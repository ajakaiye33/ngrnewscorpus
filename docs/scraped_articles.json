          "title": "2022 budget: Senate may review of $57 crude oil price benchmark",
          "text": "The Senate has said the $57 crude oil price benchmark it adopted for the 2022 national budget is still subject to a review before the eventual passage of the Appropriation Bill which the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), is expected to submit to the National Assembly before the end of the month.\n\nThe current price of the commodity is about $77 per barrel in the international market.\n\nThe red chamber had on Wednesday retained the oil benchmark proposed by Buhari in the 2022-2024 Medium Term Expenditure and Fiscal Strategy Paper.\n\nInvestigation by our correspondent during the week had revealed that the joint panels, in their report, increased the $57 benchmark proposed by Buhari to $60.\n\nIt was learnt that the joint panels, which included Committees on Finance; National Planning; Foreign and Local Debts; Banking, Insurance and Other Financial Institutions; Petroleum Resources (Upstream); Downstream Petroleum Sector and Gas, in the report, listed details of critical areas that the additional $3 increment would be used to address.\n\nThe decision of the joint panel was, however, overruled by the leadership of the red chamber, which insisted that the $57 proposed by the President must be retained.\n\nBut in an interview with our correspondent, the chairman of the joint committee, Senator Solomon Adeola, said the decision to retain the oil benchmark was arrived at after considering the volatile nature of the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe, however, said the $57 oil benchmark could still be reviewed before the fiscal document would be eventually passed if there was further improvement in the global price of the commodity.\n\nHe noted that the Senate was aware of the concerns of Nigerians over the need to stop the differential from going into the Excess Crude Account.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are being careful because of the volatility of this particular industry. The President has just assented to the Petroleum Industry Bill.\n\n\u201cThere was a careful analysis of all the items of what the executive arm of government submitted to us.\n\n\u201cThe Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries has a production quota. At the moment, Nigeria has the capacity to produce more than the quota given to the country. So, what do we do?\n\n\u201cWe cannot go contrary to the oil quota which the OPEC gave us.\n\n\u201cAs we proceed during the budget consideration and we see any improvement, there might be need to review the benchmark.\n\n\u201cWe need so much money to drive the economy and Nigerians have expressed the need to allow enough money to flow into the budget as against the Excess Crude Account.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Buhari decries illicit arms trade, solicits debt cancellation for Nigeria, others at UN",
          "text": "The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), on Friday at the ongoing 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, the United States of America, called for a regulation of arms and light weapons trade in the interest of human rights.\n\nAddressing the gathering of world leaders, the Nigerian President expressed deep concerns at the devastating effects of small arms and weapons, calling for accountability in the conventional arms trade.\n\nThe Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, revealed this in a statement titled, \u2018At UNGA, President Buhari raises the alarm on the erosion of democracy in West Africa, urges world leaders to reject unconstitutional takeovers.\u2019\n\nThe statement quoted Buhari as saying, \u201cNigeria remains deeply concerned over the illicit trade, transfer, and circulation of small arms and light weapons. Their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world are having devastating humanitarian and socio-economic consequences, especially on the continent of Africa.\n\n\u201cIt is on this note that my delegation calls for the worldwide application of the Arms Trade Treaty to codify accountability in the conventional arms trade, which is critical to the security of nations. This is in recognition of the need for a broad-based global partnership in the ongoing battle against trans-border crimes, including terrorism and piracy.\u201d\n\nBuhari also frowned on the recent trend of the unconstitutional takeover of power on the African continent, saying such actions must not be tolerated by the international community.\n\nHe warned that the democratic gains of the past decades in West Africa \u2018\u2018are now being eroded\u2019\u2019 due to these negative trends.\n\nHe affirmed Nigeria\u2019s support to efforts by ECOWAS, AU and the UN to address this growing challenge, saying, \u2018\u2018As leaders of our individual member-states, we need to adhere to the constitutional provisions of our countries, particularly on term limits. This is one area that generates crisis and political tension in our sub-region.\n\n\u201cIn this connection, my delegation underscores the importance of promoting peaceful, unfettered, and inclusive participation of states in global actions towards conflict prevention.\n\n\u2018\u2018This will facilitate the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian President also called for fair and equitable international trade system, which he said was more important to African countries than foreign aid.\n\nBuhari called for reforms that would engender recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, build resilience against future shocks and pursue transformative development strategies that could deliver the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nHe said, \u2018\u2018Nigeria reaffirms that international trade is an engine for development and sustained economic growth, as well as the global eradication of poverty.\n\n\u2018\u2018My delegation would like to reaffirm the critical role that a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system can play in stimulating economic growth and development.\n\n\u2018\u2018Fair and equitable trade would eventually eliminate the need for aid. My country and indeed all African countries do not intend to stay indefinitely looking for aid. All we need is a fair and equitable system of international trade.\u201d\n\nHowever, he called for outright debt cancellation for countries facing the most severe challenges in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBuhari said, \u2018\u2018Developing countries have been faced with unsustainable debt burdens even before the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of a new wave of deepening debt, where vital public financial resources are allocated to external debt servicing and repayments at the expense of domestic health and financing for critical developmental needs.\n\n\u2018\u2018I must commend the current initiatives by the international financial institutions and the G20 aimed at significantly mitigating the economic situation of the indebted countries and urge for more efforts in this regard.\n\n\u2018\u2018Therefore, there is an urgent need to consider expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to include all Developing, Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States facing fiscal and liquidity challenges.\n\n\u2018\u2018In addition, a review of the eligibility criteria for debt suspension, including outright cancellation, is needed for countries facing the most severe challenges.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President also advocated the equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, outlining steps Nigeria had taken to achieve \u2018\u2018moderate success\u2019\u2019 in containing the virus and halt its deadly onslaught in the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigeria remains grateful for the assistance received from our partners and friends all over the world. Vaccination is the key to our safe emergence from the pandemic.\n\n\u2018\u2018We fully support the COVAX initiative from which we have benefitted. We also thank the United States of America, Turkey, India, China, the European Union, and others for the vaccines provided.\n\nRead Also COVID-19: Buhari seeks debt cancellation for Africa\n\n\u2018\u2018Despite the acknowledgement, however, I would like to reiterate my call for a fairer and more equitable distribution of vaccines to all countries so that, together, we can fight and contain the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the fight against terrorism, the President told the UN General Assembly that \u2018\u2018As a result of the renewed vigour of Nigeria\u2019s military, many terrorist fighters are voluntarily surrendering to our security forces.\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigeria will continue to work closely with UN counter-terrorism bodies and entities to bring this scourge to an end,\u2019\u2019 he said, adding that the country would spare no effort in addressing the challenges of terrorism posed by the activities of Boko Haram in North-East Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, as well as banditry in the North-West and North-Central Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe also renewed the call for the reforms of the UN Security Council, stressing that those intergovernmental negotiations on the issue were taking too long.\n\n\u2018\u2018No reform of the United Nations system is more urgent than that of the Security Council. Stakeholders around the world are asking how such power could be concentrated, with scant representation.\n\n\u2018\u2018The intergovernmental negotiations have taken too long, some 15 years.\n\n\u2018\u2018We must avoid going in circles. Consensus has been achieved in some of the elements of this reform, especially that of the representation of Africa based on the Elzuwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is unreasonable to expect unanimity in this matter. The issue, indeed, is about justice, not unanimity. Without justice, the legitimacy even efficacy of our organisation is called to question.\n\n\u2018\u2018We can and must make substantial, irreversible progress on Security Council reform in the current session,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President also encouraged Israel and Palestine to re-engage in dialogue based on relevant UN resolutions and Initiatives.\n\n\u2018\u2018The two-state solution has the support of the international community and is widely acknowledged as the path to lasting peace,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBuhari concluded his address praising the outgoing German Chancellor, Angela Merkel.\n\nHe also pledged Nigeria\u2019s unalloyed support for multilateralism and faith in the UN as the pre-eminent body for solving current and emerging global challenges.\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigeria re-affirms its faith in the United Nations and is further resolved to continue to work with all member-states for peace and security, development and the protection of human rights.\n\n\u2018\u2018In this regard, let me close my statement by paying special tribute to a great and humane internationalist, and an exemplary practitioner of multilateral cooperation. I am speaking of Chancellor Angela Merkel of the Federal Republic of Germany. As she exits the stage, we wish her well,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nUse leadership position to stabilise W\u2019Africa, Guterres to Buhari\n\nMeanwhile, the Secretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, has urged Buhari to continue to use his leadership roles in Africa for the stabilisation of the West African sub-region.\n\nAdesina\u2019s statement quoted Guterres as saying this in a meeting on the sidelines of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nThe UN Scribe observed that Africa, especially West Africa, was generally seen as an ocean of stability and good governance, but was deeply concerned at recent reversal of fortunes in democratic rule in some parts of the West African sub-region with coups overturning elected institutions.\n\nHe, therefore, urged Buhari to continue to show leadership as he looked up to Nigeria to help stabilise the sub-region in terms of democracy and good governance.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\n\u2026Swears in new President General, Akwa Ibom State Traditional Rulers Council, ors\n\nAkwa Ibom State Governor, Mr Udom Emmanuel on Thursday commissioned four interconnected roads of 3.4Km, in Shelter Afrique, one Akwa Ibom\u2019s high profile estate as part of activities to mark the State\u2019s 34th anniversary.\n\nThe roads include General Koko Essien Avenue, Barr. Enoidem Avenue, David Lawrence Crescent, and Nicholas Ekarika Avenue, bringing the total number of internal roads constructed by Governor Udom Emmanuel led administration in the estate to sixteen.\n\nPerforming the inauguration, the Governor said the projects symbolized a signature of his administration\u2019s infrastructure drive in the estate, as done across the state.\n\nEarlier in an interview on Arise TV, the governor maintained that Akwa Ibom State at 34 has become a model of development for the nation, thanking God for taking the state so far and paid tributes to founding fathers and past leaders who have piloted the affairs of the state from inception and handing over diligently like a successful relay race. He also expressed appreciation to the people of the state for their patriotism and love for the state and their support of successive administrations over the 34year period.\n\nHe solicited more support from the people and prayed for continued advancement in the state.\n\nSimilarly, the thirty-two years-long agony of people traversing Akwa Ibom and Abia states was put to rest as the Governor also inaugurated the 45 Metre span twin bridge at Nto Edino, Obot Akara and the second phase of the 6.41Km Nto Edino-Ekewre-Azu road linking the two states.\n\nSpeaking while performing the inaugurations at the Nto Edino twin bridge, Governor Emmanuel said the projects were a thank you gift to the people of Obot Akara, meant to bring development and succour to the people of the area, maintaining that Akwa Ibom State remains a strong pillar in Nigeria\u2019s development.\n\nHear him, \u201cI\u2019ve heard the stories of the number of accidents, deaths and issues on this road. Today we\u2019ve brought succur, we\u2019ve brought development to this part of Nigeria. I\u2019m also here to tell the women, youths, elders, stakeholders, thank you for your support. I may not be able to go house by house to thank the people of Obot Akara, but if I do good roads, good projects, bring investors, your votes would have actually spoken much better than what I would have done for people individually\u201d.\n\nHe said such was the essence of voting a responsible government into power. He explained that the second phase of the road and the bridge was a reinforcement of the initial work scope, to take care of severe erosion protection, seasonal swamp area reclamation and replacement of collapsed bridges.\n\nIn his words, \u201cWhen we commissioned the first phase of this road leading to the junction in Abia state, about 8 to 10 kilometres from Agbo Hill, we promised that for those bridges that were giving issues we were going to do a twin bridge that can carry heavy traffic and any dead weight, because I noticed the traffic was going to be much, so we needed to come back for reinforcement. If you check the strength of the road and the bridge, you\u2019ll understand what I mean\u201d.\n\nThe Governor also swore into office the President General, Akwa Ibom State Traditional Rulers Council, His Eminence Ntenyin (Dr.) Solomon Etuk (JP) and Paramount Rulers Elect of Urue offong/Oruko and Ikono Local Government Areas.",

          "text": "Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi.\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Mr Chibuike Amaechi, has said that the maritime sector was being opened up for great investment opportunities given the ongoing removal of wrecks.\n\nAmaechi made this known on Friday, in Lagos, at the official launch of the removal of wrecks along the Badagry creek from Tincan Island to Navy Town, Lagos.\n\nHe also commended Dr Bashir Jamoh, the Director General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), for the initiative.\n\nREAD ALSO:NIMASA boss says Nigeria loses $25.5bn annually to illegal maritime activities\n\nHe said that the creative venture of clearing our waters of wrecks and derelicts, apart from guaranteeing better safety of navigation, opened up the prospects of many new investments in the maritime industry.\n\nAmaechi said the exercise would tremendously enhance the Federal Government\u2019s economic diversification drive and enhance Nigeria\u2019s standing in the global maritime community.\n\nThe Minister, who stressed the autonomous status of each of the agencies under the Federal Ministry of Transportation, added that all the heads of the agencies were appointed on the basis of their competence and expertise.\n\nAmaechi said he would always support imaginative ideas from the Chief Executives of the agencies, adding that it was the NIMASA DG\u2019s idea that wrecks should be removed from our waters.\n\nEarlier, Jamoh said the successful removal of the wrecks and derelicts would restore confidence in Nigerian waters, as well as eliminate obstacles to smooth, safe, and profitable navigation.\n\nJamoh commended the Minister for pushing the wreck removal idea through the Federal Executive Council.\n\nHe also cited the launch of the wreck removal exercise as another milestone in the incremental achievement of the Triple S strategy of the current Management of NIMASA, anchored on Maritime Safety, Maritime Security, and Shipping Development.\n\nHe said: \u201cThese wrecks inhibit the operation of shipping companies, which constantly strive to increase efficiency in order to remain in business.\n\n\u201cAs a result, most of the shipping companies usually avoid operating or investing in areas where navigational hazards are identified due to high insurance premium charges.\u201d\n\nJamoh said that the cost of shipping would drop for the benefit of mariners and other stakeholders in the maritime industry with the elimination or reduction of the costs associated with insurance, survey and charting of wrecks.\n\nHe said that other benefits to be derived, upon completion of the exercise, would extend to other areas of maritime core functions such as search and rescue services, Cabotage monitoring, as well as prevention and mitigation of marine pollution.\n\nThe NIMASA chief executive noted that the administration was responsible for ensuring safety and security at sea and regulating the maritime industry, in line with international laws and conventions, principally, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and the Convention of the International Maritime Organisation.\n\n\u201cIn line with this mandate and in recognition of the importance of safety of navigation in maritime administration, the agency has established the need for the removal of critical wrecks along the Badagry creek,\u201d he said.\n\nJamoh had disclosed at a Ministerial retreat organised by the Federal Ministry of Transportation in August that arrangements had been concluded for the recycling of wrecks and derelicts recovered during the wreck removal exercise.\n\nHe said this would be done in partnership with the Bayelsa Government and the Nigerian Railway Corporation which already has a foundry in Lagos for wrecks recycling.\n\nAccording to him, the ultimate aim of the exercise was to create wealth from waste, while providing jobs for Nigerians.\n\nAlso, Mr Nasir Raji, Managing Director, Ragi Industries Ltd., said that his organisation was ready to be part of the steel business that would be sourced from the wrecks worth more than N30billion.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to buy the wreck, recycle them and push back internally in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, the Acting Managing Director of Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Mohammed Bello-Koko, noted that the presence of the wrecks had been an impediment to operations.\n\nAccording to him, a legal framework will be instituted to ensure its total eradication.\n\nHe said that the exercise offered an opportunity for a value chain for employment when all the abandoned vessels were confiscated and removed from the waterways.\n\nDignitaries in attendance included the

          "text": "\n\n\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Mr Chibuike Amaechi, has said that the maritime sector was being opened up for great investment opportunities given the ongoing removal of wrecks.\n\nAmaechi made this known on Friday, in Lagos, at the official launch of the removal of wrecks along the Badagry creek from Tincan Island to Navy Town, Lagos.\n\nHe also commended Dr Bashir Jamoh, the Director General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), for the initiative.\n\nHe said that the creative venture of clearing our waters of wrecks and derelicts, apart from guaranteeing better safety of navigation, opened up the prospects of many new investments in the maritime industry.\n\nAmaechi said the exercise would tremendously enhance the Federal Government\u2019s economic diversification drive and enhance Nigeria\u2019s standing in the global maritime community.\n\nThe Minister, who stressed the autonomous status of each of the agencies under the Federal Ministry of Transportation, added that all the heads of the agencies were appointed on the basis of their competence and expertise.\n\nAmaechi said he would always support imaginative ideas from the Chief Executives of the agencies, adding that it was the NIMASA DG\u2019s idea that wrecks should be removed from our waters.\n\nEarlier, Jamoh said the successful removal of the wrecks and derelicts would restore confidence in Nigerian waters, as well as eliminate obstacles to smooth, safe, and profitable navigation.\n\nJamoh commended the Minister for pushing the wreck removal idea through the Federal Executive Council.\n\nHe also cited the launch of the wreck removal exercise as another milestone in the incremental achievement of the Triple S strategy of the current Management of NIMASA, anchored on Maritime Safety, Maritime Security, and Shipping Development.\n\nHe said: \u201cThese wrecks inhibit the operation of shipping companies, which constantly strive to increase efficiency in order to remain in business.\n\n\u201cAs a result, most of the shipping companies usually avoid operating or investing in areas where navigational hazards are identified due to high insurance premium charges.\u201d\n\nJamoh said that the cost of shipping would drop for the benefit of mariners and other stakeholders in the maritime industry with the elimination or reduction of the costs associated with insurance, survey and charting of wrecks.\n\nHe said that other benefits to be derived, upon completion of the exercise, would extend to other areas of maritime core functions such as search and rescue services, Cabotage monitoring, as well as prevention and mitigation of marine pollution.\n\nThe NIMASA chief executive noted that the administration was responsible for ensuring safety and security at sea and regulating the maritime industry, in line with international laws and conventions, principally, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and the Convention of the International Maritime Organisation.\n\n\u201cIn line with this mandate and in recognition of the importance of safety of navigation in maritime administration, the agency has established the need for the removal of critical wrecks along the Badagry creek,\u201d he said.\n\nJamoh had disclosed at a Ministerial retreat organised by the Federal Ministry of Transportation in August that arrangements had been concluded for the recycling of wrecks and derelicts recovered during the wreck removal exercise.\n\nHe said this would be done in partnership with the Bayelsa Government and the Nigerian Railway Corporation which already has a foundry in Lagos for wrecks recycling.\n\nAccording to him, the ultimate aim of the exercise was to create wealth from waste, while providing jobs for Nigerians.\n\nAlso, Mr Nasir Raji, Managing Director, Ragi Industries Ltd., said that his organisation was ready to be part of the steel business that would be sourced from the wrecks worth more than N30billion.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to buy the wreck, recycle them and push back internally in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, the Acting Managing Director of Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Mohammed Bello-Koko, noted that the presence of the wrecks had been an impediment to operations.\n\nAccording to him, a legal framework will be instituted to ensure its total eradication.\n\nHe said that the exercise offered an opportunity for a value chain for employment when all the abandoned vessels were confiscated and removed from the waterways.\n\nDignitaries in attendance included the President, Ship Owners Association of Nigeria, Dr MkGeorge Onyung, Executive Director, Finance and Administration, NIMASA, Mr Chudi Offodile and the Executive Director, Operations, Mr Shehu Ahmed.\n\nThe Executive Director, Maritime Labour and Cabotage Services, Mr Victor Ochei was also in attendance.",

We write on her instruction. The above subject refers, Sir.\n\n\u201cWe commend Your Excellency for swiftly acceding to the demands of millions of youths to set up the ENDSARS Panel.

So, it is common sense that the recommendations of a public hearing should be made public. There is no alternative to that. That\u2019s just the normal thing. Even in Lagos, the recommendations were made public, we knew who was getting what. Personally, I represented about four petitioners at the panel. As I speak with you, none of them knows their fate, despite the fact that the panel concluded several months ago.\n\n\u201cSince it was a public hearing, recommendations should be made public.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, New York\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has told world leaders at the 76th Session of the high-level General Debate of the UN General Assembly at the UN headquarters in New York on Friday, to set term limits especially for African leaders.\n\nHis call came after the continent has experienced three successful coups (two in Mali and one recently in Guinea), and one unsuccessful coup attempt in Niger, as well as an arbitrary military transfer of power in Chad following the assassination of its president.\n\nPresident Buhari stressed that the recent trend of unconstitutional takeover of power on the continent must not be tolerated by the international community.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe must deal not only with the symptoms of conflict but also the immediate causes that fuel conflicts in the first place.\n\n\u201cThese include poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities.\n\n\u201cThere are no easy solutions to these conditions. They require long-term investments and more effective international cooperation.\n\n\u201cIn this connection, my delegation underscores the importance of promoting peaceful, unfettered, and inclusive participation of states in global actions towards conflict prevention.\n\n\u201cThis will facilitate the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063.\n\n\u201cIn West Africa especially, our democratic gains of the past decades are now being eroded. The recent trend of unconstitutional takeover of power, sometimes in reaction to unilateral changes of constitutions by some leaders, must not be tolerated by the international community.\n\n\u201cNigeria fully supports the efforts by ECOWAS to address this growing challenge and appreciates the support of both the African Union and the United Nations.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, I would like to reiterate that as leaders of our individual member-states we need to adhere to the constitutional provisions of our countries, particularly on term limits. This is one area that generates crisis and political tension in our sub-region.\u201d\n\nAs regards COVID-19 vaccine, the Nigerian President said this year\u2019s theme of \u201cBuilding resilience through hope \u2013 to recover from COVID-19, rebuild sustainably, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of the people, and revitalise the United Nations, sums up our common desire to rescue our planet, recover our economies, and restore hope to all the peoples of the world.\u201d\n\nWhile thanking the international communities for the assistance received from partners and friends all over the world, said: \u201cVaccination is the key to our safe emergence from the pandemic. We fully support the COVAX initiative from which we have benefitted. We also thank the United States of America, Turkey, India, China, European Union, and others for the vaccines provided.\n\n\u201cDespite the acknowledgement however, I would like to reiterate my call for a fairer and more equitable distribution of vaccines to all countries so that, together, we can fight and contain the pandemic.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

First, it was Obasanjo from the South; then to Yar\u2019Adua, from the North; to Jonathan from the South and now Buhari, from the North. So, morally, anybody serious with One Nigeria, united Nigeria, should not be suggesting that power remains in the North. It was credited to Hakeem, I hope he is not stating the opinion of Northern Elders Forum because that will be vey confrontational and will not be good for our polity. Power should rotate.\n\nEven your party, PDP that has rotation principle, its body language suggests that the party may zone the presidency to the North. What is your view on this?\n\nI don\u2019t know where you got the body language thing. I haven\u2019t seen the body language. What PDP has done so far is to set up zoning committee, which has representatives from all the zones in the country. This committee has just started working. So, I don\u2019t know where you got the body language, maybe from what people are saying. Everybody has his opinion and his wishes. Not even opinion, some people may wish it remains in the North and some people will wish it comes down to the South. So, you hear all sorts of thing. Until that committee finishes its work, considers all the variables and comes out with a zoning formulae, and tells the party what they recommended. It is left for the National Executive Committee of the party to accept or reject their recommendations. What the NEC finally approves is what we consider as the opinion of PDP, not anybody\u2019s personal opinion. Let us not speculate until we have finally heard from the committee and NEC of the party.\n\nHowever, if they decide that it goes to the North, what will be your position?\n\nThey will give enough reasons to justify that, and we will also look at the reasons. The recommendation of the zoning committee is not final; it is still subject to the NEC approval. We will look at whatever reasons they would give and see how tenable such reasons are. I cannot begin to preempt what will happen or what will not happen. Until we go through the entire processes, we are still at the preliminary, which is for the committee to meet and consider everything. They will go deep before they come out with recommendation, then the NEC will look at it and debate it. NEC is not a one-man body; it is made up of eminent members of the party \u2013 governors, NASS members, National Working Committee members, Board of Trustee members. By the time these people sit to consider the report of the zoning committee, they will come out with a position which will be the stand of the party. Today, PDP hasn\u2019t taken any stand.\n\nIn the event that PDP NEC takes a stand and zones it to the North, saying the party is interested in winning the election and the ruling APC does the same, what position should the South that has insisted on power rotation take?\n\nIt is too early for me to say what the South will do because NEC has not taken that decision. For NEC to take that decision there must be some fundamental issues involved. It is too early for me to speculate what the South will do. You know NEC is made up of both North and South; it is not made up of only Northerners or Southerners. So, Southerners will be part of the NEC that will take this final decision. If NEC takes that final decision, it means there was a very genuine reason for that.\n\nThe South-East is asphyxiating following the sit-at \u2013home by IPOB that is affecting the economic activities of the region. How can peace be brought back to that zone?\n\nIPOB has come out to say that there should be no more sit-at-home. The problem you have when you have this type of situation is that while IPOB may be saying one thing, their operatives in the locality are doing another. We must come to a point where sanity will prevail and there will be an understanding by all parties involved because we may not be able to survive having this sit-at-home indefinitely all the time. It is positive that IPOB has come out to officially say, no more sit-at-home. We take it that as its official position. It is left for them to pass it down to their own local level so that we don\u2019t have ugly incidents of people acting on IPOB\u2019s statement and getting into trouble with its local operatives. People are beginning to see that the economy of the South-East is suffering.\n\nIs it not failure of leadership in Igbo land, where IPOB is dictating what happens in the region? One would have expected that the elders should shout at the young ones to stop what they were doing and they would obey?\n\nI don\u2019t think you are right when you say nobody has come out to tell them to stop what they are doing. A lot of people have come out in the social media to tell them the implications of the sit-at-home; its negative impacts on our economy, the society. It is not right to say nobody has come out to say anything. On the other hand, you should know that IPOB is not a body that is constituted by law. It is part of the failure of not just the leadership but of the society. It is easy to start up a mob action, but difficult to control. That is why you must be very careful before you start any mob action. Once a mob action has taken off, it is difficult to arrest; it is not a question of failure of leadership. Which leadership are we talking about? The state governors in the South-East cannot order IPOB to stop. It is not failure of leadership. People keep on pointing out the implications of what is happening and appealing to IPOB.\n\nIt is out of the appeal by the leadership; their calls and the analysis of what is happening that IPOB has come out to say there is no more sit-at-home every Monday.\n\nHow do we tackle this Nnamdi Kanu phenomenon because it is what gave birth to this sit-at-home and other things happening in the South-East. What should the Igbo leadership do?\n\nJust as people have already suggested, a political solution has to be found. If we continue following a legal process to it, it will have no end because the mere fact that you jail Nnamdi Kanu, or even kill him, thinking that the problem is over, another Nnamdi Kanu would come up. There has to be a political solution; there has to be a dialogue. The government of the day has to dialogue not just with the leadership of the Southeast, but in such a dialogue, the youths should also be involved because there are the main people who carry out the action, not the elders. But the leadership can ensure that there is a dialogue. In that dialogue, the issue will be tabled and every side presents its own position. But if it is resolved on the conference table, it is better than a legal solution that will not end it because Nnamdi Kanu is not alone; he has a lot of followers, he has a lot of deputies. If you imprison him today, someone else jumps up.\n\nA dialogue is important. Even though I was not there when President Buhari visited Imo State, he had discussions with South-East leaders. I don\u2019t know what they discussed, but there is no discussion the president or anybody will have with South-East leaders that won\u2019t include the present impasse. Let\u2019s hope that they mentioned it and try to find a way out. I\u2019m sure that would have happen.\n\nSouthern Governors Forum has been meeting and they have come up with resolutions that would reposition the region, the issue of anti open grazing, presidency from the South in 2023, fiscal federalism, VAT collection, etc. Curiously, South-East governors are behind, while South-West and South-South are the ones driving it. What does this portend and what would you have done if it were during your time?\n\nI\u2019m very much surprised that some of our governors are not attending at all; some are sending their deputies, while one sent the Secretary to the State Government. It doesn\u2019t show seriousness on our path. I don\u2019t believe the coincidence of fixing such a meeting was such that no South-East governor was chanced, except the host, Governor Ugwuanyi of Enugu State; the other ones didn\u2019t have chance at all. It shows our governors are not taking this issue seriously, or they are not representing our interests.\n\nIn our time, I was one of those who started the meeting; I hosted it, Rivers State hosted it, Lagos State hosted it first. Enugu also hosted it. We went to many states. It was such a forum where we talked of things, irrespective of your political leaning. We talked of the things concerning our region, not whether you were PDP, AD or ANPP. By then, PDP was in government, but all the other parties attended, and nobody absented. I don\u2019t now know why our governors are not forthcoming. These are things that are fundamental to our own existence, to the survival of this country. The issues involved \u2013 security, open grazing, fiscal federalism. These are basic issues, so why our governors don\u2019t want to get involved is what I cannot say. I\u2019m surprised, I\u2019m shocked because it is a forum where you go, even if you don\u2019t agree, you say it there. The highest thing is that you would refuse to sign the communiqu\u00e9, but you have aired your views. But in a situation where you boycotted the meeting is what I don\u2019t understand. By the time you start sending your deputy, it means you are not serious. It is only when you are unavoidably absent that your deputy can represent you. We even have cases of one or two of the governors who have not even attended it for the first time. They have held three meetings and we have South-East governors who have not attended any. I don\u2019t understand this; it never happened at our time that a state in the South boycotted meetings. Maybe, one was outside the country and his deputy represented them, but in a situation where it has been held three times and you have not attended, it is a serious issue. It shows that some people don\u2019t appreciate what we are going through right now in the country. It is very serious issue, I cannot offer any apologies, and I don\u2019t know what is behind it.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu, Chukwudi Nweje, Lagos, Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan, and Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri\n\nA number of socio-cultural groups and organisations in the Southern part of Nigeria as well as the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) yesterday launched scathing attacks on Kaduna State governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai over his comments that the anti-open grazing law passed by the Southern states was not implementable.\n\nEl Rufai had said at the National Secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in Abuja, on Tuesday, that the southern states of Nigeria were politicising the issue of anti open grazing.\n\nHe also said the Northern States Governors Forum had already taken a position that open grazing is not a sustainable way of livestock production, but that ranching could not be done overnight, even as the law passed by the respective state assembly was not implementable.\n\nOhanaeze Ndigbo, Afenifere, Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) and other groups descended of Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir el-Rufai on what they termed his \u201cunguarded statement.\u201d\n\nThe groups said the governor by his statement merely displayed the supremacist arrogance that the Fulani were noted for.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Chief Alex Ogbonnia said El Rufai\u2019s statement is a manifestation of his arrogance and attempt to intimidate the south.\n\nHe said: \u201cGov El Rufai is trying to show arrogance in the sense that 17 southern governors met and took a position on anti-open grazing and he, one governor, cannot even respect the position of 17 of his colleagues. Secondly, he is contradicting himself. Gov El Rufai talked about open grazing no longer being sustainable and said he is constructing ranches and at the same time he is saying that the anti-open grazing law signed by his southern counterparts is not implementable. Thirdly and most importantly, he is telling us that control of the security infrastructure of the country lies somewhere else and that we don\u2019t have the security apparatus to enforce the anti-open grazing law. That is why we must insist on restructuring of Nigeria so that regional security outfits like Ebubeagu and Amotekun will be fully empowered to implement the law.\u201d\n\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), in a statement by its spokesperson, Emma Powerful affirmed that the bill has come to stay just as it vowed to implement it if the southern governors fail to do so.\n\nPowerful who also maintained that the Kaduna governor\u2019s utterance has exposed his ignorance about the bill, assured that he can never intimidate the south into backing out of their agreement.\n\n\u201cIPOB and Biafra in general can\u2019t afford to allow El-Rufai divide us. The Southern governors have come together against him and his co-traitors in the country and that is what matters. They have bitten more than they can chew.\n\n\u201cAnti-Grazing bill in the South has come to stay and there is nothing anybody can do to change our resolve towards this law against anti- grazing in our territory. El Rufai\u2019s utterances show he\u2019s ignorant.\n\n\u201cIf the Southern governors fail to implement the bill, IPOB will implement it and we would stand shoulder to shoulder with them.\u201d\n\nADF spokesman, Abia Onyike said the Kaduna governor and his gang should bury their heads in shame for destroying the country instead of infuriating already angry Nigerians.\n\nOnyike said: \u201cThat is a demonstration of el-Rufai\u2019s arrogant display of his Fulani supremacist mentality. Otherwise, who is he to dictate to Southern Nigeria? Is he not ashamed of the crisis and violence in Nigeria today, which he and his fellow travellers bequeathed to the country? He should keep quiet and bow out in shame by 2023.\u201d\n\nMASSOB leader, Uchenna Madu said the governor was hypocritical on the ban on open grazing of Fulani cattle by the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum. He said that it was unfortunate and disappointing that the wheels of disunity and disaffection among ethnic nationalities was being driven by el-Rufai, a supposed nationalist.\n\nMASSOB said the governor would not decide for the people of Southern Nigeria, pointing out that the era of divide and rule, planting of disaffections and brotherly discord by the Arewa people in the southern regions was no longer fashionable and workable.\n\nAccording to Madu, the governor can no longer withstand the future political reality that will eventually change the political narrative of the Nigerian state.\n\n\u201cMASSOB advises the governors of Southern regions and other leaders to disregard him and his parasitic teammates because of their venomous hatred against the political interest of people of the southern regions. He has insulted the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum and Christians in general.\n\n\u201cThe indigenous people\u2019s of southern Nigeria can no longer tolerate such political neglect or callous statements against the interest and justification of their interest in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEven though MASSOB struggle is for Biafra actualization and restoration, we are not against the political and social interest of the south. Every political and economic rights of the people of the southern regions must be supported and sustained,\u201d the MASSOB leader stated.\n\nPresident of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr Bitrus Pogu said the submission of Gov El Rufai on the anti-open grazing law was unfounded. He said the Nigerian government has no business taking care of the foreign Fulani, who he said constitute majority of the migratory herders in Nigeria and insisted that they be sent back to their respective countries to be catered for by their home governments.\n\nHe said: \u201cEnforcement of the anti-open grazing law is based on determination. If Gov Samuel Ortom is able to implement anti-open grazing law in Benue State, then it is implementable. The southern governors should find out how Gov Ortom was able to implement the law in his state and do the same thing. Moreover, most of the Fulani roaming the forests are not Nigerians, let every foreign Fulani go back to his home country. Every country should take care of its Fulani. The ECOWAS Protocol on Free Movement does not mean that foreign Fulani should come to Nigeria and cause trouble.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "Kumuyi: How I started Deeper Life with 15 persons in 1973",
          "text": "General Overseer of Deeper Life Bible Church, Pastor William Folorunsho Kumuyi has explained how he started the ministry in August 1973, with 15 \u201ctruth-seekers.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking at the launch of his book, he also stated why he\u2019s known as Defender of Faith. The speech is reproduced below:\n\nWhy I\u2019m called Defender of the Faith\n\nI never knew that the words The Defender of the Faith were part of my name and calling. We were in Singapore for a conference with attendees from different parts of the world, and my humble self was required to give series of messages.\n\nAfter I finished the series, one of the ministers came and asked me if I knew the meaning of my name, William. I responded that I never thought about it.\n\nActually, when I was a young Anglican and I was to be christened, my father asked me what christian name I would love to bear. I said I would love to bear the name Johnson. There was a Johnson in our community who was very vocal, fervent, bold and courageous and I had learnt to appreciate him. It was agreed that I would be Johnson. But then when we got to the Church something else happened. As the ceremony was being preformed the minister said \u201cThis boy shall be called William\u201d. I wondered why I had to bear that name.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t many years later after I got converted on April 5 1964 and I became a preacher, travelling teacher and evangelist that we got to this meeting in Singapore. I met this minister who had studied the meanings of names. For one reason or the other he had checked the root and etymology of my name, William.\n\nHe told me: \u201cYour name, William, means THE DEFENDER OF THE FAITH\u201d. He added that what I\u2019d done there in Singapore was prophetic, a reflection of the mission and vision of man elected to fight for the faith. Whereupon he prayed along with me. Since that time I\u2019ve been more conscious of the fact that God called me.\n\nI emphasize \u201ccalled me\u201d because I had the knowledge and understanding of who God is from 1952. Then aged 11, I put God to a test. I wanted a problem resolved. So I proceeded by telling God: \u201cIf it is going to be this way, let this happen, and if it is going to be that way, let that happen.\u201d What I told the Lord happened, and since then in 1952, I\u2019ve been very conscious of God being my Guide.\n\nThen in 1964, I heard the gospel in a very simple way that God loves humanity, and everyone regardless of their status, background and religion because the scripture says unequivocally that God loves the world, and gave man His only begotten Son, and that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. Before that time, all I was doing was trying to live a good and righteous life, an upright life above board and reproach. Suddenly it dawned on me that day that I could not save myself, I could not pull up myself by the bootstraps.\n\nSo on that day, the 5th of April, 1964, I said \u201cLord, You have sent our Lord Jesus Christ not only to save humanity but to save me. So I gave my life over to the Lord Jesus. I had a real transformation and it was clear to everyone who knew me in my alma mater, Mayflower School under Tai Solarin at that time, that a change really came, and the school knew about it.\n\nEventually, I moved forward, reading books. Later, Reverend Mellor of the Methodist Church handed over to me the writings of John Wesley, the illustrious English preacher. I began to read the works and found myself consecrated to the Lord. This was because I saw how John Wesley went all over England and Europe, defending the faith, even though I didn\u2019t know the meaning of my name William then.\n\nFinally, I told God, \u201cIf you could use a man this way at that time, then You can use me. I came across just one sentence that turned everything around.\n\nJohn Wesley said:\n\n\u201cGive me a hundred men that fear nothing but sin and love none but God, and we will turn the world upside down\u201d.\n\nI plunged into deep thought about that. Could I be like John Wesley? After that inner search, I came across Charles G. Finney\u2019s books, and I was asked if I could be like him? I answered the call because I knew that it was of God. So, I took up the challenge and we started the ministry in 1973 August 3rd, with only 15 truth seekers. From there we moved on to what we have now.\n\nAs I began to see that we can be transformed and be what God wants us to be, He gave us the Lord Jesus, not only to be Saviour but as a pattern and example for us to follow. I used to say I wanted to be like John Wesley. But later, I have since sought to be like Jesus Who is Master, Saviour, Preacher, Teacher, Evangelist, and everything. By the grace of God, I moved from being a teacher to an evangelist, to being a pastor and a little bit of the life of an apostle and miracles began to take place: eyes being opened and the lame rising up and walking. And on a few occasions we saw the dead being brought back to life.\n\nAnd now with the media that came in, we found that Jesus Christ said anyone who believes in Him will do the works He did, and greater works than that because He goes to the Father. A centurion came to Jesus to ask for healing for his servant who was sick of the palsy, and he told Jesus not to come to his house but to speak the word only and his servant would be healed. We know that healing can come through various ways: by laying on of hands, by anointing with oil, by two of us agreeing together. There is also the ministry of \u201cspeaking the word only, and my servant shall be healed.\u201d By the Mercy of the Lord, Heaven is doing this in my ministry now. We are having what we call the Global Crusade through which we connect to people from all over the world and cancer and other diseases have been healed, just by praying from here in Nigeria.\n\nWe also saw the case of an entire family that was infected with covid 19 pandemic and by praying for them online and the following day when they went to the hospital the tests were negative: they were totally cured.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen HIV Aids, cancer, and lots of sicknesses healed.\n\nBut let me reveal something.\n\nI have had experiences in teaching in the secular world complex Mathematics variables. there are many of my students who have gone beyond me. Sometimes I meet past students who are now professors, engineers, doctors who know what I don\u2019t know.\n\nI want to do this in Christianity to raise people who will go beyond me. We can even start now as you read this. You can say, \u201cLord, whatever you have done by, through and with this man, William the defender, do it through me.\u201d\n\nThen we can go beyond John Wesley and say, \u201cGive me a thousand people, a million people that love God with all their hearts and souls and we can turn the world upside down.\u201d We can do it! We will start from our city, our nation, our continent Africa and who knows, we can change the world by His Grace, love, in His mercy, with our commitment and consecration and by surrendering everything we have to Him, we can change the world.\n\nSomeone was interviewing me three weeks ago from London because he wanted to take part in our crusade. He said, \u201cYou are now 80, what do you still have that you have not done?\u201d\n\nI told him 80 is just a number. Tossing that aside, you are as young as your dedication, vision and love for God. If you can dedicate your life to God and say you want to make an impact and touch lives before you leave the world, the Lord will answer your prayers.\n\nMoses started at 80 and I\u2019m just starting at 80 and who knows how far we can still go? You and I teaming together, knowing full well that the world needs us, our people and this generation need us, we can, if we count on God.\n\n\u2022Kumuyi, General Superintendent of Deeper Christian Life Ministry, spoke at the public presentation of his biography, Kumuyi:Defender of the Faith, in Lagos last week.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "title": "For the Record: Buhari\u2019s Address at UN General Assembly (Full Text)",
          "text": "By Muhammadu Buhari\n\nMr. President,\n\nLet me, on behalf of the government and people of Nigeria, congratulate you on your well-deserved election as President of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. I would like to assure you of the full support and cooperation of the Nigerian delegation throughout your tenure.\n\n2. I would like to commend your predecessor, His Excellency, Mr. Volkan Boskir, for the many remarkable achievements recorded during his tenure, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n3. Permit me to congratulate the Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, on his re-election and commend his strong commitment to making the UN more alive to its responsibilities.\n\n4. I also want to express my gratitude to him for re-appointing Ms. Amina Mohammed, as the Deputy Secretary General to assist him in discharging his heavy responsibilities.\n\nMr. President,\n\n5. The theme of this year\u2019s General Assembly \u2013 \u201cBuilding resilience through hope \u2013 to recover from COVID-19, rebuild sustainably, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of the people, and revitalise the United Nations, sums up our common desire to rescue our planet, recover our economies, and restore hope to all the peoples of the world.\n\n6. In this regard, my delegation will continue to support the United Nations, as the indispensable forum for international cooperation and the cornerstone of the multilateral system, rooted in respect for international law, including international human rights law and predicated on a rules-based order.\n\nMr. President,\n\n7. I want to thank the international community for the concerted response to COVID-19. The solidarity and drive to contain the first truly global health emergency of our time is a pointer to the many things we can achieve if we work together.\n\n8. On our part, Nigeria has made strenuous efforts to contain the virus and halt its deadly onslaught on our people. Our efforts have been rewarded with moderate success.\n\n9. At the outset, we recognised detection and contact tracing to be important tools in combating the virus. In this connection, from a mere four laboratories with testing and detection capacities, we ramped up the facilities to over 140 centres today.\n\n10. Similarly, we built isolation centres and emergency hospitals wards in record time all over the country. We carry out genomic sequencing in designated laboratories across the country with a view to detecting variants in circulation.\n\n11. In addition, over 40,000 health care workers have recently been trained on Infection, Prevention and Control measures with the support of various partners. Through the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control, we have established 16 infectious disease treatment centres located within our Teaching Hospitals and Federal Medical Centres.\n\n12. Nigeria remains grateful for the assistance received from our partners and friends all over the world. Vaccination is the key to our safe emergence from the pandemic. We fully support the COVAX initiative from which we have benefitted. We also thank the United States of America, Turkey, India, China, European Union, and others for the vaccines provided.\n\n13. Despite the acknowledgement however, I would like to reiterate my call for a fairer and more equitable distribution of vaccines to all countries so that, together, we can fight and contain the pandemic. The rising wave of newer and more contagious strains, makes this even more urgent. No country can afford the socio-economic implications of prolonged shutdown. It is imperative to underscore that no one is safe until everyone is safe.\n\nMr President,\n\n14. Nigeria remains deeply concerned over the illicit trade, transfer, and circulation of small arms and light weapons. Their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world are having devastating humanitarian and socio-economic consequences, especially on the continent of Africa.\n\n15. It is on this note that my delegation calls for the world wide application of the Arms Trade Treaty to codify accountability in conventional arms trade, which is critical to the security of nations. This is in recognition of the need for a broad-based global partnership in the on-going battle against trans-border crimes, including terrorism and piracy.\n\nMr. President,\n\n16. We must deal not only with the symptoms of conflict but also the immediate causes that fuel conflicts in the first place. These include poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities.\n\n17. There are no easy solutions to these conditions. They require long term investments and more effective international cooperation. In this connection, my delegation underscores the importance of promoting peaceful, unfettered, and inclusive participation of states in global actions towards conflict prevention. This will facilitate the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063.\n\n18 In West Africa especially, our democratic gains of the past decades are now being eroded. The recent trend of unconstitutional takeover of power, sometimes in reaction to unilateral changes of constitutions by some leaders, must not be tolerated by the international community. Nigeria fully supports the efforts by ECOWAS to address this growing challenge and appreciates the support of both the African Union and the United Nations. In this regard, I would like to reiterate that as leaders of our individual Member-States we need to adhere to the constitutional provisions of our countries, particularly on term limits. This is one area that generates crisis and political tension in our sub-region.\n\nMr President,\n\n19. Nigeria is fully committed to nuclear non-proliferation and has always supported the view that it should involve all States.\n\n20. Disarmament Conventions deserve the support of all states, small, large, nuclear or non-nuclear. Nuclear weapons remain the ultimate agents of mass destruction, and their total elimination should be the final objective of all disarmament processes within the broad spectrum of goals being pursued by the United Nations.\n\n21. In this regard, Nigeria would participate actively in the forthcoming Review Conference of the Nuclear Prohibition Treaty and also the First Meeting of States Parties to the landmark Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, scheduled to take place within the first quarter of 2022.\n\n22. Nigeria regards these upcoming events as important steps towards the realisation of a world free of nuclear weapons. We are, therefore, supportive of any diplomatic efforts in this direction. We hope that the upcoming NPT review conference would lead to a successful outcome that would facilitate the denuclearisation of the world. We would do our part to ensure such an outcome.\n\nMr. President,\n\n23. Terrorism continues to dominate security discourse worldwide. In Nigeria, Boko Haram terrorists group, though fragmented by internal strife and weakened by our defence forces, is still active and preying on soft targets. Nigeria will continue to work closely with UN Counter-Terrorism bodies and entities with a view to bringing this scourge to an end.\n\n24. Nigeria has spared no effort in addressing the challenges of terrorism posed by the activities of Boko Haram in North-East Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, as well as banditry in the North-West and North-Central Nigeria. The Nigerian Security Forces have recorded considerable success in the fight against terrorism. As a result of the renewed vigour of our military, many terrorist fighters are voluntarily surrendering to our security forces.\n\n25. I and three other Nigerian Heads of State served actively as peace keepers and Nigeria continues to support peacekeeping efforts. We know the sacrifice involved, we also know how important peace keeping is for those in vulnerable situations. Nigeria will continue to play its part fully in supporting United Nations peacekeeping operations within Africa and beyond.\n\nMr. President,\n\n26. The impact of climate change is already with us in Nigeria, manifesting in various ways: conflicts trigger; food insecurity, drying up of lakes; loss of livelihood, and youth migration, among others. The trend is the same in many other countries that are threatened by forest fires, rising sea levels, drought and desertification.\n\n27. In the circumstances, we intend to build a climate-resilient economy that effectively aligns with the SDGs and that has great potentials to unlocking the full opportunities in different sectors of the economy, while protecting the resources for present and future generations. I know, in several ways, this is also a familiar story in many countries.\n\n28. As leaders, we must create inclusive and gender-sensitive policies that address all issues connected to climate action, from mitigation to resilience.\n\n29. Nigeria believes that protecting our planet and its biodiversity and climate are important to our collective survival. That is why, we are working on a transition to low carbon economy, consistent with achieving the Paris Climate Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nMr. President,\n\n30. Combating illicit financial flows and ensuring the recovery and return of illicitly acquired assets have the potential to provide resources in the immediate term for financing development in this era of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.\n\n31. Similarly, corruption across national borders has huge negative impact on the stability, peace, and economic prospects of millions, particularly in developing countries.\n\n32. It deprives national Governments of resources needed to provide adequate and meaningful sources of livelihood for their citizens. The latter gives rise to more irregular migration patterns, with unwholesome consequences for inter-state and human relations.\n\n33. I, therefore, call on all leaders to demonstrate the much-needed political will by supporting the recommendations for systemic reforms made by the FACTI Panel.\n\n34. We support establishing modalities for a global coordination mechanism at the United Nations Economic and Social Council to systematically monitor illicit financial flows and strengthen financial integrity for sustainable development, with the participation of all relevant stakeholders.\n\nMr. President,\n\n35. On the issue of debt, we have seen that developing countries have been faced with unsustainable debt burdens even before the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of new wave of deepening debt, where vital public financial resources are allocated to external debt servicing and repayments at the expense of domestic health and financing for critical developmental needs.\n\n36. I must commend the current initiatives by the international financial institutions and the G20 aimed at significantly mitigating the economic situation of the indebted countries and urge for more efforts in this regard.\n\n37. Therefore, there is an urgent need to consider expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to include all Developing, Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States facing fiscal and liquidity challenges. In addition, a review of the eligibility criteria for debt suspension, including outright cancellation, is needed for countries facing the most severe challenges.\n\nMr. President,\n\n38. Nigeria reaffirms that international trade is an engine for development and sustained economic growth, as well as the global eradication of poverty.\n\n39. My delegation would like to reaffirm the critical role that a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system can play in stimulating economic growth and development.\n\n40. Fair and equitable trade would eventually eliminate the need for aid. My country and indeed all African countries do not intend to stay indefinitely looking for aid. All we need is a fair and equitable system of international trade.\n\n41. We, therefore, call for a reform agenda that will engender better recovery from this crisis, build resilience to future shocks and pursue transformative development strategies that can deliver the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nMr. President,\n\n42. The global food system has, in recent times, been impacted by several factors such as population growth, availability and accessibility of arable land and water resources, climate change, and loss of biodiversity.\n\n43. Increased competition for resources such as land, water, and energy, has affected food access and supply, particularly in developing countries. Climate change and unpredictable shocks, such as the current global pandemic, further exacerbate vulnerabilities in the global food system, requiring the UN\u2019s urgent attention.\n\n44. The Government of Nigeria remains determined to improve the productivity and incomes of small-scale farmers by promoting equal access to land, technology and markets, sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices.\n\n45. At the heart of Nigeria\u2019s post-COVID-19 response is the Economic Sustainability Plan, which has a major component, called the Agriculture for Food and Jobs Programme where we seek to leverage suitable technologies to build a resilient food system for the country.\n\n46. An integral part of our food systems\u2019 transformation strategy is to create an enabling and supportive environment to implement these policies in a participatory manner.\n\n47. Global efforts to mitigate and sustain food systems must involve key stakeholders, including Governments, farmers, investors, multilateral organizations, regional bodies, international financial institutions, private partners and civil society organizations.\n\nMr. President,\n\n48. Nigeria has been steadfast in safeguarding human rights, including the advancement of women, the protection of children, the protection of the rights of people living with disabilities, the treatment of migrants, refugees, returnees and displaced persons as well as, the promotion of fundamental freedoms through all legitimate means. In this regard, my delegation commends the positive example of leaders like Prime Minister Jacinda Arden of New Zealand.\n\n49. In this context Nigeria calls for collective global action through a Treaty to end all forms of violence against women and girls of all ages.\n\n50. Nigeria remains unwavering in its commitment to ensuring the advancement of human rights within its shores and beyond. This is so even in the context of a vicious decade-long onslaught by terrorists against Nigerians, quite contrary to unwholesome reports by some who hardly verify what they state against us.\n\n51. The recent rise in hate related crimes globally underscores the urgent need to continue our engagement about racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other related intolerance. It is sad to note that the issue of racism remains alive globally.\n\n52. We are beginning to forget our affirmation of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of every individual as enshrined in the UN Charter. No society can claim to be free or just if it deprives anyone of these rights.\n\n53. Nigeria has long been a principled fighter against racism and all forms of discrimination inspired by its African experience. In the past, racism oiled the machine of slavery and colonialism. Today, racism drives hate crimes and institutional discrimination. In all this, Africans and people of African descent are among the major victims.\n\n54. Cognizant of these, I commend Member States for adopting by consensus the resolution on the Establishment of the Permanent Forum of People of African Descent on 2nd August 2021. I am confident that this forum will make significant impact in the quest to end race-related vices and injustices.\n\nMr. President,\n\n55. No reform of the United Nations system is more urgent than that of the Security Council. Stakeholders around the world are asking how such power could be concentrated, with scant representation. The intergovernmental negotiations have taken too long, some 15 years. We must avoid going in cycles. Consensus has been achieved in some of the elements of this reform, especially that of the representation of Africa on the basis of the Elzuwini consensus and the Sirte Declaration. It is unreasonable to expect unanimity in this matter. The issue, indeed, is about justice, not unanimity. Without justice, the legitimacy (even efficacy) of our Organization is called to question. We can and must make substantial, irreversible progress on Security Council reform in the current session.\n\nMr. President,\n\n56. Connected to this, is the question of justice, fairness, and equity in respect of the Palestinian people. The situation in the Middle East is long-standing and gives cause for concern. Nigeria encourages Israel and Palestine to re-engage in dialogue based on relevant UN resolutions and Initiatives. The two-state solution has the support of the international community and is widely acknowledged as the path to lasting peace.\n\nMr President,\n\n57. Our organization is at the peak of the multilateral system. It is also the pre-eminent body for solving our current and emerging challenges, and for developing norms that are protective of us all. We need to re-commit to it, rejuvenate it to better serve us. Nigeria re-affirms its faith in the United Nations and is further resolved to continue to work with all Member-States for peace and security, development and the protection of human rights. In the current moment, hope for these, is dependent on how we assist each other to get COVID-19 out of all countries, regardless of their classification. We can and must do so.\n\n58. In this regard, let me close my statement by paying special tribute to a great and humane internationalist, and an exemplary practitioner of multilateral cooperation. I am speaking of Chancellor Angela Merkel of the Federal Republic of Germany. As she exits the stage, we wish her well.\n\nI thank you.\n\nADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY, MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA AT THE GENERAL DEBATE OF THE 76TH SESSION OF UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY Friday, 24TH SEPTEMBER, 2021 NEW YORK, USA\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXPOSED: How Nigerian Government Gave Indicted Cocaine Trafficker Multi-million Dollar Contract To Supply Passports To Citizens",
          "text": "This report exposes the rot, racketeering, ethnic nepotism, complete failure of due diligence, and how an indicted cocaine trafficker has come to control the supply of passports to Nigerian citizens.\n\nThe investigation, which was done by Nigerian journalist, David Hundeyin and reported by West Africa Weekly, delves into how the rot in the system led to an embarrassing scarcity of passports for Nigerians at home and abroad.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge and apologise for the challenges faced in the past few weeks regarding passport booklets availability. I am glad to inform you that booklets are now available and are being distributed to all our passport issuing centres.\u201d\n\nWith these words on March 31, former Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) Babandede verbally signed a cheque that the NIS would subsequently fail to cash. Through the course of his tenure as CG, Nigerians had become used to chronic passport booklet shortage and the associated black market arbitrage, but the shortage had become acute by 2021. He needed to make a statement to reaffirm his competence.\n\nSpeaking at the commissioning of the Maitama Passport Express Centre - itself a master class in formalised black market arbitrage - Babandede made that statement, and then some. A special team would be dispatched to \u201cfacilitate enrollment and production\u201d of passports across Nigeria and its foreign missions. New passport offices to service air passengers would be sited at the airports in Lagos, Kano and Abuja. The new \u201cpremium passport processing centre\u201d in Abuja would cut the length of passport issuance and renewal from several weeks to just 72 hours.\n\nUltimately, Babandede\u2019s statement turned out to be just that - a statement.\n\nFrom when he made these pronouncements until his retirement earlier this month, passport booklets continued to be a scarce and expensive commodity in Nigeria. Several factors were blamed for the baffling inability of Africa\u2019s most populous country to provide passports for its citizens. Chronic corruption at the NIS; disputes between the NIS and a private contractor responsible for printing booklets; scarcity of forex to pay for security printing materials; even an alleged unofficial government policy to stem brain drain by making passports hard to access - all these have variously been blamed for this state of affairs.\n\nAs is so often the case in Nigeria, no theory or explanation should be dismissed out of hand, which is why when I set out to find out what is really behind the perennial shortage of these little green booklets, I was prepared for anything. Or at least I thought I was. What would emerge as I sank my teeth into this however, was not a story about supply chain disruptions or government inefficiencies. It was nothing like I had ever seen before, which is saying something.\n\nThink Transformers meets Black Mirror meets Karishika, with protagonists who are part Elon Musk, part Lawrence Anini and part Bakin Zuwo. There is a murder in New York; a million dollar cocaine deal in Bogot\u00e1. Court cases in New Jersey; a legitimate high tech manufacturing operation in Kuala Lumpur; art exhibitions in Lagos; high society marriages; prominent placement in lifestyle and celebrity magazines, and the most comically brazen lawbreaking hidden in plain sight. If this story were a movie, it would be the conceptual offspring of Michael Bay and Ugezu J. Ugezu, which is to say, low on plot and purpose, but high on sheer crash-bang value.\n\nThere are 3 main characters in this story. Their existence and relevance was determined after speaking to 5 different sources within the NIS ecosystem. These 3, more than any other people, have had the most influence on passport issuance and the wider state of the Immigration Service. Unsurprisingly, the first name on the list is immediate past CG Muhammad Babandede.\n\nNone of my sources have any especially nice words to say about him, but neither do they have any bitter personal complaints either. The impression that comes through about Babandede is that of a fundamentally limited man who is neither virtuous nor especially malevolent. As one of the sources puts it frankly:\n\n\u201cHe tried to make some moves such as the passport express centres, but it didn\u2019t work out because he was just there to make money before he retired. He didn\u2019t really care about fixing any systemic issues like staff motivation or the ISTL contract. All that one was not his business.\u201d\n\nThe sources inform me that under Babandede\u2019s tenure, complete opacity was institutionalised, with Immigration officers now not even knowing how much to expect on their payslip at the end of the month. Apparently during his tenure, NIS staff were migrated to the Integrated Payroll and Personnel information system (IPPIS), and with that went any sort of transparency regarding staff pay scales, deductions and entitlements. As a source colourfully puts it during one of our long conversations:\n\n\u201cIt has now got to the point that you don\u2019t know what will come in at the end of the month, and whatever it is that comes in - you just have to take it like that. The deductions vary every month so we don\u2019t know how much we will take home. So tell me as a man with people depending on you, how else will you survive if not through \u2018egunje\u2019 (bribes)?\u201d\n\nWhile the sources mention different things that Babandede could have done to protect NIS staff welfare and morale, they all have one consistent criticism of him - his alleged ethnocentric posting policy. During his tenure they say, desirable NIS postings such as NIS offices in Lagos, were given exclusively to northerners, while the southerners working there were all posted out. The Ikoyi immigration office I am told, is now staffed almost exclusively by northerners - a state of affairs that would be impossible if the roles were reversed.\n\nUnder Babandede and even in these early days of his successor Idris Jere, the sources say, many northerners in the NIS, encouraged by the prebendalist disposition of their superiors, are keen to let everyone know that it is \u201ctheir turn\u201d and they are in power. Following Idris Jere\u2019s appointment a source claims, the next most senior Deputy Comptroller - a southerner from Lagos - who might have been next in line to succeed Jere, was promptly transferred to Sokoto. At press time, I have been unable to independently verify this.\n\nThe other name that every source mentions is a certain \u201cLiman\u201d at the Ikoyi Passport Office. None of the sources bothers to hide how they feel about this fellow. This man and his extreme racketeering they say, is one of the major reasons behind Nigeria\u2019s passport shortage. A bit of research brings up his name as Abdullahi I. Liman, a Deputy Comptroller in charge of the Ikoyi Passport Command of the NIS.\n\nEvery single source has a terrible story to tell about Abdullahi Liman. Liman they say, is responsible for the northernisation of the Ikoyi Passport Command. Even worse one source tells me, under Liman\u2019s tenure, the atmosphere at the Command has taken on explicitly polarised ethnic and religious overtones. Take this anecdote from one of the sources for example:\n\n\u201cYou can imagine that you are in the middle of doing a capture, then all of a sudden your colleague who is also capturing will just stand up and leave his station with a crowd of people there - because he says he is going to pray. You now end up doing his work for him, can you imagine that? This did not happen before Liman came in.\u201d\n\nLiman they say, is in the habit of pointedly using Hausa to converse with his subordinates at work, which automatically puts every southerner working under his command at a real career disadvantage. Speaking English - or in fact any other language but Hausa - at work is now a career demerit at the Ikoyi Passport Command under Liman\u2019s watch.\n\nA few days after I speak to this source, this story by the Foundation for Investigative Journalism was published, detailing persecution of a southern NIS officer at the Ikoyi Command in the exact ways described by my sources. Notice the reporter\u2019s description of his interaction with Liman.\n\nUp to this point, I have relied on testimony from sources I consider trustworthy, but even their knowledge of affairs at the NIS has its limits. While people like Abdullahi Liman are running rackets within the NIS to restrict access to passport booklets in large population centres like Lagos so as to create a lucrative black market, the sources are also clear that they believe that the NIS simply does not have enough passport booklets. To truly understand why the NIS appears to have not just a distribution problem, but also a supply problem with passport booklets, I had to figure out whose interests were served by the status quo.\n\nFirst, a brief primer on how Nigeria\u2019s passport system works.\n\nStarting in 2003, Nigeria adopted the e-passport standard to defeat counterfeiting, resulting in a contract awarded to IRIS Smart Technologies Limited (ISTL) which commenced in 2007. The scope of the contract was to implement the Nigeria Harmonised ECOWAS Electronic (SMART) Passport Autogate Systems as well as to supply e-passport booklets, wafers, laminates and maintenance services from 2006 and 2015. ISTL is affiliated with Malaysia\u2019s Iris Corp, which carries out the actual security printing services including supply of e-passport booklets.\n\nThe services that ISTL renders to the NIS include creating and maintaining the electronic database containing the passport details of Nigerian citizens, as well as maintaining the communication infrastructure that keeps a constant uplink between passport registration offices and the ISTL data centre. In case the reader has not seen the problem with this, allow me to spell it out clearly:\n\nA private company working for a profit incentive has full and unrestricted access to the sensitive data of all Nigerian passport holders, but more importantly, it alone has access to this data. In other words, ISTL has more access to passport holders\u2019 data than the NIS itself. ISTL does not actually produce passport booklets, but sub-contracts production to the Malaysian firm Iris Corp. Essentially, this company that most people have never heard of, controls a valuable sovereign database exclusively, and all it has to do is maintain a few dozen closed VSAT links from passport registration centres. Essentially, tech support.\n\nThis in fact caused a row between the NIS and the company in 2017 when the 10-year contract came up for renewal. Speaking to Daily Trust in 2017, some NIS insiders claimed the following: That the initial contract was a threat to national security because it vests control of the Country Signing Certification Authority (CSCA) - an official government seal - in ISTL, instead of the Nigerian government, which on paper is a risk factor for fraud;\n\nThat its implementation did not follow due process;\n\nThat the database and other infrastructure was paid for by the Nigerian government, but ISTL holds on to government property and uses tactics such as refusing to train NIS officers in the management of the system as a way to strong-arm the government into renewing its contract;\n\nThat NIS officers cannot conduct basic maintenance and repairs on the ISTL systems, meaning that the Nigerian government cannot withdraw from the ISTL contract without incurring catastrophic costs, which violates public procurement regulations;\n\nThat the contract had questionable exclusion clauses that gave undue advantage to ISTL at the expense of the Nigerian taxpayer.\n\nThe Malaysian company subcontracted by ISTL to print the booklets meanwhile, has found itself facing corruption probes by Malaysian authorities over its activities in other African e-passport jurisdictions such as Guinea. So putting this picture together, we have a tech support company that has somehow wrangled its way into a $138 million 10-year government contract (which was eventually renewed in 2019). Its main activity is maintaining equipment and an electronic database, and it sub-contracts passport booklet printing to a company halfway around the world whose executives have been arrested on corruption charges.\n\nFor the purpose of balance, it must be pointed out that the $138 million figure is not paid by the government, but rather comes from the company\u2019s revenue generation activities within the scope of the e-passport project. It is also important to point out that the criticisms of the ISTL contract were possibly made in bad faith by individuals who merely wanted to replace ISTL with their own companies. Indeed, the senior NIS official quoted by the Daily Trust in 2017 remarked, \u201c[The controversy] is between contractors who want the contract. The NIS\u2019 concern is simply the supply of the booklets.\u201d\n\nIt is also important to mention that the cost of sub-contracting Iris Corp to print the booklets is paid is USD, while ISTL\u2019s revenue comes in naira, with the CBN refusing to provide forex for the company. This I am reliably informed, is the material reason behind the chronic booklet shortages since 2017 - the cost of printing passport booklets has more than doubled in dollar terms since 2015. Hence, ISTL simply cannot afford to print as many booklets as before.\n\nWith that being said, we now know that there is an incredibly lucky or powerful entity behind ISTL. Who is this person? This is where the story really takes a few turns, so hold on to your hats.\n\nHigh Society Gentleman or Ex-Cocaine Trafficker?\n\nOn its website, ISTL describes itself as a \u201cmajor subsidiary of the flagship company, Image Technologies Limited (Imagetech).\u201d A quick CAC database check on Imagetech brings up the elusive character behind the curtain.\n\nFor a Lagos socialite, Olayinka Fisher is a man who somehow keeps a decidedly low profile. For one thing, while researching this story, establishing what exactly his name is turns out to be quite the task. In some places, he is \u201cYinka Fisher.\u201d In some other places, he is \u201cOlayinka Fisher.\u201d In still other places, he is \u201cOlayinka Fischer\u201d or \u201cSonayon Fisher.\u201d Only in a few places that he would rather the world did not know about, does his full and correctly spelled government name appear: \u201cOlayinka Sonayon Fisher.\u201d So who is this guy and what is there to him?\n\nQuite a bit, as it turns out.\n\nThe story starts in Mr. Fisher\u2019s previous iteration as a high flying Nigerian diplomat in in mid-to-late 1970s. At the time, when he was still known to the world as Olayinka Sonayon Fisher, he was the Second Secretary of the Nigerian Mission to the United Nations.\n\nResearching the many variants of his name online, references to his diplomatic career can be seen right up until about 1980 when he seems to vanish off the face of the historical earth. In 1989, he resurfaces on CAC documents in Nigeria as the majority shareholder in a new company called Imagetech. Presumably at this point, the high-achieving diplomat has decided to pivot into a career in tech entrepreneurship. Nigeria being what it is, nobody ever really bothers to ask why, and by 2003 he is signing the contract above for ISTL under President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nThe good times are rolling. Following the end of his marriage to River State scion Doris Amachree, he weds Dr. Pius Okigbo\u2019s daughter Anne. He becomes an avid art collector and patron of the arts. He hosts art exhibitions with the Spanish Embassy in Lagos, which are co-curated by both of his sons who share his love of the visual arts. To all intents and purposes, he is the SI unit of the classy and respectable old money Lagosian. There\u2019s just one problem:\n\nAccording to U.S. court records, Mr. Fisher allegedly used to be part of an intercontinental cocaine smuggling ring.\n\nI obtain the following documents from the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. They detail court proceedings from a 1983 case involving a violent drug dealer wanted for a murder in the Bronx, New York, a successful American businessman who dabbled into the illegal drug business with him, and a Nigerian diplomat who used his diplomatic immunity to traffic shipments of cocaine into the U.S. on their behalf.\n\nThe diplomat\u2019s name? A certain Olayinka Sonayon Fisher.\n\nAccording to Tracy Wong, the indicted American businessman, he paid Fisher the sum of $50,000 for a single shipment. The indictment further states that this arrangement lasted for at least 2 years with multiple Cocaine trafficking trips made worth several million dollars. Exactly how much Fisher made from this arrangement in total is a question only he can answer, but it certainly raises a few interesting questions.\n\nPerhaps the most telling part of this story is that following the release of this NYT article and his subsequent exit from the diplomatic corps, Fisher appears to have intentionally dropped all mention of \u201cSonayon\u201d from his name. In fact, it took the extraordinary step of making a few calls to my hometown Badagry, where the name \u201cSonayon\u201d also originates from, to confirm his identity. The fact that this has somehow slipped under the radar for decades despite his custody of one of the most sensitive databases in Nigeria is a sign of a catastrophic failure of state intelligence and due diligence.\n\nMaking this point further, I speak to a lawyer, Solomon Igberaese to give his professional opinion of this issue. He points out that according to the Public Procurement Act 2007, someone with Fisher\u2019s background should have been disqualified from the public procurement process. In his words:\n\n\u201cFalsification of fact can be interpreted to also include drug trafficking. Carrying out drug trafficking under any other guise will constitute falsification of fact. That he concealed packages inside diplomatic pouches certainly qualifies as falsification of fact. Again the section said falsification of facts relating to any matter.\u201d\n\nSo there we have it - possibly the most mind-bending story in Nigeria\u2019s rich history of dodgy public procurement and contracting. For added measure, the third person in the drug ring, a career drug dealer called Joseph Anthony Margarite was also wanted in connection with a murder at the time of his involvement with Wong and Fisher.\n\nThe full and unredacted set of court records relating to this case is available here.\n\nIf you enjoyed this story and you want to see more in-depth investigative work like this, kindly support independent journalism by purchasing a subscription using the button below.",

So tell me as a man with people depending on you, how else will you survive if not through \u2018egunje\u2019 (bribes)?\u201d\n\nWhile the sources mention different things that Babandede could have done to protect NIS staff welfare and morale, they all have one consistent criticism of him - his alleged ethnocentric posting policy. During his tenure they say, desirable NIS postings such as NIS offices in Lagos, were given exclusively to northerners, while the southerners working there were all posted out. The Ikoyi immigration office I am told, is now staffed almost exclusively by northerners - a state of affairs that would be impossible if the roles were reversed.\n\nUnder Babandede and even in these early days of his successor Idris Jere, the sources say, many northerners in the NIS, encouraged by the prebendalist disposition of their superiors, are keen to let everyone know that it is \u201ctheir turn\u201d and they are in power. Following Idris Jere\u2019s appointment a source claims, the next most senior Deputy Comptroller - a southerner from Lagos - who might have been next in line to succeed Jere, was promptly transferred to Sokoto. At press time, I have been unable to independently verify this.\n\nThe other name that every source mentions is a certain \u201cLiman\u201d at the Ikoyi Passport Office. None of the sources bothers to hide how they feel about this fellow. This man and his extreme racketeering they say, is one of the major reasons behind Nigeria\u2019s passport shortage. A bit of research brings up his name as Abdullahi I. Liman, a Deputy Comptroller in charge of the Ikoyi Passport Command of the NIS.\n\nEvery single source has a terrible story to tell about Abdullahi Liman. Liman they say, is responsible for the northernisation of the Ikoyi Passport Command. Even worse one source tells me, under Liman\u2019s tenure, the atmosphere at the Command has taken on explicitly polarised ethnic and religious overtones. Take this anecdote from one of the sources for example:\n\n\u201cYou can imagine that you are in the middle of doing a capture, then all of a sudden your colleague who is also capturing will just stand up and leave his station with a crowd of people there - because he says he is going to pray. You now end up doing his work for him, can you imagine that? This did not happen before Liman came in.\u201d\n\nLiman they say, is in the habit of pointedly using Hausa to converse with his subordinates at work, which automatically puts every southerner working under his command at a real career disadvantage. Speaking English - or in fact any other language but Hausa - at work is now a career demerit at the Ikoyi Passport Command under Liman\u2019s watch.\n\nA few days after I speak to this source, this story by the Foundation for Investigative Journalism was published, detailing persecution of a southern NIS officer at the Ikoyi Command in the exact ways described by my sources. Notice the reporter\u2019s description of his interaction with Liman.\n\nUp to this point, I have relied on testimony from sources I consider trustworthy, but even their knowledge of affairs at the NIS has its limits. While people like Abdullahi Liman are running rackets within the NIS to restrict access to passport booklets in large population centres like Lagos so as to create a lucrative black market, the sources are also clear that they believe that the NIS simply does not have enough passport booklets. To truly understand why the NIS appears to have not just a distribution problem, but also a supply problem with passport booklets, I had to figure out whose interests were served by the status quo.\n\nFirst, a brief primer on how Nigeria\u2019s passport system works.\n\nStarting in 2003, Nigeria adopted the e-passport standard to defeat counterfeiting, resulting in a contract awarded to IRIS Smart Technologies Limited (ISTL) which commenced in 2007. The scope of the contract was to implement the Nigeria Harmonised ECOWAS Electronic (SMART) Passport Autogate Systems as well as to supply e-passport booklets, wafers, laminates and maintenance services from 2006 and 2015. ISTL is affiliated with Malaysia\u2019s Iris Corp, which carries out the actual security printing services including supply of e-passport booklets.\n\nThe services that ISTL renders to the NIS include creating and maintaining the electronic database containing the passport details of Nigerian citizens, as well as maintaining the communication infrastructure that keeps a constant uplink between passport registration offices and the ISTL data centre. In case the reader has not seen the problem with this, allow me to spell it out clearly:\n\nA private company working for a profit incentive has full and unrestricted access to the sensitive data of all Nigerian passport holders, but more importantly, it alone has access to this data. In other words, ISTL has more access to passport holders\u2019 data than the NIS itself. ISTL does not actually produce passport booklets, but sub-contracts production to the Malaysian firm Iris Corp. Essentially, this company that most people have never heard of, controls a valuable sovereign database exclusively, and all it has to do is maintain a few dozen closed VSAT links from passport registration centres. Essentially, tech support.\n\nThis in fact caused a row between the NIS and the company in 2017 when the 10-year contract came up for renewal. Speaking to Daily Trust in 2017, some NIS insiders claimed the following: That the initial contract was a threat to national security because it vests control of the Country Signing Certification Authority (CSCA) - an official government seal - in ISTL, instead of the Nigerian government, which on paper is a risk factor for fraud;\n\nThat its implementation did not follow due process;\n\nThat the database and other infrastructure was paid for by the Nigerian government, but ISTL holds on to government property and uses tactics such as refusing to train NIS officers in the management of the system as a way to strong-arm the government into renewing its contract;\n\nThat NIS officers cannot conduct basic maintenance and repairs on the ISTL systems, meaning that the Nigerian government cannot withdraw from the ISTL contract without incurring catastrophic costs, which violates public procurement regulations;\n\nThat the contract had questionable exclusion clauses that gave undue advantage to ISTL at the expense of the Nigerian taxpayer.\n\nThe Malaysian company subcontracted by ISTL to print the booklets meanwhile, has found itself facing corruption probes by Malaysian authorities over its activities in other African e-passport jurisdictions such as Guinea. So putting this picture together, we have a tech support company that has somehow wrangled its way into a $138 million 10-year government contract (which was eventually renewed in 2019). Its main activity is maintaining equipment and an electronic database, and it sub-contracts passport booklet printing to a company halfway around the world whose executives have been arrested on corruption charges.\n\nFor the purpose of balance, it must be pointed out that the $138 million figure is not paid by the government, but rather comes from the company\u2019s revenue generation activities within the scope of the e-passport project. It is also important to point out that the criticisms of the ISTL contract were possibly made in bad faith by individuals who merely wanted to replace ISTL with their own companies. Indeed, the senior NIS official quoted by the Daily Trust in 2017 remarked, \u201c[The controversy] is between contractors who want the contract. The NIS\u2019 concern is simply the supply of the booklets.\u201d\n\nIt is also important to mention that the cost of sub-contracting Iris Corp to print the booklets is paid is USD, while ISTL\u2019s revenue comes in naira, with the CBN refusing to provide forex for the company. This I am reliably informed, is the material reason behind the chronic booklet shortages since 2017 - the cost of printing passport booklets has more than doubled in dollar terms since 2015. Hence, ISTL simply cannot afford to print as many booklets as before.\n\nWith that being said, we now know that there is an incredibly lucky or powerful entity behind ISTL. Who is this person? This is where the story really takes a few turns, so hold on to your hats.\n\nHigh Society Gentleman or Ex-Cocaine Trafficker?\n\nOn its website, ISTL describes itself as a \u201cmajor subsidiary of the flagship company, Image Technologies Limited (Imagetech).\u201d A quick CAC database check on Imagetech brings up the elusive character behind the curtain.\n\nFor a Lagos socialite, Olayinka Fisher is a man who somehow keeps a decidedly low profile. For one thing, while researching this story, establishing what exactly his name is turns out to be quite the task. In some places, he is \u201cYinka Fisher.\u201d In some other places, he is \u201cOlayinka Fisher.\u201d In still other places, he is \u201cOlayinka Fischer\u201d or \u201cSonayon Fisher.\u201d Only in a few places that he would rather the world did not know about, does his full and correctly spelled government name appear: \u201cOlayinka Sonayon Fisher.\u201d So who is this guy and what is there to him?\n\nQuite a bit, as it turns out.\n\nThe story starts in Mr. Fisher\u2019s previous iteration as a high flying Nigerian diplomat in in mid-to-late 1970s. At the time, when he was still known to the world as Olayinka Sonayon Fisher, he was the Second Secretary of the Nigerian Mission to the United Nations.\n\nResearching the many variants of his name online, references to his diplomatic career can be seen right up until about 1980 when he seems to vanish off the face of the historical earth. In 1989, he resurfaces on CAC documents in Nigeria as the majority shareholder in a new company called Imagetech. Presumably at this point, the high-achieving diplomat has decided to pivot into a career in tech entrepreneurship. Nigeria being what it is, nobody ever really bothers to ask why, and by 2003 he is signing the contract above for ISTL under President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nThe good times are rolling. Following the end of his marriage to River State scion Doris Amachree, he weds Dr. Pius Okigbo\u2019s daughter Anne. He becomes an avid art collector and patron of the arts. He hosts art exhibitions with the Spanish Embassy in Lagos, which are co-curated by both of his sons who share his love of the visual arts. To all intents and purposes, he is the SI unit of the classy and respectable old money Lagosian. There\u2019s just one problem:\n\nAccording to U.S. court records, Mr. Fisher allegedly used to be part of an intercontinental cocaine smuggling ring.\n\nI obtain the following documents from the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. They detail court proceedings from a 1983 case involving a violent drug dealer wanted for a murder in the Bronx, New York, a successful American businessman who dabbled into the illegal drug business with him, and a Nigerian diplomat who used his diplomatic immunity to traffic shipments of cocaine into the U.S. on their behalf.\n\nThe diplomat\u2019s name? A certain Olayinka Sonayon Fisher.\n\nAccording to Tracy Wong, the indicted American businessman, he paid Fisher the sum of $50,000 for a single shipment. The indictment further states that this arrangement lasted for at least 2 years with multiple Cocaine trafficking trips made worth several million dollars. Exactly how much Fisher made from this arrangement in total is a question only he can answer, but it certainly raises a few interesting questions.\n\nPerhaps the most telling part of this story is that following the release of this NYT article and his subsequent exit from the diplomatic corps, Fisher appears to have intentionally dropped all mention of \u201cSonayon\u201d from his name. In fact, it took the extraordinary step of making a few calls to my hometown Badagry, where the name \u201cSonayon\u201d also originates from, to confirm his identity. The fact that this has somehow slipped under the radar for decades despite his custody of one of the most sensitive databases in Nigeria is a sign of a catastrophic failure of state intelligence and due diligence.\n\nMaking this point further, I speak to a lawyer, Solomon Igberaese to give his professional opinion of this issue. He points out that according to the Public Procurement Act 2007, someone with Fisher\u2019s background should have been disqualified from the public procurement process. In his words:\n\n\u201cFalsification of fact can be interpreted to also include drug trafficking. Carrying out drug trafficking under any other guise will constitute falsification of fact. That he concealed packages inside diplomatic pouches certainly qualifies as falsification of fact. Again the section said falsification of facts relating to any matter.\u201d\n\nSo there we have it - possibly the most mind-bending story in Nigeria\u2019s rich history of dodgy public procurement and contracting. For added measure, the third person in the drug ring, a career drug dealer called Joseph Anthony Margarite was also wanted in connection with a murder at the time of his involvement with Wong and Fisher.\n\nThe full and unredacted set of court records relating to this case is available here.\n\nIf you enjoyed this story and you want to see more in-depth investigative work like this, kindly support independent journalism by purchasing a subscription using the button below.",

          "title": "BUSTED: How Nigeria\u2019s Attorney-General Malami Released Over 300 \u2018Powerful\u2019 Boko Haram Sponsors After Collecting Bribes, Left Only Foot Soldiers In Detention",
          "text": "Over 300 suspects arrested by the Nigerian government for funding Boko Haram terrorists have been released, SaharaReporters has gathered.\n\nSaharaReporters had in April reported how over 400 persons were arrested by security agencies during a nationwide crackdown on the suspected financiers of terror in Nigeria.\n\nAbubakar Malami\n\nThe operation was said to have been approved by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2020.\n\nConfirming the report a few days later, Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) had said the Nigerian government embarked on \u201ca wider and far-reaching investigation\u201d into terrorism financing after the conviction of Boko Haram financiers in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nSee Also Politics Why Buhari Government Will Not Name Sponsors Of Boko Haram Now\u2014Justice Minister, Malami\n\nBut on Wednesday, Malami, who is in the United States as part of Buhari\u2019s entourage to the United Nations General Assembly, said his office had reviewed over 1,000 case files out of which 285 had been filed before the Federal High Court.\n\nMalami was reacting to public criticism over the secrecy surrounding the identities of the alleged financiers of Boko Haram as Buhari\u2019s government has shunned all calls to name the terror sponsors.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates recently listed the names of 38 sponsors of terrorism, which include six Nigerians.\n\nHowever, sources told SaharaReporters on Thursday that while Nigerians were clamouring for the identities of the terror sponsors to be released to the public, Malami had already facilitated the release of many of them after collecting bribes from the most powerful ones among them.\n\nSaharaReporters earlier on Thursday published a list of 45 names out of the 400 suspects said to have been sponsoring terrorists.\n\nSee Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Names Of 45 Out Of 400 Suspected Boko Haram Sponsors Buhari Government Is Hiding From Nigerians\n\nBut according to a source, the 45 suspects are the \u201cinsignificant foot soldiers of terror financiers\u201d being detained by an ex parte order while others have been released.\n\nSaharaReporters exclusively obtained documents including an affidavit in support of a motion filed by the prosecution (Nigerian government) to seek the continued detention of the suspects at \u201cWu Bassey Barracks, Asokoro, Abuja for 90 days pending the conclusion of investigations by the headquarters of the Nigerian Army Intelligence Corps\u201d.\n\nThe affidavit deposed to at the Federal High Court Registry by a litigation officer in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions of the Federation says: \u201cThe suspects were arrested by troops of Operation Lafia Dole in Kaduna, Kano, Niger, Borno, Lagos and Zamfara states in relation to terrorism activities in the country.\n\n\u201cOngoing investigation revealed that the suspects have links with the Boko Haram Terrorist Group. That the investigation is advancing and suspects have access to legal practitioners of their choice. That it is in the interest of justice that the suspects be remanded pending conclusion of investigation as there are chances that the investigation will be compromised if the suspects are released on bail. That the court has the power to grant the application.\u201d\n\nThose detained as earlier exclusively published by SaharaReporters include Saidu Ahmed, Ibrahim Sani Bello, Mustapha Musa Adamu, Abubakar Sadiq Garba, Hussein Adamu, Muhammed Sani Adam, Abdulrahman Ibrahim, Ghazali Yusuf, Yusuf Ali Yusuf, Abubakar Adamu Yellow, Zahuraddeen Bashir, Haruna Garba Garo, Ibrahim Aliyu Usman, Hassan Idris, Musa Emma, Alhashim Mohammed Almashim, Baba Samaila, Bulama Tahir, Abubakar Ali, Mohammed Ambare, Danlami Hassan Nadabo, Danladi Talle Inuwa, Bashir Ali, and Mansur Muhammad Usaman.\n\nOthers are Musa Tasiu Ya\u2019u, Auwalu Ali Alhassan, Sadi Saidu Abdullahi, Suraj Adamu, Muhammed Auwalu, Ismaila Abdullaziz Mohammed, Munzali Ashiru Gambo, Yazid Muhammad Usman, Nabil Zakari, Gambo Auwalu, Muhammed Abba, Bashir Idris Shuaibu, Mohammed Yahaya, Auwalu Ibrahim, Abdullahi Umar Usman, Dahiru Umar Mohammed, Abdullahi Mohammed, Abubakar Yahaya, Hussaini Lawali Idrisu, Ladann Ibrahim, and Nurudeen Gani Aliyu.\n\nA security source told SaharaReporters on Thursday that Malami ordered the release of the \u201cbig fish\u201d or prominent and powerful ones among the 400 suspects initially arrested after collecting bribes from them.\n\nThe source added that those being detained are \u201cinsignificant foot soldiers\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe arrested about 400 of them but he collected bribes from the most powerful ones and they have since been released. Yesterday (Wednesday), he claimed there were 275 of them left, in an interview he had in New York. Most of the 275 he mentioned have also been freed.\n\n\u201cSome powerful Northern Emirs intervened on their behalf. Only an ex parte order to detain were filed against these 45 persons before Justice Anwulika Chikere of the Federal High Court, Abuja. Unfortunately, she was a vacation judge and has now travelled.\n\n\u201cShe is retiring in about three months\u2019 time. Only about 45 names were submitted to her instead of 275 the Minister claimed yesterday. These are all the strategies being used by Malami who has already left the big terror financiers off the hook.\n\n\u201cThe 45 persons are insignificant foot soldiers of terror financiers. And if you check the documents very well, most of them have already filed fundamental rights challenge against the government and are billed to be granted bail anytime soon.\n\n\u201cThat Honorable Justice Anwulika Chikere handling the case was born on 28th December 1956, so she is bound to take a bow on December 28, 2021, which is just three months from now.\u201d\n\nAnd going by documents exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters, most of the suspects currently being detained have already filed Fundamental Rights challenges and are billed to be granted bail.\n\nThough the documents also contain a list of the names of 45 suspected sponsors of terrorism, there is nothing to show that any charges have been filed against them since their arrest.\n\nConfirming that even the suspects currently being held will also regain their freedom, another source said, \u201cDon\u2019t forget that no one has been charged according to the documents; the ex parte filed contained zero evidence they carried out anything. They are billed to be granted bail.\u201d",
          "summary": "Over 300 suspects arrested by the Nigerian government for funding Boko Haram terrorists have been released, SaharaReporters has gathered.\nMalami was reacting to public criticism over the secrecy surrounding the identities of the alleged financiers of Boko Haram as Buhari\u2019s government has shunned all calls to name the terror sponsors.\n\u201cOngoing investigation revealed that the suspects have links with the Boko Haram Terrorist Group.\nThese are all the strategies being used by Malami who has already left the big terror financiers off the hook.\n\u201cThe 45 persons are insignificant foot soldiers of terror financiers.",

          "title": "What will commerce look like in Africa over the next decade?",
          "text": "With Covid-19 restrictions forcing more people to shop online, e-commerce companies and platforms on the continent have enjoyed a surge in activity. Jumia, for instance, saw a significant uptick in major indicators in the second half of last year. Also, retailers that did not previously have an online presence were compelled to do so.\n\nThe pandemic essentially propelled widespread growth in African e-commerce. However, there are questions of whether that growth can be sustained in the long run. Juliet Anammah, Group Chief Sustainability Officer and Chairperson of Jumia Nigeria thinks it can.\n\n\u201cThe boom in e-commerce is not just a function of the pandemic,\u201d she says during a panel discussion at the ongoing TechCabal Future of Commerce conference. \u201cIt\u2019s also due to the fact that there\u2019s a fundamental problem that\u2019s being solved \u2013 finding what you want, doing it much faster, getting more choices and best pricing online. If we can provide all of that, then consumers will always opt for that option.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs part of the major shifts expected in buying and selling in Africa, Anammah sees even more Africans shopping online over the next few years. This is provided e-commerce platforms continue to solve problems consumers face and offer more suites of offerings.\n\nTechnologies and innovations like Virtual Reality and interoperable payment systems are also expected to play an increased role in buying and selling, and broadly change consumer behavior and the way e-commerce is seen.\n\n\u201cStakeholders just need to keep ensuring that online platforms are solving problems. Nobody goes online just for the sake of it,\u201d Anammah says. \u201cAs long as stakeholders are building solutions that are solving fundamental problems, people will always go online.\u201d\n\nBuilding blocks for growth\n\nTo enable further growth in African commerce through digital channels, certain \u2018building blocks\u2019 must be in place. According to Nkebet Mesele, Senior Director for Solutions Management in sub-Saharan Africa at Visa, that entails making commerce in Africa \u201cmobile-led\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor commerce to grow across Africa, the building blocks that have to be in place are first, it has to be mobile-led. We need to shift commerce, banking, and the movement of money from what we know it as traditionally to building an end-to-end mobile experience for commerce to thrive,\u201d Mesele said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of SME intra-Africa money movement and trade that\u2019s happening. Hence we need to ensure cross-currency flows and commerce is happening seamlessly between a consumer in Nigeria, for example, and a merchant in Kenya.\u201d\n\nIn addition to those, SME support initiatives and adequate fraud controls also have to be in place. \u201cConsumers and the merchants have to be comfortable buying online and also have that understanding and awareness of how to be safe while shopping.\u201d\n\nKhadijah Abu, Paystack\u2019s Head of Product Expansion notes that providing access to credit for merchants and SMEs is equally important to enabling further growth, as is exposing sellers to more consumers across the country, continent, or world.\n\n\u201cIf you can only exchange goods with people standing in front of you, then the scope of your market will always be limited,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if you can stay at home and create something that someone halfway across the continent or the world is willing to pay for, then all of a sudden, you\u2019re exposed to a whole new level of growth.\u201d\n\nAbu adds that increased internet penetration and financial inclusion levels are key indicators for e-commerce as they would imply that people have money and can access sellers not just in their immediate vicinity but also across other markets or regions.\n\nMore so, efficient use of technology to automate businesses, incentives, and grants from the government or larger organisations and initiatives that include logistics and supply chain management will \u201cdefinitely help\u201d people build and produce more.\n\nWhile building, however, stakeholders have to \u201crealise that there\u2019s not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution that makes sense for the entire continent,\u201d Wiza Jalakasi, Vice President of Global Developer Relations, at Chipper Cash cautions.\n\n\u201cAfrica is fragmented from a cultural perspective and because of that, people have different ways of doing things. So whatever solutions are built have to be contextually aware of the environment and be sensitive to the needs of individuals in the specific countries.\u201d\n\nIt might be possible to aggregate some of the market systems in these countries at some point, Jalakasi says. \u201cBut it starts with building solutions for people on the ground.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nYou can follow the Future of Commerce 2021 event on YouTube.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "Phishing scams are becoming more prevalent in African countries",
          "text": "\u201cThe 12 billion dollar scam\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what the FBI nicknamed phishing in 2018; a name that reflected the estimated amount of money lost to the cyberattack globally between 2013 and 2018. In 2018 alone, about $1.2 billion was lost to phishing and in 2020, phishing scammers made over $1.8 billion\u2014 more than via any other type of cybercrime.\n\nAccording to RiskIQ, businesses across the world lose about $17,700 every minute to phishing attacks and top companies lose $25 per minute to cybercrime.\n\nPhishing, also called email-scam, is a method of trying to gather personal information by sending deceptive e-mails to target recipients. Phishing is one of the oldest internet scams, dating back to the \u201890s, and perhaps remains one of the most prevalent cybercrimes.\n\nThe goal of phishing is to fool victims into believing that the message is something they want or need. For instance, the message can be an invoice from a vendor, payment or account update request from the victim\u2019s bank; it could even be a grant/scholarship offer. But one thing phishing emails have in common with other forms of cyberattack is that every phishing email comes with a call to action that prompts recipients to download a link or file.\n\nOnce the victims supply their personal data, the attackers have unfettered access to their identity and proceed to engage in malicious activities such as making purchases with the victim\u2019s credit card or cleaning out their accounts.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nPhishing is also widespread in Africa\n\nAcross the world, Nigerians are stereotyped as the highest perpetrators of internet scams \u2014especially email scams \u2014 and series of recent events and reports somewhat justify this stereotype. But this doesn\u2019t mean Africans aren\u2019t susceptible to phishing attacks.\n\nPhishing attacks are prevalent in the continents and individuals and businesses across Africa have fallen victims to phishing scams. Cybercriminals have become even smarter with their tactics, adapting to changing economic situations and embracing more sophisticated technology to lure people into clicking on things they should not.\n\nFor instance, the COVID-19 vaccine rollout throughout Africa has given rise to ample opportunity for cybercriminals to carry out several attacks that are hidden in what, at first glance, may appear to be relevant information.\n\nScammers, posing as WHO or other trusted health organizations, now send phishing emails to unsuspecting victims to offer things like a COVID-19 kit, Coronavirus relief package which include food and cash benefits, or Medicare benefits; then ask them to verify personal information like bank details. Google also said in April 2020 that scammers are sending 18 million hoax emails about Covid-19 to its 1.5 billion Gmail users every day.\n\nAn example of COVID-19 phishing email asking for a bitcoin donation\n\nAnother example of COVID-19 phishing email sent in disguise as the UK government\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, a global cybersecurity company using its deep threat intelligence and security expertise to protect over 400 million and 250,000 corporate clients against cyberattacks, spam constituted almost 30% of email traffic in South Africa and close to 35% in Kenya in H1 2021.\n\nOver a million phishing attacks were recorded in South Africa in the first half of 2021. In Kenya, over 600,000 phishing attacks were recorded, and its around 400,000 in Nigeria. That\u2019s a combination of over two million attacks in the first half of the year from the three biggest African markets.\n\nThis shows that phishing is also a significant threat in Africa. But the company said these numbers represent a reduction from the cyberattacks that were captured within the same period in 2020. South Africa witnessed a 17% decline; Kenya saw a 48% decline, and Nigeria recorded an 18% decline from over two million cases in 2020.\n\n\u201cThis decrease is in line with global trends and supports the decline that Kaspersky research identified happening through the course of last year already. Of course, this does not mean that organisations and consumers can ignore the risk of traditional cybercrime attacks or that phishing, as well as spam, are still not of significant concern across Africa,\u201d says Bethwel Opil, Enterprise Sales Manager at Kaspersky in Africa. \u201cInstead, people need to become even more aware of cybersecurity best practices and remain vigilant to protect their personal and business systems from the risk of compromise,\u201d\n\nHow businesses and individuals can protect themselves from phishing scams\n\nWhile there\u2019s no way to stop scammers from sending phishing emails, there are certain ways to prepare and make sure individuals and businesses stop falling victims.\n\nOnce the characteristics of dubious emails have been understood and there\u2019s a consistent effort in looking out for them before taking any action, there\u2019s a high chance of beating phishing activities.\n\nIndividuals and businesses are advised to install relevant cybersecurity solutions on their devices, and in addition to that, they should consider the following tips:\n\nReview the email address of senders and look out for impersonations of trusted brands or people.\n\nAlways inspect URLs in emails for legitimacy by hovering over them before clicking\n\nBeware of URL that redirects and pay attention to subtle differences in website content: make sure the URL starts with https:// and not http://.\n\nGenuine brands and professionals generally won\u2019t ask recipients to divulge sensitive personal information. If an email prompts for such, the next thing to do is to investigate and contact the brand or person directly, rather than hitting reply.\n\nUse multiple email addresses, one for personal use and another for online shopping or social media.\n\nDo not rush or panic-react, scammers use such tactics to pressure their victims into clicking links or opening attachments.\n\nEnsure browsers and operating system software are up to date with the latest patches.\n\nUse anti-spam filters in addition to antivirus and Internet security solutions.\n\nShare this article\n\nDamilare Dosunmu | Author @tarykuh",

We do not want any unnecessary provocation from our neighbours.\n\n\u201cWe wish to request that our neighbouring communities, who we have tried to live in peace with for decades, respect our boundaries,\u201d he admonished.\n\nThe Ogwashi-Uku monarch disclosed that from time immemorial, Otulu community, nay Issele-Azagba land, were part of his kingdom and as a fact, lent out lands to Issele-Azagba to farm at inception.\n\nHRM Okonjo II, who last weekend narrowly escaped attack by cultists while on a visit to Otulu where he offered prayers , cited gazetted references including court judgements to back his ownership claim, said \u201cOtulu Ogwashi-Uku historically is a farming settlement under our Agidiasei Quarters.\n\n\u201cOtulu Ogwashi-Uku was separated from its sister community Edo Ogwashi-Uku when the current Lagos-Benin Expressway was built, effectively putting both communities on either side of the expressway.\n\n\u201cOtulu has always been part of Ogwashi-Uku Kingdom and has always been managed by an Okwabani appointed by the Obi of Ogwashi-Uku.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOtulu Ogwashi-Uku, politically, is Ward 1 in Aniocha South Local Government. A review of the geographical map of Delta State, drawn up by the Delta State Government, shows and establishes the local government boundaries which clearly puts Otulu Ogwashi-Uku inside Aniocha South Local Government.\n\n\u201cSo, from a historical, geographic and political point of view, Otulu Ogwashi-Uku is and will remain part of Ogwashi-Uku Kingdom.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that some communities are rushing to make claims about Otulu Ogwashi-Uku in light of the unfortunate incident which happened last week.\n\n\u201cWe are very prepared to defend our communal land to ensure that no outside community interferes with the land handed to us by our ancestors.\n\n\u201cWe will not permit any distortion of the facts or the truth\u2026we have relevant legal documents to back up our claims.\n\n\u201cLet us end by responding to a story we heard from HRM Agbogidi Obi Francis Jideuwa, the Obi of Issele-Azagba claiming ownership of Otulu.\n\n\u201cWe have a great deal of respect for His Majesty and we are sure he is misquoted and the stories supposedly from him about Otulu Ogwashi-Uku are false.\n\n\u201cWe know the history and relationship between our Azagba Ogwashi-Uku Community and Issele Azagba. We provided farm lands to them which metamorphosed to the present Issele Azagba community,\u201d he claimed.\n\n...",

          "text": "By Okey Onyenweaku\n\nAce banker and Group Managing Director of FBN Holdings, Urum Kalu Eke (UK Eke), has emerged winner of the prestigious Zik Prize in Professional Leadership Award for the year 2020 in recognition of his strides in the banking industry.\n\nAnnouncing the choice of Eke for the award at a virtual press conference yesterday, Prof Pat Utomi, chairman of the selection committee and member of the Board of Public Policy Research and Analysis Centre (PPRAC), organisers of the award scheme, said he was after a rigorous review process by the board.\n\nUtomi described Eke as a consummate banker with close to 4 decades experience in Financial Services, Audit and Capital Market operations across various financial institutions, who is credited with helping develop First Bank businesses within the Public Sector, Retail and Private Banking Groups.\n\n\u201cHe is being celebrated for his unblemished record of service and enormous contributions to the development and growth of the African Financial services industry,\u201d he said.\n\nAn honour to whom it is due\n\nUtomi said Eke, 56, who has had nearly four decades in the banking industry, and continues to make tremendous impact, especially in his capacity as Managing Director of FBN Holdings, where he has led the institution on the part of profitability, is one of Africa\u2019s finest bankers whose records speak for \u201cso eloquently.\u201d\n\nUtomi\u2019s views are shared by many industry players who told Business Hallmark that the honour to banker is most deserving.\n\n\u201cIt is a very good choice and an honour well deserved. It is a recognition of professional excellence,\u201d said Mazi Okechukwu Unaegbu, author and former president of Chattered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cU. K Eke has done well as a banker. And as GMD of FBN Holding\u2019s, he has made his mark. Those who made the choice did a very good job. Rather than look for politicians who carry money about, they decided to honour someone who has contributed meaningfully to the economy.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. David Adonri, Chief Executive Officer of Highcap Securities, no one else could have been more worthy of such recognition.\n\n\u201cUK Ekeh has done well. I remember at the time he took office, the bank faced very serious challenges, principal of which was the position of the non-performing loan which had set the bank on the part of losses,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs there were statutory provisions that had to be made, the losses that accompanied this were such that the bank could not pay dividends. In fact, within that season, the dividends that the FirstBankGroup was barely able to pay to shareholders were not coming from the bank but the subsidiaries.\n\n\u201cIt is to his credit that he has been able to complete the management of those provisions for the bad loans exposure due to the overexposure of the bank to, most notably the petroleum industry.

While the holding company had ended 2015 with gross earnings of N503 billion, it moved to N583.006billion in 2016, his first year as MD.\n\nGoing further, it was N598.184billion in 2017, and by 2018, it was N587.406billion and then N590.4 in 2019. In 2020, however, the impact of the pandemic caused a marginal 1.9 percent drop in the earnings to N579.4 billion.\n\nIn terms of profit, Eke\u2019s reign has also coincided with a period of rapid growth. FBN Holdings profit grew from N12.24billion in 2016 to N37.7billion in 2017, N58.23billion in 2018, N73.66billion in 2019 and N89.7 billion in 2020.",

The session typically covers a wide range of topics including Export documentation, Selection and Implementation of Supply Chain Management for Exports, Application of Export Development Business Processes amongst others.\n\nSpeaking on the programme, the Managing Director, Fidelity Bank Plc, Mrs. Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe noted that, \u201cAs a leading supporter of small businesses, we introduced the EMP five years ago to bridge the knowledge gap in the export business locally and to help participants to compete effectively in the global export market. Given the success we have recorded in the course of the programme and following the yearnings of potential participants, we decided to host an edition of the training in Kano for those who are unable to attend the session in Lagos.\u201d\n\nWhile EMP 11 is scheduled to hold at the Lagos Business School (LBS), Lekki, Lagos between 4 and 8 October 2021; EMP 12 would hold at a soon-to-be announced venue in Kano State from 11 to 15 October 2021. The sessions would be facilitated by leading faculty from LBS, Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) staff as well as experts in financial management and exports.\n\nFidelity Bank has over the years demonstrated its resolve to grow the non-oil export side of the economy through strategic initiatives and partnerships. For instance, the bank provided over N32.7 billion in credits to businesses operating in strategic sectors including rice, dairy, poultry, oil palm and cocoa in 2019. The bank has also successfully leveraged strategic partnerships with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) under various industry targeted intervention funding programmes to enhance access to credit for eligible players in the agribusiness and non-oil exports space with the aim of addressing food security gaps and enhancing foreign exchange earnings.\n\n\u201cThe benefits of supporting the non-oil sector of the economy cannot be overemphasized given the immense benefits that it provides to the economy and the nation in terms of providing much needed foreign exchange investments, increasing our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employment generation. This informs our decision to host the EMP regularly and we enjoin interested entrepreneurs to take advantage of this initiative to take their business to the next level,\u201d Onyeali-Ikpe explained.\n\nTo register for the event, kindly visit www.fidelitybank.ng",

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), and Georgetown University collaborated to deliver the professional certification training.\n\nAbout 40 participants drawn from the NCDC, state-level ministries of health, Nigeria Port Health Services, and the Nigerian military were certified in the first cohort of the intermediate-level Public Health Emergency Management Professional Certification Program (PHEM PC) adapted from the US-CDC was delivered by Georgetown University, a leader in Public Health Emergency Management training.\n\nThe Consul General highlighted the strategic partnership between the U.S. and Nigeria in strengthening health security and response to disease threats. \u201cThe U.S. Government is committed to promoting the health and wellbeing of Nigerians through initiatives and training that increase disease prevention, detection, and response,\u201d she added.\n\nThe PHEM PC Program equipped emergency managers, incident managers, state epidemiologists, first responders, watch managers, and other public health experts with specialized training in crisis and emergency risk communication, public health emergency management functions, and operations. The knowledge, competencies, and skill set taught in the course will help officials coordinate public health emergencies.\n\nIn 2019, Nigeria became a GHSA partner country committed to achieving GHSA 2024 targets and IHR requirements. The PHEM training is part of the U.S. Government\u2019s efforts to support pandemic preparedness in Nigeria and globally.\n\nFull remarks by U.S. Consul General Claire Pierengelo During the Closing Ceremony and Certification of Participants of the USG-supported Public Health Emergency Management Professional Certificate Program Friday, September 24, 2021\n\nFour Point by Sheraton, Victoria Island, Lagos\n\nOn behalf of the U.S. Mission in Nigeria, I am delighted to join you this afternoon for the closing ceremony and certification of participants of the United States Government-supported Public Health Emergency Management Professional Certificate program, the first such training at the intermediate level.\n\nOver the last 14 days, our distinguished participants have gone through rigorous training leading to certification. The two-week course focused on core principles of an Incident Management System (IMS) as an efficient coordination mechanism for responding to small disease outbreaks as well as more significant public health emergencies like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nEmergency Management is one of the 11 capacity building prioritized by the USG in its support of Nigeria. Our primary goal is to continue supporting Nigeria to achieve the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) 2024 targets and the International Health Regulations (IHR) requirements by strengthening workforce development, surveillance, emergency response, and laboratory capacity, among other areas.\n\nToday\u2019s event highlights our continued strategic partnership with Nigeria to support health security and response to disease threats. In the recent past, the USG had funded the participation of 4 Nigerians to attend the advanced Public Health Emergency Management (PHEM) Fellowship program at CDC headquarters in Atlanta.\n\nAs Nigeria consolidates country capacity for public health response by establishing State Public Health Emergency Operations Centers (PHEOC) across the country, we envision expanding PHEM capacity across Nigeria by training more stakeholders to ensure adequate knowledge, competencies, and skills to efficiently manage technical operations of the PHEOCs.\n\nEven as we continue to respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in our countries and many parts of the world, the need for all countries to continuously improve their response capacities cannot be overemphasized. We believe the PHEM professional certification program is one such training initiative that will adequately position Nigeria for epidemic and pandemic response now and into the future.\n\nLet me use this opportunity to thank Dr. Chikwe and the NCDC team for providing the opportunity for this transformative collaboration. In addition, I would like to thank the US-CDC for their leadership and Georgetown University for their efforts in working with the government and other partners to implement the PHEM program in Nigeria.\n\nFinally, following lessons learned from this pilot implementation, USG will continue to support NCDC to advance Public Health Emergency Management interventions in Nigeria at all levels. let me reiterate that the we remain committed and stand ready to continue our partnership with Nigeria in its response to public health disease threats and adopt strategies that will increase disease prevention, detection, and response. We are committed to promoting the health and wellbeing of Nigerians.\n\nThank you.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nPiqued by the total collapse of federal roads in the country\u2019s Southeast region, founder of Igbo Youth Movement (IYM) and Secretary, Eastern Consultative Assembly (ECA), Evang Elliot Ugochukwu-Uko, has called on the Economic and Financial Commission (EFCC) to investigate contractors handling the roads and government officials who awarded the contracts with a view to ascertaining their level of culpability.\n\nUko\u2019s appeal comes amid total breakdown of portions of strategic federal roads in the region, including Enugu-Onitsha road, Onitsha-Owerri road, Aba-Ikot Ekpene road, Enugu-Port Harcourt road, among others.\n\nThe activist who made the appeal in a statement on Friday, noted that the state of roads in the Southeast \u201cis embarrassing, to say the least.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cEnugu/Onitsha, one hour journey, now takes five hours. Trade and commerce suffers. Distribution of farm produce is greatly hampered. Travel becomes a nightmare.\n\n\u201cThe management of the construction companies responsible for some of the roads and their directors are sacred cows that cannot be called out.\n\n\u201cWe think the time has come for companies to be proud of the roads they deliver. We think it\u2019s time to investigate why roads suddenly collapse, split in two, break in the middle or suddenly turn into craters and huge potholes. Some turn into swimming pools. Who built them and why the sudden collapse?\u201d\n\nUko tasked the anti corruption agency to use the same zeal it uses to trace and arrest internet fraudsters to also pursue contractors who deliver substandard jobs and public office holders who divert funds meant for such projects.\n\nHe said, \u201cEFCC visits hotels and homes picking up suspected fraudsters a.k.a. Yahoo boys. They are paraded, their Laptops and other telecommunication devices seized and displayed. They are detained, investigated and arraigned for trial.\n\n\u201cAside the complaints that sometimes Innocent folks are picked up and their school projects delayed as their Laptops are seized, the nation has actually seen several convictions and even confessions and refunds.\n\n\u201cBut we wonder how come, same EFCC finds it difficult to investigate failed road projects. We hope it\u2019s not just a situation of finding it very convenient to raid hotels in search of youngsters, but inconvenient and inpolitik to investigate shady road contracts because of the calibre of people involved. It would have been much better if the two areas were addressed simultaneously, thereby carrying the people along in the process.\n\n\u201cSince anyone who embezzles public funds without properly discharging his side of the bargain, certainly committed economic crime against the people. There\u2019s need for a thorough investigation into the causes of many failed roads.\n\n\u201cIn my region, many federal roads have collapsed. So many lives have been lost, so many businesses destroyed as a result of impassable roads. Many are death traps. Some due to low quality and substandard construction.\n\n\u201cSome are reported to have been budgeted for, in some cases, contracts actually awarded and payment made. When will EFCC look into the cases of contracts awarded and jobs either poorly executed or not done at all.\n\n\u201cIf Mr. Integrity\u2019s administration truly wants to earn the trust and respect of the masses of my region, EFCC search light should be beamed on the records of the many contracts awarded in respect of these many failed roads.\n\n\u201cWho did what road? Which companies were paid? Who supervised the shabily done jobs? Who approved payments? Where the jobs done properly and satisfactorily?\n\n\u201cIf a culture of probity and accountability is not established, the profligacy that crippled the country will not only continue, but grow worse.\n\n\u201cThese terribly failed roads were done by humans who believe they are untouchable. The reluctance of EFCC to look into this very important issue, does not speak well of the reputation of the institution.\n\n\u201cGoing after students and youngsters in night clubs and hotel rooms, while the remorseless and conscienceless big fishes who destroyed the land by their greed and their mindless looting strut freely about as if they are above the law, does not enhance the credibility of the EFCC.\n\n\u201cThese horrible roads hinder economic growth, retard agricultural activities, negatively impact on social life and cripple transportation of goods and people.\n\n\u201cThe much oppressed and abused masses are praying and waiting to see the day the EFCC will begin to do the needful. There\u2019s no better way to earn respect of the aggieved masses, than to go after the hyenas and the foxes who ate up the people\u2019s commonwealth.\n\n\u201cEFCC digging into the contract awards, job supervision and project delivery, would help sanitize the system.\n\n\u201cThe spate of broken and collapsed roads, with some splitting right into two, suggests serious investigations be carried out in order to ascertain the materials used in the construction of the roads.\n\n\u201cThis measure will ensure better quality roads. The current situation does not speak well about our government. EFCC should take a look at the books now.\u201d",

          "text": "With growing concern among Nigerians about the continuous borrowing by the federal and state governments, President Muhammadu Buhari has appealed to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, USA, to grant debt forgiveness to poor and developing countries.\n\nThe president also insisted that the resurgent military takeover of governments in West Africa must not be condoned by the international community.\n\nIn his speech at the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly, the president in a statement by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, warned that democratic gains of the past decades in West Africa \u2018\u2018are now being eroded\u2019\u2019 due to these negative trends.\n\nThe president\u2019s speech, delivered from the podium of the General Assembly hall, addressed other matters on the international agenda of interest to Nigeria, including the COVID-19 pandemic, Arms Trade Treaty, climate change, terrorism, anti-corruption, debt suspension, international trade, UN Security Council Reform, the Palestinian Question, and racial discrimination, among others.\n\nOn the issue of debts in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Nigerian leader urged G20 countries to extend its debt suspension initiatives to all developing countries, least developed countries, and Small Island Developing States facing fiscal and liquidity challenges.\n\nThe president called for outright debt cancellation for countries facing the most severe challenges.\n\nHe said, \u2018\u2018Developing countries have been faced with unsustainable debt burdens even before the pandemic\n\n\u2018\u2018The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of a new wave of deepening debt where vital public financial resources are allocated to external debt servicing and repayments at the expense of domestic health and financing for critical developmental needs.\u201d\n\nBuhari commended the current initiatives by the international financial institutions and the G20 aimed at significantly mitigating the economic situation of the indebted countries and urged for more efforts in this regard.\n\n\u2018\u2018Therefore, there is an urgent need to consider expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to include all Developing, Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States facing fiscal and liquidity challenges.\n\n\u2018\u2018In addition, a review of the eligibility criteria for debt suspension, including outright cancellation, is needed for countries facing the most severe challenges.\u2019\u2019\n\nLEADERSHIP Weekend reports that President Buhari\u2019s calls for debt cancellation comes amidst growing concern and criticisms from Nigerians at the Buhari administration\u2019s continuous borrowing to fund budget deficits.\n\nMany believe the debts are becoming unsustainable with the country requiring to expend 98 percent of its annual income to service the N33 trillion debts owed by the federal and state governments.\n\nSome individuals, civil society organisations and opposition political parties earlier this week called on the Senate of the National Assembly to reject the president\u2019s newest request for approval to borrow another $4billion and \u20ac710 million from foreign sources, with many commentators accusing the government of spending the money to finance consumption rather than on viable capital projects.\n\nThe government, on its part, has continuously defended its borrowings, saying they were within economically safe limits, and that the funds were needed to develop world class infrastructure.\n\nThe recent trend of unconstitutional takeover of power, sometimes in reaction to unilateral changes of constitutions by some leaders, was also addressed by President Muhammadu Buhari who urged the international community not to tolerate such coups.\n\nHe affirmed Nigeria\u2019s support to efforts by ECOWAS, AU and the UN to address this growing challenge.\n\n\u2018\u2018As leaders of our individual member states, we need to adhere to the constitutional provisions of our countries, particularly on term limits. This is one area that generates crisis and political tension in our sub-region,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president urged the international community not only to deal with the symptoms of conflict but also the immediate causes that fuel conflicts in the first place.\n\n\u2018\u2018These include poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities.\n\n\u2018\u2018There are no easy solutions to these conditions. They require long term investments and more effective international cooperation. In this connection, my delegation underscores the importance of promoting peaceful, unfettered, and inclusive participation of states in global actions towards conflict prevention.\n\n\u2018\u2018This will facilitate the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063.\u201d\n\nThe president also used the occasion of the speech to renew his advocacy for equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, outlining steps Nigeria has taken to achieve \u2018\u2018moderate success\u2019\u2019 in containing the virus and halting its deadly onslaught in the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigeria remains grateful for the assistance received from our partners and friends all over the world.\n\n\u2018\u2018Vaccination is the key to our safe emergence from the pandemic.\n\n\u2018\u2018We fully support the COVAX initiative from which we have benefitted. We also thank the United States of America, Turkey, India, China, European Union, and others for the vaccines provided.\n\n\u2018\u2018Despite the acknowledgement, however, I would like to reiterate my call for a fairer and more equitable distribution of vaccines to all countries so that, together, we can fight and contain the pandemic.\n\n\u2018\u2018The rising wave of newer and more contagious strains makes this even more urgent. No country can afford the socio-economic implications of prolonged shutdown. It is imperative to underscore that no one is safe until everyone is safe,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn Nigeria\u2019s intervention to halt the pandemic, the President said:\n\n\u2018\u2018At the outset, we recognised detection and contact tracing to be important tools in combating the virus.\n\n\u2018\u2018In this connection, from a mere four laboratories with testing and detection capacities, we ramped up the facilities to over 140 centres today.\n\n\u2018\u2018Similarly, we built isolation centres and emergency hospital wards in record time all over the country. We carry out genomic sequencing in designated laboratories across the country with a view to detecting variants in circulation.\n\n\u2018\u2018In addition, over 40,000 health care workers have recently been trained on Infection, Prevention and Control measures with the support of various partners.\n\n\u2018\u2018Through the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control, we have established 16 infectious disease treatment centres located within our teaching hospitals and Federal Medical Centres,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn the fight against terrorism, the President told the UN General Assembly that the Nigerian security forces had recorded considerable success.\n\n\u2018\u2018As a result of the renewed vigour of Nigeria\u2019s military, many terrorist fighters are voluntarily surrendering to our security forces,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president noted that while terrorism continues to dominate security discourse worldwide, in Nigeria, Boko Haram terrorists group, though fragmented by internal strife and weakened by the defence forces, is still active and preying on soft targets.\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigeria will continue to work closely with UN Counter-Terrorism bodies and entities with a view to bringing this scourge to an end, \u2019\u2019 he said, adding that the country would spare no effort in addressing the challenges of terrorism posed by the activities of Boko Haram in North East Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, as well as banditry in the North West and North Central Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018I and three other Nigerian heads of state served actively as peacekeepers and Nigeria continues to support peacekeeping efforts. We know the sacrifice involved; we also know how important peacekeeping is for those in vulnerable situations.\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigeria will continue to play its part fully in supporting United Nations peacekeeping operations within Africa and beyond,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn international trade, President Buhari called for reforms that will engender recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, build resilience to future shocks and pursue transformative development strategies that can deliver the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals .\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigeria reaffirms that international trade is an engine for development and sustained economic growth, as well as the global eradication of poverty.\n\n\u2018\u2018My delegation would like to reaffirm the critical role that a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system can play in stimulating economic growth and development.\n\n\u2018\u2018Fair and equitable trade would eventually eliminate the need for aid.\n\n\u2018\u2018My country and indeed all African countries do not intend to stay indefinitely looking for aid. All we need is a fair and equitable system of international trade,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe Nigerian leader also renewed the call for the reforms of the UN Security Council, stressing that intergovernmental negotiations on the issue were taking too long.\n\n\u2018\u2018No reform of the United Nations system is more urgent than that of the Security Council. Stakeholders around the world are asking how such power could be concentrated, with scant representation.\n\n\u2018\u2018The intergovernmental negotiations have taken too long, some 15 years.\n\n\u2018\u2018We must avoid going in circles. Consensus has been achieved in some of the elements of this reform, especially that of the representation of Africa on the basis of the Elzuwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is unreasonable to expect unanimity in this matter. The issue, indeed, is about justice, not unanimity. Without justice, the legitimacy (even efficacy) of our organisation is called to question.\n\n\u2018\u2018We can and must make substantial, irreversible progress on Security Council reform in the current session,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOn the Palestinian question, the president encouraged Israel and Palestine to re-engage in dialogue based on relevant UN resolutions and initiatives.\n\n\u2018\u2018The two-state solution has the support of the international community and is widely acknowledged as the path to lasting peace,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari also expressed deep concerns at the devastating effects of small arms and weapons, calling for accountability in conventional arms trade.\n\n\u201cNigeria remains deeply concerned over the illicit trade, transfer, and circulation of small arms and light weapons. Their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world are having devastating humanitarian and socio-economic consequences, especially on the continent of Africa.\n\n\u201cIt is on this note that my delegation calls for the world wide application of the Arms Trade Treaty to codify accountability in conventional arms trade, which is critical to the security of nations. This is in recognition of the need for a broad-based global partnership in the on-going battle against trans-border crimes, including terrorism and piracy.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari concluded his UN speech at the 76th annual general debate with praise for the outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nHe also pledged Nigeria\u2019s unalloyed support for multilateralism and faith in the UN as the pre-eminent body for solving current and emerging global challenges.\n\nContinue to use your leadership position to stabilize West Africa, UN Secretary-general urges President Buhari\n\nMeanwhile, the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his leadership roles in Africa as well as the stabilization of the West African sub-region.\n\nThe Secretary General spoke yesterday in a meeting with the Nigerian president on the sidelines of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly taking place in New York.\n\nAccording to the UN scribe, Africa, especially West Africa, was generally seen as an ocean of stability and good governance, but was deeply concerned at recent reversal of fortunes in democratic rule in some parts of the West African sub-region with coups overturning elected institutions.\n\nHe, therefore, urged President Buhari to continue to show leadership as he looks up to Nigeria to help stabilise the sub-region in terms of democracy and good governance.\n\nOn terrorism, the Secretary General commended the efforts of Nigeria on this global phenomenon, assuring the Nigerian leader of the United Nations\u2019 continued support in her efforts to address the prevailing security and humanitarian challenges that had arisen, especially with the Internally Displaced Persons.\n\nHe also commended Nigeria\u2019s efforts on climate change, expressing willingness of the world body to cooperate with the country in this regard.\n\nPresident Buhari applauded Mr Gutterres for his global leadership and the success of the 76th Session.\n\nHe assured the Secretary General that Nigeria had achieved appreciable successes in tackling the insecurity caused by terrorists and bandits.\n\nThe president also thanked him for the global organisation\u2019s intervention in activities towards reducing the effects of climate change, especially with the support for the Great Green Wall programme, which is aimed at arresting desertification across the Sahel as well as the campaign against deforestation in Nigeria.\n\nPresident Buhari added that Nigeria was ready to support and work closely with the United Nations towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.",

          "title": "Experts Explain How VAT Collection By States Will Work",
          "text": "As the argument between the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) and state governments over the collection of Value Added Tax continues, tax experts have laid out the modalities and/or issues that would define the operationality of VAT administration in the states.\n\nThis is as manufacturers, tax experts and industry watchers say they foresee a multiple tax system that would be complicated if collection is left for states.\n\nExcept for the few challenges identified in the possibility of states\u2019 collection of VAT, the experts said it would be better for the states to be in charge of tax collection for developmental purposes.\n\nThey, however, raised concern that allowing states to collect VAT would have a negative impact on ease of doing business. They also expressed worry at the capacity of the states to effectively collect tax; issues of lack of policies to address legal issues of border checks and destination inspection without increasing the burden of payment on the taxpayers.\n\nTax consultant, Dr Fredrick Obasi said, \u201cIt\u2019s not the administration of tax that is important, but the capacity to collect. The right thing to do for developmental purposes is to allow the states to collect tax,\u201d he said.\n\nBut can they collect? Most states do not have the capacity.\n\nOn the expected controversy that could emerge if states are allowed to collect VAT, Dr Obasi said the law has taken care of how it should be done.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a consumption tax. You pay at the point of purchase or consumption. VAT law and compliance is not ambiguous. It is an input/output VAT. When the output is more, you don\u2019t pay because you would have added something more. The input should always be more than output.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe general view is that most states do not even have the will power.\n\n\u201cIf the states have the capacity, they should be allowed to collect. Nigeria will be better off because development will be closer to the masses; and collection administration will be easier because the taxpayers will be known one-on-one,\u201d he stated.\n\nBut Barrister Lawrence Emeka Ihebie has a slightly different notion of how it should work, in a scenario of the supreme court pronouncing that VAT collection should be done by the respective states.\n\nHe said in an interview that \u201cit\u2019s going to be difficult and it will require cooperation among states.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the only area of challenge is in the input and output VAT collection. Output VAT is paid at the point of the reselling of a product, which implies that the VAT on a product that is being sold for the second time should be less than the amount of the VAT paid at the first point of purchase of the product.\n\nThe fear is that some states would still want to collect the full value of the 5% VAT on a product where VAT had been paid in full sum, regardless of the place of payment.\n\nThe law provides that you remove the value of the 5% VAT paid at the first point of purchase and then deduct it from the VAT input on the product at the second point of sale of the product.\n\nIhebie\u2019s view is that the federal government should collect VAT on a business transaction that happens between states (interstate). The law states that when a transaction involves two states, only the federal government has the power to make law on it. That was the supreme court judgment in Aberuagba vs Attorney-general of Ogun State case.\n\nThere are reports of people paying stamp duty in one state and they are mandated to still pay stamp duty on the same product in another state.\n\nExperts also foresee a major challenge in filing of tax returns for individuals and businesses that have operations beyond a state.\n\nIn the case that states are allowed to collect VAT, people would be required to file tax returns in two or more states on a particular product or service. For instance, a company that operates in all the states of the federation will then be required to maintain tax returns in each of the states.\n\n\u201cThat will decrease ease of doing business and ease of paying tax. It will be difficult to determine who will be entitled to certain VAT where it happens in a border between states,\u201d Barrister Ihebie said.\n\nHowever, he said, states should be allowed to collect tax, adding that it would make the governors start attracting business.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t solve a problem by running away from it. So, when these issues arise, the states will come up with a policy or an amendment whereby the input paid in a particular state can be recognised in the other state. The federal government could also collect the VAT and share it equally between the states involved.\n\n\u201cAll the issues raised are issues that can be resolved. It might, however, increase the burden on the taxpayers,\u201d Ihebie stated.\n\nOperators in the organised private sector also raised concern that some states may increase the VAT from the current 7.5 per cent up to 10 percent once they commence collection, bringing more disruptions to the already complicated tax system in the country.\n\nA former director-general of LCCI, Dr. Muda Yusuf, said state collection of VAT will surely come with some complications and overlaps which may be detrimental to business interests.\n\nHe argued that the VAT conundrum had created a great deal of uncertainty among investors \u201csuch that we are dealing with conflicting and overlapping instructions from the states and federal government.\u201d\n\nHe said this is surely not the best for investors\u2019 confidence, stating that the resolution of the VAT controversy should be both legal and political.\n\nHe affirmed that it is important to have some engagements and discussions among the key players and participants.\n\n\u201cThis should, however, be without prejudice to the central issue of equity and justice in the distribution of the VAT proceeds. The bigger issue is actually the equity question,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, the national president, Association of Small Business Owners of Nigeria (ASBON), Dr Femi Egbesola, said the idea of state governments collecting taxes means that enough funds will be allotted to building a structure that will manage the collection of VAT, stating that \u201cwe don\u2019t need it in an economy that is descending and reclining.\u201d\n\nHe explained that VAT collection will not bring advantage to business owners due to the overlapping in VAT collection from companies that have offices in different states, which could cause companies to pay multiple taxes.\n\nHe said harmonising the payment of tax will become very difficult as business owners will bear the brunt of paying more taxes on vatable products.\n\n\u201cApparently, this will see state governments charging different rates from 7.5 per cent to 10 percent while some other states may even charge more, and how do they begin to harmonise the payment of tax.\u201d\n\nThe ASBON boss stated that the CAMA Act of 2020 that was signed into law exempts small businesses whose turnover in a year is N25 million and below from paying tax, adding that the CAMA Act belongs to the federal government and when it comes to states collecting VAT, they may say they don\u2019t recognize the law and that means small businesses who are struggling will begin to pay VAT.\n\nHe further posited that multiple payment of tax will occur as manufacturers are likely to pay more taxes in their manufacturing states with state government officials clamping down on their distributors for tax and, largely, if the state government succeeds on this, it will bring negative consequences to small businesses.\n\n\u201cIt is no gainsaying that for any economy to survive, we must grow the small business sector and that\u2019s why some of us are clamouring that the VAT policy should not fly, or else it will affect us negatively,\u201d Egbesola said.\n\nIndustrialist Urges FG, States To Dialogue On VAT\n\nMeanwhile, an industrialist, Kayode Ojo, has called the federal and state governments to come to a round table and discuss the contentious issue of who collects the Value Added Tax (VAT).\n\nOjo said the two levels of government should not allow the VAT collection matter to create tension in the country.\n\nSpeaking on the issue, the All Progressive Congress (APC) chieftain in Ekiti State said the issue should be critically looked into by the parties involved in order to reach a reasonable compromise that will benefit all.\n\n\u201cMy position on VAT, which is a consumption tax, is that the federal and state government should come together and dialogue on how it will generate maximum benefit to all and sundry.\n\n\u201cIt is not one-cap-fits-all; a lot of studies should be done to arrive at how it should be administered,\u201d he said.\n\nOjo said he was very sure that the two contending parties could reach a compromise that would be favourable to all sides.\n\nThe front line politician stressed the need for the harmonious relationship that has been existing between the two tiers of the government to be built upon to resolve the controversial issue.\n\n\u201cLet us remember that we are the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress, so I don\u2019t expect the VAT issue to degenerate into chaos.\n\n\u201cThe committee set up by the federal government and the states should parley, \u2018jaw- jaw\u2019 and see how they will generate maximum benefit for all and sundry .\n\n\u201cThe two parties should arrive at the best option that could be good for both the federal and the States government and, I am sure, a compromise can be reached on the matter.\u201d\n\nLEADERSHIP Weekend reports that there is ongoing legal battle between the Rivers State government and Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS), an agency of the federal government -on who is entitled to collect VAT.\n\nLagos State has also recently domesticated the VAT collection after passing a bill into law to that effect.\n\nThe Southern Governors Forum, at a meeting in Enugu State last week, also took a joint position to support VAT collection by states.",
          "summary": "Except for the few challenges identified in the possibility of states\u2019 collection of VAT, the experts said it would be better for the states to be in charge of tax collection for developmental purposes.\nThey, however, raised concern that allowing states to collect VAT would have a negative impact on ease of doing business.\nThe law states that when a transaction involves two states, only the federal government has the power to make law on it.\nOjo said the two levels of government should not allow the VAT collection matter to create tension in the country.\nThe Southern Governors Forum, at a meeting in Enugu State last week, also took a joint position to support VAT collection by states.",

          "text": "Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has been asked to release or publish the recommendations of the Ogun State judicial panel on police brutality, otherwise known as EndSARS panel, within seven days.\n\nA Non-Governmental Organisation, the Crusaders of Freedom Initiative, made the request in a letter addressed to Abiodun on Friday.\n\nThe NGO, through its counsel, Kayode Aderemi, reminded the governor that the EndSARS panel had submitted its recommendations to him since July 2021.\n\nPursuant to Section 4 of the Freedom of Information Act 2011, the group asked Abiodun to make public the recommendations of the panel.\n\nA copy of the letter titled, \u2018Request for the release/publication of details of the Ogun State EndSARS panel\u2019s recommendation\u2019, read in part:\n\n\u201cWe are the solicitors to the Crusaders of Freedom Initiative, a registered NGO. We write on her instruction. The above subject refers, Sir.\n\n\u201cWe commend Your Excellency for swiftly acceding to the demands of millions of youths to set up the ENDSARS Panel. We understand that the Panel has concluded her sittings and made her recommendations to your Excellency, since July, 2021. We hereby humbly request for the release/publication of the details to the Panel\u2019s recommendations.\n\n\u201cWe made this request pursuant to Section 1 of the Freedom of Information Act 2011, which guarantees any person to access or request information in custody or possession of any public official, agency or institution.\n\n\u201cPursuant to Section 4 of the Freedom of Information Act 2011, we urge your Excellency to accede to our request within 7 days from receipt of this request.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with DAILY POST, Aderemi charged the State government to make public the report of the panel, saying the panel was a private one.\n\nThe legal practitioner stated that he represented no fewer than four petitioners at the panel, expressing dissatisfaction that none of his clients knew their fate as far as the panel was concerned.\n\n\u201cThe EndSARS panel was a public hearing, not a private hearing. So, it is common sense that the recommendations of a public hearing should be made public. There is no alternative to that. That\u2019s just the normal thing. Even in Lagos, the recommendations were made public, we knew who was getting what. Personally, I represented about four petitioners at the panel. As I speak with you, none of them knows their fate, despite the fact that the panel concluded several months ago.\n\n\u201cSince it was a public hearing, recommendations should be made public. Newspapers covered petitions and hearings, why should the recommendations be private?\u201d he queried.\n\nThe counsel threatened to approach the court if Gov Abiodun failed to release the panel\u2019s report in accordance with the FOI Act in seven days",

          "title": "Constitution Amendment: Delays, Intrigues, Distrust As Nigerians Await New Law",
          "text": "The federal republic of Nigeria\u2019s constitution is now being amended in the National Assembly; nonetheless, there are citizens from various fields of endeavor who do not believe the document will ever see the light of day.\n\nSome argue that it has been customary for the National Assembly to establish possibilities in the shape of committees in both the upper and lower chambers to fulfill pledges made to legislators who voted for the Senate President or the Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\nDAILY POST examines the past, present, and likely outcome of the current amendment exercise, which is chaired by Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, who also represents Delta Central Senatorial District.\n\nThe last time the Nigerian Constitution was revised was in January 2011, under the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan, and since then, the inadequacy and insanity of the amended constitution has prompted constant calls for more amendments.\n\nAs a result of this development, an amendment committee was formed, chaired by Senator David Mark, who served as President of the Senate from 2007 to 2015.\n\nSenator Ike Ekweremadu, the Deputy Senate President, was the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Constitution Amendment at the time.\n\nAt the upper and lower legislative chambers, an ad hoc committee was sponsored alongside a regular committee. Senator Ike Ekweremadu, who represents Enugu West Senatorial District on the Peoples Democratic Party platform, chaired the Committee for twelve years in the pursuit of a functional constitutional draft.\n\nFor the past twelve years that Ekweremadu has presided over the Committee, all attempts to change the Constitution have failed despite significant funding of almost N3 billion.\n\nThe fund, which was intended for both House of Representatives and Senate Committees as they coexisted, failed to provide any outcomes.\n\nDespite Ekweremadu\u2019s legal competence and experience as a fifth-time member of the red Chamber, the Constitution amendment failed.\n\nSome citizens, on the other hand, believe that the never-ending unsuccessful constitutional amendment process is merely meant to serve as a conduit for legislators and not to serve Nigerians\u2019 true interests.\n\nThe House of Representatives Spokesperson, Benjamin Kalu, expressed confidence that the 9th National Assembly would change the narrative, saying that the pending constitution amendment would be voted into law and signed by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIn just two years, he claimed, MPs in the 9th Assembly accomplished more legislative obligations in terms of bills passed, motions sponsored, and resolutions passed than in any prior session.\n\nThe legislator, who spoke on a live radio show in Abuja with a DAILY POST correspondent last week, credited the 9th National Assembly for having a good working relationship with the executive branch of government.\n\nPresident Buhari, he added, will assent to the new constitution as soon as it is passed. He went on to say that if MPs could break the jinx by passing the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), which is now an Act, he was confident that the Constitution would be passed as well.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigerians who still express doubt that the Constitution amendment will not be passed are reminded of the PIB which was passed into law after 21 years.\n\nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila on his part, didn\u2019t only assure that the amended constitution would be passed into law in record time but said the document would make sure that institutions of the state are accountable for their action to put an end to the debilitating conflicts across the country.\n\nGbajabiamila who was giving a keynote address at 112th Founder\u2019s Lecture of the King\u2019s College Old Boys Association, Lagos, on Saturday last week submitted that Nigeria\u2019s amalgamation in 1914 was a phenomenon that should mobilise Nigerians into a strong and united territory, but regretted that the reverse has been the case. He said the ongoing Constitution amendment provided ample opportunity for a working document to be produced to enable citizens take ownership of their own country.\n\nHe maintained: \u201cIn the House of Representatives, we are currently in the process of substantive review of our nation\u2019s Constitution. Our objective is to deliver a Constitution that more effectively organizes our politics to make it more inclusive, enshrine efficient mechanisms for holding institutions of State to account and put an end to debilitating conflicts that continue to tear our nation apart.\n\nSpeaking further, he said: \u201cWe will not produce a perfect Constitution. No such thing has ever existed in the world. However, together we can, by the choices we make and our actions, use our Constitution as the foundational document of our nationhood to give life to the best promise of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn his view, Senator Francis Fadahunsi representing Osun East Senatorial District on Thursday likened Nigeria\u2019s Constitution to a \u2018rag\u2019, which requires patches all the time. He regretted that Nigeria has never been serious in its search for a Constitution that tended to take care of Nigerians, saying, there was the late Justice Niki Tobi Committee report which comprehensively addressed the yearnings of Nigerians, but was jettisoned due to unexplained reasons.\n\nThe lawmaker said Nigeria\u2019s parliament has a history of constitution amendments, yet nothing workable has ever come out, saying: \u201cIf they had allowed Justice Niki Tobi Committee report to be implemented and allowed the legislature to work on it, maybe it would have solved problems. Today, the Constitution is unworkable.\n\n\u201cAside from the 9th Senate that is battling with the Constitution amendment, all other sessions, from first to the 8th have been running up and down trying to amend the Constitution, yet it didn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cConstitution is like a rag, and if we are lucky in the 9th Assembly we will be to amend some parts of the Constitution, if not we have to sit down in future to talk about Constitution amendment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of experienced lawmakers and we should allow a Constitution to come from the 9th Assembly because we are the representative of the people.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a legal practitioner who didn\u2019t want his name in print expressed pessimism about constitutional amendment under the current leadership of the National Assembly.\n\nHe said the amendment of the constitution was more than a serious exercise that should not be left in hands of unserious lawmakers.\n\nThe lawyer, while disclosing that he participated in the Constitutional Review national public hearing which was held on June 3 and 4 at the International Conference Centre, Abuja pointed out that \u201cStates creation\u201d interests have made the exercise difficult, controversial and a recipe for crisis.\n\nHe said the Dr. Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan leadership does not have the capacity and resolute to do what wouldn\u2019t be in the interest of the executive, hence, memoranda on State creation were not in the interest of the executive and were dead on arrival.\n\nHowever, the Constitution Review Committee as it were, may have a time challenge to carry out the exercise given that it has less than a two-year life span. It is even more difficult that out of the period left, 2023 political activities may go full-blown from mid-2022 and time will tell, if Senators and Representatives of the 9th National Assembly will amend the 1999 Constitution before May 29.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s President Muhammadu Buhari has addressed the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, USA.\n\nIn his speech, President Muhammadu Buhari spoke on COVID-19, Terrorism, Corruption, global food system, human rights amongst other issues.\n\nSpeaking on COVID-19, President Buhari thanked the international community for the concerted response to Covid-19.\n\n\u201cThe solidarity and drive to contain the first truly global health emergency of our time is a pointer to the many things we can achieve if we work together,\u201d Mr Buhari said.\n\nThe President equally said Nigeria made strenuous efforts to contain the virus and halt its deadly onslaught on Nigerians. He revealed that the country built isolation centres and emergency hospital wards in record time all over the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria remains grateful for the assistance received from our partners and friends all over the world. Vaccination is the key to our safe emergence from the pandemic. We fully support the COVAX initiative from which we have benefitted. We also thank the United States of America, Turkey, India, China, European Union, and others for the vaccines provided.\n\n\u201cDespite the acknowledgement however, I would like to reiterate my call for a fairer and more equitable distribution of vaccines to all countries so that, together, we can fight and contain the pandemic. The rising wave of newer and more contagious strains, makes this even more urgent. No country can afford the socio-economic implications of prolonged shutdown. It is imperative to underscore that no one is safe until everyone is safe,\u201d Mr Buhari said.\n\nOn combating illicit financial flows, Mr Buhari said the recovery and return of illicitly acquired assets have the potential to provide resources in the immediate term for financing development in this era of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.\n\nThe former military ruler said Nigeria intends to build a \u201cclimate-resilient economy that effectively aligns with the SDGs and that has great potentials to unlocking the full opportunities in different sectors of the economy while protecting the resources for present and future generations. I know, in several ways, this is also a familiar story in many countries.\u201d\n\nREAD THE FULL SPEECH BELOW\n\nAT THE GENERAL DEBATE OF THE 76TH SESSION OF UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY\n\nFriday, 24TH SEPTEMBER, 2021\n\nNEW YORK, USA\n\n\u27a2 Mr. President,\n\n\u27a2 Heads of State and Government,\n\n\u27a2 Mr. Secretary-General,\n\n\u27a2 Distinguished Delegates,\n\n\u27a2 Ladies and Gentlemen.\n\nMr. President,\n\nLet me, on behalf of the government and people of Nigeria, congratulate you on your well-deserved election as President of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. I would like to assure you of the full support and cooperation of the Nigerian delegation throughout your tenure.\n\n2. I would like to commend your predecessor, His Excellency, Mr. Volkan Boskir, for the many remarkable achievements recorded during his tenure, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n3. Permit me to congratulate the Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, on his re-election and commend his strong commitment to making the UN more alive to its responsibilities.\n\n4. I also want to express my gratitude to him for re-appointing Ms. Amina Mohammed, as the Deputy Secretary General to assist him in discharging his heavy responsibilities.\n\nMr. President,\n\n5. The theme of this year\u2019s General Assembly \u2013 \u201cBuilding resilience through hope \u2013 to recover from COVID-19, rebuild sustainably, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of the people, and revitalise the United Nations, sums up our common desire to rescue our planet, recover our economies, and restore hope to all the peoples of the world.\n\n6. In this regard, my delegation will continue to support the United Nations, as the indispensable forum for international cooperation and the cornerstone of the multilateral system, rooted in respect for international law, including international human rights law and predicated on a rules-based order.\n\nMr. President,\n\n7. I want to thank the international community for the concerted response to Covid-19. The solidarity and drive to contain the first truly global health emergency of our time is a pointer to the many things we can achieve if we work together.\n\n8. On our part, Nigeria has made strenuous efforts to contain the virus and halt its deadly onslaught on our people. Our efforts have been rewarded with moderate success.\n\n9. At the outset, we recognised detection and contact tracing to be important tools in combating the virus. In this connection, from a mere four laboratories with testing and detection capacities, we ramped up the facilities to over 140 centres today.\n\n10. Similarly, we built isolation centres and emergency hospital wards in record time all over the country. We carry out genomic sequencing in designated laboratories across the country with a view to detecting variants in circulation.\n\n11. In addition, over 40,000 health care workers have recently been trained on Infection, Prevention and Control measures with the support of various partners. Through the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control, we have established 16 infectious disease treatment centres located within our Teaching Hospitals and Federal Medical Centres.\n\n12. Nigeria remains grateful for the assistance received from our partners and friends all over the world. Vaccination is the key to our safe emergence from the pandemic. We fully support the COVAX initiative from which we have benefitted. We also thank the United States of America, Turkey, India, China, European Union, and others for the vaccines provided.\n\n13. Despite the acknowledgement however, I would like to reiterate my call for a fairer and more equitable distribution of vaccines to all countries so that, together, we can fight and contain the pandemic. The rising wave of newer and more contagious strains, makes this even more urgent. No country can afford the socio-economic implications of prolonged shutdown. It is imperative to underscore that no one is safe until everyone is safe.\n\nMr President,\n\n14. Nigeria remains deeply concerned over the illicit trade, transfer, and circulation of small arms and light weapons. Their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world are having devastating humanitarian and socio-economic consequences, especially on the continent of Africa.\n\n15. It is on this note that my delegation calls for the world wide application of the Arms Trade Treaty to codify accountability in conventional arms trade, which is critical to the security of nations. This is in recognition of the need for a broad-based global partnership in the on-going battle against trans-border crimes, including terrorism and piracy.\n\nMr. President,\n\n16. We must deal not only with the symptoms of conflict but also the immediate causes that fuel conflicts in the first place. These include poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities.\n\n17. There are no easy solutions to these conditions. They require long term investments and more effective international cooperation. In this connection, my delegation underscores the importance of promoting peaceful, unfettered, and inclusive participation of states in global actions towards conflict prevention. This will facilitate the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063.\n\n18 In West Africa especially, our democratic gains of the past decades are now being eroded. The recent trend of unconstitutional takeover of power, sometimes in reaction to unilateral changes of constitutions by some leaders, must not be tolerated by the international community. Nigeria fully supports the efforts by ECOWAS to address this growing challenge and appreciates the support of both the African Union and the United Nations. In this regard, I would like to reiterate that as leaders of our individual Member-States we need to adhere to the constitutional provisions of our countries, particularly on term limits. This is one area that generates crisis and political tension in our sub-region.\n\nMr President,\n\n19. Nigeria is fully committed to nuclear non-proliferation and has always supported the view that it should involve all States.\n\n20. Disarmament Conventions deserve the support of all states, small, large, nuclear or non-nuclear. Nuclear weapons remain the ultimate agents of mass destruction, and their total elimination should be the final objective of all disarmament processes within the broad spectrum of goals being pursued by the United Nations.\n\n21. In this regard, Nigeria would participate actively in the forthcoming Review Conference of the Nuclear Prohibition Treaty and also the First Meeting of States Parties to the landmark Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, scheduled to take place within the first quarter of 2022.\n\n22. Nigeria regards these upcoming events as important steps towards the realisation of a world free of nuclear weapons. We are, therefore, supportive of any diplomatic efforts in this direction. We hope that the upcoming NPT review conference would lead to a successful outcome that would facilitate the denuclearisation of the world. We would do our part to ensure such an outcome.\n\nMr. President,\n\n23. Terrorism continues to dominate security discourse worldwide. In Nigeria, Boko Haram terrorists group, though fragmented by internal strife and weakened by our defence forces, is still active and preying on soft targets. Nigeria will continue to work closely with UN Counter-Terrorism bodies and entities with a view to bringing this scourge to an end.\n\n24. Nigeria has spared no effort in addressing the challenges of terrorism posed by the activities of Boko Haram in North-East Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, as well as banditry in the North-West and North-Central Nigeria. The Nigerian Security Forces have recorded considerable success in the fight against terrorism. As a result of the renewed vigour of our military, many terrorist fighters are voluntarily surrendering to our security forces.\n\n25. I and three other Nigerian Heads of State served actively as peace keepers and Nigeria continues to support peacekeeping efforts. We know the sacrifice involved, we also know how important peace keeping is for those in vulnerable situations. Nigeria will continue to play its part fully in supporting United Nations peacekeeping operations within Africa and beyond.\n\nMr. President,\n\n26. The impact of climate change is already with us in Nigeria, manifesting in various ways: conflicts; food insecurity, drying up of lakes; loss of livelihood, and youth migration, among others. The trend is the same in many other countries that are threatened by forest fires, rising sea levels, drought and desertification.\n\n27. In the circumstances, we intend to build a climate-resilient economy that effectively aligns with the SDGs and that has great potentials to unlocking the full opportunities in different sectors of the economy, while protecting the resources for present and future generations. I know, in several ways, this is also a familiar story in many countries.\n\n28. As leaders, we must create inclusive and gender-sensitive policies that address all issues connected to climate action, from mitigation to resilience.\n\n29. Nigeria believes that protecting our planet and its biodiversity and climate are important to our collective survival. That is why we are working on a transition to low carbon economy, consistent with achieving the Paris Climate Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nMr. President,\n\n30. Combating illicit financial flows and ensuring the recovery and return of illicitly acquired assets have the potential to provide resources in the immediate term for financing development in this era of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.\n\n31. Similarly, corruption across national borders has huge negative impact on the stability, peace, and economic prospects of millions, particularly in developing countries.\n\n32. It deprives national Governments of resources needed to provide adequate and meaningful sources of livelihood for their citizens. The latter gives rise to more irregular migration patterns, with unwholesome consequences for inter-state and human relations.\n\n33. I, therefore, call on all leaders to demonstrate the much-needed political will by supporting the recommendations for systemic reforms made by the FACTI Panel.\n\n34. We support establishing modalities for a global coordination mechanism at the United Nations Economic and Social Council to systematically monitor illicit financial flows and strengthen financial integrity for sustainable development, with the participation of all relevant stakeholders.\n\nMr. President,\n\n35. On the issue of debt, we have seen that developing countries have been faced with unsustainable debt burdens even before the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of new wave of deepening debt, where vital public financial resources are allocated to external debt servicing and repayments at the expense of domestic health and financing for critical developmental needs.\n\n36. I must commend the current initiatives by the international financial institutions and the G20 aimed at significantly mitigating the economic situation of the indebted countries and urge for more efforts in this regard.\n\n37. Therefore, there is an urgent need to consider expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to include all Developing, Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States facing fiscal and liquidity challenges. In addition, a review of the eligibility criteria for debt suspension, including outright cancellation, is needed for countries facing the most severe challenges.\n\nMr. President,\n\n38. Nigeria reaffirms that international trade is an engine for development and sustained economic growth, as well as the global eradication of poverty.\n\n39. My delegation would like to reaffirm the critical role that a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system can play in stimulating economic growth and development.\n\n40. Fair and equitable trade would eventually eliminate the need for aid. My country and indeed all African countries do not intend to stay indefinitely looking for aid. All we need is a fair and equitable system of international trade.\n\n41. We, therefore, call for a reform agenda that will engender better recovery from this crisis, build resilience to future shocks and pursue transformative development strategies that can deliver the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nMr. President,\n\n42. The global food system has, in recent times, been impacted by several factors such as population growth, availability and accessibility of arable land and water resources, climate change, and loss of biodiversity.\n\n43. Increased competition for resources such as land, water, and energy, has affected food access and supply, particularly in developing countries. Climate change and unpredictable shocks, such as the current global pandemic, further exacerbate vulnerabilities in the global food system, requiring the UN\u2019s urgent attention.\n\n44. The Government of Nigeria remains determined to improve the productivity and incomes of small-scale farmers by promoting equal access to land, technology and markets, sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices.\n\n45. At the heart of Nigeria\u2019s post-COVID-19 response is the Economic Sustainability Plan, which has a major component, called the Agriculture for Food and Jobs Programme where we seek to leverage suitable technologies to build a resilient food system for the country.\n\n46. An integral part of our food systems\u2019 transformation strategy is to create an enabling and supportive environment to implement these policies in a participatory manner.\n\n47. Global efforts to mitigate and sustain food systems must involve key stakeholders, including Governments, farmers, investors, multilateral organizations, regional bodies, international financial institutions, private partners and civil society organizations.\n\nMr. President,\n\n48. Nigeria has been steadfast in safeguarding human rights, including the advancement of women, the protection of children, the protection of the rights of people living with disabilities, the treatment of migrants, refugees, returnees and displaced persons as well as, the promotion of fundamental freedoms through all legitimate means. In this regard, my delegation commends the positive example of leaders like Prime Minister Jacinda Arden of New Zealand.\n\n49. Nigeria remains unwavering in its commitment to ensuring the advancement of human rights within its shores and beyond. This is so even in the context of a vicious decade-long onslaught by terrorists against Nigerians, quite contrary to unwholesome reports by some who hardly verify what they state against us.\n\n50. The recent rise in hate related crimes globally underscores the urgent need to continue our engagement about racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other related intolerance. It is sad to note that the issue of racism remains alive globally.\n\n51. We are beginning to forget our affirmation of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of every individual as enshrined in the UN Charter. No society can claim to be free or just if it deprives anyone of these rights.\n\n52. Nigeria has long been a principled fighter against racism and all forms of discrimination inspired by its African experience. In the past, racism oiled the machine of slavery and colonialism. Today, racism drives hate crimes and institutional discrimination. In all this, Africans and people of African descent are among the major victims.\n\n53. Cognizant of these, I commend Member States for adopting by consensus the resolution on the Establishment of the Permanent Forum of People of African Descent on 2ndAugust 2021. I am confident that this forum will make significant impact in the quest to end race-related vices and injustices.\n\nMr. President,\n\n54. No reform of the United Nations system is more urgent than that of the Security Council. Stakeholders around the world are asking how such power could be concentrated, with scant representation. The intergovernmental negotiations have taken too long, some 15 years. We must avoid going in cycles. Consensus has been achieved in some of the elements of this reform, especially that of the representation of Africa on the basis of the Elzuwini consensus and the Sirte Declaration. It is unreasonable to expect unanimity in this matter. The issue, indeed, is about justice, not unanimity. Without justice, the legitimacy (even efficacy) of our Organization is called to question. We can and must make substantial, irreversible progress on Security Council reform in the current session.\n\nMr. President,\n\n55. Connected to this, is the question of justice, fairness, and equity in respect of the Palestinian people. The situation in the Middle East is long-standing and gives cause for concern. Nigeria encourages Israel and Palestine to re-engage in dialogue based on relevant UN resolutions and Initiatives. The two-state solution has the support of the international community and is widely acknowledged as the path to lasting peace.\n\nMr President,\n\n56. Our organization is at the peak of the multilateral system. It is also the pre-eminent body for solving our current and emerging challenges, and for developing norms that are protective of us all. We need to re-commit to it, rejuvenate it to better serve us. Nigeria re-affirms its faith in the United Nations and is further resolved to continue to work with all Member-States for peace and security, development and the protection of human rights. In the current moment, hope for these, is dependent on how we assist each other to get Covid-19 out of all countries, regardless of their classification. We can and must do so.\n\n57. In this regard, let me close my statement by paying special tribute to a great and humane internationalist, and an exemplary practitioner of multilateral cooperation. I am speaking of Chancellor Angela Merkel of the Federal Republic of Germany. As she exits the stage, we wish her well.\n\n58. I thank you.",

          "text": "\u2026We\u2019ve changed the way we do business \u2013 GMD \u2026It\u2019ll boost investors\u2019 confidence \u2013 SAN \u2026Corporation\u2019s books manipulated \u2013 Obiaraeri \u2018\u2026NNPC still a loss-making entity\u2019 \u2018\u2026The agency showed positive results due to cash infusion\u2019\n\nMany Nigerians could not believe their ears when they heard that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) recorded profit in 2020, as they are yet to come to terms with the figures presented. According to them, over the years, the Corporation seems to have been managed only to record losses; BENJAMIN UMUTEME reports.\n\nThe announcement that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) recorded a N287 billion profit in 2020 jolted Nigerians that felt it was surreal, even as others took the announcement with a pinch of salt preferring to see the full report before they can speak.\n\n\n\nOver the years, Nigerians have seen the state-run Corporate as the epitome of wastefulness as its four refineries have refused to work due largely to corrupt handling of Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) that have been carried out. The implication was that staffers were being paid without doing any work. In the 2018 and 2019 audited reports, the Corporation recorded losses and it was on that basis that many are yet to come to terms with the \u2018profit\u2019 that was recorded. More still, is the fact that in 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic shut down global production thereby making it difficult for the crude oil sale which prices entered negative territories.\n\n\n\nAnnouncing the record profit, the first in 44 years of the Corporation\u2019s existence, President Muhammadu Buhari said the feat became possible through prudent management of resources and the need to maximise value for the Nigerian people from its natural resources.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to announce the declaration of profit after tax of N287 billion in 2020 by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. This is sequel to the completion of the statutory annual audit exercise for year 2020.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe NNPC losses were reduced from N803 billion in 2018 to N1.7 billion in 2019 and the eventual declaration of net profit in 2020 for the first time in its 44-year history.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have further directed the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to timely publish the audited financial statements in line with the requirements of the law and as a follow-up to our commitment to ensuring transparency and accountability by public institutions,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNNPC GMD\u2019s explanations\n\n\n\nThrowing more like on the N287 billion profit recorded by the Corporation, NNPC GMD, Mele Kyari, said the turn-around from a loss position of N803 billion to a profit of N287 billion between 2018 to 2020 is an indication of the aggressive implementation of its cost-cutting measures, automation of business processes, emphasis on commercially-focused investments, and non-interference in the management of the Corporation from any quarters.\n\n\n\nHe said the Corporation saved a lot of cost through contract renegotiation by up to 30% on the heels of the Covid-19 pandemic, introduction of technology that drastically cut travel cost through reduction in in-person meetings and the general automation of processes that enhanced efficiency across the group\u2019s businesses.\n\nKyari said, \u201cWhat we did to arrive at this (N287 billion profit), I think it is a continuous process. Since this administration came into being in 2015, there was a very drastic change in the way we do our business.\n\n\u201cOne is to cut cost, to be more efficient and also to ensure that this company is transparent and accountable to Nigerians and therefore it is a process that started in 2015 on the commencement of the administration of president Muhammadu Buhari who has consistently being the Minister of Petroleum Resources in 2015 till this day and the end result is that, that piloting gave us the opportunity to do things differently.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd because it is a continuous process, when I came on board, I learnt from what was on ground and also brought a new perspective which is to ensure that I build on what I met and to collaborate and steer the direction of the board of directors of this company to ensure that cost is reduced.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe combination of all these is the result we posted. First is the reduction of the losses in 2019. It is a collective activity, collective action, but ultimately the things that we did made it possible.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDoubts persist\n\n\n\nBefore the full audited report was released, a foremost economist and founder of Stanbic-IBTC Bank, Atedo Peterside, insisted that there was no way the NNPC, with the way it is presently run, can make profit. Peterside noted further that the Corporation dipped its fingers into the federation account to announce the N287 billion profits.\n\n\n\nIn a tweet, Peterside wrote, \u201cThere is an allegation that NNPC dipped their fingers in the Federation Cookie Jar in order to announce bumper 2020 profits; they should come clean and publish details of all dividends received by them and tell us which ones they recently diverted from the federation to themselves.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso, the investment banker challenged the Corporation to publish details of all dividends received by it and tell Nigerians which ones it recently \u201cdiverted from the federation.\u201d\n\n\n\nLikewise, Dr. Nnaemeka Obiaraeri, a petroleum sector expert, queried how the Corporation will suddenly move from a loss position of N.7 billion in 2019 to a record profit of N287 billion in 2020?\n\n\n\nFor Obiaraeri, it was all about manipulative balance sheet engineering through consolidation of the corporate actions of independent entities set up by acts of parliament for the benefit of the federation saying it was a \u2018tad too deceitful.\u2019\n\n\n\nAccording to the petroleum expert, the dividends of the NLNG; The West African Gas Pipeline Company (Operated by Chevron); The Nigeria Gas Company (NGC); Duke Oil; NPDC; Bonny Transport Company, and Wheel Insurance were put together and declared as profit by the NNPC.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you add up all of the dividends for the year ended 2019, which was declared, paid and transferred to the NNPC accounts in 2020 on behalf of the federation , you will get in excess of over $2.5bn/N1 trillion (using the CBN official rate),\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nIndustry experts have queried how the Corporation was able to re-value its N713 billion initially assumed to be doubtful receivables from the federation account. They are of the belief that \u201cit\u2019s just a one off thing that won\u2019t happen every year.\u201d There is also a widespread belief that the Corporation manicured its books to arrive at the profit.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts on revenue shortfall\n\n\n\nA closer look at the financial statements revealed that the Corporation\u2019s revenue fell by 19.76 per cent in 2020 to N3.718 trillion from N4.634 trillion declared in 2019. Further highlights of the financial statements revealed that while the Corporation\u2019s group financial position increased in total current assets by 18.7 per cent compared to that of 2019, its total current liabilities increased by 11.4 per cent within the same period.\n\nAccording to the report, the group\u2019s working capital remained below the line at N4.56 trillion in 2020 as against N4.44 trillion in 2019. That is not all!\n\n\u201cAccumulated losses in recent years come to N1.5 trillion for the group and N395 billion for the Corporation,\u201d the Premium Times had indicated in a report.\n\n\n\nAs far as the head of finance at American International School of Lagos, Elochukwu Oguebue, is concerned, despite the media hype, NNPC is still a loss-making entity.\n\n\n\n\u201cOne assumption I can make from the disclosure on the impairment reversal and other notes to the accounts is that the Federal Government must have injected funds into NNPC in 2021. Or what else could have prompted the reversal. To reverse impairment on receivables, the auditors must have seen a document that convinced them that most of that amount is recoverable,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nOthers believe that backing out the N713 billion reversal of impairment and refunds showed that NNPC would have reported another year of loss. Going further into the report, the auditors explained how NNPC had been sustaining recurring losses over the years, culminating in N1.5 trillion as of December 2020.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese events or conditions along with other matters indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubts on the group and Corporation\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern,\u201d PwC, SIAO Partners, and Muhtari Dangana & Co say in a joint statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncreased income\n\n\n\nIt is not really all gloomy as the audited report revealed a 153.95 per cent increase from the NNPC\u2019s Other Incomes from N266 billion in 2019 to N675.7 billion in 2020. The major components of the Other Incomes include a N110.6 billion refund from the federation, N157 billion from sundry incomes (amounts recovered from the federation relating to strategic alliance balances), and a N250 billion from variation in crude stocks, which represents movements in crude inventory, under-lift and over-lift positions.\n\nAs the director of finance and operations at a Washington-based Community Foundation of Snohomish County, Kalu Aja, put it \u201cthe Corporation was able to show positive results due to cash infusion from the federal government.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe cash infusion is more than cash generated from the operations of the Corporation. To be legal and clear, this is correct. The question is should a Corporation that has a negative short-term position post billions in accounting \u2018profits\u2019\u201d?\n\nMore questions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shortfall of the value of the Corporation\u2019s assets over its liabilities is one area of contention, especially as this raises concerns on the going concern of the supposedly most prolific and strategic asset of Nigeria. The experts wondered how a Corporation like NNPC can perennially be loss-making, while companies operating in the sector, with very limited assets and resources, are consistently reporting operating profits, with strong cash flow.\n\n\n\nSpeaking with this reporter, a source who would not want his name in print said to record profit in a pandemic year when the majority of businesses were recording losses is no mean feat. He noted that if the Corporation records profit in 2020 of all years, \u201cit shows that they would have been recording profit in years past which has not been remitted.\u201d\n\n\n\nOther professionals wonder what could have eroded the assets of NNPC beyond its perennial losses, which have always been a subject of enquiry. While it\u2019s a myth yet to be unravelled, analysts wonder how NNPC spends N678 billion on general and administrative expenses, including some N65 billion staff cost of its refinery subsidiary, despite the public knowledge that the refineries are moribund. While some say petrol subsidy has been one of the major factors responsible for NNPC\u2019s poor performance, that argument seems weak given that NNPC usually passes the cost to the federation account.\n\n\n\nPositive devt\n\n\n\nSome experts have, however, commended the Corporation for the courage to make its financial statement public. According to them, the move is a positive development for the extractive industry.\n\n\n\nAn energy law expert, Damilola, Olawuyi (SAN), explained that international law emphasises the need for openness and transparency across all aspects of regulatory enforcement and supervision. NEITI has been particularly active in raising awareness of the need for proactive information disclosure as a tool for enhancing public confidence and eradicating corruption.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe publication of audited financial statements by the NNPC shows that such efforts are paying off and will significantly boost investors\u2019 confidence in the on-going efforts by the federal government to sanitise the extractive industry.\n\n\n\n\u201cReducing secrecy, through the publication of open and transparent data, allows stakeholders to monitor corruption risks across the entire oil and gas value-chain and to make sure they are properly addressed,\u201d Prof. Olawuyi said further.\n\n\n\nAn Abuja-based chartered accountant, Ifeanyi Onuba, in his reaction, expressed surprise that people question the report because they have not been following the Corporation\u2019s publications of its monthly financial and operational reports (MFORs).\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that despite NNPC\u2019s Monthly Financial and Operations Report including the published Audited Financial Statements for 2018 and 2019, Peterside could still claim that the Corporation took funds from the federation account in order to announce a profit of N287 billion,\u201d he said.",
          "summary": "According to them, over the years, the Corporation seems to have been managed only to record losses; BENJAMIN UMUTEME reports.\n\u201cI am pleased to announce the declaration of profit after tax of N287 billion in 2020 by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.\n\u201cThe NNPC losses were reduced from N803 billion in 2018 to N1.7 billion in 2019 and the eventual declaration of net profit in 2020 for the first time in its 44-year history.\nKyari said, \u201cWhat we did to arrive at this (N287 billion profit), I think it is a continuous process.\nPeterside noted further that the Corporation dipped its fingers into the federation account to announce the N287 billion profits.",

Ortom said instead of bringing Nigeria together, the president had succeeded in dividing the country with intimidation and marginalization.\n\nThe governor, who said this yesterday in Enugu when he delivered a lecture at the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria, organized by the NUJ Chapel titled \u2018Emerging Security Situation in the SouthEast: The Place of Good Governance,\u201d noted that Buhari has abused power by not giving equal appointments and recognizing federal character. He said he does not hate Buhari or the Fulani but must speak in the face of marginalisation, intimidation and selective injustice, pointing out that the constitution must be respected. Ortom said for Nigeria to move in the path of unity and oneness, the people of Eastern Nigeria should be provided with adequate infrastructure.\n\n\u201cEastern Nigeria deserves infrastructure and key appointments. Our founding fathers saw a vision of oneness and unity. \u201cThe present administration has instead employed intimidation. I, Ortom, will not keep quiet in the face of marginalisation,\u201d he said, adding that he wants peace anchored on justice to reign. Ortom said whereas former President Goodluck Jonathan never threatened or intimidated anybody, under President Buhari, intimidation of dissenting voices in a democracy has been the order of the day.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari spoke on a long list of critical issues on Friday as he addressed world leaders at the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA76).\n\nHe took to the podium to address the world leaders after President Nicos Anastasiades of Cyprus at the General Debate of the session at the UN Headquarters in New York, the United States.\n\nThe theme for this year\u2019s UNGA is, \u2018Building Resilience Through Hope \u2013 To Recover from COVID-19, Rebuild Sustainably, Respond to the Needs of the Planet, Respect the Rights of People and Revitalise the United Nations\u2019.\n\nIn his speech, President Buhari thanked Nigeria\u2019s partners and friends all over the world for their assistance since the outbreak of COVID-19, saying vaccination was the key to the safe emergence from the pandemic.\n\nAccording to him, the nation fully supports the COVAX initiative from which it has benefitted and is grateful to the United States, Turkey, India, China, European Union, and others for the vaccines provided.\n\nREAD ALSO: President Buhari Addresses World Leaders At UN General Assembly\n\n\u201cDespite the acknowledgement, however, I would like to reiterate my call for a fairer and more equitable distribution of vaccines to all countries so that, together, we can fight and contain the pandemic,\u201d the Nigerian leader said.\n\n\u201cThe rising wave of newer and more contagious strains makes this even more urgent; no country can afford the socio-economic implications of prolonged shutdown. It is imperative to underscore that no one is safe until everyone is safe.\u201d\n\nOn security, he raised concerns over illicit trade, transfer, and circulation of small arms and light weapons.\n\nTheir excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world, the President stated, were already having devastating humanitarian and socio-economic consequences, especially on the continent of Africa.\n\nHe, therefore, called for a worldwide application of the Arms Trade Treaty to codify accountability in conventional arms trade, saying it was critical to the security of nations.\n\nPresident Buhari explained that this was in recognition of the need for a broad-based global partnership in the ongoing battle against transborder crimes, including terrorism and piracy.\n\nHe stressed the need not to only deal with the symptoms of conflict but to tackle the immediate causes that fuel crisis, including poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities.\n\n\u201cThere are no easy solutions to these conditions,\u201d the Nigerian leader told the session. \u201cThey require long term investments and more effective international cooperation.\n\n\u201cIn this connection, my delegation underscores the importance of promoting peaceful, unfettered, and inclusive participation of states in global actions towards conflict prevention. This will facilitate the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063.\u201d\n\nThe President also drew the attention of the world leaders to the forceful takeover of government in some African countries, noting the events in Guinea and Sudan.\n\nHe lamented that such happenings were eroding the democratic gains of past decades, stressing that the recent trend which, sometimes were in reaction to unilateral changes of constitutions by some leaders, must not be tolerated by the international community.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian leader, Nigeria fully supports the efforts by ECOWAS to address the growing challenge and appreciates the support of both the African Union and the United Nations.\n\nHe reiterated that leaders of individual member-states must adhere to the constitutional provisions of their countries, particularly on term limits.\n\nOn the issue of extremism, he said, \u201cTerrorism continues to dominate security discourse worldwide. In Nigeria, Boko Haram terrorist group, though fragmented by internal strife and weakened by our defence forces, is still active and preying on soft targets.\n\n\u201cNigeria will continue to work closely with UN Counter-Terrorism bodies and entities with a view to bringing this scourge to an end, Nigeria has spared no effort in addressing the challenges of terrorism posed by the activities of Boko Haram in North-East Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, as well as banditry in the North-West and North-Central Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Security Forces have recorded considerable success in the fight against terrorism. As a result of the renewed vigour of our military, many terrorist fighters are voluntarily surrendering to our security forces,\u201d he added.\n\nPresident Buhari informed the session that Nigeria intended to build a climate-resilient economy that would effectively align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well as with great potentials to unlocking the full opportunities in different sectors of the economy while protecting the resources for present and future generations.\n\nHe stated that as leaders, there was a need to create inclusive and gender-sensitive policies that would address all issues connected to climate action, from mitigation to resilience.\n\nAccording to the President, Nigeria believes that protecting the planet and its biodiversity and climate are important to the collective survival of the people.\n\nHe explained that this was why the government was working on a transition to a low carbon economy, consistent with achieving the Paris Climate Agreement and the SDGs.\n\nRead his full speech at the session below:\n\nADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY, MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA AT THE GENERAL DEBATE OF THE 76TH SESSION OF UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY Friday, 24TH SEPTEMBER, 2021 NEW YORK, USA\n\nProtocols:\n\nMr. President,\n\nLet me, on behalf of the government and people of Nigeria, congratulate you on your well-deserved election as President of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly. I would like to assure you of the full support and cooperation of the Nigerian delegation throughout your tenure.\n\n2 I would like to commend your predecessor, His Excellency, Mr. Volkan Boskir, for the many remarkable achievements recorded during his tenure, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n3 Permit me to congratulate the Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, on his re-election and commend his strong commitment to making the UN more alive to its responsibilities.\n\n4 I also want to express my gratitude to him for re-appointing Ms. Amina Mohammed, as the Deputy Secretary General to assist him in discharging his heavy responsibilities.\n\nMr. President,\n\n5 The theme of this year\u2019s General Assembly \u2013 \u201cBuilding resilience through hope \u2013 to recover from COVID-19, rebuild sustainably, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of the people, and revitalise the United Nations, sums up our common desire to rescue our planet, recover our economies, and restore hope to all the peoples of the world.\n\n6 In this regard, my delegation will continue to support the United Nations, as the indispensable forum for international cooperation and the cornerstone of the multilateral system, rooted in respect for international law, including international human rights law and predicated on a rules-based order.\n\nMr. President,\n\n7 I want to thank the international community for the concerted response to COVID-19. The solidarity and drive to contain the first truly global health emergency of our time is a pointer to the many things we can achieve if we work together.\n\n8 On our part, Nigeria has made strenuous efforts to contain the virus and halt its deadly onslaught on our people. Our efforts have been rewarded with moderate success.\n\n9 At the outset, we recognised detection and contact tracing to be important tools in combating the virus. In this connection, from a mere four laboratories with testing and detection capacities, we ramped up the facilities to over 140 centres today.\n\n10 Similarly, we built isolation centres and emergency hospitals wards in record time all over the country. We carry out genomic sequencing in designated laboratories across the country with a view to detecting variants in circulation.\n\n11 In addition, over 40,000 health care workers have recently been trained on Infection, Prevention and Control measures with the support of various partners. Through the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control, we have established 16 infectious disease treatment centres located within our Teaching Hospitals and Federal Medical Centres.\n\n12 Nigeria remains grateful for the assistance received from our partners and friends all over the world. Vaccination is the key to our safe emergence from the pandemic. We fully support the COVAX initiative from which we have benefitted. We also thank the United States of America, Turkey, India, China, European Union, and others for the vaccines provided.\n\n13 Despite the acknowledgement however, I would like to reiterate my call for a fairer and more equitable distribution of vaccines to all countries so that, together, we can fight and contain the pandemic. The rising wave of newer and more contagious strains, makes this even more urgent. No country can afford the socio-economic implications of prolonged shutdown. It is imperative to underscore that no one is safe until everyone is safe.\n\nMr President,\n\n14 Nigeria remains deeply concerned over the illicit trade, transfer, and circulation of small arms and light weapons. Their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world are having devastating humanitarian and socio-economic consequences, especially on the continent of Africa.\n\n15 It is on this note that my delegation calls for the world wide application of the Arms Trade Treaty to codify accountability in conventional arms trade, which is critical to the security of nations. This is in recognition of the need for a broad-based global partnership in the on-going battle against trans-border crimes, including terrorism and piracy.\n\nMr. President,\n\n16 We must deal not only with the symptoms of conflict but also the immediate causes that fuel conflicts in the first place. These include poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities.\n\n17 There are no easy solutions to these conditions. They require long term investments and more effective international cooperation. In this connection, my delegation underscores the importance of promoting peaceful, unfettered, and inclusive participation of states in global actions towards conflict prevention. This will facilitate the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063.\n\n18 In West Africa especially, our democratic gains of the past decades are now being eroded. The recent trend of unconstitutional takeover of power, sometimes in reaction to unilateral changes of constitutions by some leaders, must not be tolerated by the international community. Nigeria fully supports the efforts by ECOWAS to address this growing challenge and appreciates the support of both the African Union and the United Nations. In this regard, I would like to reiterate that as leaders of our individual Member-States we need to adhere to the constitutional provisions of our countries, particularly on term limits. This is one area that generates crisis and political tension in our sub-region.\n\nMr President,\n\n19 Nigeria is fully committed to nuclear non-proliferation and has always supported the view that it should involve all States.\n\n20 Disarmament Conventions deserve the support of all states, small, large, nuclear or non-nuclear. Nuclear weapons remain the ultimate agents of mass destruction, and their total elimination should be the final objective of all disarmament processes within the broad spectrum of goals being pursued by the United Nations.\n\n21 In this regard, Nigeria would participate actively in the forthcoming Review Conference of the Nuclear Prohibition Treaty and also the First Meeting of States Parties to the landmark Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, scheduled to take place within the first quarter of 2022.\n\n22 Nigeria regards these upcoming events as important steps towards the realisation of a world free of nuclear weapons. We are, therefore, supportive of any diplomatic efforts in this direction. We hope that the upcoming NPT review conference would lead to a successful outcome that would facilitate the denuclearisation of the world. We would do our part to ensure such an outcome.\n\nMr. President,\n\n23 Terrorism continues to dominate security discourse worldwide. In Nigeria, Boko Haram terrorists group, though fragmented by internal strife and weakened by our defence forces, is still active and preying on soft targets. Nigeria will continue to work closely with UN Counter-Terrorism bodies and entities with a view to bringing this scourge to an end.\n\n24 Nigeria has spared no effort in addressing the challenges of terrorism posed by the activities of Boko Haram in North-East Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, as well as banditry in the North-West and North-Central Nigeria. The Nigerian Security Forces have recorded considerable success in the fight against terrorism. As a result of the renewed vigour of our military, many terrorist fighters are voluntarily surrendering to our security forces.\n\n25 I and three other Nigerian Heads of State served actively as peace keepers and Nigeria continues to support peacekeeping efforts. We know the sacrifice involved, we also know how important peace keeping is for those in vulnerable situations. Nigeria will continue to play its part fully in supporting United Nations peacekeeping operations within Africa and beyond.\n\nMr. President,\n\n26 The impact of climate change is already with us in Nigeria, manifesting in various ways: conflicts trigger; food insecurity, drying up of lakes; loss of livelihood, and youth migration, among others. The trend is the same in many other countries that are threatened by forest fires, rising sea levels, drought and desertification.\n\n27 In the circumstances, we intend to build a climate-resilient economy that effectively aligns with the SDGs and that has great potentials to unlocking the full opportunities in different sectors of the economy, while protecting the resources for present and future generations. I know, in several ways, this is also a familiar story in many countries.\n\n28 As leaders, we must create inclusive and gender-sensitive policies that address all issues connected to climate action, from mitigation to resilience.\n\n29 Nigeria believes that protecting our planet and its biodiversity and climate are important to our collective survival. That is why, we are working on a transition to low carbon economy, consistent with achieving the Paris Climate Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nMr. President,\n\n30 Combating illicit financial flows and ensuring the recovery and return of illicitly acquired assets have the potential to provide resources in the immediate term for financing development in this era of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.\n\n31 Similarly, corruption across national borders has huge negative impact on the stability, peace, and economic prospects of millions, particularly in developing countries.\n\n32 It deprives national Governments of resources needed to provide adequate and meaningful sources of livelihood for their citizens. The latter gives rise to more irregular migration patterns, with unwholesome consequences for inter-state and human relations.\n\n33 I, therefore, call on all leaders to demonstrate the much-needed political will by supporting the recommendations for systemic reforms made by the FACTI Panel.\n\n34 We support establishing modalities for a global coordination mechanism at the United Nations Economic and Social Council to systematically monitor illicit financial flows and strengthen financial integrity for sustainable development, with the participation of all relevant stakeholders.\n\nMr. President,\n\n35 On the issue of debt, we have seen that developing countries have been faced with unsustainable debt burdens even before the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of new wave of deepening debt, where vital public financial resources are allocated to external debt servicing and repayments at the expense of domestic health and financing for critical developmental needs.\n\n36 I must commend the current initiatives by the international financial institutions and the G20 aimed at significantly mitigating the economic situation of the indebted countries and urge for more efforts in this regard.\n\n37 Therefore, there is an urgent need to consider expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to include all Developing, Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States facing fiscal and liquidity challenges. In addition, a review of the eligibility criteria for debt suspension, including outright cancellation, is needed for countries facing the most severe challenges.\n\nMr. President,\n\n38 Nigeria reaffirms that international trade is an engine for development and sustained economic growth, as well as the global eradication of poverty.\n\n39 My delegation would like to reaffirm the critical role that a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system can play in stimulating economic growth and development.\n\n40 Fair and equitable trade would eventually eliminate the need for aid. My country and indeed all African countries do not intend to stay indefinitely looking for aid. All we need is a fair and equitable system of international trade.\n\n41 We, therefore, call for a reform agenda that will engender better recovery from this crisis, build resilience to future shocks and pursue transformative development strategies that can deliver the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nMr. President,\n\n42 The global food system has, in recent times, been impacted by several factors such as population growth, availability and accessibility of arable land and water resources, climate change, and loss of biodiversity.\n\n43 Increased competition for resources such as land, water, and energy, has affected food access and supply, particularly in developing countries. Climate change and unpredictable shocks, such as the current global pandemic, further exacerbate vulnerabilities in the global food system, requiring the UN\u2019s urgent attention.\n\n44 The Government of Nigeria remains determined to improve the productivity and incomes of small-scale farmers by promoting equal access to land, technology and markets, sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices.\n\n45 At the heart of Nigeria\u2019s post-COVID-19 response is the Economic Sustainability Plan, which has a major component, called the Agriculture for Food and Jobs Programme where we seek to leverage suitable technologies to build a resilient food system for the country.\n\n46 An integral part of our food systems\u2019 transformation strategy is to create an enabling and supportive environment to implement these policies in a participatory manner.\n\n47 Global efforts to mitigate and sustain food systems must involve key stakeholders, including Governments, farmers, investors, multilateral organizations, regional bodies, international financial institutions, private partners and civil society organizations.\n\nMr. President,\n\n48 Nigeria has been steadfast in safeguarding human rights, including the advancement of women, the protection of children, the protection of the rights of people living with disabilities, the treatment of migrants, refugees, returnees and displaced persons as well as, the promotion of fundamental freedoms through all legitimate means. In this regard, my delegation commends the positive example of leaders like Prime Minister Jacinda Arden of New Zealand.\n\n49 In this context Nigeria calls for collective global action through a Treaty to end all forms of violence against women and girls of all ages.\n\n50 Nigeria remains unwavering in its commitment to ensuring the advancement of human rights within its shores and beyond. This is so even in the context of a vicious decade-long onslaught by terrorists against Nigerians, quite contrary to unwholesome reports by some who hardly verify what they state against us.\n\n51 The recent rise in hate related crimes globally underscores the urgent need to continue our engagement about racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other related intolerance. It is sad to note that the issue of racism remains alive globally.\n\n52 We are beginning to forget our affirmation of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of every individual as enshrined in the UN Charter. No society can claim to be free or just if it deprives anyone of these rights.\n\n53 Nigeria has long been a principled fighter against racism and all forms of discrimination inspired by its African experience. In the past, racism oiled the machine of slavery and colonialism. Today, racism drives hate crimes and institutional discrimination. In all this, Africans and people of African descent are among the major victims.\n\n54 Cognizant of these, I commend Member States for adopting by consensus the resolution on the Establishment of the Permanent Forum of People of African Descent on 2nd August 2021. I am confident that this forum will make significant impact in the quest to end race-related vices and injustices.\n\nMr. President,\n\n55 No reform of the United Nations system is more urgent than that of the Security Council. Stakeholders around the world are asking how such power could be concentrated, with scant representation. The intergovernmental negotiations have taken too long, some 15 years. We must avoid going in cycles. Consensus has been achieved in some of the elements of this reform, especially that of the representation of Africa on the basis of the Elzuwini consensus and the Sirte Declaration. It is unreasonable to expect unanimity in this matter. The issue, indeed, is about justice, not unanimity. Without justice, the legitimacy (even efficacy) of our Organization is called to question. We can and must make substantial, irreversible progress on Security Council reform in the current session.\n\nMr. President,\n\n56 Connected to this, is the question of justice, fairness, and equity in respect of the Palestinian people. The situation in the Middle East is long-standing and gives cause for concern. Nigeria encourages Israel and Palestine to re-engage in dialogue based on relevant UN resolutions and Initiatives. The two-state solution has the support of the international community and is widely acknowledged as the path to lasting peace.\n\nMr President,\n\n57 Our organization is at the peak of the multilateral system. It is also the pre-eminent body for solving our current and emerging challenges, and for developing norms that are protective of us all. We need to re-commit to it, rejuvenate it to better serve us. Nigeria re-affirms its faith in the United Nations and is further resolved to continue to work with all Member-States for peace and security, development and the protection of human rights. In the current moment, hope for these, is dependent on how we assist each other to get COVID-19 out of all countries, regardless of their classification. We can and must do so.\n\n58 In this regard, let me close my statement by paying special tribute to a great and humane internationalist, and an exemplary practitioner of multilateral cooperation. I am speaking of Chancellor Angela Merkel of the Federal Republic of Germany. As she exits the stage, we wish her well.\n\nI thank you.",

          "text": "The Federal Government has clarified that the debts being taken are not for funding recurrent expenditures but for implementing capital projects which previous administrations failed to carry out.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed stated this in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital on Thursday during a one-day town hall meeting on the power situation in the state.\n\nThe minister\u2019s explanation is coming on the heels of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s plea at the UNGA meeting, for \u201crich nations\u201d and international financial institutions for outright debt cancellation for countries facing the most severe challenges in the wake of the COVID-19\u201d.\n\nThe president\u2019s most recent request for an external loan was sent to the Senate on September 14.\n\nIn his letter transmitted to the Senate, he sought the approval of the lawmakers to borrow $4 billion and \u20ac710 million loans from bilateral and multilateral organisations to fund the deficit in the 2021 budget.\n\nThe National Assembly had approved one earlier in July where the President requested to borrow $8.3 billion and \u20ac490 million loans contained in the initial 2018-2020 borrowing plan.\n\nFurther defending the borrowings, Lai Mohammed said that the Federal Government has implemented a lot of projects in different parts of the country which, according to him, past administrations had used as a conduit pipe to squander public funds.\n\nThe minister argued that infrastructure is the engine of economic growth, hence, the premium it places on building and reconstruction.\n\n\u201cNaysayers have recently ramped up their criticism of the Buhari administration from borrowing. These critics are very insincere; we do not borrow for recurrent expenditure neither do we borrow to pay salaries. We are borrowing to build world-class infrastructures that will benefit generations of Nigerians and we have a lot to show from the loans we have taken.\u201d Mohammed stated.\n\nAccording to him, the Federal Government has over 13,000 kilometers of federal roads under repair, rehabilitation and reconstruction.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a road project in every state today. Today we have started the countdown to when the second Niger bridge which successive administrations have built only on paper will be completed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is an irony that those who are criticizing us today performed very badly in terms of modernizing our infrastructure even when they served at a time when our earnings were multiples of what we get today. Have they embarked on the kind of infrastructure development we are currently engaged in perhaps there would have been no reason for us to borrow as much as we are doing today.\n\n\u201cFor example, in their time they claimed to have spent billions of naira in building infrastructure but as one can see their infrastructure projects are only on the pages of newspapers. Today we are still saddled with looking for resources to build the same infrastructure for which they claimed to have allocated huge resources. We\u2019ll however not be deterred by their antics, we\u2019ll continue to ignore those who have decided to play politics with everything,\u201d Mohammed added.",

I would like to assure you of the full support and cooperation of the Nigerian delegation throughout your tenure.\n\n2 I would like to commend your predecessor, His Excellency, Mr. Volkan Boskir, for the many remarkable achievements recorded during his tenure, despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n3 Permit me to congratulate the Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, on his re-election and commend his strong commitment to making the UN more alive to its responsibilities.\n\n4 I also want to express my gratitude to him for re-appointing Ms. Amina Mohammed, as the Deputy Secretary General to assist him in discharging his heavy responsibilities.\n\nMr. President,\n\n5 The theme of this year\u2019s General Assembly \u2013 \u201cBuilding resilience through hope \u2013 to recover from COVID-19, rebuild sustainably, respond to the needs of the planet, respect the rights of the people, and revitalise the United Nations, sums up our common desire to rescue our planet, recover our economies, and restore hope to all the peoples of the world.\n\n6 In this regard, my delegation will continue to support the United Nations, as the indispensable forum for international cooperation and the cornerstone of the multilateral system, rooted in respect for international law, including international human rights law and predicated on a rules-based order.\n\nMr. President,\n\n7 I want to thank the international community for the concerted response to COVID-19. The solidarity and drive to contain the first truly global health emergency of our time is a pointer to the many things we can achieve if we work together.\n\n8 On our part, Nigeria has made strenuous efforts to contain the virus and halt its deadly onslaught on our people. Our efforts have been rewarded with moderate success.\n\n9 At the outset, we recognised detection and contact tracing to be important tools in combating the virus. In this connection, from a mere four laboratories with testing and detection capacities, we ramped up the facilities to over 140 centres today.\n\n10 Similarly, we built isolation centres and emergency hospitals wards in record time all over the country. We carry out genomic sequencing in designated laboratories across the country with a view to detecting variants in circulation.\n\n11 In addition, over 40,000 health care workers have recently been trained on Infection, Prevention and Control measures with the support of various partners. Through the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control, we have established 16 infectious disease treatment centres located within our Teaching Hospitals and Federal Medical Centres.\n\n12 Nigeria remains grateful for the assistance received from our partners and friends all over the world. Vaccination is the key to our safe emergence from the pandemic. We fully support the COVAX initiative from which we have benefitted. We also thank the United States of America, Turkey, India, China, European Union, and others for the vaccines provided.\n\n13 Despite the acknowledgement however, I would like to reiterate my call for a fairer and more equitable distribution of vaccines to all countries so that, together, we can fight and contain the pandemic. The rising wave of newer and more contagious strains, makes this even more urgent. No country can afford the socio-economic implications of prolonged shutdown. It is imperative to underscore that no one is safe until everyone is safe.\n\nMr President,\n\n14 Nigeria remains deeply concerned over the illicit trade, transfer, and circulation of small arms and light weapons. Their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world are having devastating humanitarian and socio-economic consequences, especially on the continent of Africa.\n\n15 It is on this note that my delegation calls for the world wide application of the Arms Trade Treaty to codify accountability in conventional arms trade, which is critical to the security of nations. This is in recognition of the need for a broad-based global partnership in the on-going battle against trans-border crimes, including terrorism and piracy.\n\nMr. President,\n\n16 We must deal not only with the symptoms of conflict but also the immediate causes that fuel conflicts in the first place. These include poor and undemocratic governance, human rights abuses, poverty, ignorance, injustice and inequalities.\n\n17 There are no easy solutions to these conditions. They require long term investments and more effective international cooperation. In this connection, my delegation underscores the importance of promoting peaceful, unfettered, and inclusive participation of states in global actions towards conflict prevention. This will facilitate the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the African Union Agenda 2063.\n\n18 In West Africa especially, our democratic gains of the past decades are now being eroded. The recent trend of unconstitutional takeover of power, sometimes in reaction to unilateral changes of constitutions by some leaders, must not be tolerated by the international community. Nigeria fully supports the efforts by ECOWAS to address this growing challenge and appreciates the support of both the African Union and the United Nations. In this regard, I would like to reiterate that as leaders of our individual Member-States we need to adhere to the constitutional provisions of our countries, particularly on term limits. This is one area that generates crisis and political tension in our sub-region.\n\nMr President,\n\n19 Nigeria is fully committed to nuclear non-proliferation and has always supported the view that it should involve all States.\n\n20 Disarmament Conventions deserve the support of all states, small, large, nuclear or non-nuclear. Nuclear weapons remain the ultimate agents of mass destruction, and their total elimination should be the final objective of all disarmament processes within the broad spectrum of goals being pursued by the United Nations.\n\n21 In this regard, Nigeria would participate actively in the forthcoming Review Conference of the Nuclear Prohibition Treaty and also the First Meeting of States Parties to the landmark Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, scheduled to take place within the first quarter of 2022.\n\n22 Nigeria regards these upcoming events as important steps towards the realisation of a world free of nuclear weapons. We are, therefore, supportive of any diplomatic efforts in this direction. We hope that the upcoming NPT review conference would lead to a successful outcome that would facilitate the denuclearisation of the world. We would do our part to ensure such an outcome.\n\nMr. President,\n\n23 Terrorism continues to dominate security discourse worldwide. In Nigeria, Boko Haram terrorists group, though fragmented by internal strife and weakened by our defence forces, is still active and preying on soft targets. Nigeria will continue to work closely with UN Counter-Terrorism bodies and entities with a view to bringing this scourge to an end.\n\n24 Nigeria has spared no effort in addressing the challenges of terrorism posed by the activities of Boko Haram in North-East Nigeria and the Lake Chad region, as well as banditry in the North-West and North-Central Nigeria. The Nigerian Security Forces have recorded considerable success in the fight against terrorism. As a result of the renewed vigour of our military, many terrorist fighters are voluntarily surrendering to our security forces.\n\n25 I and three other Nigerian Heads of State served actively as peace keepers and Nigeria continues to support peacekeeping efforts. We know the sacrifice involved, we also know how important peace keeping is for those in vulnerable situations. Nigeria will continue to play its part fully in supporting United Nations peacekeeping operations within Africa and beyond.\n\nMr. President,\n\n26 The impact of climate change is already with us in Nigeria, manifesting in various ways: conflicts trigger; food insecurity, drying up of lakes; loss of livelihood, and youth migration, among others. The trend is the same in many other countries that are threatened by forest fires, rising sea levels, drought and desertification.\n\n27 In the circumstances, we intend to build a climate-resilient economy that effectively aligns with the SDGs and that has great potentials to unlocking the full opportunities in different sectors of the economy, while protecting the resources for present and future generations. I know, in several ways, this is also a familiar story in many countries.\n\n28 As leaders, we must create inclusive and gender-sensitive policies that address all issues connected to climate action, from mitigation to resilience.\n\n29 Nigeria believes that protecting our planet and its biodiversity and climate are important to our collective survival. That is why, we are working on a transition to low carbon economy, consistent with achieving the Paris Climate Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nMr. President,\n\n30 Combating illicit financial flows and ensuring the recovery and return of illicitly acquired assets have the potential to provide resources in the immediate term for financing development in this era of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.\n\n31 Similarly, corruption across national borders has huge negative impact on the stability, peace, and economic prospects of millions, particularly in developing countries.\n\n32 It deprives national Governments of resources needed to provide adequate and meaningful sources of livelihood for their citizens. The latter gives rise to more irregular migration patterns, with unwholesome consequences for inter-state and human relations.\n\n33 I, therefore, call on all leaders to demonstrate the much-needed political will by supporting the recommendations for systemic reforms made by the FACTI Panel.\n\n34 We support establishing modalities for a global coordination mechanism at the United Nations Economic and Social Council to systematically monitor illicit financial flows and strengthen financial integrity for sustainable development, with the participation of all relevant stakeholders.\n\nMr. President,\n\n35 On the issue of debt, we have seen that developing countries have been faced with unsustainable debt burdens even before the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of new wave of deepening debt, where vital public financial resources are allocated to external debt servicing and repayments at the expense of domestic health and financing for critical developmental needs.\n\n36 I must commend the current initiatives by the international financial institutions and the G20 aimed at significantly mitigating the economic situation of the indebted countries and urge for more efforts in this regard.\n\n37 Therefore, there is an urgent need to consider expansion and extension of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative to include all Developing, Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States facing fiscal and liquidity challenges. In addition, a review of the eligibility criteria for debt suspension, including outright cancellation, is needed for countries facing the most severe challenges.\n\nMr. President,\n\n38 Nigeria reaffirms that international trade is an engine for development and sustained economic growth, as well as the global eradication of poverty.\n\n39 My delegation would like to reaffirm the critical role that a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system can play in stimulating economic growth and development.\n\n40 Fair and equitable trade would eventually eliminate the need for aid. My country and indeed all African countries do not intend to stay indefinitely looking for aid. All we need is a fair and equitable system of international trade.\n\n41 We, therefore, call for a reform agenda that will engender better recovery from this crisis, build resilience to future shocks and pursue transformative development strategies that can deliver the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nMr. President,\n\n42 The global food system has, in recent times, been impacted by several factors such as population growth, availability and accessibility of arable land and water resources, climate change, and loss of biodiversity.\n\n43 Increased competition for resources such as land, water, and energy, has affected food access and supply, particularly in developing countries. Climate change and unpredictable shocks, such as the current global pandemic, further exacerbate vulnerabilities in the global food system, requiring the UN\u2019s urgent attention.\n\n44 The Government of Nigeria remains determined to improve the productivity and incomes of small-scale farmers by promoting equal access to land, technology and markets, sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices.\n\n45 At the heart of Nigeria\u2019s post-COVID-19 response is the Economic Sustainability Plan, which has a major component, called the Agriculture for Food and Jobs Programme where we seek to leverage suitable technologies to build a resilient food system for the country.\n\n46 An integral part of our food systems\u2019 transformation strategy is to create an enabling and supportive environment to implement these policies in a participatory manner.\n\n47 Global efforts to mitigate and sustain food systems must involve key stakeholders, including Governments, farmers, investors, multilateral organizations, regional bodies, international financial institutions, private partners and civil society organizations.\n\nMr. President,\n\n48 Nigeria has been steadfast in safeguarding human rights, including the advancement of women, the protection of children, the protection of the rights of people living with disabilities, the treatment of migrants, refugees, returnees and displaced persons as well as, the promotion of fundamental freedoms through all legitimate means. In this regard, my delegation commends the positive example of leaders like Prime Minister Jacinda Arden of New Zealand.\n\n49 In this context Nigeria calls for collective global action through a Treaty to end all forms of violence against women and girls of all ages.\n\n50 Nigeria remains unwavering in its commitment to ensuring the advancement of human rights within its shores and beyond. This is so even in the context of a vicious decade-long onslaught by terrorists against Nigerians, quite contrary to unwholesome reports by some who hardly verify what they state against us.\n\n51 The recent rise in hate related crimes globally underscores the urgent need to continue our engagement about racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other related intolerance. It is sad to note that the issue of racism remains alive globally.\n\n52 We are beginning to forget our affirmation of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of every individual as enshrined in the UN Charter. No society can claim to be free or just if it deprives anyone of these rights.\n\n53 Nigeria has long been a principled fighter against racism and all forms of discrimination inspired by its African experience. In the past, racism oiled the machine of slavery and colonialism. Today, racism drives hate crimes and institutional discrimination. In all this, Africans and people of African descent are among the major victims.\n\n54 Cognizant of these, I commend Member States for adopting by consensus the resolution on the Establishment of the Permanent Forum of People of African Descent on 2nd August 2021. I am confident that this forum will make significant impact in the quest to end race-related vices and injustices.\n\nMr. President,\n\n55 No reform of the United Nations system is more urgent than that of the Security Council. Stakeholders around the world are asking how such power could be concentrated, with scant representation. The intergovernmental negotiations have taken too long, some 15 years. We must avoid going in cycles. Consensus has been achieved in some of the elements of this reform, especially that of the representation of Africa on the basis of the Elzuwini consensus and the Sirte Declaration. It is unreasonable to expect unanimity in this matter. The issue, indeed, is about justice, not unanimity. Without justice, the legitimacy (even efficacy) of our Organization is called to question. We can and must make substantial, irreversible progress on Security Council reform in the current session.\n\nMr. President,\n\n56 Connected to this, is the question of justice, fairness, and equity in respect of the Palestinian people. The situation in the Middle East is long-standing and gives cause for concern. Nigeria encourages Israel and Palestine to re-engage in dialogue based on relevant UN resolutions and Initiatives. The two-state solution has the support of the international community and is widely acknowledged as the path to lasting peace.\n\nMr President,\n\n57 Our organization is at the peak of the multilateral system. It is also the pre-eminent body for solving our current and emerging challenges, and for developing norms that are protective of us all. We need to re-commit to it, rejuvenate it to better serve us. Nigeria re-affirms its faith in the United Nations and is further resolved to continue to work with all Member-States for peace and security, development and the protection of human rights. In the current moment, hope for these, is dependent on how we assist each other to get COVID-19 out of all countries, regardless of their classification. We can and must do so.\n\n58 In this regard, let me close my statement by paying special tribute to a great and humane internationalist, and an exemplary practitioner of multilateral cooperation. I am speaking of Chancellor Angela Merkel of the Federal Republic of Germany. As she exits the stage, we wish her well.\n\nI thank you.",

          "text": "As the setting sun turns the Arghandab river violet, seven young Taliban turn in a circle on the bank, singing and dancing in traditional Afghan style.\n\nThe scene would have been unimaginable 20 years ago, when the hardline Islamist group were first in power and banned music outright.\n\nAnd just months ago the riverbed was the site of bloody clashes between the Taliban and government forces \u2014 the concrete bridge the men are dancing under is cleft in two, destroyed in fighting.\n\nBut now a chorus rises from the rocky bank, as they move from side to side, clapping their hands and chanting the lyrics of a patriotic Afghan song: \u201cSend me a hello from Kabul\u2026 I miss you very much.\u201d\n\nWhen the Taliban ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, all entertainment, including singing and dancing, was forbidden.\n\nBut these younger Taliban do listen to music \u2014 even if most of it is religious.\n\nSince the group\u2019s return to power in mid-August, even its leaders seem to have relaxed slightly on the topic \u2014 at least in larger cities, where people are not being punished for listening to music.\n\nThe young Taliban under the bridge have come here to relax before they head back to Kandahar, the group\u2019s spiritual birthplace, just 10 kilometres (six miles) away.\n\nAlthough the origin of their song is unclear, it celebrates national unity in a country riven with ethnic and tribal divisions.\n\n\u201cThis song belongs to us, it belongs to our country,\u201d says Hafiz Mudasir, a dancer in his twenties.\n\nREAD ALSO: Taliban Say Girls To Return To School \u2018Soon As Possible\u2019\n\n\u2018We Had a Plan\u2019\n\nLike his companions, he is tall, thin and bearded \u2014 and still full of excitement at his group\u2019s victory after two decades of fighting the US-led occupation and the former government.\n\n\u201cTwenty years ago, American troops arrived, but we had a plan,\u201d he says.\n\nTaliban fighters took Kabul on August 15 following a lightning offensive launched in May as the United States and NATO began their final withdrawal.\n\nThey have promised a more moderate brand of rule this time \u2014 though they have made clear that they will run Afghanistan within the restrictive limits of their interpretation of sharia law.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing anything bad. It\u2019s our enemies who are spreading rumours, saying we\u2019re killing people,\u201d says Hafiz.\n\nBut many in Afghanistan are distrustful and fear a return to the harsh rule of the 1990s.\n\n\u2018The Price You Pay\u2019\n\nAs the sun vanishes below the horizon, the dancers are joined by 20 or so other Taliban members.\n\nThey spread out rugs on the pebbles of the riverbank and begin to pray in the fading light.\n\nBread and melons await them when they are finished.\n\nAs evening falls, a line of vehicles passes by the foot of the bridge, splashing across the riverbed to get to the other bank.\n\nThey used to be able to use the bridge, until last December, when the Taliban, looking to isolate Kandahar, detonated a vehicle stuffed full of explosives on it.\n\nThe bridge collapsed in the middle, leaving a 10-metre-wide hole with government forces on one side, and the Taliban on the other.\n\nA police station on the Taliban side came under attack by the militants, who sent suicide bombers to kill the policemen trapped there.\n\nBut that attack \u2014 like many others that saw civilians killed \u2014 does not appear to stir Hafiz\u2019s conscience.\n\nHe tells AFP such violence is the price the Taliban pay to \u201cspread Islam in the region\u201d.\n\nAnd if an innocent is killed, \u201che can thank God, because it\u2019s good to die a martyr\u201d.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "The influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un says they are willing to resume talks with the South if it ends its \u201chostile policies\u201d.\n\nKim Yo-jong was responding to a renewed call from the South to officially declare an end to the Korean War.\n\nThe conflict, which split the peninsula into two, ended in 1953 with an armistice and not a peace treaty.\n\nThe two countries have technically been at war ever since, and locked in a sometimes tense relationship.\n\nThis week, South Korean president Moon Jae-in called for the two Koreas and their allies \u2013 the US which backs the South, and China which is the North\u2019s biggest economic partner \u2013 to declare a formal end to the conflict and bring peace to the peninsula.\n\nThe idea was initially dismissed by a top North Korean minister as \u201cpremature\u201d.\n\nBut in an unexpected statement released on Friday through state media, Ms Kim said the idea was \u201cadmirable\u201d.\n\nHowever she added that the North would only be willing to discuss the proposal if the South stopped what she called \u201chostile policies\u201d towards them.\n\n\u201cWhat needs to be dropped is the double-dealing attitudes, illogical prejudice, bad habits and hostile stand of justifying their own acts while faulting our just exercise of the right to self-defence,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOnly when such a precondition is met, would it be possible to sit face to face and declare the significant termination of war.\u201d\n\nI remember on the day that Kim Jong-un and Moon Jae-in first met, I said that when it comes to inter-Korean relations, hope can be a difficult thing to manage.\n\nThe prospect of ending a more than 70-year war on the Korean peninsula has been the hope of this administration in Seoul for nearly 5 years.\n\nBut President Moon is running out of time. His successor will be elected in March.\n\nHe took a gamble on meeting Kim Jong-un and holding his hand on the sacred summit of Mount Paektu. But since then, relations between the two Koreas have soured.\n\nNorth Korea even blew up an office which was purpose built to house talks between the two sides. It looked like all hope of peace talks were over.\n\nBut here we are, another small sliver of hope breaking through in the form of a statement from Kim Yo-jong.\n\nNote all the caveats and pre-conditions. There are a lot of \u201cifs\u201d and \u201cbuts\u201d in there.\n\nSo, does she mean it? Kim Yo-jong doesn\u2019t say things lightly. But she\u2019s also batting everything back to Seoul.\n\nIt might as well say: \u201cTalks will only follow if you behave in a way we deem worthy\u201d.\n\nAnd who knows when that may be.\n\nSouth Korea earlier this month tested its first submarine-launched ballistic missile, just hours after the North tested their own weapon.\n\nNorth Korea has also often criticised South Korea\u2019s annual military drills with the US.\n\nRelations between the two countries have not improved much since denuclearisation talks between Mr Kim and US president Donald Trump soured in 2019.\n\nMr Moon, who has made engagement with the North a cornerstone of his presidency, has previously argued that a declaration to end the war would encourage the North to denuclearise.\n\nNorth Korea in turn has called for crippling economic sanctions to be lifted first.\n\nBut the US has repeatedly said that North Korea must abandon its nuclear weapons first before any sanctions can be lifted.",

          "text": "Exiled Catalan separatist leader Carles Puigdemont has been detained in Italy on a Spanish arrest warrant.\n\nSpain has accused him of sedition for a breakaway independence referendum in 2017 that the courts ruled illegal.\n\nAt the time he was president of Catalonia but fled to Belgium after the vote. He lives there and sits as a member of the European Parliament.\n\nPolice were apparently waiting for him at Sardinia\u2019s Alghero airport and he is due in court in the coming hours.\n\nMr Puigdemont had travelled to the Mediterranean island for a Catalan folklore festival, his lawyer said.\n\nA judge in Sardinia will have to decide whether he should be released or extradited.\n\nThe 2017 referendum prompted Spain\u2019s deepest political crisis for decades, with the Catalan regional parliament declaring independence, and Madrid then imposing direct rule over the region.\n\nAfter Mr Puigdemont and two ministerial colleagues fled, Spain jailed nine other Catalan leaders for sedition for their role in the breakaway vote. They were pardoned by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez in June.\n\nMadrid failed in its court bid to extradite Mr Puigdemont and two ministerial colleagues and they were later elected to the European Parliament in 2019.\n\nAs MEP the Catalan ex-leader initially had immunity from prosecution but the Parliament voted to strip him of that last March. He appealed against the decision but in an initial ruling at the end of July the EU\u2019s general court said there was no immediate risk of arrest.\n\nThere are at least two question facing the Italian judiciary: the validity of the Spanish extradition request, and the powers of Italian judges when the case is yet to receive a ruling by the EU\u2019s top court.\n\nSpanish authorities say the European arrest warrant was \u201cnever deactivated\u201d. And Mr Puigdemont\u2019s lawyers say that no court within the EU can execute a European arrest warrant until a final ruling has been made.\n\nCatalonia\u2019s new president Pere Aragones \u2013 also a separatist \u2013 condemned what he called the \u201cpersecution\u201d of Mr Puigdemont.\n\nMr Puigdemont\u2019s arrest is uncomfortable for the Spanish government, says the BBC\u2019s Guy Hedgecoe in Madrid. The left-wing coalition in Madrid had just started engaging in talks with the Catalan government in an attempt to calm tensions and find a long-term solution to the crisis.\n\nThe Spanish government said in a statement: \u201cThe arrest of Mr Puigdemont corresponds to an ongoing judicial procedure that applies to any EU citizen who has to answer to the courts.\u201d\n\nHe should \u201csubmit to the action of justice like any other citizen\u201d, it added.\n\nCatalonia is one of Spain\u2019s richest, most distinctive regions and has enjoyed a high degree of autonomy. But many Catalans feel they pay more to Madrid than they get back, and there are historical grievances too, in particular Catalonia\u2019s treatment under the dictatorship of General Franco.",

Country after country acknowledged the wide disparity in accessing the vaccine, painting a picture so bleak that a solution has at times seemed impossibly out of reach.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s President Cyril Ramaphosa on Thursday pointed to vaccines as \u201cthe greatest defence that humanity has against the ravages of this pandemic\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, a great concern that the global community has not sustained the principles of solidarity and cooperation in securing equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is an indictment on humanity that more than 82 percent of the world\u2019s vaccine doses have been acquired by wealthy countries, while less than 1 percent has gone to low-income countries.\u201d\n\nHe and others urged UN member states to support a proposal to temporarily waive certain intellectual property rights established by the World Trade Organization (WTO) to allow more countries, particularly low- and middle-income countries, to produce COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nFor his part, Namibian President Hage Geingob slammed what he called \u201cvaccine apartheid\u201d, saying it was a pity that while people in some countries were at the stage of receiving booster jabs, people in other countries had yet to receive their first dose.\n\nThe United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Israel are among the countries that have begun administering boosters or announced plans to do so.\n\nAngola\u2019s President Joao Lourenco, meanwhile, said it was \u201cshocking to see the disparity between some nations and others with respect to availability of vaccines\u201d.\n\n\u201cThese disparities allow for third doses to be given, in some cases, while, in other cases, as in Africa, the vast majority of the population has not even received the first dose,\u201d Louren\u00e7o said.\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s President Emmerson Mnangagwa called on the international community to exercise \u201cenhanced multilateralism and a unity of purpose\u2019 in vaccine distribution.\n\n\u201cThe hording and inequitable distribution with the resultant uneven vaccination patterns across the globe is not acceptable,\u201d he said in a pre-recorded address.\n\n\u201cVaccine nationalism is self-defeating and contrary to the mantra that no one is safe until everyone is safe,\u201d added Mnangagwa.\n\nBenido Impouma, a programme director with the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) Africa programme, noted during a weekly video news conference that the surge in new COVID-19 cases is starting to ease in Africa \u201cbut with 108,000 new cases, more than 3,000 lives lost in the past week and 16 countries still in resurgence, this fight is far from over.\u201d\n\n\u201cFresh increases in cases should be expected in the coming months,\u201d Impouma said. \u201cWithout widespread vaccination and other public and social measures, the continent\u2019s fourth wave is likely to be the worst, the most brutal yet.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, during a global vaccination summit convened virtually on the sidelines of the General Assembly, President Joe Biden announced that the US would double to one billion doses its purchase of Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 shots to share with the world, with the goal of vaccinating 70 percent of the global population within the next year.\n\nThe WHO has said only 15 percent of promised donations of vaccines \u2013 from rich countries that have access to large quantities of them \u2013 have been delivered.\n\nThe UN health agency has said it wants countries to fulfil their dose-sharing pledges \u201cimmediately\u201d and make shots available for programmes that benefit poor countries and Africa, in particular.\n\nBiden, earlier this year, broke with European allies to embrace waivers to intellectual property rights for the vaccines, but there was no movement on Wednesday towards the necessary global consensus on the issue required under WTO rules.\n\nWhile some non-governmental organisations have called those waivers vital to boosting global production of the shots, US officials concede it is not the most constricting factor in the inequitable vaccine distribution \u2013 and some have worried the waivers would mean little without the necessary production infrastructure to make the highly complex jabs.",
