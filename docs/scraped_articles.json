          "title": "Bandits/herdsmen farm occupation: Insecurity grounds CBN borrowers, farmers say loan repayment difficult",
          "text": "I was kidnapped for a month, my crop destroyed, I don\u2019t know how to pay CBN loan \u2013 Farmer\n\nWe can\u2019t support farmers with uninsured ABP loans, says Federal Ministry of Agriculture\n\nThere are indications that the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme is heading for the rocks as bandits are forcing farmers, who took the ABP loans, to abandon their farms.\n\nFarmers in Zamfara, Kebbi, Sokoto, Ekiti and Ebonyi states, in separate interviews with The PUNCH on Monday, said repaying the loans would be tough because bandits had taken over their farms and destroyed crops.\n\nRecall that the CBN had in 2015 launched the ABP in line with its developmental function. The programme is aimed at creating a linkage between anchor companies involved in processing and small holder farmers of agricultural commodities.\n\nAccording to the CBN, the thrust of the ABP is provision of farm inputs in kind and cash to small holder farmers to boost production of the commodities, stabilise inputs supply to agro-processors and address the country\u2019s negative balance of payments on food.\n\nAt harvest, the farmers supply their produce to agro-processors who pay the cash equivalent to the farmers\u2019 accounts.\n\nThe CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, at the launch of the 2021 wet season input distribution in the South-West in Ado Ekiti last month, said a total of 3,107,890 farmers had been financed for the cultivation of 3,801,397 hectares of land across 21 commodities through 23 participating financial institutions.\n\nHe also stated that the sustainability of the programme depended on repayment of loans by farmers.\n\nBut farmers, who collected the loans told The PUNCH on Monday that with bandits sending them away from their farms, they would not be able to repay the ABP loans.\n\nI took N1.3m loan, bandits destroyed my farm, I couldn\u2019t harvest a bag of rice \u2013 Zamfara farmer\n\nOne of the farmers in Zamfara State, Alhaji Nuhu Dansadau, in an interview with one of our correspondents, said he collected N1.3m ABP loan.\n\nDansadau, whose farm is in Yargaladima village in the Maru Local Government Area, lamented that he was not able to harvest even a bag of rice because the bandits destroyed his crop.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe bandits destroyed all my crop very close to harvesting period. They put their cattle in my rice farm and everything was destroyed.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the bandits also threatened to kill him if he returned to the farm. He said, \u201cWhen they destroyed my farm, they also told me not to come to the farm again.\u201d\n\nI was kidnapped for a month, my crop destroyed, I don\u2019t know how to pay CBN loan \u2013 Farmer\n\nAnother farmer, Mallam Umar Yusuf, who took a N600,000 loan, told The PUNCH that he was kidnapped by the bandits and detained for over a month.\n\nHe maintained that after he paid ransom, he was released and when he returned to his farm, he discovered that the crops he planted had been destroyed by the bandits.\n\nYusuf stated, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to pay the CBN loan because I didn\u2019t harvest anything.\n\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t wait to harvest rice and soya beans in my farm at Bardoki village in the Gummi Local Government Area because of persistent bandits\u2019 attacks.\u201d\n\nA farmer in Jangeme village in the Gusau Local Government Area, Aminu Sarki, said he fled his village following persistent attacks by bandits.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI obtained the CBN loan and I planted rice and soya beans but I was unable to wait for the harvest because of the fear of bandits\u2019 attacks.\u201d\n\nSarki added that his village was deserted, adding that it would not be easy for farmers to go to their farms.\n\nInsurance only covers flood, fire, excludes cattle menace \u2013 Chairman, Ekiti farmers\n\nIn Ekiti State, farmers said insecurity had kept many of them away from their farms, making the repayment of the CBN loans difficult.\n\nThey lamented the destruction of farms by herdsmen\u2019s cattle among other security challenges.\n\nAccording to them, the fact that the insurance for the CBN ABP does not cover cattle menace has compounded their problems.\n\nThe state Chairman of the All Farmers\u2019 Association of Nigeria, Adebola Alagbada, said, \u201cGoing to farm is a serious problem. You face the challenge of being kidnapped by the bandits.\n\n\u201cAgain, the challenges of herdsmen to farmers are enormous. That is why there is no food; no garri, cassava and maize in town. It is a serious challenge and repayment of bank loans becomes a burden to the farmers. Apart from bank loans, farmers get funds from thrift societies, which is more terrible. Farmers are in serious problem now. In my farm, I battle Fulani herdsmen on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nAlagbada, who lamented that that a major obstacle was the limited coverage of the available insurance, said, \u201cWe want insurance to cover cattle menace. As it obtains now, it is not packaged into the insurance scheme. The insurance covers just flood and fire. It does not cover herders\u2019 attack which is the problem that we have in the farms.\u201d\n\nIt won\u2019t be easy to pay back ABP loan \u2013 Ekiti maize farmers\n\nAlso, the state Chairman of the Maize Growers Processing Marketer Association of Nigeria, John Omoyajowo, whose members lost multi-million naira worth ready-to-harvest maize on over 60 hectares of land to cattle invasion early in the year, said, \u201cWe have not been able to get out of it. That is our problem. The farmers cannot go to farm again.\n\n\u201cIt would not be easy to pay back the ABP loans. When we were at a meeting in Abuja on Friday, they were clamouring that we should pay back and they were not even advancing us any form of money.\n\n\u201cWe have inputs, but we need money to mechanise and that is our problem. We didn\u2019t complete the input we were given last year. We need money to mechanise and then people will plant, we still have herbicide, fertilizers and seed.\n\nWe are being asked to repay, but insurance doesn\u2019t cover cattle menace \u2013 Maize farmers\n\n\u201cThere is nothing we can do about it. It is unfortunate the insurance we have does not cover cattle menace. When our farms were destroyed, they were referring us to insurance when they knew that cattle menace is not insured in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlso, the state Chairman of the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria, Kolawole Rotimi, who lamented that herdsmen attacks had dealt \u201cdeadly blows\u201d on farmers and crops production, said, \u201cUp till now, most of the laws that our governors have been trying to put in place, anti-grazing or whatever, have not really been implemented.\n\n\u201cThere are still attacks on our farms which have made some people abandon their farms. In some areas, the farmers say they are not going back to the farms. With all these, no insurance. The insurance package that we are using does not cover herdsmen attacks.\n\n\u2018If we don\u2019t pay ABP loan, CBN will not give us another\u2019\n\n\u201cFarmers are having difficult times to pay back the ABP loan and invariably, if we are not able to pay the loans, the CBN will not be happy to give us more. It will affect us too, it may turn to a bad debt. It is a development finance loan and the CBN has our reports. We write reports on what we are passing through. I don\u2019t know how the Federal Government is going to assist us,\u201d he said.\n\nRich farmers are now taking refuge in IDP camps \u2013 Sokoto rice grower\n\nIn Sokoto State, an elderly farmer, Alhaji Sani Aliyu, in an interview with The PUNCH, said, \u201cMore worrisome is that major rice producing local government areas in Sokoto State are under the threat of banditry.\n\n\u201cWe cannot go to farm. So, tell me, how can we meet any target? The loss cannot be quantified in that people who were rich rice farmers before are now taking refuge in IDP camps. Some have fled to safe haven in Niger Republic.\u201d\n\nA rice farmer in Kebbi State, Babangida Garba, lamented that the attacks came after floods washed away many rice farms last year in the state.\n\nA 49-year-old Ibiam Uchenna-Ogbuewu, an indigene of Ebunwana Edda community in the Afikpo South Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, said fear of herdsmen attacks had discouraged him from accessing his farms.\n\nUchenna-Ogbuewu, a beneficiary of the ABP loan, who hitherto owned three hectares of rice farm in Oso Edda community, said, \u201cIt all started around November 2019 as I was preparing to harvest rice from my farm in the Oso Edda community, when I noticed that herdsmen had destroyed about two out of the three hectares the night before.\n\n\u201cOn getting to the farm that morning, I discovered that herdsmen had entered the farm the previous night and their cows had trampled on the rice. For some minutes, I wept and asked them why they did that kind of thing, because they were still on the farm and were very relaxed. One of them said I better shut up or they would beat me up. As I was talking to the other, another one was already bringing out his knife to attack me.\u201d\n\nThe Youth Chairman of Afikpo North LGA, Mr Oko Emmanuel, said herders\u2019 attack had hindered him from going to farm.\n\nEmmanuel said the situation had gone very bad and called on the government to expedite action to arrest the ugly trend.\n\nThe youth leader said, \u201cIt\u2019s a national issue that has assumed a disturbing dimension. I am not a farmer, but my mentor is and I know the level of havoc the herdsmen\u2019s cattle are wreaking on people\u2019s farms. This is what led to the protest embarked upon by the Afikpo women last week. I no longer go to farm.\u201d\n\nThe CBN declined to comment on the impacts of the growing insecurity in certain parts of the country on their Anchor Borrowers\u2019 Programme.\n\nWhen asked how the security challenges in these states were affecting the effectiveness of the initiative, a member of the CBN Communication\u2019s unit, Isa Abdul, told one of our correspondents that such questions should be directed to security officials in the affected states.\n\nHe added that the function of the CBN as regards to the programme was to disburse funds to the farmers.\n\nWe can\u2019t support farmers with uninsured ABP loans \u2013 FMARD\n\nWhen asked if the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development would support farmers who could not repay the loans because of bandits\u2019 attacks, the Director of Information in the ministry Theodore Ogaziechi, replied in the negative.\n\nHe stated that the ministry would perhaps come into the matter if the affected farmer had insurance cover with the Nigeria Agricultural Insurance Corporation.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhatever is not budgeted for is absolutely difficult to take care of. This is something different entirely. They went and picked up a loan and are you expecting the agric ministry to come and repay the loans?\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t take the loans on behalf of the ministry. However, if they were insured with NAIC, perhaps that is when insurance under the Federal Ministry of Agriculture would have taken care of their losses.\u201d ,,Copyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\u2026advices party leaders to divest power to youths to sustain legacies\n\nPresident of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has said that the All Progressives Congress (APC) may face challenges after the exit of President Muhammadu Buhari from office in 2023, except timely interventions are taken to avert same.\n\nLawan gave the warning on Monday night in a speech delivered to close the First Progressives Youth Conference 2021 which held at the International Conference Centre, Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the party must begin to plan ahead to sustain the goodwill and legacies of the present administration by ensuring that its leaders hand over power to competent youths in the All Progressives Congress.\n\nHe noted that by doing so, the party would be able to retain its appeal and nationalistic outlook beyond the 2023 general elections.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhether we like it or not, the truth is, President Muhammadu Buhari remains the person with the bulk of the support we get across this country in APC.\n\n\u201c[And] when he leaves, he would still have some roles, but I daresay that it is after he leaves office that APC will face its challenge.\n\n\u201cYes, we have to know our value then, and the value of APC presently is APC minus President Muhammadu Buhari. Whatever it is, that is the value of APC.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to do a lot to build this party, and we need our youths more than ever before for them to continue with this legacy that this administration has established all over the country.\n\n\u201cThat means we have to see our selves as brothers and sisters regardless of where we come from.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President added that, \u201cour tribe or even ethnic group, our religious persuasion should not matter when it comes to uniting this country.\n\n\u201c[And] as APC, the onus is on us to provide security and an economy that will bring growth and development to give people the kind of life that is meaningful.\n\n\u201cWe can ask others to join us, but we are the ones to do it, so we need all hands on deck.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that the plan of the APC to deliver on most of its promises to Nigerians was stalled in the first tenure of the President Buhari administration as a result of the feud between the National Assembly and the Executive arm of government.\n\n\u201cWhen we were voted in 2019 as leaders of the National Assembly, we were conscious of one thing, that our mandate that was given to us by Nigerians in 2015 had suffered disruption and dislocation.\n\n\u201cFor four years (2015 to 2019), our government could not perform optimally because of the then crisis between the parliament \u2013 the National Assembly \u2013 and the Executive arm of government.\n\n\u201cSo, APC had already lost four very important years. And, that was supposed to be the years that we should have convinced Nigerians that they took the right decision by voting out a PDP administration in 2015.\n\n\u201cWhat are our options? We are one party in different arms of government. Our policies are supposed to be the same. Our programmes and projects are supposed to be the same, whether you\u2019re in the legislature or the executive.\n\n\u201cSo long as you are APC, that is your programme and project, that is your government and you are bound to make it succeed.\n\n\u201cSo, we took the conscious decision of working in harmony that our relationship must be characterized by consultation, coordination, partnership and mutual respect, that we must succeed in the second tenure (2019 \u2013 2023).\n\n\u201cOtherwise, in 2023, many would like to see our backs if you can\u2019t provide the services expected of you in your first four years.\n\n\u201c[And] you to change and do better, why would anybody give you eight years?\n\n\u201cSo, we felt we have an obligation to Nigerians who voted for us, to our people in APC and to our country, that we must work in such a fashion and manner that government is able to deliver services to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President further disclosed that the ongoing amendment to the 1999 constitution will accord priority to inclusion of youths in governance.\n\nHe explained that the aim was to ensure that power is divested to younger generation in a way that allows them to participate in the process.\n\n\u201cPower is not given by opposition. When were out of power or when we came in, another party was in control of the country \u2013 the PDP.\n\n\u201cThere was no way the PDP could have given us power a la carte, but the people of Nigeria mobilized and, of course, that government was voted out.\n\n\u201cBut when it is a family affair, and this is my position, power is given not taken. Imagine yourself and your children, you want them to be better than you.\n\n\u201cBut when you say power will not be given, that family is dysfunctional. So, power is given and can be given.

          "text": "The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has reacted to a recent statement by a Northern group asking the government to grant Igbos a referendum and let them separate from Nigeria.\n\nIn a press statement, a group known as the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) had said that only a referendum for Igbo exit can guarantee peaceful Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the Northern Coalition, a recent decision by South East Governors and political leaders to denounce the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB and like-minded secessionist groups in the region was only hypocritical.\n\nThe Coalition further alleged that the Governors are only trying to buy time in order to restrategise for a deadlier onslaught for actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra.\n\nCNG also said in the statement that the Igbo nation ought to count themselves lucky that since they were defeated in the civil war, they ought to suffer more severe marginalization.\n\nHURIWA, in a statement signed by its National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko and Zainab Yusuf, its National Secretary, said that Statement by CNG, is nothing but a deliberate subterfuge, red-herring and ethnic profiling carefully designed to put the Igbos on the spot and reopen the wounds of the 1967 civil war.\n\nBiafra: IPOB needs referendum not asylum \u2013 Nnamdi Kanu replies UK govt\n\nHURIWA said the statement was also aimed at discrediting the campaign for Nigerian President of Igbo extraction.\n\nThe human rights organisation noted that the ethnic profiling of Ndigbo being promoted lately by some known Northern leaders and some groups is an ill-wind that will blow no one any good.\n\n\u201cApart from the Coalition of Northern Groups, Hakin Baba Ahmed recently made the same call for an Igbo referendum on behalf of the Northern Elders Forum,\u201d HURIWA noted.\n\n\u201cThat other call for Igbo referendum came about the same time that a serving Northern Senator to the same Igbo ethnic group said that they would get into war if that was what they wanted.\n\n\u201cIt is important to remind those profiling other ethnic groups and calling for Igbo referendum, that it is not only Biafra secessionist agitation that is going on in the country.\n\nA section of the Yoruba nation is calling for Oduduwa Republic, while Boko Haram terrorism has the simple objective of creating an Islamic Republic in the North East. What could be more secessionist than such?\n\n\u201cAnd how come such groups are not calling for Yoruba Referendum or a referendum for an Islamic state in the North East if indeed their motivation is patriotic and in good faith?\n\n\u201cIt is important to further note that the Igbo leaders cannot be held responsible for Biafra agitation any more than the Northern leaders should be held responsible for the activities of secessionists and terrorists like Abubakar Shekau and Boko Haram or for banditry.\u201d\n\nHURIWA said it sees the call for Igbo referendum by this Northern Coalition on the account Nnamdi Kanu and IPOB activities as being orchestrated in bad faith \u201cand carefully calculated to set up the Igbo ethnic group to be decimated once again, as was the case with the first military coup in which soldiers of many ethnic groups participated.\n\n\u201cThose calling for Igbo Referendum ought to worry more about why secessionist agitations are springing up all over the country and not create the impression that it is a sole Biafra or Igbo franchise.\u201d\n\nCNG is not the first group to make such a call from the North. As DAILY POST reported earlier, the Northern Elders Forum, NEF, had begged the Buhari administration to allow the South East secede from Nigeria.\n\nMaking the plea, the Northern Elders had said that they had reviewed events and tendencies which suggest that Nigeria is bound for more crises amid the agitations for Biafra, security challenges, among others.\n\nSimilarly, a member of the National Assembly, and Chairman Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Adamu Bulkachuwa had declared that the Nigerian Government will not bow to the demands of those he described as \u2018insurgents\u2019 in the South East.\n\nBulkachuwa said that the South East had tried separating from Nigeria before a move that led to the civil war, wondering if the region wanted to take the same route again and warned that the government would have no choice.",
          "summary": "The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has reacted to a recent statement by a Northern group asking the government to grant Igbos a referendum and let them separate from Nigeria.\nIn a press statement, a group known as the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) had said that only a referendum for Igbo exit can guarantee peaceful Nigeria.\n\u201cApart from the Coalition of Northern Groups, Hakin Baba Ahmed recently made the same call for an Igbo referendum on behalf of the Northern Elders Forum,\u201d HURIWA noted.\n\u201cThat other call for Igbo referendum came about the same time that a serving Northern Senator to the same Igbo ethnic group said that they would get into war if that was what they wanted.\n\u201cIt is important to remind those profiling other ethnic groups and calling for Igbo referendum, that it is not only Biafra secessionist agitation that is going on in the country.",

          "text": "Up to 10,000 domestic spectators will be allowed in Tokyo 2020 venues, Olympics organizers said yesterday, a decision that cuts against the recommendation of medical experts who said holding the event without fans was the least risky option.\n\nThe announcement ends months of speculation and highlights Japan\u2019s determination to push on with the Games and salvage the multi-billion-dollar extravaganza amid public opposition and deep concern about a resurgence in infections.\n\nThe decision was widely expected after some recent comments by organizers and as the government\u2019s own medical experts last week appeared resigned to the event going ahead with fans. Japan has largely avoided the kind of explosive coronavirus outbreaks that have devastated other countries, but the vaccine roll-out was initially slow and the medical system pushed to the brink in some places.\n\nThe limit for the Games, scheduled to begin on July 23, \u201cwill be set at 50 per cent of venue capacity, up to a maximum of 10,000 people,\u201d organizers said in a statement.\n\nBut the cheering \u2013 for a victory or a plucky underdog \u2013 will likely be quelled as shouting will be prohibited. Organizers also said masks would be required and spectators be requested to travel directly to venues and go straight home.\n\nNumbers could be further reduced after July 12, depending on whether \u201cquasi emergency\u201d COVID-19 measures, due to expire the day before, are extended or due to any other anti-infection measures in force at the time, according to organizers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpectators from overseas have already been banned. The national stadium, built for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and due to host athletics and soccer this time, would have held 68,000 fans but now will be at a sliver of that.\n\nOrganizers are still considering whether to allow alcohol to be served in venues, Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimoto said. Even as experts voiced concern, Hashimoto had previously said she was eyeing allowing up to 10,000 fans.\n\nSome of the country\u2019s top health experts on Friday said banning spectators would be the least risky option.",

We are the most travelled people in Nigeria, we don\u2019t want to leave Nigeria but some people are trying to push us out of the country and the reason they are doing that is what we don\u2019t know. We have a document that manifests a sectional approach to governance and we are not afraid to say it.\n\n\u201cEven in the past that Boko Haram, very well known to have devastated parts of Nigeria and has even grown to have brothers and sisters now called bandits, yet nobody has designated them as terrorists, but when our boys were running around here carrying flags, saying they want referendum, it was very quick and easy for the federal government to designate them a terrorist organization.\n\n\u201cThis unequal treatment of the people is at the root of the problems of Nigeria. There is now a feeling of alienation of the Igbo and it is not just us the Igbo that have that feeling, it has spread all over the place in the North, West, and south.\u201d\n\nThe senator noted that the minimum demand of Ndigbo was restructuring, adding that they were not second class citizens but they have been pushed to the fringes. He declared that as equal partners in the Nigeria project, the Igbo were qualified to get any position in the land including the Presidency.\n\nHe stated that the main problem in the country today was that a sectional government was in place which abhorred inclusion.",

          "text": "From John Adams, Minna\n\nIn what looks like a collapse in negotiation between the Niger state government and armed Bandits for the release of the 136 abducted students of the Salihu Tanko Islamiya School in Tegina, Rafi Local Government Area of the State, the State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello has ordered a full scale rescue operation to free the children.\n\nAbout 1,000 security agents, drawn from the Army, the Police, Civil Defence, the local hunters and local vigilantes have been mobilized for the rescue operation.\n\nThis is coming almost three weeks after the abduction of the school children, and after series of negotiations between the parents and the bandits.\n\nAddressing the security agents in Kagara, Rafi Local Government Area of the State on Monday, the Governor said the rescue operation had become necessary because it is obvious that the bandits are not being sincere with the negotiation.\n\n\u201cThe abductors are not honest, they are not honourable. After agreeing with parents they started shifting goal post and now we are here to take action\u201d.\n\nThe governor pointed out that since the government has ruled out payment of ransom it was time to take a decisive action against the bandits.\n\n\u201cNow that we have ruled out payment of ransom, it is time for government to take decisive measures towards ending the bandits activities that is forcefully changing the lives of the people especially in the rural areas.\n\n\u201cWe have to try our possible best not make them succeed in forcing us to change our normal lives, they started by displacing farmers from their farmlands, next, they moved to burning farms, then moved to kidnappings and forcing us to close our schools, now they have started attacking Islamic schools, only God knows what is next.\n\nThe Governor disclosed that \u201cmost of these Bandits are from outside the country, they are hired to cause problems for us. It is not the habit of the true Fulani to indulge in this kind of act. These bandits are well organised and coordinated. We can not fold our arms anymore but to take decisive and necessary steps to apprehend those involved, both the informants and the bandits\u201d.\n\nThe Governor had earlier met with Parents of the 136 kidnapped students of the Islammiya School and other stakeholders at the palace of the Emir of Kagara, Alh. Ahmed Garba Gunna, where he commiserated with them and urged them to exercise patience as government is exploring all avenues to ensure the safe rescue of the children.\n\nWhile commending the security personnel for their efforts in fighting the bandits in the last few weeks, Governor Sani Bello revealed that logistics have been provided, adding that \u201cyour allowances and other financial benefits will always be provided as at when due\u201d.\n\nThe governor who expressed sadness over the killing of 20 Vigilante Corps Members by the bandits in Magama Local Government recently however called on the Federal government to collaborate with her neighboring countries, saying \u201cfrom all indications, these bandits are foreigners\u201d.\n\nThe Emir of Kagara, Alh. Ahmad Garba Gunna, Attahiru II thanked the governor for all the support to the Emirate, especially in the area of security and the support so far given to the family of the kidnapped school children.",

And we are following up with dialogue, which at the end of the day is what will happen. We have to talk, we have to discuss. Minister of Defence, Minister of Interior and service chiefs were in Enugu earlier last Saturday and we are going to do follow-up meetings on that again starting from tomorrow.\n\n\u201cWe briefed him and he accepted that dialogue is the way to go in all these. Like I keep on saying, there is a very thin line between perception and reality, so certain things should be done, at least to assuage the feelings of the people in the area and make them not to feel unwanted, so that area was also discussed.\u201d\n\nHe said they also briefed the president on labour issues, including the recent strike by Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) and Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN) for two months before it was called off.\n\n\u201cI have to see him to appraise him with labour industrial milieu, especially when you know that the judiciary and parliamentary workers JUSUN and PASAN respectively had been been on strike that lasted for two months. We achieved a truce, through up an agreement and we have to today summit his own copies of the agreement to him.\n\n\u201cWe are going to monitor the agreement. He is very interested in it. And if you remember, he had to do an Executive Order 10 in consonance with the constitution, so that we have independence, financial autonomy for the judiciary and legislature in the states. And he was happy that at least the strikes had been called off.\u201d\n\nThe minister also said government was apprehensive over the looming industrial action in Kaduna as regards the face-off between the state government and Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), and that this formed part of the discussion with President Buhari.\n\nHe said this followed complaints by the leadership of the NLC that the Kaduna State government had refused to obey the terms of agreement reached between the two parties after the Federal Government, through the Minister of Labour and Employment, intervened to broker a truce in the industrial dispute between the two parties.",

I urge all fathers in the country to put their heads together in the best interest of our nation. As a nation, we are in pains as a result of the security challenges that we are passing through.\n\n\u201cFathers should stand up as soldiers of Christ and defend the Church and Nigeria at large. As fathers, we must continue to advocate peace and unity in diversity beginning from our homes,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ambience of the church was lightened up as Kalu donated over N2 million to the Catholic Men Organisation (CMO), Catholic Women Organisation and officiating Catholic priests.\n\nIn his response, Rev. Father Charles congratulated fathers and acknowledged that the roles of fathers in nation building cannot be over-emphasised.\n\nThe Catholic cleric also urged fathers to register with CMO and lamented the refusal of some fathers in the church to join the organisation.

The two women were arrested with seven bags of cannabis weighing 77.23kg brought in from Ogbese, Ondo State, to supply a man they simply identified as Alhaji. According to them, they had earlier supplied the same Alhaji two bags before coming with the seven bags they were caught with.\n\nOn Friday June 18, operatives of the Oyo state Command acting on intelligence also raided the residence of Alhaji Faruq, at Elebu area, Akala expressway, Oluyole LGA, Ibadan, where they recovered 43 ampoules of methylphenidate. In Kaduna state, a drug trafficker, Segun Abraham was arrested at Panteka area of the state on 17th June with 211.500kg of skunk heading to Kano state.\n\nMeanwhile, a Nigerian returning from Pakistan, Ezenyeche Kingsley Ebuka has been arrested by NDLEA operatives at the Murtala Muhammed International Airpirt, MMIA, Ikeja Lagos with five pellets of heroin weighing 250grams discovered in his anus. The suspect had arrived the \u2018D\u2019 arrival hall of the airport on 14th June on Turkish airline flight from Pakistan with the illicit drug inserted in his anus. He however failed to beat the eagle eyes of narcotic officers during inward clearance of passengers on the flight.\n\nWhile commending the Ogun, Oyo, Kaduna and the MMIA Commands of the Agency for sustaining the offensive action against illicit drug trafficking and the cartels running it, Gen. Marwa warned that the NDLEA will not spare any law enforcement agent hiding under the privilege of his uniform to engage in narcotic criminal business.\n\n\u201cThose who think they can sabotage ongoing efforts to rid Nigeria of the menace of illicit drug trafficking and abuse hiding behind the fa\u00e7ade of their uniforms should better think twice because they\u2019ll have NDLEA to contend with.\u201d",

          "title": "Buhari: My Policies, Projects, Appointments Guided By Equity, Inclusiveness",
          "text": "\u2022Says criminal elements terrorising Nigeria will be prosecuted\n\nBy Adedayo Akinwale\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari on Monday said that all the policy initiatives, projects and even appointments by his administration were guided by equity and inclusiveness.\n\nHe added that there was no part of the country that had not been impacted positively in the areas of infrastructure, agriculture and economic support initiative based on peculiarities of the regions.\n\nBuhari stated this in Abuja while declaring open the maiden edition of the Progressives Youth Conference with the theme, \u201cThe Future Is A Decision\u201d, organized by the All Progressives Congress (APC) youth wing.\n\nThe President, who was represented by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha reiterated that every criminal element that had taken up arms against the peace of the country and its citizens would be brought to book accordingly.\n\nHe stated: \u201cSo far, all the policies initiatives, projects and even appointments by this administration have been guided by equity and inclusiveness. There is actually no part of the country that has not been impacted positively in the areas of infrastructure, agriculture and economic support initiative based on peculiarities of the regions. What an area lacks in one aspect is compensated for in another.\n\n\u201cAs you are all aware, we are currently dealing with some internal security challenges and I will like to reassure you that as the Commander in chief of the armed forces, no effort will be spared in tackling them.\n\n\u201cAs I have repeatedly said in recent weeks, every criminal element that has taken up arms against the peace of the country and its citizens will be brought to book accordingly. I am happy to see that we are beginning to see the results and we keep improving until the country is rid of such divisive elements. \u201c\n\nThe President noted that he was pleased to know that the theme of the conference provides an opportunity for creating a movement, while the future is a decision that should be made today.\n\nBuhari noted that the conference was therefore very timely coming up not too long after the membership registration exercise of the party and just before the commencement of congresses starting from the Wards.\n\nHe said he was confident that deliberations at the conference would impact on the party\u2019s activities and even trickles down to his administration.\n\nBuhari added that he was mindful of the fact that his administration came into leadership on the back of the victory achieved at the polls by the party on two consecutive occasions.\n\nHe stressed that it was therefore pertinent that party members remain bound by the tenets of the APC manifesto and constitution.\n\nThe President pointed out that while those documents might not be perfect, they were put together so that elected and appointed members of the party conduct themselves in most responsible manner possible, while implementing and executing policies that are not only beneficial, but fair to all Nigerians\n\nBuhari urged the youths not to despair, nor relent in their joint task of nation building, saying they have no other country but Nigeria.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is the responsibility of every one of us to work towards the development and advancement of this country. Let us seize the opportunity to put unpleasant experiences and controversies of the past behind us as we forge a better future for the APC and for our dear country, Nigeria.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Chairman, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party and the Governor of Yobe state, Mai Mala Buni, said the event was coming at a time when the party was undergoing complete rebirth, recovery, rehabilitation, rejuvenation and repositioning.\n\nHe said it was a fact that the future of the party and the country lies in the youth, saying they cannot afford to discard the youth in the affairs of the party.\n\nBuni noted that the ruling party had in the last 12 months been administered by the Caretaker Committee due to problems and internal squabbles that had bedeviled the party.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI am pleased to say that collectively, we have rescued a troubled party that was heading towards imminent collapse and disintegration, to a very strong, solid, reliable and ever growing political party.\u201d\n\nThe chairman said the youth of the party had throughout the turbulent times remained progressively united to the cause of the party.\n\nBuni stressed that this also explains why the Caretaker committee under his leadership took a deliberate position of engaging the youth in every process.\n\nHe said as part of the strategic approach to youth engagement, a committee on youth, women and people with special needs was constituted during the membership registration and revalidation exercise.\n\nThe chairman noted that their support to the committee has translated into the rebirth of a new APC that gives every member a true sense of belonging and pride.\n\nBuni stressed that the ruling party had no doubt repositioned itself as Nigeria\u2019s leading party and Africa\u2019s largest political party.\n\nHe stressed, \u201cI also want to assure you that the committee is making great efforts to approach the proposed congresses and convention with a united front to produce a strong leadership that would enjoy the support, trust and confidence of all members. A leadership that would protect party interest above personal and primordial interests, promote unity and take the party to a more prosperous.\u201d\n\nBuni pointed out that as the theme of the conference suggests, the decision for the future of the party and country cannot be at any other time better than now when the corporate unity and security in the country were being challenged.\n\n\u201cAs the most energetic segment of the population, retrogressive elements with evil interests in causing confusion, creating and fanning hate and disunity will always rely on you to achieve such negative and unpatriotic tendencies and to destroy your future. You must resist them. You should never allow yourselves to be used as tools in the hands of these treacherous elements,\u201d Buni added\n\nOn his part, former Governor of Imo state, Senator Richard Okorocha said Nigerian youths should stop procrastinating, they should be focused and must rise and take their place.\n\nHe added that power was not given but taken, adding that the life and future of the country is in their hands.\n\nOkorocha said, \u201cThere should be an industrial revolution.

          "title": "Amid Global Pressure, UAE to Fine Violators of New Corporate Transparency Rules",
          "text": "By Ndubuisi Francis\n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE), one of the world\u2019s top emerging tax havens, will begin collecting penalties and fines on its requirement for reporting of company beneficial ownership information, as it faces international pressure to address money laundering concerns, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has revealed.\n\nThe tiny gulf country, which is a federation of seven emirates, is ruled by a mix of federal and local laws in addition to laws governing its sprawling free zones.\n\nThe legal environment, along with the absence of a single and centralised register and weak regulations, have turned the UAE to a safe haven for illicit activities, Transparency International said in a report last year.\n\nThe country is believed to be a safe haven for Nigerian officials who launder public funds.\n\nAn associate fellow, Chatham House, Matthew Page, recently disclosed that over 800 properties worth $400 million in Dubai, UAE were traced to Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) in Nigeria.\n\nPage, in a paper titled \u2018Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs) in Real Estate and Education Sector: Implications for Investigators,\u2019 delivered at a workshop organised by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), revealed that 35 state governors in Nigeria had acquired a total of 69 properties; five presidency staff members were controlling 13 properties, while 16 lawmakers are in possession of 45 properties.\n\nAccording to the findings, 15 ministers have 25 properties, 158 suspected politicians\u2019 proxies are in control of 226 properties, 14 security sector leaders (71), 50 PEP-linked business persons (91), 13 known Nigerian law enforcement agency suspects (216), 16 heads of department and agency (25), 11 NNPC officials (19), and a judge, one.\n\nAnother report by Human and Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA Resource Centre), a good governance advocacy group, titled, \u2018Fixing Nigeria\u2019s Illicit Financial Flows: A critical review of UK and UAE Policies, Laws and Practices,\u2019 had also linked 10 former Nigerian governors to properties worth \u00a356 million (about N30 billion) in the United Kingdom, while 13 top military officers were also linked to 216 houses in the UAE.\n\nThe report gave graphic details of illicit financial flows (IFFs) from Nigeria to the UK and the UAE, specifically Dubai.\n\nHowever, as the UAE prepares to implement the new rules on beneficial owners, there are questions about numerous exemptions and loopholes in the rules.\n\nCompanies may use brokers or banks as the legal owners, but the new laws that require the reporting of beneficial owners is focused on recording the true owners who reap the benefits of ownership, have 25 per cent or more of the company\u2019s shares and voting rights at the company or the power to dismiss and appoint directors.\n\nThe Policy Director of Global Financial Integrity (GFI), Lakshmi Kumar, said: \u201cBeneficial ownership truthfully provides you who is behind the company and gives you an individual to go after. It allows enforcement agencies that are genuinely invested in understanding and uncovering illicit financial flows to identify an individual.\u201d\n\nSince the September 11 attacks in the United States, the UAE has come under spotlight because of the role its banks and airports played in facilitating transfer of cash, weapons and other material to alleged terrorist groups, according to the Chicago Tribune.\n\n\u201cWhat makes the UAE attractive to illicit business is the absence of any kind of oversight, questioning (or) requirements.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of other countries, they may not have the technological capacity, but that is not Dubai\u2019s problem. Look at how the UAE monitors civil society groups, people who advocate against human rights violations with migrant labour. The UAE does an excellent job monitoring, enforcing and prosecuting them. There\u2019s a lack of interest behind this beneficial ownership law,\u201d Kumar said.\n\nIn 2020, the UAE was placed under a year-long observation by the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) for concerns over money laundering, terrorism financing, weapons of mass destruction, loopholes in the property and precious metal industries and the lack of legal action against money laundering.\n\nAccording to Kumar, this law, among others, may alter the perception among foreign investors that the UAE is a hub for illegal money movement.\n\nThe decision affects 513,000 non-financial businesses, according to Gulf News.\n\nUAE\u2019s minister of economy has yet to decide who the enforcement authorities of the law will be, according to the cabinet decision issued earlier this year.\n\nThe law applies to the entire country with the exception of the financial free zones of Dubai and Abu Dhabi.\n\nGovernment-owned corporations and publicly traded entities are also excluded from the ownership reporting requirement.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how this data will be stored, and the information will not be publicly available.\n\nThe ICIJ investigations, such as the 2016 Panama Papers, have helped prompt numerous countries to enact beneficial ownership registries in recent years, including in Cyprus, Ghana and Kenya earlier this year.\n\nMore recent expos\u00e9s by ICIJ, such as FinCEN Files and Luanda Leaks, have highlighted Dubai\u2019s rise as a go-to secrecy haven for people looking to hide illicit wealth.\n\nAdministrative penalties and fines of up to 100,000 UAE dirhams for companies that don\u2019t comply with reporting beneficial ownership information will begin July 1.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Duro Ikhazuagbe\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has reduced the life ban from football activities slammed on former Super Eagles Head Coach, Samson Siasia, to five years and also quashed the 50,000 Swiss franc fine on the ex international.\n\nCAS ruling Monday is the fallout of the appeal filed by Siasia challenging the decision rendered by the Adjudicatory Chamber of FIFA on 11 April 2019.\n\nThe FIFA decision found Siasia guilty of infringement of article 1 (bribery) of the 2009 FIFA Code of Ethics and sanctioned him with a life ban from taking part in any kind of football-related activity at national and international level (administrative, sports or any other) and a fine of CHF 50,000 was imposed on him.\n\nIn 2010, a match fixer tried to involve Mr Siasia as a coach of a club under his strict instructions. With the promise of employment benefits, Mr Siasia would have had to always field several players under the control of the match fixer.\n\nThe negotiations between the match fixer and Mr Siasia in relation to the conditions of employment were conducted by email over a period of two months.\n\nEventually, the club did not accept or could not afford Mr Siasia\u2019s requests and the negotiations ended.\n\nBut Monday, CAS Panel confirmed the Challenged Decision, with the exception of the following elements:\n\n\u201c*Mr Siasia is banned for 5 (five) years from taking part in any kind of football-related activity at national and international level (administrative, sports or any other) as of 16 August 2019.\n\n\u201d *The imposed fine of CHF 50,000 (fifty thousand Swiss Francs) on Mr Siasia is set aside. The Panel determined the imposition of a life ban to be disproportionate for a first offence which was committed passively and which had not had an adverse or immediate effect on football stakeholders, and that a five-year ban would still achieve the envisaged aim of punishing the infringement committed by Mr Siasia.\u201d\n\nThe CAS panel acknowledged the need for sanctions to be sufficiently high enough to eradicate bribery and especially match-fixing in football.\n\nHowever, the Panel considered in the particular circumstances of this matter that it would be inappropriate and excessive to impose a financial sanction in addition to the five-year ban, since the ban already incorporated a financial punishment in eliminating football as a source of revenue for Mr Siasia, and considering that Mr Siasia had not obtained any gain or pecuniary benefit from his unethical behavior.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Alex Enumah\n\nJustice Taiwo Taiwo of the Abuja Division of the Federal High Court on Monday ordered oil giant, Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited, and its Joint venture partner, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), to pay the total sum of N81.9 billion as damages to Ibeno communities in Akwa Ibom State over oil pollution.\n\nThe amount, according to the judgment, must be paid within 14 days, after which 8 per cent interest will be accruals on the principal sum annually.\n\nThe communities, led by Obong Effiong Archianga and nine others, had in April 2012 dragged the NNPC, Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited and ExxonMobil Corporation to court over oil spillages in their communities between 2000 and 2010.\n\nThe oil spillages, the plaintiffs had claimed, badly affected their environment as well as destroyed their means of livelihood which was mainly fishing and farming.\n\nDelivering judgment in the matter, Justice Taiwo held that the American oil company and NNPC were negligent in the way and manner they handled oil spills that caused environmental degradation in the communities.\n\nHe particularly took a swipe at the NNPC for being interested in the revenue generations from oil exploration at the expense of the lives of the people of the communities.\n\nThe judge held that the oral and documentary evidence adduced by the plaintiffs supported their claims that lives were made miserable for them when their waters and land were polluted through crude oil leakages from old oil pipelines belonging to the defendants.\n\nWhile reacting to Mobil\u2019s claim that it carried out a clean up exercise, the court held that the American company failed to address the issue of compensation that would have mitigated the economic losses of the people.\n\nBesides, the judge described as unreliable the witnesses called by Mobil, adding that for no reason they became evasive during cross examination by the counsel to the plaintiffs.\n\nSpecifically, the court held that the oral and documentary evidence produced by Mobil were not in any way helpful to the court as they were targeted at serving predetermined interest.\n\nThe court further held that both Mobil and NNPC were negligent when they failed to visit farmlands, rivers and creeks said to have been contaminated by the oil leakages from their pipelines.\n\nJustice Taiwo also rejected the claims of the NNPC that the suit was statute barred in 2012 when it was filed by the aggrieved plaintiffs.\n\nThe NNPC had claimed that the suit was not filed within 12 months by the plaintiffs as required by the provision of section 12, sub section 1 of the NNPC Act, 2004.\n\nAccording to the court, the instant suit has to do with fundamental rights that cannot be rendered impotent by the statute of limitations.\n\nThe judge held that section 11, subsection 5 of the Oil Pipeline Act, makes it mandatory for oil companies to monitor and repair their pipelines to avoid spillages and environmental degradation.\n\nThe judge consequently awarded the sum of N42.8 billion as damages for intangible losses, N29.1 billion special damages as annotated and N10 billion as general damages.\n\nHowever, the third defendant, ExxonMobil Corporation, was removed from the court action when the court established that there was no cause of action against it.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Residents of Fowowawo, a community in the Owode Egba Local Government Area of Ogun State are currently fleeing their area after power-drunk personnel of the Nigerian Navy invaded the community and started taking over their lands.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the navy personnel are working for some powerful land-grabbers in the community and have vowed to arrest and detain anyone who resists them.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the military men have also sent packing the local chief, Baale, Chief Waheed Muraino, as the people continued to desert their homes due to the invading military men.\n\n\u201cThe navy personnel are being used by warring families and parties laying claim to lands in the community. One of them is the Ogunleye family, another is the Olashile family. The latter decided to toe the legal path by taking the matter before the court of law in 2009,\u201d a source revealed.\n\n\u201cRegarding the laws of the land, we decided to approach the court rather than take the same paths with the land-grabbers by resorting to self-help,\u201d the Baale, Chief Muraino, said.\n\n\u201cThe Ogun State High Court under Justice Akinyemi ruled in favour of the Olashiles as they were declared the rightful owners of the land,\u201d a source stated.\n\n\u201cMembers of the Ogunleye family led by a hoodlum, Sufi Taiwo, obviously were not pleased with the court injunction and they decided to inflict mayhem on the Olashile family, Agbege descendants, and the entire Fowowawo community,\u201d the source added.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the military men assaulted and tortured several residents, including a woman, Lateefat Adenekan, who visited the village with her one-year-old child without the knowledge of the seriousness of the fracas.\n\n\u201cSufi Taiwo personally and violently dispossessed Lateefat of her infant. The child is yet to be seen to date. When Lateefat\u2019s uncle, Nurudeen Adenekan, consulted the police to report the case, he was later visited at home and beaten till he had fractures.\n\n\u201cA few days later, Nurudeen was revisited allegedly by Sufi, who poured petrol into his ears and eyes till he lost consciousness; that led to Nurudeen\u2019s death in November 2020,\u201d the source revealed.\n\n\u201cNot done, on January 6, 2021, Sufi Taiwo took an excavator into the village, in company with some men of the Nigerian Navy to start excavation on the land. The Baale (traditional ruler) contacted the police immediately but they appeared powerless in the presence of these men.\n\n\u201cThis led to the petitioning of the Apapa Naval Base, an action that yielded no result. The naval officers currently excavate and sell sand and they extort drivers and the rest of the villagers.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the Nigerian Navy personnel under the Western Naval Command, Apapa, had since then refused to leave the community.\n\n\u201cThe military men also destroyed some cocoa and banana farmlands spread on about 10 acres because they wanted to sell off the lands. Any attempt by us to resist the illegality of this naval personnel was met with torture and injuries,\u201d a resident narrated.\n\nSaharaReporters was told that one of the farmers who was injured by the military men was Micheal Shotinoye who had a rice farm.\n\n\u201cHis rice farm which engaged a lot of workers has now been abandoned; it is no longer safe to be there,\u201d a source stated.\n\nThe fleeing Baale narrated that the community had reported several times to the navy authorities but no action was taken to stop the navy personnel.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have petitioned the Senate, Ministry of Defence, Headquarters of the Nigerian Navy, office of the Chief of Naval Staff, among others, but the actions have yielded little or no result. The Ogun State Police Command has also invited Sufi Taiwo several times, but he never honoured the invitation once.\n\n\u201cWe hereby call on the Ogun State Government, human rights lawyers, and other well-meaning Nigerians to come to our aid. I am currently a fugitive as I dare not go to the Fowowawo, a town where I am supposed to be the head.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters was told that Ofem Ubi is the Ogun State Navy Commandant but he has taken no action on the excesses of the navy personnel as he is said to be receiving financial proceeds from the crimes.\n\nDOCUMENTS: Nigerian Navy Personnel Sack Ogun Community to Take Over Land, Expel Traditional Ruler by Sahara Reporters on Scribd",

          "text": "Residents of Fowowawo, a community in the Owode Egba Local Government Area of Ogun State are currently fleeing their area after power-drunk personnel of the Nigerian Navy invaded the community and started taking over their lands.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the navy personnel are working for some powerful land-grabbers in the community and have vowed to arrest and detain anyone who resists them.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the military men have also sent packing the local chief, Baale, Chief Waheed Muraino, as the people continued to desert their homes due to the invading military men.\n\n\u201cThe navy personnel are being used by warring families and parties laying claim to lands in the community. One of them is the Ogunleye family, another is the Olashile family. The latter decided to toe the legal path by taking the matter before the court of law in 2009,\u201d a source revealed.\n\n\u201cRegarding the laws of the land, we decided to approach the court rather than take the same paths with the land-grabbers by resorting to self-help,\u201d the Baale, Chief Muraino, said.\n\n\u201cThe Ogun State High Court under Justice Akinyemi ruled in favour of the Olashiles as they were declared the rightful owners of the land,\u201d a source stated.\n\n\u201cMembers of the Ogunleye family led by a hoodlum, Sufi Taiwo, obviously were not pleased with the court injunction and they decided to inflict mayhem on the Olashile family, Agbege descendants, and the entire Fowowawo community,\u201d the source added.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the military men assaulted and tortured several residents, including a woman, Lateefat Adenekan, who visited the village with her one-year-old child without the knowledge of the seriousness of the fracas.\n\n\u201cSufi Taiwo personally and violently dispossessed Lateefat of her infant. The child is yet to be seen to date. When Lateefat\u2019s uncle, Nurudeen Adenekan, consulted the police to report the case, he was later visited at home and beaten till he had fractures.\n\n\u201cA few days later, Nurudeen was revisited allegedly by Sufi, who poured petrol into his ears and eyes till he lost consciousness; that led to Nurudeen\u2019s death in November 2020,\u201d the source revealed.\n\n\u201cNot done, on January 6, 2021, Sufi Taiwo took an excavator into the village, in company with some men of the Nigerian Navy to start excavation on the land. The Baale (traditional ruler) contacted the police immediately but they appeared powerless in the presence of these men.\n\n\u201cThis led to the petitioning of the Apapa Naval Base, an action that yielded no result. The naval officers currently excavate and sell sand and they extort drivers and the rest of the villagers.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the Nigerian Navy personnel under the Western Naval Command, Apapa, had since then refused to leave the community.\n\n\u201cThe military men also destroyed some cocoa and banana farmlands spread on about 10 acres because they wanted to sell off the lands. Any attempt by us to resist the illegality of this naval personnel was met with torture and injuries,\u201d a resident narrated.\n\nSaharaReporters was told that one of the farmers who was injured by the military men was Micheal Shotinoye who had a rice farm.\n\n\u201cHis rice farm which engaged a lot of workers has now been abandoned; it is no longer safe to be there,\u201d a source stated.\n\nThe fleeing Baale narrated that the community had reported several times to the navy authorities but no action was taken to stop the navy personnel.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have petitioned the Senate, Ministry of Defence, Headquarters of the Nigerian Navy, office of the Chief of Naval Staff, among others, but the actions have yielded little or no result. The Ogun State Police Command has also invited Sufi Taiwo several times, but he never honoured the invitation once.\n\n\u201cWe hereby call on the Ogun State Government, human rights lawyers, and other well-meaning Nigerians to come to our aid. I am currently a fugitive as I dare not go to the Fowowawo, a town where I am supposed to be the head.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters was told that Ofem Ubi is the Ogun State Navy Commandant but he has taken no action on the excesses of the navy personnel as he is said to be receiving financial proceeds from the crimes.\n\nDOCUMENTS: Nigerian Navy Personnel Sack Ogun Community to Take Over Land, Expel Traditional Ruler by Sahara Reporters on Scribd",

          "text": "In Hero Mode, all Troy wants is to work at Playfield, his mom\u2019s 12-year-old gaming company. But she insists he focus on a dull computer science course at school. The real reason, however, is that she wants him to have a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood away from video games.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Playfield is sinking. Their only potential angel investor bailed because their latest game sucked. A cheap buy offer from a rival is on the table.\n\nBut Troy convinces his mom to let him rebuild the game. He adds a rainbow that talks and a Barack Obama feature. And the rest is\u2026 actually, go watch the rest.\n\nReal life Troy stories are rare in Nigeria but an active gaming community is growing. Platforms like Twitch and Discord are spurring a global gaming economy and a means for financial independence for young Nigerians \u2013 like Olaide and Ying-Yi Akanji.\n\nThey met in 2012 at a GCE exam hall. When they started dating, Olaide introduced Ying-Yi (who is half-Nigerian, half-Taiwanese) to online gaming. Now married, they are an ardent gaming couple.\n\nWhile speaking with them on Tech Republic \u2013 a weekly radio show produced by 88.5 UFM Lagos in collaboration with TechCabal \u2013 I felt nudged to pick a controller and earn some recharge card money, at least. But how does a rusty Millennial get started?\n\nBelow is an excerpt of the chat with the Akanji\u2019s, edited for clarity. Most questions are from Tech Republic hosts Jay and Didi.\n\nJay: What\u2019s the situation with gaming in Nigeria?\n\nOlaide: I have been playing video games since I was a kid. My first Playstation 2 was from my dad. I became very good at gaming but I felt it couldn\u2019t take me anywhere because our 300kbps internet was so bad. Playing online was just impossible.\n\nThen I moved to the UK to study software engineering and everything was better. I dived into e-sports and built a following on Twitch. But I was not comfortable with a foreign audience. Gaming was more fun when I moved back. I could chat and banter on my streams in Pidgin and Yoruba.\n\nBut then came the issues \u2013 internet and electricity. It was demotivating to the point where I almost quit. The main problem was ping \u2013 a measure of how fast you get responses when you click to pass or shoot or any other action.\n\nOur problem here is that when you click on a button for any of those actions, it needs to travel to a server in Europe before it returns to Nigeria. And if you are playing against someone in Europe, their ping is much faster. I may shoot him first but it may not get to him when I do; then he shoots a second later and wins. That\u2019s why you have not seen Nigerians breakthrough internationally.\n\nDidi: Okay, how do I get into gaming? Can I start now even if I didn\u2019t play as a kid?\n\nOlaide: Yes you can! That\u2019s what I love about gaming. When people tell me they don\u2019t like video games, I say you haven\u2019t tried it out. There are so many games out there, it\u2019s impossible for you to hate them all.\n\nA 16-year-old kid won $3million playing Fortnite in 2019 and I actually played in that tournament. I made it into the top 1,000 from the initial 80 million people. The top 100 played in the finals in the US.\n\nBut that prize money shows how this sport has grown. I think the biggest prize money ever won in Nigeria was around \u20a65million.\n\nJay: This is really an untapped market in Nigeria\n\nOlaide: Oh my God, there\u2019s so much potential. I\u2019ve had many conversations with companies that want to get into online gaming but they fear the risks. And it\u2019s understandable because you need 24/7 electricity.\n\nI\u2019ve heard stories about NEPA taking power in the middle of a tournament. It\u2019s painful. When we compete against South Africans, they win because their internet is better.\n\nStill, the Nigerian gaming community is growing.\n\nDidi: How many female gamers are in Nigeria?\n\nYing-Yi: We have quite a few, but the gaming scene is saturated with guys. Girls in Nigeria have less time to play video games because they are more likely to do house chores, while guys can keep playing. Women gamers have to put in more effort. That means we are not a lot but we are getting there.\n\nParents also need to understand that gaming helps to improve cognitive reasoning of both boys and girls. Yes it can be sedentary but parents can set the balance between gaming and other activities.\n\nAlexander: So how do you pitch online gaming to people in government, as something good for the digital economy?\n\nOlaide: People are investing in electronic sports (esports) because every competition provides a level playing field for amateur and expert gamers. No connections needed.\n\nAnybody can buy a console, start playing and competing. Gamers like TimTheTatman are terrible at gaming but make millions because they make entertaining gaming videos. That opportunity should be open to all Nigerian youth looking for jobs and alternative income streams.\n\n\u2014\n\nListen to Tech Republic every Thursday at 2pm WAT on 88.5 UFM Lagos. Brought to you in collaboration with TechCabal.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to avoid investment scams in Nigeria",
          "text": "\u201cDo you want to double your money in 10 days?\u201d\n\nInvestment scams tend to start off the same way.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a social media advert or a video of a celebrity telling you that an \u2018investment platform\u2019 made them millionaires overnight.\n\nThey all echo an alarming promise: \u201cgive us your money and we will give you more returns than you\u2019ve ever seen in the market \u2013 oh and did we mention your money is sure to come back to you?\u201d\n\nThese offers always seem too good to be true. And they usually are.\n\nOver the past few weeks, two different scams have been uncovered in Nigeria. Insha-Allahu Investment is the latest of them.\n\nWith a business name that roughly translates to \u2018If God Wills\u2019, the company\u2019s CEO is currently on the run after promising investors up to 20% Return on Investment (ROI) in two months. Many of the investors put in their life savings and in one case, their inheritance in a bid to multiply their money.\n\nInvestment is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It requires work. The work on your part as the investor is to perform due diligence and ensure your money is going to the right place.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that many more investment scams will continue to spring up. Days after Brisk Capital\u2019s CEO was arrested for fraud, a tweet featuring a popular celebrity made the rounds.\n\nThe power to become a millionaire is in your hands. Start your journey to become a millionaire today by Joining the great @mcivip known as Millionaire Club where you can invest and earn big.\n\n\n\nOfficial website: https://t.co/HMfsRY9aCspic.twitter.com/i0gqGXYzjJ \u2014 Instablog9ja (@instablog9ja) May 28, 2021\n\nIn it, the actor claimed that the company, Millionaires Club Investment, would give you 50% ROI (Return on Investment) in 3 days.\n\n\u201cOkay, but how?\u201d\n\nThis is a question that should follow every claim of returns. If a company tells you they plan to give you 30% of your money back in say, a month as Brisk Capital did, it\u2019s important to ask for details of how exactly they plan on making those returns.\n\nI spoke to Adedayo Bakare, COO of Money Africa and Oluwatomi Solanke, CEO of Trove Finance to get an idea of how to gauge if a deal is too good to be true.\n\nThey both agree that there is a relative benchmark to employ when discussing investments in the country \u2013 it\u2019s called the MPR (Monetary Policy Rate) \u2013 it\u2019s usually around the price of most of the government\u2019s debt instruments \u2013 like bonds and treasury bills.\n\nAs of March 2021, the MPR for Nigeria was 11.5% per year. To find out how much that is monthly, we just need to divide by 12 and we have roughly 0.96% per month.\n\nSo as a rule of thumb, if you have any \u2018investment platform\u2019 offering you significantly more than 0.96% ROI per month then you should proceed with caution. If they\u2019re offering less, then you shouldn\u2019t bother with them at all because you could get more by buying debt instruments directly from the government.\n\nInvestment is, by nature, risky. Legitimate investment platforms are usually keen to inform you of the risks involved when you\u2019re putting your money with them. If a person is promising you 30% monthly and telling you it is low-risk then they are already lying to you and you should not bother doing business with them.\n\nThis is the first step in finding out if an \u2018investment opportunity\u2019 is a scam \u2013 investigate their ROI claims and how they intend to turn them into a reality.\n\nIf a company tells you they are investing in the stock market \u2013 which admittedly can give you high returns \u2013 you must be aware of the risks. The market is volatile and can move up or down very quickly.\n\nIf they say they are investing in real estate then, as an investor, the onus is on you to ask questions about the real estate offerings. Are they selling land? Renting out buildings? How exactly are they able to make that much money from renting or selling land within a short time frame.\n\nIf you find that a company\u2019s explanation for the \u2018how?\u2019 is satisfactory, then you should go on to the next item on our checklist: Regulation.\n\n\u201cAnd you are licensed by\u2026?\u201d\n\nThis is probably one of the most essential checks you must perform before you hand over funds to an investment company.\n\nIt is not enough that a company is \u2018registered\u2019 as a business. Any street-smart hustler can register a business.\n\nAn investment platform you are considering must be either: registered with the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), or be affiliated with a company that is licensed by the SEC or the CBN.\n\nA company claiming to be a financial services company of any kind that has no connection to the SEC or CBN is one to approach with extreme caution.\n\nTo be extra sure, when a company tells you they are licensed with the SEC or gives you their affiliate company (or trustee), you can click here to confirm their eligibility.\n\n\u201cWho did you say you were again?\u201d\n\nContinue your due diligence by looking into the company\u2019s track record.\n\nIt is important to find out what credentials the owners or managers of these companies have. In the case of Dominic Joshua, a quick search would have raised some doubt about the veracity of a 21-year-old investment wunderkind with no real track record.\n\nThis step is especially important when you speak with referees or the company\u2019s brand ambassadors. You shouldn\u2019t put your money into a company just because a friend or family member told you it was great.\n\nYou should also check the company\u2019s track record and find out if fraud allegations have been levelled against its founders, senior leaders, or board members.\n\nPlatforms like ours, Nairaland and even Facebook have been around long enough to have picked up news on all kinds of scams and their perpetrators. It would be good to search for the names of those people and companies and see what comes up.\n\nFinally, making wise and well-informed investment decisions is a great idea but the journey to financial freedom is no walk in the park and requires careful research.\n\nSo the next time you or a loved one are faced with a new \u2018investment opportunity,\u2019 we recommend you share this article with them.\n\n*This is not investment advice\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Two unhealthy decades later\n\nOnly Rwanda, Botswana and Zambia have budgeted over 15% to health in the last two decades. In Nigeria, budget allocation for healthcare was 4.15% and 3.91% in 2017 and 2018 respectively, as data by TechCabal Insights shows.\n\n\n\nWith governments\u2019 poor performance, the burden of funding African healthcare has largely fallen on the shoulders of the private sector, which accounts for nearly 60% of financing. The continent relies on private providers for nearly 50% of its healthcare needs.\n\nEast and Southern Africa remain the regions most affected by HIV in the world. But as other diseases like Ebola and COVID-19 have shown, Africa\u2019s healthcare concerns are systemic, broad and in need of huge capital injection.\n\nAfrica has an estimated $66 billion-a-year health financing gap and in the absence of serious government efforts, donors and the private sector have come through.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the value of PE and VC investments in African healthcare increased from 3% to 16% of total investments in the continent, according to the African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (AVCA).\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, 97 private equity and venture capital fund investments worth $1.3bn were made in health care in Africa. Most healthcare deals in that period happened in Nigeria (15%), Morocco (11%), Egypt (10%), South Africa (8%) and Ghana (8%). Boluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nHealth care, as an investment sector, can be narrowed down to a number of segments, according to the GICS classification system: Equipment & Supplies, Providers & Services, Technology, Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals, and Life Sciences Tools & Services.\n\nAnd health technology (healthtech) has received the most attention recently in Africa.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, AVCA estimates that healthtech accounted for 35% of health care investments in Africa. In 2020 alone, healthtech was the bright star too \u2013 gulping 45% of health care investments.\n\nOne of the more eye-catching healthcare companies is mPharma. The Ghana-based startup is now present in 7 other countries and has raised over $40 million. It became a crucial partner in the Ghanaian government\u2019s vaccine distribution strategy this year and is tipped as one of Africa\u2019s next big companies..\n\nOther breakout healthcare startups in Africa include LifeBank, Helium Health and 54Gene in Nigeria, Ilara Health in Kenya, and Healthlane in Cameroon. These startups are filling critical gaps in blood products logistics, genetics data and hospital management technology to improve service delivery. More are coming on board.\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nAs with mPharma, new innovative health startups are relying on VC funding to rise to popular consciousness. To close the $66bn-a-year gap, the PE and VC community will be expected to invest larger checks at a faster rate in more startups. COVID-19, while an unfortunate pandemic, has spurred a welcome boost in visibility for healthcare startups.\n\nBut tough questions will have to be asked of governments as well. Are they doing their bit, at least keeping to what they agreed to 20 years ago? The first quarter of the 21st Century has only four years before it ends.

          "text": "The Buhari administration has stepped up efforts to regulate the online media in Nigeria in what is seen by many as attempts to further stifle the civic space in the country.\n\nTwo weeks after blocking Twitter\u2019s operations, the federal government has asked the House of Representatives to enact a law that will empower the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to control all forms of internet broadcasting and social media.\n\nThe request was made on Wednesday by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, during a public hearing organised by the house committee on information, national orientation, ethics, and values on a bill to amend the NBC Act.\n\nThe commission already controls television and radio broadcasting in Nigeria, based on provisions in Section 2(b) of the NBC Act. It states that \u201cthe Commission shall have [the] responsibility of receiving, processing and considering applications for the establishment, ownership or operation of radio and television stations including cable television services, direct satellite broadcast and any other medium of broadcasting.\u201d\n\nLai Mohammed now wants the commission to also regulate the online media, in addition to other channels of broadcasting. \u201cI want to add here specifically that internet broadcasting and all online media should be included in this because we have a responsibility to monitor contents, including Twitter,\u201d the minister told lawmakers.\n\nBefore Lai Mohammed\u2019s proposal, the broadcasting regulator had asked all social media platforms and service providers in the online broadcasting space in Nigeria to apply for a broadcast licence.\n\nPossible clampdown on freedom of expression\n\nWidespread criticism has trailed the proposal by the Nigerian government, which has only further stoked concerns over a possible clampdown on free speech and internet freedom by the Buhari administration.\n\nMedia stakeholders at the public hearing kicked against the inclusion of online media under NBC\u2019s mandate, asking the panel to instead make the commission more independent of the Minister of Information.\n\nOver time, the NBC has acted as an extension of the Ministry of Information and Culture, which rarely acts independently, and thus, the commission\u2019s operations have often been subject to political interference. This was condemned by the International Press Centre (IPC) and the Centre for Media Law and Advocacy in a joint statement that called for the neutrality of the commission.\n\nAccording to Akin Akingbulu, executive director of the Institute for Media and Society, the commission should not receive directives from the information minister. \u201cThe power to give directives to the commission, vested in the minister of information in section 6 should be removed and replaced with powers which include policy formulation for the broadcasting sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial media bill through the backdoor\u201d\n\nDespite the ban on Twitter, Nigerians continue to use the platform thanks to virtual private networks (VPNs) that help bypass the suspension. Many have taken to Twitter to express criticism over the proposed regulation of online media.\n\nBREAKING: NBC Amendment Bill Is Social Media Bill Through The Backdoor \u2014 SERAP (@SERAPNigeria) June 17, 2021\n\nAmendment of the NBC act;grafting the shoot of autocracy. \u2014 Senator Shehu Sani (@ShehuSani) June 17, 2021\n\nNigeria Govt is asking House of Reps to amend the NBC Act and include \u201cinternet broadcasting\u201d.\n\n\n\nThat means all online radio/TV stations must register with NBC and Lai Mohammed.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Google has announced opening up three new programmes targeted at supporting African entrepreneurs \u2014 the 6th cohort of Google for Startups Accelerator (GFSA) Africa, $3 million Black Founders Fund (BFF) Africa, and Google.org-backed $3 million grants for female entrepreneurs.\n\nFollowing a rigorous selection process earlier in the year, 15 tech startups have been chosen across the continent to participate in the GFSA; and the three-month online mentorship programme will begin today, June 21, 2021. Notably, the first virtual class of Google for Startups Accelerator Africa was launched last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nGFSA Cohort 6. Source: Supplied\n\nGFSA has graduated 67 startups from the past five cohorts \u2014 represented across 17 African countries \u2014 since it launched in 2018.\n\nCharles Murito, Google\u2019s Africa Policy and Government Relations Director, told Techpoint Africa that these startups are in turn accelerating the continent\u2019s economy, having collectively raised over $72 million in capital and provided 2,800 jobs after participating in the programme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlack Founders Fund (BFF) Africa\n\nSimultaneously, applications will be opened for the $3 million Black Founders Fund for African startups in their early stage. The programme will have 50 African startups, led by Black founders, receive cheques between $50k and $100k.\n\nHowever, it is non-dilutive equity-free funding, which means the startups do not have to give up part of their shares to Google following the financing. In addition, the startups will get $220k in Google ads grants and cloud credits alongside training sessions and access to Google\u2019s network of mentors.\n\nEligibility\n\nTo be eligible for this, interested businesses must be a tech startup headquartered in either Botswana, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, or Zimbabwe; have a founding team of at least one black founding member, and possess technical skills to use Google\u2019s resources.\n\nHead of Google for Startups Accelerator Africa, Onajite Emerhor, adds that, for inclusiveness, the fund is open to companies that are focused on supporting the black community, not only those led by black C-level founders.\n\nQualified startups can apply here as applications close on July 7, 2021.\n\nSME grants and support for 500 female entrepreneurs\n\nMeanwhile, another $3 million has been earmarked as SME grants. This fulfils the company\u2019s promise to open funding initiatives to small businesses that are not online. The $3 million funds will be used to provide mentorship, coaching, and access to key markets for 5,000 female entrepreneurs with low digital skills come from rural areas and currently operate in an informal sector.\n\nThis will also include seed capital in the form of cash grants and Google product support for 500 aspiring female entrepreneurs. Beneficiaries will be chosen from Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and select Francophone countries.\n\nFor two of the programmes, Google will be working with two African partners, with a thriving community of entrepreneurs, to disburse the funds \u2014 Co-Creation Hub (CcHUB) for BFF, while Tony Elumelu Foundation will be in charge of grants for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Google\u2019s 14 years of presence in Africa, it has at different times launched investments initiatives that are far-reaching into the continent, not only South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, and Ghana, where it has physical offices. It has reached more locations through partnerships with tech hubs and startup communities in other locations.\n\nApart from funding, Google has also been actively involved in empowering African talents with digital skills. During his visit to Nigeria in 2017, Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, disclosed plans to train 10 million Africans in digital skills by 2022.\n\nIn January 2020, Google launched the Google Developers Space in Lagos, the first of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 to serve as an incubation ground for innovators. In the meantime, the tech giant has ongoing projects addressing Africa\u2019s Internet access and connectivity challenges.",

          "text": "Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s busiest city with a massive consumer market has overtaken Nairobi, Kenya\u2019s capital as home and a top destination for the greatest number of start-ups in Africa. Over 500 active start-ups operate out of Lagos.\n\nRead Also: Kenya overtakes Nigeria as top destination for start-ups investment deals in 2020\n\nThe most populous city in Nigeria gained five spots in 2021 to attain a global ranking of 122nd (122nd in 2020) after switching places with Nairobi, which now ranks 136th, according to the Global Startup Ecosystem Index 2021 by StartupBlink that ranked 1,000 cities and 100 countries.\n\nThe large population of Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s commercial hub is one of the reasons for the rise in start-ups in the city.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising that Lagos is the top start-up hub in Africa,\u201d Andrew S Nevin, Partner/Chief Economist, PwC, Nigeria said.\n\nThis is because, according to Nevin, \u201cThere are big challenges to solve on a massive scale,\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s only solvable with innovation.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s top economic performer has one of Nigeria\u2019s highest urbanisation rates as more people arrive in search of opportunity, creating demand for accommodation, financial service products, roads, health care and electricity, amongst other things.\n\nAlthough Lagos is Nigeria\u2019s smallest by land area, the centre of excellence is Africa\u2019s largest, a densely-packed megalopolis that is home to an estimated 21 million people. Nigeria\u2019s most populous.\n\nOn its own, Nigeria\u2019s economic capital would rank as Africa\u2019s seventh-largest economy. Known for its traffic gridlock and entrepreneurial dynamism, Lagos alone is responsible for about 30 percent of Nigeria\u2019s gross domestic product. If Lagos was a country, its economy which is worth over $136-billion would not only be the seventh-largest in Africa, it would be ahead of Cote D\u2019Ivoire and Kenya.\n\nA breakdown of the report by StartupBlink, one of the world\u2019s most comprehensive startup ecosystem map and research centres revealed that Lagos was also ranked in the global top 50 cities for E-commerce & Retail Technology and in the global top 100 for both Transportation Technology and Education Technology, a natural by-product of the pandemic\u2019s digital acceleration.\n\nIbadan was another city that saw a massive increase in ranking, jumping 601 spots to 353rd globally and 2nd in Nigeria, surpassing the Nigerian capital of Abuja. The latter ranked 3rd nationally, fell 12 spots to 466th on the global ranking, while Port Harcourt decreased by 6 spots to 906th.\n\nThe newest Nigerian city in the rankings, Enugu, came out at the 978th spot globally and 5th nationally. Benin City increased 9 spots to 979th, while Kano jumped 14 spots to 981st. In total, Nigeria now has seven cities in the global top 1000 and continues to have the highest number of ranked cities of any African nation.\n\nAs a result, Nigeria reported one of the notable increases in Africa, it leapt 5 spots to now rank 63rd globally. It is the highest-ranking country in Western Africa and the 3rd highest-ranking country in Africa.\n\n\u201cNigeria has increased significantly, gaining 5 spots to rank 63rd globally. It is the highest-ranking country in Western Africa and the 3rd highest-ranking country in Africa,\u201d research analysts at StartupBlink, said.\n\nWithin Africa, the Global Startup Ecosystem Index 2021 showed that there were differences among sub-regions. Central Africa had no representation in the rankings; Eastern Africa grew from 4 to 6 countries in the global top 100. Northern Africa kept its three representatives in the global top 100, yet two of the three nations (Tunisia and Morocco) declined in rank.\n\nSouthern Africa had a good year; not only did South Africa join the global top 50 this year, but a second Southern African country (Namibia) joined the rankings.\n\nIt was a good year for Western Africa as all ranked countries (Nigeria, Ghana, and Cape Verde) improved their rankings.\n\nDespite nurturing unicorns like Jumia, an online shop for electronics, phones, and fashion, Nigeria, according to StartupBlink, faces some major challenges, such as a lack of financing options and even a lack of broadband internet infrastructure.\n\n\u201cGovernment entrepreneurship programs are present but need to be developed, as does legislation and public sector support,\u201d the report said.\n\nNigerian and Kenyan start-ups accounted for over 77 percent of the total investment attracted in 2020. Nigeria alone was estimated to have been backed by more than $600 million in venture capital funding in 2019.\n\nAccess to funding for many of the smaller start-ups in Africa\u2019s largest economy remains a key challenge that is crippling growth.",

Whatever it is, that is the value of APC.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to do a lot to build this party, and we need our youths more than ever before for them to continue with this legacy that this administration has established all over the country.\n\n\u201cThat means we have to see our selves as brothers and sisters regardless of where we come from.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President added that, \u201cour tribe or even ethnic group, our religious persuasion should not matter when it comes to uniting this country.\n\n\u201c[And] as APC, the onus is on us to provide security and an economy that will bring growth and development to give people the kind of life that is meaningful.\n\n\u201cWe can ask others to join us, but we are the ones to do it, so we need all hands on deck.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that the plan of the APC to deliver on most of its promises to Nigerians was stalled in the first tenure of the President Buhari administration as a result of the feud between the National Assembly and the Executive arm of government.\n\n\u201cWhen we were voted in 2019 as leaders of the National Assembly, we were conscious of one thing, that our mandate that was given to us by Nigerians in 2015 had suffered disruption and dislocation.\n\n\u201cFor four years (2015 to 2019), our government could not perform optimally because of the then crisis between the parliament \u2013 the National Assembly \u2013 and the Executive arm of government.\n\n\u201cSo, APC had already lost four very important years. And, that was supposed to be the years that we should have convinced Nigerians that they took the right decision by voting out a PDP administration in 2015.\n\n\u201cWhat are our options? We are one party in different arms of government. Our policies are supposed to be the same. Our programmes and projects are supposed to be the same, whether you\u2019re in the legislature or the executive.\n\n\u201cSo long as you are APC, that is your programme and project, that is your government and you are bound to make it succeed.\n\n\u201cSo, we took the conscious decision of working in harmony that our relationship must be characterized by consultation, coordination, partnership and mutual respect, that we must succeed in the second tenure (2019 \u2013 2023).\n\n\u201cOtherwise, in 2023, many would like to see our backs if you can\u2019t provide the services expected of you in your first four years.\n\n\u201c[And] you to change and do better, why would anybody give you eight years?\n\n\u201cSo, we felt we have an obligation to Nigerians who voted for us, to our people in APC and to our country, that we must work in such a fashion and manner that government is able to deliver services to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe Senate President further disclosed that the ongoing amendment to the 1999 constitution will accord priority to inclusion of youths in governance.\n\nHe explained that the aim was to ensure that power is divested to younger generation in a way that allows them to participate in the process.\n\n\u201cPower is not given by opposition. When were out of power or when we came in, another party was in control of the country \u2013 the PDP.\n\n\u201cThere was no way the PDP could have given us power a la carte, but the people of Nigeria mobilized and, of course, that government was voted out.\n\n\u201cBut when it is a family affair, and this is my position, power is given not taken. Imagine yourself and your children, you want them to be better than you.\n\n\u201cBut when you say power will not be given, that family is dysfunctional. So, power is given and can be given. How I wish it would be given.\n\n\u201cI am with you and I am on your side. I am still on the side that we can give power to our youths.\n\n\u201cWe should enable them, prepare them and tell them this is the way to go. You have seen us do it, and you can do better because of the energy and capacity that you have.\n\n\u201cThese days, our youths have more capacities, what they may lack is that clout.\n\n\u201cSo, we also have to mentor our youths, but we have to give them the opportunity to participate in governance.\n\n\u201cI really feel we can do better to have more youths and more women in our government and party positions.\u201d",

          "text": "By Abankula\n\nThe Anambra governorship ambition of Chukwuma Soludo, the former CBN governor, has run into troubled waters.\n\nThe deepening schism in his All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) may make INEC apply the Zamfara treatment, reports indicated.\n\nIn Zamfara, the All Progressives Congress, in the run-up to the 2019 elections, broke into factions and failed to hold legal primaries for all elective posts.\n\nINEC and the courts later stripped the party of the entire posts won, many by landslide.\n\nTwo days to the 23 June primary of APGA to pick its flag bearer, a faction led by Jude Okeke, said the exercise may be futile.\n\nHe said INEC might exclude the party from the governorship election slated for November 6.\n\nThe Publicity Secretary of the Okeke-led faction of the party, Ikechukwu Chukwunyere, gave reasons the disqualification may happen.\n\nIn a report by Punch, The group accused the Victor Oye-led faction of the party of alleged refusal to submit the statutory 21 days notice on the Special Ward Congress to the Commission.\n\nChukwunyere specifically said the Oye faction did not duly notify INEC on the plan to hold ward congresses ahead of the governorship poll within the 21 days recommended by its regulations and Section 85 of the Electoral Act.\n\nThe Publicity Secretary, who distributed copies of the INEC letter confirming the non-receipt of APGA\u2019s 21 days notification, said the Electoral umpire had communicated its position on the matter to the Okeke\u2019s faction in two separate letters.\n\nIn one of the letters, obtained by our correspondent, the commission addressed his position to the principal counsel of a law firm, Omas and Partners, who had earlier written and asked for the information while relying on the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nThe letter dated June 18, 2021 and signed by the Secretary to the Commission, Rose Oriaran-Anthony, read:\n\n\u201cThis is to inform you that the commission did not receive the statutory 21 days\u2019 notice for the nomination of APGA Anambra State governorship candidate from Victor Oye led APGA.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, the commission did not monitor the said ward congress and as such, there is no monitoring report of the Commission.\u201d\n\nThe second letter, also signed by Oriaran-Anthony, and addressed to the National Chairman of APGA also read, \u201cPlease refer to your letter dated June 16, 2021 forwarding the list of delegates for the nomination of APGA\u2019s Governorship Candidate in the forthcoming Anambra State Governorship Election.\n\n\u201cThis is to notify you that the records of the Commission indicate that APGA did not duly notify the Commission of the date of the Congress where the ad hoc delegates were elected as required by Section 85 of the Electoral Act 2010 (As Amended)\n\n\u201cAccordingly the Commission is unable to confirm if the Ad hoc Delegates list submitted by your party is the outcome of a democratic process as required by Section 87(7) of the Electoral Act 2010 (As Amended).\n\n\u201cThe Commission wishes to emphasize the need for full compliance with all legal requirements for the conduct of Party Primaries as earlier communicated in the Commissions letter to your Party dated 7 June 2021 (REF: INEC/DEPM/UPPM/119/1/37).\u201d\n\nChukwunyere alleged that the two letters by INEC have therefore rendered APGA\u2019s governorship primary being proposed for Wednesday, June 23, as an exercise in futility because \u201cthe use of invalid delegate list will exclude the party from the election.\u201d\n\nChukwunyere further alleged that the Okeke faction remains the only option and hope for APGA to have a candidate in the Anambra Governorship Election since it had dully submitted all the notices.\n\nChukwunyere said, \u201cWe are aware of the position of INEC on this matter. As disheartening as it is, there is still hope for the party.\n\n\u201cAlthough the Oye faction had missed the issuance of statutory notice, all hope is not lost if the party backs the Okeke faction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is because the Okeke faction has served all valid notices for the APGA primary in Anambra. It is important to join hands with the faction now if the party must take part in the election,\u201d he added.\n\nProfessor Chukwuma Soludo, is a frontrunner to clinch the governorship ticket of APGA. He is from Anambra south, where it is believed, APGA may pick its candidate.\n\nSeven other aspirants are in the race against him.\n\nThey are Chukwuma Umeoji, Carter Umeh, Chief Damian Okoro, Chief Akachukwu Nwankpo, Okwudili Nwankwo and hankGod Kenechukwu Ibeh.\n\nThree of the aspirants are serving members of the Anambra State House of Assembly.",

          "text": "During the 2015 presidential election campaign, one of the primary manifestos of the All Progressives Congress, APC, was to restructure the country for total transformation, according to NewsDirect.\n\nExpectations were high following President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s election victory, as Nigerians patiently awaited the new political system promised on the campaign trail, only to find gestures indicating otherwise.\n\nDr. Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment, informed Nigerians on September 6, 2016, that the president was still working to fulfill his campaign pledges, particularly the restructuring of the country.\n\nThe Minister told journalists in Awka, Anambra State, said the Buhari administration has already begun the restructuring process, beginning with the economy.\n\nHe said, \u201cNigerians have changed their way of doing things for the better and have become more prudent and judicious in their spending pattern.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one after the other. After economic restructuring to reposition the economy of this country, the Buhari administration will embark on the political restructuring and will set the modalities for the exercise.\u201d\n\nHowever, the president, who has been silent on the reorganization for years, has recently spoken out against calls for a new political structure.\n\nOn June 19, the president declared that his administration will not restructure the country, claiming that those advocating for split and restructuring are foolish and uninformed about war.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe other issue is that those who are currently calling for restructuring and conference on what they call ethnic nationality, If you go to Southern Kaduna, Taraba, who is to represent them? We have a different combination of ethnicity in many parts of the country. Even Kano and Kaduna Igbo have properties. The same goes for Yorubas.\n\n\u201cThere are Fulani in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. So those calling for whether separation or restructuring, some of them I will say they are very naive or even mischievously dangerous. Those agitating for restructuring are ignorant of war and its consequences. Because Nigeria is a dominant force in west Africa\u201d.\n\nThe president\u2019s declaration has continued to trigger reactions from concerned Nigerians as many took to their social media handle to lambast the president.\n\nA former presidential aide, Reno Omokri described Buhari\u2019s promise as an election scam stating that it was the promise that gave him the victory in 2015.\n\n\u201cIf a Nigerian youth makes a false promise of marriage to a woman and obtains money from her, the EFCC will arrest him for \u2018romance scam\u2019.\n\n\u201cYet, Buhari made false promises to restructure Nigeria and obtained votes from Nigerians based on that. Is that not an\u2018 election scam\u2019? The biggest issue General Buhari campaigned on in 2015 was restructuring. Now, he says he will NEVER restructure Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIs that not a scam? That is deceit. That is obtaining votes by false pretences. That is why the Southwest and Southeast are agitating for secession.\n\n\u201cMay Buhari not drive Nigeria to war! Twitter deleted his tweet and he banned them. What about all the promises he made that he has now deleted? Should we ban Buhari too\u201d.\n\nA respondent, Promise Emeka who spoke to DAILY POST in Abuja, said the president used restructuring to market himself during the election.\n\n\u201cThey knew very well that the Southeast and South-South belong to the People\u2019s Democratic Party, PDP so they used restructuring to deceive our leaders to win the election.\n\n\u201cSeven years after the election, we are yet to get the promise. The Southern Leaders need to wise up. Northerners have a different agenda for this country than what we can see. They are afraid of standing alone and that is why the country would remain the way it is.\n\n\u201cThe only thing they know is dragging us back and that is why we are agitating for our own sovereign nation, Biafra. No mallam will come to Biafra after our freedom to tell us how to run our government\u201d, he stated.\n\nSimilarly, an On-Air Personality, Mr Alfred Ademola expressed shock that Buhari \u2018Mr Integrity\u2019 would lie to millions of Nigerian.\n\n\u201cHonestly we thought this man was a Messiah, someone who has all qualities of a good leader not knowing that we were heading for doom.\n\n\u201cFirst it was the promise of paying youths five thousand Naira for being jobless, which even the one who used to be a pastor denied openly. \u2018Kai! This country na joke\u2019.\n\nI don\u2019t even think about this administration anymore, I have learnt to live with the reality since I cannot change the situation. May God give us life so we can try again in 2023 but are we going to have a candidate from a foreign country? Is it not these deceivers that will present candidates to us? It is well with Nigeria.",

          "text": "The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Monday announced that it has reduced the life ban imposed on former Head Coach of Nigeria\u2019s Super Eagles, Samson Siasia to five years.\n\nWorld football governing body, FIFA, had slammed Siasia with life ban over alleged match fixing scandal.\n\nHowever, the Court ruled that Siasia was a first offender and it would be injustice to ban him for life even when he has not received any financial benefit from the deal that brought the punishment on him.\n\nThe judgement was delivered after CAS heard Siasia\u2019s appeal earlier.\n\nThe CAS said in a media release Monday afternoon that \u201cCAS has issued its decision in the appeal filed by the Nigerian football coach Samson Siasia against the decision rendered by the Adjudicatory Chamber of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) on 11 April 2019 (the Challenged Decision).\n\n\u201cIn such decision, Samson Siasia was found guilty of infringement of article 1 (bribery) of the 2009 FIFA Code of Ethics and sanctioned with a life ban from taking part in any kind of football-related activity at national and international level (administrative, sports or any other) and a fine of CHF 50,000 was imposed on him.\n\n\u201cIn 2010, a match fixer tried to involve Mr Siasia as a coach of a club under his strict instructions. With the promise of employment benefits, Mr Siasia would have had to always field several players under the control of the match fixer.\n\n\u201cThe negotiations between the match fixer and Mr Siasia in relation to the conditions of employment were conducted by email over a period of two months. \u201cEventually, the club did not accept or could not afford Mr Siasia\u2019s requests and the negotiations ended.\n\n\u201cThe CAS Panel confirmed the Challenged Decision, with the exception of the following elements:\n\n\u201cMr Siasia is banned for 5 (five) years from taking part in any kind of football-related activity at national and international level (administrative, sports or any other) as of 16 August 2019.\n\n\u201cThe imposed fine of CHF 50,000 (fifty thousand Swiss Francs) on Mr Siasia is set aside.\n\n\u201cThe Panel determined the imposition of a life ban to be disproportionate for a first offence which was committed passively and which had not had an adverse or immediate effect on football stakeholders, and that a five-year ban would still achieve the envisaged aim of punishing the infringement committed by Mr Siasia.\n\n\u201cThe Panel acknowledged the need for sanctions to be sufficiently high enough to eradicate bribery and especially match-fixing in football.\n\n\u201cHowever, the Panel considered in the particular circumstances of this matter that it would be inappropriate and excessive to impose a financial sanction in addition to the five-year ban, since the ban sanction already incorporated a financial punishment in eliminating football as a source of revenue for Mr Siasia, and considering that Mr Siasia had not obtained any gain or pecuniary benefit from his unethical behavior.\u201d",

          "text": "The Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, is confident that Nigeria will remain united as a strong nation to the frustration of those waiting to see the country broken into pieces.\n\nHe made the remark on Monday in Abuja at the maiden edition of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Progressives Youth Conference.\n\n\u201cIn the area of disruption and disruptive innovation, the principle that we are stronger together than in little part is a sound principle and it is my respectful view that those who advocate the breaking up of the country are terribly wrong,\u201d Professor Osinbajo told a crowd of youths and party chieftains at the International Conference Centre in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nHe added, \u201cOur size is crucial for geopolitical and economic relevance. Our people will be better served by a large populous and diverse country. As with all big and diverse countries, our business is to make this union work; it is to give everybody a sense of belonging.\n\n\u201cAll of those waiting on the sidelines, hoping that this big country called Nigeria will break up into bits so that they can pick up the pieces, will be very sorely disappointed and I am very sure that those of you who are seated here today will prevent that from happening.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President acknowledged the need for all Nigerians to be guaranteed a fair chance at improving their human condition and urged the youth to be a part of conversations that will ensure this.\n\nHe asked the young generation not just to say it was time for them and for the older people to give way, stressing that such was unlikely to happen.\n\nProfessor Osinbajo, however, stated that it was the strength of the ideas and the depth of the youths\u2019 organisation and not age that would retire those ahead of them.\n\n\u201cI am also frankly not very impressed with the notion that the role and power of young people are somehow postponed until elders have gone, or that there\u2019s some kind of generational queue that to which we all must subscribe.\n\n\u201cEven if that was true at some point, today, that notion stands on very weak legs indeed,\u201d he said.\n\nThe event had in attendance APC youth leaders and older party leaders from various parts of the country, as well as top government officials.\n\nConversations at the conference centred on more youth inclusiveness in party politics and the positioning of young people for the 2023 general elections.",

Without wasting much of your time, permit me to X-ray some of the achievements as follows:\n\nCONSPIRACY/MURDER/ ARMED ROBBERY AND THE ARREST OF SUSPECTED SELF-CONFESSED ESN/IPOB MEMBERS;\n\nAt about 1830hrs of 23/5/2021, while acting on credible information suspected ESN/ IPOB members were meeting at Agubia Ikwo in the resident of one Ebube Ivom \u2018m\u2019 age 31yrs, their suspected ESN/IPOB Sector Commander.\n\nThe said meeting had in attendance a Cross River State-based native doctor (Ezemuo), who was invited to fortify members of the group with marks on different parts of their bodies, as antidotes to bullets in preparation to attack Onueke Divisional Headquarters and INEC office both in Ezza South Local Government Area of the State by 8:30pm of the same day, 23rd May, 2021.\n\nOn the strength of the information, the command swiftly deployed a team of Police Operatives in collaboration with Neighbourhood Watch of Ikwo, in the process thirty-nine (39) male suspects, made up of indigenes of Ebonyi State and two non-indigenes from neighbouring Abia State were arrested and large quantities of juju charms were recovered from them together with living creatures such as Tortoise and hawk.\n\nEight (8) of these suspects made useful statements to the Police, while one of them, Elom Daniel \u2018m\u2019 age 17 years took Police Operatives to their hideout at Agbaja-Izzi community in Abakaliki Local Government Area of the State, where the owner of the house escaped leaving behind his wife and a child.

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nHalima Gayam, Lafia\n\nIn February, youths in Mada station community in Nasarawa state began to loosen and cut railway tracks that connect the area to the rest of the country.\n\nAlthough the Mada station tracks, about 130km away from Abuja, had not been in use for about five years, the infrastructure was still good enough for the vandals.\n\nBy June, most of the route\u2019s six tracks laid bare, except for its ballast.\n\nThe portions left untouched were only those protected by the wheels of an abandoned coach.\n\nEven the culvert under the tracks were dug and the water pipes vandalised.\n\n\u2018Night operation\u2019\n\n\u201cWe were not happy about it,\u201d a resident of the community Mikailu Abdullahi, told Channels Television. \u201cWe did our best to stop them, but we couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSome community members reported the vandalisation to the police and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), but they were told there weren\u2019t enough arms to enforce arrests, according to a staff of the Nigeria Railway Corporation in Mada station who pleaded anonymity.\n\n\u201cThe youths came in numbers at night to vandalise the tracks,\u201d the staff said. \u201cIn one of the incidents, six armed men came here to arrest a trailer loaded with railway materials. But they couldn\u2019t make the arrest because the youths refused.\u201d\n\nAnother railway staff suggested that the youths were motivated by a sense of entitlement.\n\n\u201cThe youths are claiming that the tracks are their father\u2019s and they have to chop (eat),\u201d he said. \u201cThey are also claiming they are indigenes of the area, so nobody can stop them to do whatever they want to do.\n\n\u201cWe did our best (to stop them). When we reported to the nearest police station and civil defence, they said there are no arms and mobility. So this is how the vandalism continued.\u201d\n\nIn May, the police stepped in and have now arrested 35 of the vandals, including two Chinese nationals, local politicians, police and NSCDC officials, and a railway official.\n\nChinese connection\n\nThe youths, according to the police, were in cahoots with several top politicians, corrupt police officers and NSCDC staff, and Chinese nationals.\n\nAfter welders perform the loosening and cutting, the tracks and sleepers are piled and arranged in lorries, before they are ferried to a steel company run by a Chinese suspect, Marra Thai.\n\nMr Thai is said to be the main collector of the vandalised tracks.\n\nAccording to the Nasarawa Commissioner of Police, Bola Longe, the tracks are compressed and dissolved \u201cand then later on they will mass produce new ones and use it for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether it is legal or not,\u201d Mr Thai, whose steel company is based in Abuja, said when asked why he received vandalised tracks. \u201cAnd we asked somebody to confirm it, and they said there was no problem. That\u2019s why we collected it.\u201d\n\nBut the police said Mr Thai\u2019s lawyer offered a N600,000 bribe when the police caught up with his client.\n\nAniette Eyoh, the officer who heads the anti-vandalism template created by the police, rejected the bribe. One lorry driver implicated in the vandalism operation also offered Officer Eyoh N150,000.\n\nThe monies were displayed when the suspects were paraded this month.\n\n\u201cWe have resolved, with unbending determination, that whosoever comes into our radar, no matter who, will be seen, and the person will be arrested and treated in accordance with the provision of the law,\u201d Mr Longe, the police chief, said.\n\n\u2018An act of terrorism\u2019\n\nThe vandalisation of rail tracks is a recurring headache in Nigeria. While the Federal Government has prioritised the revitalisation of the country\u2019s railway network, vandals appear to have upped their activities.\n\nThis month, the police announced that it had cracked down on a criminal syndicate engaged in vandalising rail tracks across the North-West and North-Central.\n\nThe operation was uncovered after the police raided a warehouse in Gboko, Benue state.\n\nInside the warehouse, the police discovered different vandalised rail equipment, stolen rail installation racks, weld-shear, rail puller, other rail accessories and consumables.\n\nBut many of the syndicate members are still at large.\n\nThe Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, has described such vandalisation as acts of terrorism.\n\n\u201cRemoval of rail tracks can cause train derailment, with deadly consequences,\u201d he said at a town hall meeting recently.\n\nWhile promising to prosecute anyone suspected of vandalising public property, the Minister has also pleaded with Nigerians to take ownership of the assets, as they \u201cmust be protected for the benefit of all.\u201d",
