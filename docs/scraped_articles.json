          "title": "Hackers now unlock, steal vehicles, NCC warns Nigerians",
          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission, on Sunday, said hackers now unlock vehicles for purpose of stealing and other vices, saying the new trend also offers hackers the opportunity to make away with the cars they hacked.\n\nAccording to the NCC, the ongoing cyber-vulnerability allows a nearby hacker to unlock vehicles, start their engines wirelessly and make away with cars.\n\nThe NCC stated this in a statement on Sunday signed by its Director, Public Affairs, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, titled, \u2018Hackers can unlock, steal your vehicles, NCC alerts Nigerians\u2019.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe fact that car remotes are categorized short range devices that make use of radio frequency (RF) to lock and unlock cars informed the need for the Commission to alert the general public on this emergent danger, where hackers take advantage to unlock and start a compromised car.\n\n\u201cAccording to the latest advisory released by the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), the Cybersecurity Centre for the telecom sector established by the NCC, the vulnerability is a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack or, more specifically, a replay attack in which an attacker intercepts the RF signals normally sent from a remote key fob to the car, manipulates these signals, and re-sends them later to unlock the car at will.\n\n\u201cWith this latest type of cyber-attack, it is also possible to manipulate the captured commands and re-transmit them to achieve a different outcome altogether. \u201cMultiple researchers disclosed a vulnerability, which is said to be used by a nearby attacker to unlock some Honda and Acura car models and start their engines wirelessly. The attack consists of a threat actor capturing the radio frequency (RF) signals sent from your key fob to the car and resending these signals to take control of your car\u2019s remote keyless entry system,\u201d the advisory stated.\n\nOn solutions that can be adopted by car owners, the advisory added, \u201cWhen affected, the only mitigation is to reset your key fob at the dealership. Besides, the affected car manufacturer may provide a security mechanism that generate fresh codes for each authentication request, this makes it difficult for an attacker to \u2018replay\u2019 the codes thereafter. Additionally, vulnerable car users should store their key fobs in signal-blocking \u2018Faraday pouches\u2019 when not in use.\u201d\n\n\u201cImportantly, car owners in the stated categories are advised to choose Passive Keyless Entry (PKE) as opposed to Remote Keyless Entry (RKE), which would make it harder for an attacker to read the signal due to the fact that criminals would need to be at close proximity to carry out their nefarious acts.\n\n\u201cThe PKE is an automotive security system that operates automatically when the user is in proximity to the vehicle, unlocking the door on approach or when the door handle is pulled, and also locking it when the user walks away or touches the car on exit. The RKE system, on the other hand, represents the standard solution for conveniently locking and unlocking a vehicle\u2019s doors and luggage compartment by remote control.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project has filed a lawsuit against the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), \u201cover his failure to probe allegations that over N1.48 trillion reportedly spent on maintaining the country\u2019s four refineries between 2015 and 2020 may have been stolen, mismanaged or diverted into private pockets.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, the government reportedly spent N10.23 billion in June 2020 on three refineries that processed zero crude. Also in 2021, the government approved $1.5 billion (about N600 billion) to repair the Port Harcourt refinery. Despite the huge spending, the refineries are still not working while fuel scarcity persists.\n\nIn the suit number FHC/L/CS/806/2022 filed last week at the Federal High Court, Lagos, SERAP is seeking \u201can order of mandamus to direct and compel Buhari to investigate the spending on Nigeria\u2019s refineries, and alleged mismanagement of public funds budgeted for maintaining the refineries since 1999.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also seeking \u201can order of mandamus to compel Buhari to ensure the prosecution of anyone suspected to be responsible for the importation and distribution of dirty fuel into Nigeria, and to identify and ensure access to justice and effective remedies to affected victims.\u201d\n\nThe suit filed on behalf of SERAP by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Ms Adelanke Aremo, read in part, \u201cDirecting and compelling President Buhari to probe allegations of corruption and mismanagement of the money meant to repair the country\u2019s refineries would advance the rights of victims of corruption to restitution, compensation and guarantee of non-repetition.\n\n\u201cCombating the corruption epidemic in the oil sector would alleviate poverty, improve access of Nigerians to basic public goods and services, and enhance the ability of the government to meet its human rights and anti-corruption obligations.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite the country\u2019s enormous oil wealth, ordinary Nigerians have derived very little benefit from their own natural wealth and resources, primarily because of widespread grand corruption, and the impunity of perpetrators.\n\n\u201cHigh-ranking public officials, including officers of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited suspected of complicity in the allegations of corruption and mismanagement in the oil sector, and the importation and distribution of adulterated fuel have continued to enjoy impunity.\n\n\u201cAccording to reports, the government spends over N264 billion annually to operate and maintain the country\u2019s refineries. Successive governments have reportedly spent trillions of Naira to rehabilitate, operate and maintain the refineries that have produced little or no fuel.\n\n\u201cThe government reportedly spent $396 million for maintenance of the country\u2019s refineries between 2015 and 2020 alone. Despite this huge spending, millions of Nigerians continue to lack access to full and unhindered supply of fuel.\n\n\u201cAbout N82.82 billion was reportedly spent in 2015; N78.95 billion in 2016; N604.127 billion in 2017; N426.66 billion in 2019; N218.18 billion in 2019, and N64.534 billion expenditure was recorded from January to June 2020.\u201d\n\nJoined in the suit as Respondent is Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN, Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice.\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Alfred Adewale Martins has condemned in very strong terms the stoning and killing of Miss Deborah Yakubu in Sokoto State by a mob of overzealous students for alleged blasphemy.\n\n\n\nHe also charged the law enforcement agencies to quickly swing into action to investigate the matter to identify the culprits and bring them to justice according to the Nigerian criminal law.\n\n\n\nHe said that the alleged killing of young Deborah Yakubu, a female student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education is appalling, provocative, and inhuman.\n\n\n\nSuch acts, if not checked forthwith, he warned, are capable of further exacerbating religious tension, thereby causing disaffection amongst the peace-loving people of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nIn a release signed by the Director of Social Communications, Rev.

No one has a right to arbitrarily shed human blood.\n\nIt is not in our constitution; it is not in our customs or tradition. Such an act is archaic and reprehensible and should be expunged totally from our DNA.

Despite the huge spending, the refineries are still not working while fuel scarcity persists.\n\nIn the suit filed last week at the Federal High Court, Lagos by its lawyers Kolawole Oluwadare and Ms Adelanke Aremo, SERAP is seeking \u201can order of mandamus to direct and compel President Buhari to investigate the spending on Nigeria\u2019s refineries, and alleged mismanagement of public funds budgeted for maintaining the refineries since 1999.\u201d\n\nSERAP is also seeking \u201can order of mandamus to compel President Buhari to ensure the prosecution of anyone suspected to be responsible for the importation and distribution of dirty fuel into Nigeria, and to identify and ensure access to justice and effective remedies to affected victims.\n\n\u201cAn order of mandamus to direct and compel President Buhari to instruct appropriate anti-corruption agencies to jointly track and monitor the spending of public funds to rehabilitate, operate, and maintain Nigeria\u2019s refineries.\u201d\n\nThe filed suit read in part: \u201cNigeria has made legally binding commitments under the UN Convention against Corruption to ensure accountability in the management of public resources. These commitments ought to be fully upheld and respected.\n\n\u201cDirecting and compelling President Buhari to probe allegations of corruption and mismanagement of the money meant to repair the country\u2019s refineries would advance the rights of victims of corruption to restitution, compensation and guarantee of non-repetition.\n\n\u201cCombating the corruption epidemic in the oil sector would alleviate poverty, improve access of Nigerians to basic public goods and services, and enhance the ability of the government to meet its human rights and anti-corruption obligations.\n\n\u201cHigh-ranking public officials, including officers of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited suspected of complicity in the allegations of corruption and mismanagement in the oil sector, and the importation and distribution of adulterated fuel have continued to enjoy impunity.\n\n\u201cAccording to reports, petroleum products with methanol quantities above Nigeria\u2019s specification were recently imported into the country.\n\n\u201cNNPC reportedly stated that the methanol-blended petrol was imported into the country by a few suppliers through four premium motor spirit cargoes under its Direct Sales Direct Purchase (DSDP) arrangement.\n\n\u201cAccording to reports, for every 200 litres of the adulterated product, 800 litres of petrol with good quality would be required for the blending to be done.\n\n\u201cAccording to reports, the government spends over N264 billion annually to operate and maintain the country\u2019s refineries. Successive governments have reportedly spent trillions of Naira to rehabilitate, operate and maintain the refineries that have produced little or no fuel.\n\n\u201cThe government reportedly spent $396 million for maintenance of the country\u2019s refineries between 2015 and 2020 alone. Despite this huge spending, millions of Nigerians continue to lack access to full and unhindered supply of fuel.\n\n\u201cAbout N82.82 billion was reportedly spent in 2015; N78.95 billion in 2016; N604.127 billion in 2017; N426.66 billion in 2019; N218.18 billion in 2019, and N64.534 billion expenditure was recorded from January to June 2020.\u201d\n\nHowever, no date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) says it wishes to alert telecom consumers and members of the public on an ongoing cyber-vulnerability that allows a nearby hacker to unlock vehicles, start their engines wirelessly and make away with the cars.\n\nIt said that the fact that car remotes are categorized short range devices that make use of radio frequency (RF) to lock and unlock cars informed the need for the Commission to alert the general public on this danger, where hackers take advantage to unlock and start a compromised car.\n\nAccording to the latest advisory released by the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), the Cybersecurity Centre for the telecom sector established by the NCC, the vulnerability is a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack or, more specifically, a replay attack, in which an attacker intercepts the RF signals normally sent from a remote key fob to the car, manipulates these signals, and re-sends them later to unlock the car at will.\n\nThe Commission said that with this latest type of cyber-attack, it is also possible to manipulate the captured commands and re-transmit them to achieve a different outcome altogether.\n\n\u201cMultiple researchers disclosed a vulnerability, which is said to be used by a nearby attacker to unlock some Honda and Acura car models and start their engines wirelessly.\n\n\u201cThe attack consists of a threat actor capturing the radio frequency (RF) signals sent from your key fob to the car and resending these signals to take control of your car\u2019s remote keyless entry system,\u201d the advisory stated emphatically.\n\nHowever, the NCC-CSIRT, in the advisory, has offered some precautionary measures that could be adopted by car owners to prevent falling victim to the attack.\n\nAccording to the cyber-alert unit of the Commission, \u201cWhen affected, the only mitigation is to reset your key fob at the dealership. Besides, the affected car manufacturer may provide a security mechanism that generate fresh codes for each authentication request, this makes it difficult for an attacker to \u2018replay\u2019 the codes thereafter.\u201d\n\nIt said that vulnerable car users should store their key fobs in signal-blocking \u2019Faraday pouches\u2019 when not in use.\n\nImportantly, the Commission said that car owners in the stated categories are advised to choose Passive Keyless Entry (PKE) as opposed to Remote Keyless Entry (RKE), which would make it harder for an attacker to read the signal due to the fact that criminals would need to be at close proximity to carry out their nefarious acts.\n\nIt explained that the PKE is an automotive security system that operates automatically when the user is in proximity to the vehicle, unlocking the door on approach or when the door handle is pulled, and also locking it when the user walks away or touches the car on exit.\n\nThe RKE system, according to the Commission, on the other hand, represents the standard solution for conveniently locking and unlocking a vehicle\u2019s doors and luggage compartment by remote control.\n\nAdditionally, in a related advisory, the NCC, based on another detection by CSIRT, informed the general public about the resurgence of Joker Trojan-Infected Android Apps on Google Play Store.\n\nThis arose due to the activities of criminals who intentionally download legitimate apps from the Play Store, modify them by embedding the Trojan malware and then uploading the app back to the Play Store with a new name.\n\nIt said that the malicious payload is only activated once the apps goes live on the Play Store, which enables the apps to scale through Google\u2019s strict evaluation process.\n\nOnce installed, these apps request for permissions that once granted, enable the apps to have access to critical functions such as text messages and notifications.\n\nAs a consequence, it explained further that a compromised device will subscribe unwitting users to premium services, billing them for services that do not exist. A device like this can also be used to commit Short Messaging Service (SMS) fraud while the owner is unaware.\n\n\u201cIt can click on online ads automatically and even use SMS One Time password (OTPs) to secretly approve payments. Without checking bank statements, the user will be unaware that he or she has subscribed to an online service. Other actions, such as stealing text messages, contacts, and other device data, are also possible,\u201d the Commission said.\n\nIt warned that to avoid falling victim to the manipulation of hackers deploying Joker Trojan-Infected Android Apps, Android users must avoid downloading unnecessary apps or installing apps from unofficial sources.\n\nThe NCC also said it wishes to advise telecom consumers to ensure that apps installed from the Google Play Store are heavily scrutinized by reading reviews, assessing the developers, perusing the terms of use and only granting the necessary permissions.\n\nConclusively, the NCC recommended that unauthorised transactions be checked against any installed app.\n\n\u201cIndeed, any apps not in use should be deleted while users are also advised to ensure that a device is always patched and updated to the latest software,\u201d the Commission said in a statement signed by Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, its Director of Public Affairs.",

          "title": "2023: PDP\u2019S presidential contenders and pretenders",
          "text": "Fourteen days to the presidential primaries of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP), leading contenders for the presidential ticket of the party are emerging as the aspirants get set to do battle later in the month. \u2018Dare Odufowokan, Assistant Editor examines the emerging forerunners in the contest and reports on their chances of clinching the 2023 presidential ticket of the opposition party.\n\nPRESIDENTIAL aspirants on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), after months of campaigns from one state to the other in search of the support of the party\u2019s 3,700 delegates ahead of the party\u2019s Presidential primary scheduled for May 28-29, 2022, are now ready to do battle for the opposition\u2019s party\u2019s much coveted 2023 presidential ticket.\n\nThe Nation gathered that most of the presidential hopefuls are now busy lobbying party leaders and other prominent stakeholders for support in pursuit of their aspirations. \u201cThe underground politicking has increased just as the open campaign is subsiding. The serious ones among the aspirants have reached out to the delegates who will be voting at the primary election. Now, they are wrapping up their activities by talking to the leaders and stakeholders in each state,\u201d a source said.\n\nSeventeen chieftains of the opposition party paid N41million to obtain the expression of interest and nomination forms of PDP. Upon the closure of the sales of the forms, the party proceeded to screen the aspirants. The presidential screening committee of the party headed by Senator David Mark attended to all the aspirants, and at the end of the process, 15 of them were cleared while two were disqualified from the race.\n\nPDP chieftains who appeared before the screening committee include former Vice President, Abubakar Atiku, two former Senate Presidents, Bukola Saraki and Anyim Pius Anyim as well as Governors Aminu Tambuwa, Nyesom Wike, Bala Mohammed, Emmanuel Udom, of Sokoto, Rivers, Bauchi and Akwa Ibom states respectively.\n\nOthers are businessman, Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, former Governors Peter Obi and Ayo Fayose of Anambra and Ekiti States, Chief Sam Ohunabunwa, Dele Momodu, Charles Okwudili, Chikwendu Kalu, Cosmos Ndukwe and Olivia Tarela, who is the only female among the PDP presidential aspirants.\n\nThe two aspirants disqualified by the committee, who also had their disqualification upheld by the party\u2019s appeal panel earlier this month are former lawmaker, Cosmas Ndukwe, and a US-based medical doctor, Nwachukwu Anakwenze. The party also announced that the two aspirants will not be refunded their N40m fees paid for nomination and expression of interest forms.\n\nTHE CONTENDERS\n\nWith the decision of the party to shun its tradition of zoning the presidency to a particular zone in line with its rotation principle, many pundits are now quick to predict that the race for the 2023 presidential ticket of the opposition PDP is among Atiku, Wike, Saraki and Tambuwal. To this school of thoughts, these four aspirants have done the most work towards canvassing for the supports of party leaders and delegates in the past months.\n\nIn spite of growing indications that the party\u2019s leadership may have resolved to produce a northern presidential candidate owing to its belief that it can only unseat the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) with a candidate from the north, Governor Wike of Rivers state, who has emerged as the leading aspirant from the southern zone, is still rated by many analysts as someone who can pull a surprise and alter the party\u2019s plan during the primary election.\n\n\u201cThe thinking in the PDP today is more about winning the next presidential election and displacing the APC from Aso Rock and not fulfilling an age long tradition. The APC used the same gimmick in 2025 when it picked Buhari from the north and defeated the PDP banking on the votes from the region. The PDP leadership has weighed all the options and we are going for what is best for the party in the current circumstance,\u201d a party leader said.\n\nOur correspondent also gathered that there is a ground swell of opinion within the party that former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and ex-Senate President Bukola Saraki are the best options among the numerous northern presidential aspirants. While Atiku\u2019s supporters are touting his vast political networks across the country as what PDP needs to unseat the APC, Saraki\u2019s promoters are quick to point to his dual origin in both the north and the south.\n\n\u201cWith Saraki, we will appeal to both the north Saraki\u2019s and the southern zones. He is from Kwara in the northern region and a Fulani at that. But his Yoruba ancestry can also not be wished away. With that, he is a candidate the south can warm up to. The party leaders are not blind to all these attributes and what the PDP can gain by choosing Bukola as its candidate from the north in 2023,\u201d our source added.\n\nRecall that some weeks back, a group of party elders from the north had announced Saraki and Mohammed as the preferred northern consensus candidates. The party leaders said any of the two would be supported by the people of the region. Expectedly, Atiku, Tambuwal and many other northern aspirants rejected the position of the elders and dismissed it as unrealistic.\n\nATIKU ABUBAKAR\n\nA founding father of the party, he served as Vice President for eight years on the platform of the PDP. He was the party\u2019s candidate in the 2019 election. He ran against and lost to incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari. He is believed to be very popular in the southeast. His northeastern zone too is expected to go with him all things being equal.\n\n\u201cThis time around is different; our journey will not end at the poll; we will get to work and rescue Nigeria. I invite every Nigerian to join me in this mission to save our dear country. Nigeria is a land of possibility. There is no challenging background that will make any Nigerian give up. I am a living witness to what is possible in Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder my presidency, I want to focus on five key areas: the unity of Nigeria, security, economy, education and devolving more resources and powers to the federating units. I have never been this optimistic, and with your support and God\u2019s grace, we will get to the promised land,\u201d Atiku had said with optimism at the declaration of his aspirantion.\n\nAt 75, many believe this may be his last shot at the presidency, an ambition he had been nursing since 1992. Many party stalwarts see him as the best option for the PDP if the party is desirous of defeating any of the heavyweights currently jostling for the ticket of the ruling APC. \u201cIt is only an Atiku that can defeat someone like Asiwaju Bola Tinubu of the APC. PDP needs Atiku now more than ever before,\u2019 a source said.\n\nHis famed huge war-chest is also being adduced as a reason for his candidature by his supporters. \u201cPDP is not the ruling party. We need someone who can finance a presidential election with little or no support,\u201d a party source said. In recent times, he has made considerable overtures to the delegates in the southwest and north-central of the country. He remains a frontrunner for the ticket.\n\nBut claims in some quarters that his candidature is feared by some leading chieftains of the party, especially in the north, is an albatross to his aspiration. The Nation gathered that his failure to emerge as one of the proposed consensus aspirants of the north is due to this fear. His unending face-off with some of the governors of the party since 2019 is also a threat.\n\nNYESOM WIKE\n\nHe prides himself as the only presidential aspirant who had never left the PDP since 1999. He was elected as a two-term Executive Chairman of Obio Akpor Local Government Area from 1999 to 2007. He was appointed Minister in July 2011. Wike resigned before finishing his term to campaign for Governor of Rivers State. He won the election and was re-elected in 2019. He has emerged as the frontrunner among aspirants from the south.\n\nHe is one of the contenders who had campaigned and reached out the most. According to his campaign team, he has been to almost every state of the country to canvass for votes. He is almost the most talked about aspirant as at today. Many political observers expect him to pull a surprise at the primary election, especially on the strength of the pro-zoning agitation within the party which he championed.\n\nAmidst allegations that he is actually positioning himself for the vice-presidential ticket of the party, the Rivers State governor daily vows that he will not settle for anything other than the presidency. His financial strength and famed political spread are to his advantages. He will pocket the votes of delegates in Rivers State and do very well in the south-south zone.\n\n\u201cI want to become Nigeria\u2019s President because one, we are in problem. And I want to offer myself to the people of this country to solve such problems. Because I do know, as a man who loves this country, as a man who is committed to the development of this country, you can\u2019t be standing aloof, seeing your country sliding the way it is sliding.\n\n\u201cAs Governor of Rivers State, I solve problems. And I believe that should we just close our eyes and allow this country to go the way it is going? I say, no. So I\u2019m going to offer myself, so I can contribute. I have the ability to solve Nigeria\u2019s insecurity problems. You remember my war against oil bunkering in Rivers State,\u201d Wike said about his aspiration.\n\nHis current efforts in the northern zones have also been very promising with his handlers saying he has the tacit support of many groups within the party ahead of the primary election. But his constant disagreements with the leadership of the party and colleague governors are something to worry about for his supporters as he goes to the shadow poll.\n\nBUKOLA SARAKI\n\nHe had contested for the same position in 2019 but lost out in the primaries. Saraki is a former two-term governor of Kwara state who also served as senate president till 2019. He was proposed alongside another aspirant as northern consensus candidates by the Northern Elders Forum. The decision is still generating controversy within the party.\n\n\u201cAs Senate President, I defended the integrity of the National Assembly, sometimes, at great personal cost. In all the positions I occupied, I was driven by the deep conviction to serve, help, proffer solutions and leave behind a legacy of courage, hard work and unyielding commitment to making a difference. Perhaps, more importantly, I have gone into each of these positions with clearly thought-out plans, decided well in advance,\u201d he said.\n\nSaraki\u2019s promoters are quick to point to his dual origin in both the north and the south. \u201cWith Saraki, we will appeal to both the north Saraki\u2019s and the southern zones. He is from Kwara in the northern region and a Fulani at that. But his Yoruba ancestry can also not be wished away. With that, he is a candidate the south can warm up to. The party leaders are not blind to all these attributes and what the PDP can gain by choosing Bukola as its candidate from the north in 2023,\u201d our source added.\n\nHe served as the Director General of Atiku\u2019s campaign in 2019. His critics within and outside the party however say he is no longer the political giant he used to be when he was the strongman of Kwara politics, following the loss of the state to the APC in 2019. \u201cSaraki will need to first win back his home state for the PDP before talking about being our presidential candidate,\u201d a source said.\n\nSaraki will win the chunk of the votes from Kwara state and do very well in other north central state at the primary election. His performances in other states, especially in the northwest and southwest will determine how far he can go. His handlers say using the many contacts he garnered and nurtured as Senate President, he will perform better than he used to do in the southeast and south-south.\n\nAlthough it caused a storm several weeks ago, the recommendation by Northern Elders of Saraki and Bala Mohammed as consensus aspirants for the region is seen as a plus for the former Kwara governor. Analysts say it is significant that PDP grandees who were the forces behind the consensus arrangement overlooked the likes of Atiku and Tambuwal and plumbed for the former Senate President.\n\nThese same PDP elder-statesmen who prefer to operate behind the scenes were the same ones who sent former Minister of Defence, General Aliyu Gusau (rtd) to Port Harcourt in 2019 to turn the race away from Tambuwal and in the direction of Atiku.\n\nThe consensus report may just be an indicator of where they are looking this time around.\n\nAMINU TAMBUWAL\n\nHe is the incumbent governor of Sokoto state who served as Speaker of the House of Representatives till 2015. He first contested for the PDP presidential ticket in 2019 but came second to Atiku in the primary election. Pundits say his chances are not as bright as they were during the last struggle for the ticket of the opposition party owing to certain developments within and outside the party.\n\nHe was adjudged one of the favourites in the race at the very beginning but his ratings plummeted following the declaration of Governor Wike for the presidential race. The Rivers governor was no doubt one of the strong pillars behind Tambuwal\u2019s 2019 presidential aspiration which saw him coming a close second to Atiku. Wike\u2019s aspiration obviously hurt the chances of Tambuwal this time around.\n\nHis popularity in his native Sokoto is also believed to have waned as he struggled to win re-election in 2019 with less than 400 votes. His omission from the list of proposed northern consensus candidates also hurt his case. He will nonetheless perform well in the northwest zone and struggle to share delegates in Imo and Anambra states owing to the support he enjoys from his former Deputy, Emeka Ihedioha.\n\nBALA MOHAMMED\n\nThe Bauchi State governor is a former minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). He is one of the very first to declare his presidential bid. He emerged as an unexpected pick as one of the two consensus candidates from the north by NEF. Sources close to him say he is toying with the possibility of picking the PDP presidential ticket while still gunning for re-election as governor. This distraction may be the reason for his lackluster campaign and not to brilliant chance in the presidential contest.\n\nIt is being rumoured that he may abandon the presidential pursuit to concentrate on his re-election bid in Bauchi. At best, he will pick votes of delegates in his state and manage to garner some more from neigbourng Gombe state and the FCT if he decides to contest the presidential primary election of the PDP.\n\nOTHERS\n\nUdom Emmanuel, the two-term governor of Akwa Ibom state is a surprise inclusion in the race for the PDP presidential ticket. He didn\u2019t do much to project his aspiration outside his home state. This will work against him. Talks are rife that he is actually interested in the vice presidential slot. Beyond winning the votes of delegates from his state, he may not do much.\n\nAnyim Pius Anyim, former senate president and former secretary to the government of the federation is also an early joiner in the race. He has moved round to canvass for votes but pundits say he is not entrenched in the politics of the opposition party enough to pull any surprise at the primary election. He will garner some votes in the southeast on the strength of the agitation for power shift but may not do much outside his zone.\n\nPeter Obi, a former governor of Anambra state who was the Vice Presidential candidate of the PDP in 2019, is not seen as a strong contender by pundits. A highly respected economist who is adjudged to have governed Anambra state well, he is one of the preferred candidates from the southeast zone. But he doesn\u2019t seem to have the required political structure to make a successful bid for the presidential ticket of the opposition party.\n\nAnother aspirant in the race is Mohammed Hayatu-Deen. He is the Chairman of the Renaissance Development Forum. He is an experienced banker, economist, project finance executive, administrator, and elder statesman with about forty years\u2019 experience across multiple Nigerian industries.\n\nThe Borno state born Shuwa Arab has surprised many with the zeal he pursued his presidential aspiration. He is among those cleared to contest the primary election of the PDP but many pundits say he may not make much impact largely because he is to known to have been part of the party\u2019s politics before now.\n\nAlso in the race is immediate past President of the Nigerian Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, Sam Ohuabunwa. He declared for the presidential race quite early, precisely in November 2021. Analysts say he may have entered the race on the strength of the agitation for power to be ceded to the southeast region in 2023.\n\nBut he is not known to have done much beyond his zone to advance his presidential aspiration. To many observers of the politics of the opposition party, the businessman turned politician is not likely to make much impact at the primary election.",

          "text": "DESPITE the initial dilly-dallying by the Governor Samuel Ortom-led committee to determine the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential zoning formula, it was all but clear weeks ago that the party would throw the contest open. The country was in no mood to countenance anything but zoning of the presidency to the South, regardless of the flaws inherent in that restrictive method and the sophistry of some northern politicians enamoured of state power and its benefits. However, the PDP appeared fated to do what they have now, perhaps reluctantly, done. They don\u2019t have a southern aspirant with enough heft, not even someone with the kind of superficial but enervating eloquence draining the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), and can no longer produce one given the timelines imposed on the political parties by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). They will have to manage what they have; but what they have is not only uninspiring, they stand the risk, as ex-vice president Atiku Abubakar has demonstrated with his vacillating tweets and laborious explanations on the murder of Sokoto student Deborah Samuel, of imploding before the 2023 battle is properly joined.\n\nWith the PDP fated to vie for the presidency through an open contest for the ticket, it would be confounding, if not cataclysmic, for the APC to ape the opposition by opening up their presidential race for the ticket. By design, political nomenclature, and antecedents, the APC has and will stick to zoning in the name of equity, fairness and justice. These virtues may be fundamentally alien to its raison d\u2019etre, but having put a northerner in office for eight years, the party will stammer and be incoherent in pushing for another northerner, notwithstanding the ploy by some party leaders to mortgage the party\u2019s conscience to the irresolute PDP. President Muhammadu Buhari may be rightly accused of running an insular presidency, but even he, not being eloquent as it turns out, will find it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to defend so blatant and outrageous a tactic. The party will stick to zoning, as informal as it may be, and stay true to it, win or lose. For apart from the president, the party has enough governors and political leaders with conscience who already advocate for fair and rational politicking, and have left no one in doubt which side their bread is buttered.\n\nThe race for the tickets in the two parties is undoubtedly cluttered. The president may have set the cat among the pigeons in his party\u2019s presidential race, thereby pruning the number of aspirants from a hefty and unreasonable 28, but they still have enough men left to becloud the race, up the ante, and create some measure of anxiety for the leading aspirants. The improbable and comical aspiration of ex-president Goodluck Jonathan seems to have come to grief. He ran a short but bewildering race to get himself canonised as the APC standard-bearer despite ruling the country for almost six years on the platform of the PDP. Those who egg on AfDB president Akinwunmi Adesina as a potential candidate now have egg on their faces for infertile imagination and crass politicking. It was not going to work, his dazzling academic credentials notwithstanding, for not enough critical mass had been formed by political spectators easily mesmerised by eloquence and academic laurels. Ekiti State governor Kayode Fayemi and ex-Ogun governor Ibikunle Amosun formed an amusing pair, attending each other\u2019s declaration for the race as if running for the presidency was a picnic. Their ambitions will peter out in the days ahead or at least end in fatuity.\n\nThe few northerners in the race of 25 remaining APC aspirants are in it as a fail-safe device, they argue. But that argument was never bound to be tenable. Enough sensible politicians occupy high positions within the party to know that the PDP is a bad example and a calloused conscience to emulate, and in any case, the party would be unable to sell itself in the Southwest and much of the South should it produce a northern candidate. Should President Buhari be succeeded by another northern president, what would stop that region from producing the president in perpetuity? This is the rationalisation that will probably doom the PDP. The opposition is unlikely to produce a southern candidate, and of the northern aspirants, the leading politician, the former vice president, is looking increasingly unsure of himself and his chances. He claims to be emotionally and politically ready for high office, but he will struggle to undo the damage a common tweet did to his image as a stoical and courageous politician. Worse, he has stammered considerably to prove that it makes sense for his party and the country to produce a northern successor to President Buhari. If he implodes, as many expect, Sokoto governor Aminu Tambuwal, already breathing down the former vice president\u2019s neck, will leap to the front. The race is really between the two men for the ticket. The party\u2019s best bet is Mr Tambuwal, but it is Alhaji Atiku that stands any chance of giving the APC pick a good and enthusiastic fight. His age may be taking a toll on him, and his principles may be opportunistic and indiscernible, but he has more contacts and a significant network to clinch the ticket and give a good account of himself in the presidential poll.\n\nFor the APC, there are really only two contestants worthy of any serious consideration \u2013 former Lagos governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. All the others are opportunists waiting for the leading aspirants to bite the dust. Since INEC has shortened the duration for the parties to nominate their standard-bearers, with a little over two weeks left to pick their candidates, neither of the two APC aspirants is likely to goof to a level that would doom their chances. In fact, they will both be extra cautious in words and actions. So far, given the torrent of abuse he has received and the cold shoulder party behemoths had given him, Asiwaju Tinubu has surprisingly run the more stable, even-tempered and coordinated race. His network built and quietly serviced for decades, not to say his obstreperous mentees who are nevertheless proof of his capacity for talent hunting, has remained solid and impregnable. The Southwest may be overbearingly critical, but they grudgingly admire his capacity and tenacity. The Northwest and Northeast, almost to a man, trust him. Having held the reins of power for about eight years, and seem about to be compelled to surrender it, the two regions desperately need a man they can trust, someone who though being a secularist is at least nominally associated with them in religion, and one whom they had dined with, cozied with, and who worked more than any other Nigerian to selflessly reclaim the presidential stool for them in 2015. They are unlikely to ditch him.\n\nWhy Prof. Osinbajo expects to best his main rival\u2019s network built and serviced for decades is hard to say. Eloquent, polished, even debonair; however, this is politics, not haute couture. Those who inspired the Osinbajo challenge may be having a rethink. Even they don\u2019t want to be on the losing side. There will be no opportunity to dazzle the delegates with eloquence and philosophy before the fateful votes. And it is uncertain that any of the southern regions will take a huge plunge into the cold and hostile pool of defeat with the eminent professor. They really don\u2019t know him beyond his being the vice president, don\u2019t know his antecedents, and don\u2019t know what he really can do beyond smooth talking. In the end, southern delegates will probably bolt from his stable and berth where common sense and opportunity beckon.\n\nOn his own, the president has played his cards close to his chest. No one can claim to know exactly where he belongs \u2013 to everybody and to nobody perhaps. But even he may in fact be astute enough to know that the dynamics of his party are presenting him with a fait accompli. He senses that Asiwaju Tinubu has done enough homework to clinch the ticket, and he has been neutral enough not to impede that aspirant\u2019s homework. By now he probably suspects that the man who can best protect his legacy and name, and still find time to visit him in Daura should the APC retain the presidency, is the man whom the presidency and the party had in the past treated so shabbily and yet did not take offence nor softened his zeal for the party.\n\nWhat will probably decide it for most delegates, apart from networks and contacts, is who can best tackle the catastrophic decline suffered by Nigeria. The Chibok and Dapchi schoolgirls\u2019 abductions are still unresolved, Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) is perennially on strike, train attack and other hostages do not elicit the firm and spontaneous response the government should give to the crime, youths are perplexed, frustrated and ethically disoriented, the economy is in free fall, political paralysis has numbed and desensitised the country, cost of government remains prohibitively high and unsustainable, and the security services and law enforcement agencies are overstretched, archaic, ponderous and ineffective. Mutual suspicion fuelled by these crises needs someone who can galvanise the country behind him, someone the people can trust, someone who has the initiative and courage to firmly grapple with the problems.\n\nIn the weeks ahead, party delegates will almost certainly be called upon to pick between Alhaji Atiku and Mr Tambuwal in the PDP, and Asiwaju Tinubu and no one in particular in the APC. The PDP has shown a preference for a northern candidate partly because there is no viable alternative from the South. They are unlikely to engage in long-running manipulations to make their choice. Their choice may rankle with and alienate some delegates, but in the end they will pick between the two tested politicians. The APC on the other hand has been manipulative, secretive and conspiratorial. If they become exasperated with the futility of their own conspiracies, and bring all manipulations to an end, they will most likely pick Asiwaju Tinubu. Both parties know that their aspirants are flawed, not the least their final picks, but pick one they must. Despite the pall of religious gloom and zealotry hanging over the country, the parties know that they have an election to fight next year, not a papacy to struggle over; a presidency to win, not a clerical stool to claim.\n\nBuhari steals the thunder of APC aspirants\n\nWhen President Muhammadu Buhari peremptorily ordered cabinet members interested in elective offices to resign in order not to violate the laws of the land and jeopardise the electoral future of the All Progressives Congress (APC), it was probably the first time he would use presidential powers decisively, agreeably and uncontroversially for public good. Until last Friday, his party boasted some 25 aspirants, about 10 of whom were his ministers. It was mortifying that the ministers recklessly engaged in political junkets around the country in search of party tickets. Millions of their countrymen wondered whether the president had lost control to let his appointees run amok at the expense of public service. They were not to wonder for long.\n\nAlmost as if startled to action, the president announced at the tail end of the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting last Wednesday that he had noted the political ambitions of some of his ministers, and would want them to resign before May 16 to pursue those ambitions. It was a bolt from the blue, and it was the turn of the ministers, who had obviously long viewed the president as a somnolent, phlegmatic figure easily manipulable, to be startled. It was as if they never knew him, at least not this side of him in matters unrelated to ethnic and geopolitical jingoism.\n\nTo worsen the shock, the president organised a farewell meeting with the 10 ministers two days later, nine of whom were present. He thanked them for their services, cracked his usual bucolic jokes, and added with a hint of sarcasm that the departing ministers had been well groomed in his cabinet to succeed him. It was unlikely he meant every word. How could he, especially with the litigious rascality of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor, Godwin Emefiele, a man so given to frivolity that he completely forgot the weight and primacy of his office. And, boy, was Abubakar Malami, the controversial Justice minister, shell-shocked. By Friday, it was still not certain whether he had resigned or not, or whether like the comical and excessive Labour minister Chris Ngige he had thought twice about going to Siberia \u2013 all for what.\n\nIf President Buhari was all along capable of this kind of enthralling move, there is no telling what else and what other jokers he might have up his sleeves. He had encouraged droves of charlatans to bid for high offices, at least those who saw him as imperial overlord; and there was not one, lay or clerical, secular or atheist, that he did not encourage to stake a claim for anything and everything. Alas, he saw them all as suckers, each leaving his presence assured of being already canonised. Even ex-president Dr Jonathan who should know better allowed himself to be taken on a merry-go-round, expecting to be foisted on a strange party he knew nothing about its founding. And if the gentle na\u00eff Dr Jonathan, with all his presidential experience and antecedents, could be taken for a ride, why should Pastors Yemi Osinbajo and Tunde Bakare not be led by the nose? Nigerians would indeed give anything to know what this often inscrutable president thinks of the Kogi charlatan Yahaya Bello and the libidinous Sani Ahmed Yerima, the undistinguished and capricious ex-governor of Zamfara State.\n\nThere was always this streak of firmness and candour in President Buhari. Would to God he had applied these virtues to the grave problems facing the nation rather than lending them to massage his pet animosities against the Southeast and IPOB. The country recalls wistfully how he indulged this side of himself in the failed coup to unseat the party\u2019s former caretaker committee schemers weeks ago. Had the coup not failed, Yobe governor Mai Mala Buni would have been disgraced out of office for fooling all the party some of the time. And then of course, there was also the game of thrones the president also sanctioned to banish former APC chairman Adams Oshiomhole in favour of the scheming caretaker committee.\n\nPerhaps President Buhari will yet surprise everyone by firmly organising a credible succession against the run of play. He had played aloof for long, and stayed distant and imperial as political players imagining themselves to be members of his kitchen cabinet jostle for power and influence. He may have a much more developed sixth sense than everyone cares to give him. Should he indulge that sixth sense, no one can tell what the glorious end would be. But for now, he has pulled the carpet from under those who imagine themselves immovable. It is hoped that his sixth sense will be mixed with the mortar of logic to help him instinctively appreciate who in his party can best tackle the humongous crisis and complexity the country became on his watch.",

Fr. Christopher Omotosho.\n\n\n\nOmotosho noted that Kukah\u2019s residence was not attacked though rampaging hoodlums vandalised and torched two of the parishes presided over by the fiery preacher during the protests embarked upon by the Muslim youths.\n\n\u201cDuring the protest, groups of youths led by some adults in the background attacked the Holy Family Catholic Cathedral at Bello Way, destroying church glass windows, those of the Bishop Lawton Secretariat were also attacked and a community bus parked within the premises vandalised.\n\n\n\n\u201cSt. Kevin\u2019s Catholic Church Gidan Dere, Eastern By-pass, was also attacked and partly burnt; windows of the new hospital complex under construction, on the same premises, were shattered.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey were promptly dispersed by a team of Mobile policemen before they could do further damage.\n\n\u201cThe hoodlums also attacked the Bakhita Centre located along Aliyu Jodi Road and burnt down a bus within the premises.\u201d\n\nKukah commended Tambuwal \u201cfor acting promptly by declaring the 24-hour curfew to stem the protests\u201d.\n\nHe also commended the security forces for promptly rising to the occasion to prevent further damage to the church\u2019s facilities.\n\n\n\nThe Bishop said no life was lost in the attacks and noted, \u201cContrary to information in circulation, we wish to disclaim that there was an attack of any sort on the residence of Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah.\n\nKukah appealed to Christians to remain law-abiding and pray for the return of normalcy.\n\n\u201cAll Masses in Sokoto metropolis have been suspended until the curfew is lifted,\u201d the statement added.\n\nCAN Calls for Nationwide Protests May 22\n\nMeanwhile, CAN has called on all its members to embark on a peaceful protest nationwide.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday by the General Secretary of CAN, Joseph Daramola, the President of the religious body, Rev. Samson Ayokunle, directed all secretariats to stage the protest on Saturday, May 22, 2022.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have been directed by the CAN President, His Eminence, Rev. Dr. Samson Olasupo A. Ayokunle, to request all Church leaders, through your various Churches to organise a peaceful protest in honour of one of our daughters, Deborah Yakubu, who was gruesomely murdered on Thursday, May 12, 2022, at the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto in Sokoto State by some Islamic extremists.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe protest will take place on May 22, 2022, in the afternoon by 3p.m. in every Secretariat of the Christian Association of Nigeria nationwide and not on the streets to avoid further loss of lives,\u201d Daramola explained.\n\nIn a related development, Governor El-Rufai of Kaduna State has also banned any form of religious protest across the state.\n\n\n\nThe state\u2019s Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, announced the ban in a statement issued yesterday in Kaduna.\n\n\n\nHe said the ban became imperative \u201cgiven moves by some unpatriotic elements to organise series of for-and-against protests related to a security development in one of the northern Nigerian states.\u201d\n\nHe urged citizens of the state to remain calm as they go about their lawful pursuits and to immediately report any such activity or security concern to the security agencies.\n\nMore Condemnations Trail Killing of Deborah\n\nMeanwhile, more condemnations have continued to trail the killing of Deborah.\n\nIn its reaction to the gruesome murder, the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA) expressed outrage over the killing and called on Tambuwal and President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure justice.\n\n\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday by ECWA President, Dr Stephen Baba Panya, the church stated that \u201cthe brutal killing and burning of Deborah by some misguided Muslim students is nothing short of overt criminality which we at the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA) roundly condemn.\u201d\n\n\n\nPanya queried the legitimacy of a government that cannot guarantee the security of its citizens, saying: \u201cWhile our faith in this country is still very strong because we know that there are laws that ought to govern the conduct of all citizens like it is in every civilised clime, we are at a loss which provision under our nation\u2019s jurisprudence permits the brutal, senseless and shameful killing and setting ablaze of a fellow Nigerian by any misguided group, under whatever pretext with no one held accountable.\u201d\n\n\n\nECWA called on Buhari to prevail on the Inspector General of Police and all relevant law enforcement agencies \u201cto ensure that all the perpetrators of this dastardly and despicable act are not only fished out, but that they are brought to justice according to law.\u201d\n\n\n\nA former President of the Senate, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, has also condemned in the strongest terms, the gruesome and unlawful killing of Deborah.\n\nIn a statement he signed, Anyim who is a presidential aspirant on the platform of the PDP, described the killing as cruel, illegal, callous, and inhuman.\n\nNYSC Urges Corps Members Not to Panic\n\nMeanwhile, the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Sokoto State has enjoined the corps members serving in the state not to panic as their safety is guaranteed.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday, the state Coordinator of NYSC, Alhaji Muhammad Nakamba, urged the corps members to be law-abiding and remain indoors as announced by the government, especially those within the Sokoto metropolis.\n\n\n\nHe explained that the management of the scheme in the state had contacted all the security agencies to ensure the safety of its corps members throughout the curfew period and beyond.\n\nNBA Rejects Calls to Cancel Sokoto Conference\n\nIn another development, the Chairman of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Section on Public Interest and Development Law (NBA-SPIDEL), Dr. Monday Ubani, has rejected the call by some lawyers to cancel the conference of the NBA-SPIDEL scheduled in Sokoto to protest the killing.\n\n\n\nUbani advised lawyers to be circumspect over the incident.\n\nHe maintained that it was preposterous for lawyers to call for the cancellation of the 2022 NBA-SPIDEL Conference in protest against the killing of Deborah, which was carried out by lawbreakers in the state.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe barbaric act was not authorised or approved by the state government to our knowledge. The state government has issued a statement condemning the act and requested that the crime perpetrators be brought to book.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving said that, it will be preposterous for someone who is a lawyer to be suggesting that we should cancel our conference that is billed to take place in Sokoto because of the acts of lawbreakers in the state,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said he had sent a message to Tambuwal and the Attorney General of Sokoto, requesting a statement that the safety of the lawyers would be guaranteed.\n\n\n\nUbani argued that calling for the cancellation of the Sokoto conference was like asking for conferences billed for Owerri to be cancelled because of the killings of two army personnel \u2013 husband and wife \u2013 by unknown gunmen or asking for the cancellation of conferences in Abuja because of some of the killings that had taken place there recently.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Before Another Deborah is Lynched",
          "text": "SIMONKOLAWOLE! BY SIMON KOLAWOLE\n\nThe stoning to death of Deborah Samuel, a student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, over alleged blasphemy is a timely reminder that retail religious extremism is very much alive and kicking in northern Nigeria. It has been quite a while since killings over \u201cblasphemy\u201d took place in the north and the tendency is to think we have overcome this impulsive, irreversible reaction to a perceived religious offence. We are certainly not yet out of the woods. Deborah\u2019s killing, which I learnt was recorded on video and shared on social media, shocked many young Nigerians who were likely seeing such a gory incident on our shores for the first time in their lives.\n\nPerhaps the most unforgettable case took place in Kano in December 1994. Gideon Akaluka, a trader, was accused of \u201cdesecrating the Qur\u2019an\u201d and beheaded. His head was mounted on a stick and paraded on the streets of Kano like a trophy. We heard that Gen Sani Abacha, then-head of state and himself a Muslim, was so furious he did not subject the suspects to a formal trial before executing them. In the end, the sheet of paper that Akaluka \u201cdesecrated\u201d was apparently the leaflet instructions of a medication, written in English and Arabic. There are people who still don\u2019t know that Arabic is a language and not a religion \u2014 and that there is an Arabic Bible for Arab Christians.\n\nAnother religion-fuelled lynching that I can immediately recall happened in March 2007. The victim was Mrs Christianah Oluwaseesin, a secondary school teacher in Gandu, Gombe state. She was supervising an Islamic Religious Studies exam. According to what we were told, a student wanted to take her bag into the hall. The teacher seized and threw it outside, and the student screamed that it contained a Qur\u2019an. The mother-of-two was subsequently lynched \u201cfor desecrating and mutilating the Qur\u2019an\u201d. The principal, a Muslim, who tried to save her was battered while three classroom blocks, the school clinic and the library were burnt. Suspects were arrested and that was it.\n\nFor a while, there seems to be a pause in Muslim/Christian hostilities in the north \u2014 save for the intractable crisis in southern Kaduna, which dates back to at least 1987, and the Plateau killings that exploded in 2001 and keep exploding till today. The general lull, in my opinion, is not because anything has changed in the animosity but possibly because there is a bigger enemy at the door: Boko Haram. Since the group launched into full-scale terrorism in 2009, it has been taking victims from both religions. Contrary to what you read on social media, Boko Haram has evidently killed more Muslims than Christians and was at a time targeting mosques in Kano, Yobe and Borno states.\n\nSurely, before the Boko Haram era, religious killings were common in the north but it was usually as a result of confrontations between Christians and Muslims. With Boko Haram becoming a common threat, the confrontations reduced. The sense flowing from this is that by the time the Boko Haram era is subdued or exterminated, normal hostilities between Christians and Muslims may resume. It appears to be a conflict without end, always on ice and waiting for the opportunity to rupture. There are many reasons responsible for this perpetual state of hostilities and I would think that a country that has responsible leadership will work day and night to manage this animosity with dexterity.\n\nWill this enmity end anytime soon? The Sokoto incident is not an encouraging signal. If students of a higher institution \u2014 where teachers are being trained \u2014 can take law into their hands in this manner, lynching and burning the body of a fellow student, it only offers more than a passing glance at the future. The factory for the production of Boko Haram and ISIS militants is very much in full production. We typically think these terrorists recruit street urchins, but the conduct of the tertiary school students in Sokoto shows clearly that the pool of talents, as it were, is larger than the uneducated and unemployed youths out there. Boko Haram would have their eyes on them.\n\nBefore I proceed, I need to make something very clear: I do not support insulting people\u2019s religious sensibilities in the name of \u201cfree speech\u201d \u2014 although I must emphasise here that nothing on earth can justify jungle justice. Deborah\u2019s killing remains outrageous and stands condemned. But every freedom comes with responsibility. For some people, religion provides the highest form of emotions and any attack on their beliefs will trigger the worst in them. It is important that we understand our differences and respect the boundaries. It is, however, also very important to respond to offences within the limits of the law. Even if somebody kills your mother, there is a process to seek justice.\n\nMeanwhile, I want to commend all the Muslims and Muslim groups who have been courageous enough to condemn the killing of Deborah. It is a hard thing to do because they too can be attacked by the extremists. Every Muslim is hurt when the Prophet is insulted, but everyone doesn\u2019t react the same way. You can be angry and still restrain yourself from taking an irreversible action. Many Muslims have been sending messages to me quoting verses in the Qur\u2019an that condemn jungle justice. In an Islamic society, if someone is accused of blasphemy, there is a laid-down process to deal with it. This is to avoid miscarriage of justice. The extremists, however, always act differently.\n\nI have read some comments on social media that show how ignorant many people are about the ethnic and religious make-up of Nigeria. Some are using this opportunity to call for \u201crestructuring\u201d. But Deborah was a Christian from Kebbi state, not Ondo or Rivers. Will \u201crestructuring\u201d relocate Zuru Christians from Kebbi to Anambra? Some are asking what Christians \u201care still doing in the north\u201d, perhaps unaware that there are indigenous Christians in every northern state. Many attacked Lord Lugard yet again for the amalgamation of 1914. But was it Lugard that created northern Christians? I am not against people playing politics but a little dose of logical reasoning will not kill anybody.\n\nHaving said that, however, I admit that our society has been shaped for ages to think and act in a particular way and this cannot change overnight. We need to work on it. In the north, religion is a major marker of identity. People identify themselves first by their religion before their ethnicities. This should put in perspective the unending conflicts and tensions along religious lines. (This is what some people are trying to introduce to Yorubaland, egged on by busybodies. As I warned in a previous write-up, it never ends well and I hope Yoruba people will not take the bait.) Ethnic groups in the north are dominated by a religion. Hence, ethnic conflicts inevitably appear to be religious.\n\nHow do we prevent more Deborah cases? The starting point is for religious leaders across the divides to continue to preach the message of mutual respect and tolerance. The message of disrespect and jungle justice has to stop. The message of peace and love must become pervasive. Christians and Muslims must commit to respecting each other\u2019s beliefs. We need to be sensitive to what others hold dear and also know how to react with civility when we are offended. I have Catholic buddies whose beliefs about the Virgin Mary I do not share, but I am sensible enough not to go there. They may not lynch me because Christians take these things differently, but they will still be offended.\n\nTwo, government has to work with religious leaders and experts in conflict management to develop a system that will promote peace and pre-empt conflicts. There should be an alert procedure when tensions arise to prevent people from taking the law into their hands. There is no jurisprudence in the world that does not allow for fair hearing. In fact, Islamic jurisprudence allows for fair hearing, contrary to what the extremists want us to believe. Also, there should be an improved early-warning mechanism to flag potential confrontations and violence. Tensions can be nipped in the bud before things get out of hand. Interfaith dialogues must also be strengthened for better co-operation.\n\nThree \u2014 and this is a long-term project \u2014 cross-religious education is very critical to dealing with our mindsets. I think the education ministry recently tried to introduce it but it was shot down because of the fear of \u201cIslamisation\u201d. It is tragic that in many parts of the north today, all a Christian student knows about Islam is what fellow Christians teach them and all a Muslim knows about Christianity is as taught by fellow Muslims. What they are taught is left to the imagination. People grow up with resentment, hate and disdain towards each other. Being a friend to someone of a different religion is taught as \u201ccontamination\u201d \u2014 punishable by hellfire. This is full of dangers.\n\nFinally, there must be consequences for jungle justice. Nobody should ever get away with taking the law into their hands \u2014 whether over religion or something else. It is most unfortunate that violence broke out in Sokoto on Saturday with people taking to the streets to demand the release of suspects. This is impunity. It is annoying. In a state ravaged by under-reported killings by bandits, where lies their priority? Truly, the government has a long way to go. A peace-building project is complicated and will take sincere and thinking leadership to deliver. The killing of Deborah was not just because of the WhatsApp message. That was just a trigger. This jungle justice mindset needs overhauling.\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nTHUMBS UP!\n\nWith President Muhammadu Buhari failing to do the needful when his ministers started campaigning all over the country without resigning, one rare Nigerian stood out. His name is Dr Chukwuemeka Uwaezuoke Nwajiuba, a 54-year-old lawyer from Imo state who is seeking APC\u2019s presidential ticket. He did the honourable thing by resigning. No desperation to hold on to his job. This most likely influenced Buhari\u2019s belated decision to ask his politicking ministers to resign. Nwajiuba, a founding member of APP/ANPP, was elected into the house of reps in 1999 aged 32. He unsuccessfully contested for Imo governorship in 2003, 2007 and 2011. He is a rare Nigerian politician. Exemplary.\n\nBIRD IN HAND\n\nDr Chris Ngige, the (former) minister of labour and productivity, dramatically pulled out of the presidential race on Friday by opting to return to the cabinet \u2014 after attending a valedictory session presided over by President Buhari. We seem to understand why he pulled out \u2014 a bird in hand, as our forefathers would say, is worth two in the bush. But he tried to mask the entire drama around the withdrawal of his resignation as being in the \u201coverall interest of the nation\u201d. Come on! How can serving 12 more months as minister be of more \u201cnational interest\u201d than being president for a possible eight years? As they say on Naija Twitter, we play too much in this country. Hilarious.\n\nFREE ZONE\n\nThe PDP has finally ditched power rotation, obviously based on its calculations on how to reclaim power from the APC. I foresee its northern presidential hopefuls eventually agreeing to queue up behind one of their own to ward off the challenge from Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers state and Mr Peter Obi, former governor of Anambra state. The potential biggest loser would be the south-east which has always voted for the PDP in presidential elections since 1999 and desires to finally produce an Igbo president. PDP\u2019s new disposition is all the more intriguing because it was the party that \u201ccreated\u201d power rotation. Compliance, or lack of it, has done much damage since 2010. Politics!\n\nDANGER AHEAD\n\nOn Monday, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) decided to extend its strike by three months. That is almost a whole semester, if I am not mistaken. There has been no love lost between ASUU and the government since this year\u2019s strikes started on February 14. Our children in public universities are going to lose a whole academic year again. I remember my younger sister spending six years on a four-year course in the 1990s because of long ASUU strikes. The federal government and university teachers have to reach an agreement by any means. There are irreparable consequences of keeping teenagers idle for so long. Our future is in serious danger. Alarming.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "COVID Under Control in China",
          "text": "By Chu Maoming\n\nSome Nigerian friends have recently expressed concerns about China\u2019s COVID situation and showed their support to China\u2019s efforts to fight the disease. I truly appreciate the precious and valuable support at the difficult time. It will help me and my fellow Chinese strengthen confidence in defeating the disease. I would like to assure my Nigerian friends that China will be able to win the battle.\n\nAs the highly contagious and latent Omicron variant is sweeping the world, multiple Chinese regions have been overshadowed by the current COVID-19 resurgence. But China has been rising to the challenge.\n\nThrough a resolute and full implementation of the dynamic zero-COVID approach, and with the whole-hearted support of the Chinese people, Shenzhen in southern China resumed normal work and production in late March as the resurgence subsides, while community transmission has been cut in Jilin Province since mid-April. Racing against time, Beijing has carried out multiple rounds of nucleic acid testing, and has grasped the basic picture of hidden transmission in society. Data shows the epidemic situation is steadily improving and under effective control in Shanghai. Daily new COVID-19 cases have fallen from a peak of 27,000 to 3,000 at the time of writing , and nearly two-thirds of the infections have recovered in the city. Over 70 percent of Shanghai\u2019s 1,800-plus major enterprises have resumed work and production, and the resumption rate of the first batch of more than 660 key industrial enterprises in the city has exceeded 90 percent.\n\nChina\u2019s anti-epidemic experience has demonstrated that its dynamic zero-COVID policy is not only the best option but also the bottom line that must be maintained for the country\u2019s current epidemic prevention and control work.\n\nYet, the country\u2019s effective anti-pandemic efforts such as temporary lockdowns, brief closures of factories and stores, and suspension of offline classes in schools, have been repeatedly questioned by a number of Western media outlets as being excessively strict. While it is undeniably true that halting normal production can be costly, it is also true that the virus kills.\n\nWorldwide, the virus has claimed over 6 million lives. In sharp contrast, the death toll was about 5,000 on the Chinese mainland.\n\nBy pursuing the dynamic zero-COVID approach, China has managed to safeguard people\u2019s lives and well-being and has minimized the epidemic\u2019s impact on economic and social development to the largest extent.\n\nThe stringent anti-epidemic measures inevitably lead to short-term economic pains, but dynamic zero-COVID is overall a counter-epidemic policy that ensures economic development.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, China\u2019s GDP increased by 4.8 percent year on year. Against the backdrop of global inflation, domestic prices remain steady. The value of goods trade in the period rose 10.7 percent. China\u2019s major industrial firms saw their profits up 8.5 percent year on year.\n\nAs a result, it is not difficult to conclude that China\u2019s dynamic zero-COVID policy complements and bolsters the normal operation of the economy and society. The policy has woven a strong safety net for the 1.4 billion Chinese people.\n\nHumanity is a community with a shared future. Solidarity and cooperation remain the most powerful weapons against global and regional g hands with the rest of the world to combat malaria, or joining international cooperation in the fight against SARS, bird flu, Ebola and COVID-19, China has always been giving a helping hand to other countries to tide over difficulties.\n\nFacing the COVID-19 pandemic, China has carried out its largest emergency humanitarian action since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1949. It has provided hundreds of billions of anti-pandemic supplies to 153 countries and 15 international organizations and supplied 2.1 billion doses of vaccine to more than 120 countries and international organizations. It is making COVID-19 vaccines an accessible and affordable public product for developing countries.\n\nFrom eliminating major infectious diseases such as malaria, to promoting international cooperation in the fight against COVID-19, China has always put people and their lives in the first place, which is responsible for not only the health and lives of the Chinese, but also the global public health cause. With concrete actions, China is practicing the vision of building a global community of health for all and building a powerful joint force for the world to fight COVID-19.\n\n*Chu Maoming is China\u2019s ConsulGeneral in Lagos\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*President flays killing, orders thorough, impartial probe of incident\n\n*Victim\u2019s Whatsapp voice note shows alleged blasphemy is false\n\n* Atiku in facebook post, disowns Tweet condemning killing\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nThe Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), the Northern States Christian Elders Forum (NOSCEF) and the British government have condemned the murder of Deborah Samuel, a 200-level female student of Shehu Shagari College of Education, Sokoto, by some fanatical students of the same school for allegedly blaspheming Prophet Muhammad (SAW) in a Whatsapp post.\n\n\n\nThey are also demanding for the arrest and prosecution of all those responsible for the murder of Deborah, who was attacked and killed by the mob of fanatics that burnt her corpse at the school\u2019s premises last Thursday.\n\nLikewise, President Muhammadu Buhari strongly flayed the resort to self-help by the mob in Sokoto, resulting in violence, destruction and killing of Deborah.\n\n\n\nThe General Secretary of CAN, Joseph Daramola, in a statement yesterday said: \u201cThe vampires must be brought to book. The unlawful and dastardly action of the perpetrators must not only be condemned by all right-thinking people but the security operatives must fish them out, prosecute them as it is expected of them.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is the failure of the security agencies and the government to rise up to such criminalities in the past that gave birth to terrorists and bandits. And as long as the State fails to bring these beasts and criminals amidst us to book so also the society will continue to be their killing fields.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge the swift reaction of His Eminence, Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar III who not only condemned the criminal and religious intolerant action but also called on the security agencies to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe also call on all teachers and preachers of religious intolerance, extremism, and terrorism to repent before the wrath of God descends on them if the State failed to bring them to book. They are agents of death amidst us.\n\n\u201cWe recall the provocative and demeaning advertisement of the Sterling Bank where the bank compared the Resurrection of Jesus Christ to \u201cAgege bread\u201d, up till now, nobody was attacked and even the CAN leadership has accepted the apology tendered by its Managing Director, Abubakar Suleiman.\n\n\n\n\u201cKilling for any God in the name of blasphemy is ungodly, satanic, foolish, reprehensible, and totally unacceptable. This is not a Stone Age and Nigeria is not a Banana Republic. Nigeria remains a non-religious State where no religion is supreme to the other.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge and commend the restraint of the Christian students of the College who refused to embrace self-help and reprisal attacks on those who murdered their colleague. It is our prayer that those vampires in religious garments will not push the country to a religious war.\n\n\u201cThis is why both the government and the security agencies must stop treating them with kid gloves. Enough is enough.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Northern Christian Elders in a statement by its Chairman, Ejoga Inalegwu, in Kaduna yesterday, called on the government to immediately apprehend and make an example of those who perpetrated the dastardly act.\n\nThe Christian group noted that anything short of apprehending and prosecuting those involved in the heinous act was unacceptable.\n\n\n\nAccording to them, the act was purely a murder in the robe of religion.\n\nThe group said, \u201cThe death of Debora Yakubu (Samuel) is one too many by mobs wearing a cloak of religion in the North. In a country where there is a law, nobody, group or individuals has a right to take another\u2019s life whatsoever, outside the due process of law.\n\n\u201cWe also urge the government to make a public example and make a new statement by quickly bringing the perpetrators to book.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis should not be the usual rhetoric of condemnations and then the case is swept under the carpet with publicised arrests, no prosecution or jaundiced prosecution and letting off the hook, when the outcries die down.\n\n\u201cOne day it is the videoed execution of Christians in the North because of a said killing of a terrorist in Syria, and next what should have been an internal WhatsApp class platform chat results in mob action murder, wearing the robe of religion in our dear North.\u201d\n\nBuhari Flays Killing\n\nThe President, in a reaction to the incident via a release issued by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, said the news of the killing of Deborah by fellow students was a matter of concern and demanded an impartial, extensive probe into all that happened before and during the incident.\n\n\n\nHe noted that Muslims all over the world demand respect for the Holy Prophets, including Isah (Alaihissalaam, Jesus Christ) and Muhammad (SAW) but where transgressions occur, as alleged to be the case in this instance, the law does not allow anyone to take matters into their hands.\n\n\n\n\u201cMoreover, religious leaders preach that it is not for the believer to judge the actions of another person. The constituted authority must be allowed to deal with such matters when they arise.\n\n\u201cNo person has the right to take the law into his or her own hands in this country. Violence has and never will solve any problem,\u201d said the President.\n\n\n\nPresident Buhari also directed the Ministries of Information and Culture, Police Affairs and that of Communications and Digital Economy to work with GSM providers and Tech companies to help contain the spread of false and inflammatory information through social media.\n\nHe extended the nation\u2019s condolences to the family of the deceased student and called for tampered comments by the media and calm among the general population while investigation is ongoing to find out the remote and immediate causes of the incident.\n\nBritish Government\n\nThe British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing has condemned the killing of Deborah.\n\nIn a tweet yesterday, Laing said the authorities must ensure that the perpetrators of the act are brought to justice.\n\n\u201cI condemn the murder of Deborah Samuel in Sokoto, and urge the police and relevant authorities to ensure the perpetrators of this horrific act are made to face justice in line with the law,\u201d she wrote.\n\nTambuwal Meets Sokoto Ulama, Kukah\n\nThe Sokoto State Governor, Hon. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal has met with a broad spectrum of Muslim leaders in the state to deliberate on the way to maintain peace and harmony amongst its citizens\n\nA statement by his media office said Tambuwal met with Bishop of Sokoto Catholic Diocese, Mathew Kukah, among others.\n\nThe statement said that the governor had to cut short his various official engagements in Abuja, to rush to Sokoto in view of the importance of the various consultations.\n\nVictim\u2019s Whatsapp Voice Note Shows Alleged Blasphemy is False\n\nThe purported reason Deborah was killed and her body burnt by the mob has been found to be false.\n\nDeborah had shared a voice note on her class Whatsapp group in which she challenged her colleagues who were posting religious information there.\n\n\n\nShe spoke in Hausa. According to a Twitter user who did the translation, Deborah was quoted to have said: \u201cHoly Ghost Fire, nothing\u2019s going to happen to me, you should know what to be sending to this group, it\u2019s not that the group was created to be sending nonsense, the group was created for posting things like, test, assignment e.t.c. not the nonsense you are posting, no be only prophet, you are coming to play on me.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe nonsense she apparently referred to were the religious posts.\n\nHer comments were said to have irked some of her colleagues who felt she disrespected Prophet Mohammed, and threatened to deal with her. When the tension was high, the school authorities took her to the security room to give her some protection. However, the enraged students overpowered the security officers, dragged Deborah out, and beat her until she died before setting her corpse on fire.\n\n\n\nFormer President of the Senate, Anyim Pius Anyim also condemned, in the strongest terms, the gruesome and unlawful killing of Deborah.\n\nIn a statement he personally signed, Anyim decried the killing of Deborah as cruel, illegal, callous and inhuman.\n\nAnyim said: \u201cThere is no place in a modern Democracy such as Nigeria for jungle justice and killing of human beings illegally. We cannot afford now to add religious intolerance to the plethora of problems bedevilling our country.\u201d\n\nAtiku Distances Self from Deborah Tweet\n\nPresidential hopeful, Atiku Abubakar, has distanced himself from a tweet condemning the lynching of Deborah.\n\nAtiku, who is running for President on the platform of the PDP, had taken to Twitter on Thursday to condemn the mob action, saying, \u201cThere cannot be a justification for such gruesome murder. Deborah Yakubu was murdered and all those behind her death must be brought to justice. My condolences to her family and friends.\u201d\n\nThe former Vice-President, however, came under threats from some Muslim northerners who threatened not to vote for him if he emerges as the Presidential candidate of the PDP.\n\n\n\nHowever, Atiku later deleted the tweet amid the threats.\n\nOn Facebook yesterday, the former Vice President in a message on his verified Hausa page distanced himself from the message. He also stated that any message on social media that did not come with the initials \u201cA. A.\u201d were not his.\n\n\u201cThis evening I received information that a post was made that doesn\u2019t agree with my orders. I use this to announce that any post without A. A. is not from me. May God protect us,\u201d he wrote in Hausa.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "Likewise, President Muhammadu Buhari strongly flayed the resort to self-help by the mob in Sokoto, resulting in violence, destruction and killing of Deborah.\nThe Christian group noted that anything short of apprehending and prosecuting those involved in the heinous act was unacceptable.\nDeborah had shared a voice note on her class Whatsapp group in which she challenged her colleagues who were posting religious information there.\nFormer President of the Senate, Anyim Pius Anyim also condemned, in the strongest terms, the gruesome and unlawful killing of Deborah.\nIn a statement he personally signed, Anyim decried the killing of Deborah as cruel, illegal, callous and inhuman.",

          "text": "A multi-million naira mansion belonging to Prince Joseph Kpokpogri, estranged lover of controversial Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh, has been demolished by the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) in Abuja.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the mansion, which is in the Asokoro area, was invaded on Saturday at about 8am by officials of the FCT Administration with a bulldozer which began to demolish the building.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters, the owner of the building, Kpokpogri and ex-lover of Dikeh, expressed shock saying he was not pre-informed by the officials about the demolition which he described as illegal.\n\n\"I don't have any issue with anybody that will warrant the wicked and illegal destruction of my house this morning without any pre-notice from the FCT ministry. Is it because I am from the Niger Delta region of the country? I just woke up this morning and saw the ministry officials, security men and a bulldozer and the next thing I saw was my fence being brought down.\n\n\u201cThey entered my compound and began to demolish my house; as we talk, my swimming pool is gone, a bungalow in my compound is also down. And any moment from now, the full mansion, which cost me over N700million, my hard-earned money, will soon be brought down and I don't know the offence I have committed and I don't know who is behind this.\n\n\"None of the officials want to speak with me and I am only being told now that the FCT minister, Muhammad Bello, sent them to come and demolish my house that a road will be passing through my house. My house was approved, I paid for everything, I am not owing the federal government a dime. Before now, about five northerners had approached me to sell my house to them but I refused. Because, my house is seated on a rock and an attraction of everybody; so everybody wants to have my house.\"\n\nAs of the time of filing this report, the main building is about to be demolished as soon as properties and other belongings are evacuated from the building by Kpokpogri.\n\nPrince Joseph Kpokpogri has been having a serious battle with his estranged lover, Dikeh, resulting to series of arrest, legal actions and counter-arrest and actions.",

Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Google unveils first smartwatch, new phones, virtual cards and more",
          "text": "Google on Wednesday and Thursday held its annual developer conference where it revealed an expanded line of new products and services.\n\nAt its first in-person developer conference in 3 years, the tech giant announced 3 new smartphones and its first in-house smartwatch as well as plans to release a new tablet next year. Google also announced updates to several of its most popular tools including Maps, Google Translate and its core search product.\n\nHere are some major announcements made:\n\nNew Pixel Watch and Pixel phones\n\nIn 2019, Fitbit was acquired by Google for $2.1 billion, a move many saw as a hint that Google was planning to go head-on with the likes of Apple and Samsung, which are already market leaders in smartwatches.\n\nTwo years later, Google has finally launched its first in-house built watch. The Pixel watch can be paired with Android devices only and is 4G-compatible, which means it can function on its own without being near a phone\u2014but to do this it requires its own data plan.\n\nThe tech giant did not reveal a price for the wearable, but it said it would be a \u201cpremium product\u201d when it launches in the 4th quarter of the year.\n\nThere are already many third-party Android watches which run on Google\u2019s Wear operating system but so far Google has not had its own device until now.\n\nAs part of its annual tradition, Google announced its new mid-tier phone, the Pixel 6A. It also unveiled its next flagship phones: the Pixel 7 Pro with a triple rear camera system and the Pixel 7 with two rear cameras.\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, Google announced that it\u2019s getting back to releasing tablets after announcing that it will be focusing solely on building in 2019. The new Android tablet is set to be released in 2023.\n\nUpdated Search and Maps\n\nSource: Google\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that Google processes approximately 63,000 search queries every second, 5.6 billion searches per day and approximately 2 trillion global searches per year. Google search which started from only text queries has over the years added the option to use voice and picture queries options.\n\nNow Google\u2019s new multi-search feature\u2014Multi-search Near Me\u2014allows users to search using text and images at the same time. The tech giant pointed out that the use cases for this feature include searching for a meal or outfit, and finding local results from restaurants, retailers and more.\n\nSource: Google\n\nFor a long time, Google Map has been the most popular Map app in the world, helping people around the world including Africans navigate through cities and rural areas. Now it\u2019s getting a new feature that allows users to view their cities in a more immersive way.\n\nThe new feature, immersive view, fuses together Street View and aerial imagery in order to offer a digital model of the world and a new way to explore cities, key landmarks, restaurants, venues, and other places of interest.\n\nGoogle maps\u2019 new immersive view for cities comes off as a challenger to Apple\u2019s 3D mode map view. In addition to this, Maps also now offers to find the most fuel-efficient route to get there with eco-friendly routing and offer users the ability to access Google Maps Live View in other third-party apps with the ARCore Geospatial API.\n\nVirtual cards\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nGoogle is rolling out virtual credit cards to help protect users\u2019 financial information while they\u2019re shopping online. The feature generates a virtual card number that users can autofill instead of their actual card information on Android mobile devices or in Google\u2019s Chrome browser, masking their real credit card number from the companies they\u2019re shopping from. These virtual cards are typically used for one-time purchases, but users will also be able to use these cards for subscriptions.\n\nVirtual cards will roll out this summer initially only for US users with Visa, Mastercard American Express and Capital One credit cards.\n\nTranslation and AR glasses\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nGoogle Translate has added support for 24 additional languages, bringing the total number of languages the product supports to 133.\n\nOver 300 million people across Africa, Asia and South America speak these newly-added languages. 10 of the 24 new languages added to Google Translate are spoken in Ghana, Togo, Sierra Leone, Mali, South Africa, Eritrea, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Namibia, Uganda and Zimbabwe.\n\nClosely related to this announcement was Google unveiling Augmented Reality (AR) glasses that hint it plans to join companies like Snap and Meta who have AR glasses ambitions. Google showed off a pair of AR glasses that were capable of real-time translation during a conversation. The tech giant revealed no details on whether this will be a product people can buy.\n\nGoogle\u2019s first attempt at creating smart glasses was roughly a decade ago, but it didn\u2019t take off as expected due to its limited launch, high initial pricing and privacy concerns.\n\nAds and user privacy\n\nSource: Google\n\n\n\nGoogle made a set of security and privacy announcements which will roll out later in the year.\n\nA notable one is the My Ad Centre hub, a new control centre that will give users more control and visibility over how their ads are personalised across Google\u2019s apps and sites, including Google Search, YouTube, and the Discover feed in Google app.\n\nIt\u2019ll let users customise the types of ads they see by selecting from a range of topics they are interested in or opt to see fewer ads on a given topic. For example, if you want to see fewer ads about fashion, you can indicate.\n\nThe hub will also make it easier for users to request that their personal information such as phone numbers, email and home addresses be scrubbed from search results.\n\nThese announcements come after Google reported its 2022 Q1 revenue which was up 23% from the same period last year, reaching $68 billion, while its net profit dropped to $16.4 billion compared to last year\u2019s $17.9 billion.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank edges close to eNaira use case with much-needed upgrade",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria\u2019s central bank digital currency (CBDC), eNaira, will get an update that will allow it to perform more functions such as bill payment and USSD access.\n\nThis was revealed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Lagos Branch Controller, Bariboloka Koyor, during a sensitisation campaign on the eNaira in Oshodi, Lagos.\n\nAccording to Vanguard, Koyor said, \u201cstarting from next week, there will be an upgrade on the eNaira Speed Wallet app that will allow you to do transactions such as paying for DStv or electric bills or even paying for flight tickets.\u201d\n\nWhat was wrong with the eNaira?\n\nChimezie Chuta, Founder, Blockchain Nigeria User Group (BNUG), told Techpoint Africa on a phone call that the upgrade had been in the works for a while.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Chuta, the CBDC, which launched in October 2021, had to go through a complete rework as some inconsistencies were revealed.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, there were faults that would not have allowed the eNaira to achieve its full potential.\u201d\n\nThere were issues with setting up the eNaira Speed Wallet application at launch. In a test I conducted after the launch, the app had trouble verifying my BVN, which made using the application impossible.\n\nHowever, news by This Day, in December 2021, said the eNaira was getting rapid acceptance among Nigerians. It said the eNaira Speed Wallet app had reached over 600 thousand downloads eight weeks after launch, and \u20a643 million worth of transactions had been carried out just weeks after launch.\n\nPwC\u2019s 2022 CBDC Global Index also reported that the CBN leads global CBDC retail projects. Retail CBDC projects refer to digital currencies designed for public use instead of wholesale projects such as China\u2019s CBDC \u2014 the e-CNY \u2014 created for institutional usage.\n\nAccording to the Index, over 35,000 transactions have been completed on the eNaira, which was downloaded in 160 countries.\n\nWhile the Index lauds the eNaira, a Twitter poll conducted by Intelligence by Techpoint \u2014 Techpoint Africa\u2019s data and Intelligence arm \u2014 in April 2022 said otherwise. The poll had votes from 157 Twitter users, 36.9% (58) of which voted \u201cI don\u2019t own a Wallet.\u201d\n\nNigeria's eNaira adoption\n\nWhat have you done with the eNaira Speed Wallet since its launch?\n\n\n\nKindly vote and retweet. Advertisement April 7, 2022\n\nInterestingly, 27.4% (38) of those who own a wallet had never used it. Only 1.3% had completed a transaction with the eNaira Wallet, while 34.4% were indifferent about the CBDC project.\n\nChuta, however, justified the issues eNaira faced after it launched by saying the \u201cindustry and the technology are still young, so it is normal to go back to the drawing board.\u201d While he cannot point at specific errors, Chuta reiterates that there was a need to rework the project.\n\nWhat will the eNaira upgrade do?\n\nIn addition to bill payments, the eNaira will be accessible via Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD). Per Vanguard, Koyor told business owners and market leaders that the USSD code for the eNaira (*997#) would make onboarding more Nigerians easier.\n\nThe Guardian also reported on Friday, May 6, 2022, that fintech could explore investment opportunities with the eNaira. Yusuf Jelil, Principal Manager and Business Lead for the eNaira project, said that the CBN, along with fintech startups, is looking to explore investment opportunities with the eNaira.\n\nHow eNaira USSD could work\n\nWhile there\u2019s little detail on how the eNaira will work with USSD, we can make educated guesses on how the service will work based on our understanding of the eNaira and USSD protocols in Nigeria.\n\nUSSD integration with the eNaira could mean that feature phone users can now use the digital currency without Internet connectivity. This includes setting up a wallet and sending and receiving eNaira.\n\nAccording to the CBN, the first tier of Speed Wallet users can set up a wallet without a Bank Verification Number (BVN). However, they will have a daily transaction limit of \u20a650,000 ($121.50).\n\nA National Identification Number (NIN) will be required in place of the BVN. Given that 71 million Nigerians have their NINs \u2014 17 million more than the 54 million registered BVNs \u2014 more people get access to financial services without going to a physical bank branch.\n\nIt is, however, important to note that the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has been unable to verify NINs, leaving 7.5 million MTN subscribers disconnected.\n\nFacilitating eNaira transactions via USSD also raises the question of who bears the consent charge, a question that stands in the way of free transactions, the eNaira\u2019s biggest value proposition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nIsn\u2019t today Friday, May 13, 2022? Does that ring a bell? (I\u2019m not talking about the horror movie, lol.) If you can remind me \u2014 because I\u2019ve been mentioning it for a week now \u2014 you\u2019ll have all my money this weekend.\n\n$5,000. Yeah, you read that right. So, I had a dream last night and won a singing competition. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Don\u2019t mind me; I\u2019m only joking. My voice is terrible. You don\u2019t want to hear me sing. (Editor\u2019s note: You really don\u2019t.)\n\nHowever, I\u2019m happy. I mean, it\u2019s the weekend again. Aren\u2019t you glad?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, today is Techpoint Africa Pitch Friday! Now, you remember, huh?\n\nTechpoint Africa will host entrepreneurs and startup enthusiasts at 43b Emina Crescent, Opebi, Allen, Ikeja by 5 p.m.\n\nWho knows, maybe you\u2019ll meet your next startup co-founder or be inspired to start your own. Don\u2019t pass it up for anything. Kindly register here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAre there many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\nInterswitch\u2019s $110m\n\nSafaricom\u2019s plan to launch M-PESA Junior Accounts\n\nAre there many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat comes to mind when you hear the term \u201cfintech,\u201d especially since every Tom, Dick, and Harry wants to start a fintech startup that \u201cbanks the unbanked\u201d? Digital payments? Lending? Just those two?\n\nPerhaps now\u2019s a good time to ask how many fintech startups you know do not provide lending and payment options in Nigeria. None? Just a few?\n\nIf you believe that fintechs are limited to just those two, I just might hold a fintech Masterclass. For the right amount, of course.\n\nSimply put, fintech \u2014 the combination of the words \u201cfinancial\u201d and \u201ctechnology\u201d \u2014 is the incorporation of technology into the offerings of financial services companies to improve their usability and delivery to customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does it function? It primarily works by disaggregating offerings like digital lending, payments, blockchain, and digital wealth management, while creating new markets for them.\n\nFurther, it refers to a wide range of financial activities that can be performed without the assistance of a person, like money transfers, check depositing with your smartphone, bypassing a bank branch to apply for credit, raising funds for a business startup, or managing your investments.\n\nBut seriously, do you think Nigerian startups primarily offer payment and lending services?\n\nChimgozirim probably has answers to your many questions concerning this. Please read his story here: Does Nigeria have too many fintech startups? What the numbers say\n\nY Combinator in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Y Combinator\u2019s (YCs) website, 3,657 startups had gone through the California-based technology startup\u2019s accelerator programme as of W22 \u2014 its Winter cohort.\n\nIntelligence by Techpoint, the data and research arm of Techpoint Africa, has partnered with YC to give an account of its activities in Africa since 2009. Above is a snippet of the report titled Y Combinator in Africa: A report about African startups that have gone through Y Combinator\u2019s Accelerator Programme.\n\nInterswitch\u2019s 110m\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterswitch, an African payments company, has announced an investment from LeapFrog Investments and Tana Africa Capital.\n\nAlthough Interswitch has not confirmed the amount it received from the firms, TechCrunch, reports it at $110 million, but says \u201cthe precise terms of the transaction have not been disclosed.\u201d When asked about the investment and Interswitch\u2019s new valuation, a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch, \u201cWe can\u2019t comment on that for the time being.\u201d\n\nSo, what does the company do? Founded in 2002 by Mitchell Elegbe (CEO), Interswitch is an Africa-focused integrated digital payments and commerce company which facilitates the electronic exchange of money.\n\nThe fintech company is well known for its Point-of-Sale terminals and online consumer payment platforms like Quickteller and Verve. The company claims Verve is Africa\u2019s largest domestic debit card scheme, issuing over 35 million active cards since launch.\n\nThe funding will aid in its expansion across the continent and the provision of digital payment services.\n\nAlso, the funds will be used to support Interswitch\u2019s pan-African strategy, which includes acquiring new customers and developing new products to support a financial inclusion strategy.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022) will take place in less than nine days!

To win, follow the instructions here.\n\nTickets are selling out fast; save a seat for yourself here.\n\nSafaricom to launch M-PESA Junior Accounts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafaricom has announced plans to launch M-PESA Junior Accounts for young Kenyans, intended for people aged 10 to 18.\n\nThe telco company claims these customers will be able to access the network through SIM cards registered to their guardians or parents since they do not have the necessary identification to register for a Safaricom line.\n\nRemember that Kenya\u2019s Communications Authority (CA) introduced new standards requiring parents and guardians who purchase phones for minors under 18 to register the SIM cards in the child\u2019s name to protect minors who use Internet and broadcasting services.\n\nWhy? Children are vulnerable to various risks due to the rapid industrial revolution and digitisation in Kenya and globally. Also, with access to the Internet via various devices, other hazards include child trafficking, prostitution, child pornography, trafficking, early age exposure to alcohol advertising, cyberbullying, and crimes like identity theft.\n\nConsequently, CA wants mobile network operators, broadcasters, internet service providers (ISPs), and content providers to implement policy and technical safeguards to protect minors.\n\nHowever, it appears that Safaricom is at odds with Kenya\u2019s CA with this plan. Well, the company has not revealed additional details on how the M-PESA Junior Accounts will work.\n\nAlso, the telco will launch a virtual debit card for international online payments.\n\nWhy? While some products, like Spotify, can be paid for directly with M-PESA, others, like Netflix, are unavailable, forcing customers to use bank-affiliated cards.\n\nAnd this causes some concern, particularly among those unwilling to do so for security or other reasons best known to them.\n\nFurther, per the World Bank Financial Inclusion Data, 72.9% of Kenyans have a mobile money account, and 26.1% buy and pay bills online. This means that over 14 million people buy and pay bills online.\n\nHowever, the products will be available before the end of June 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nWin up to \u20a61m when you participate in Credo\u2019s Social Payments Hackathon starting May 16, 2022.

          "title": "Does Nigeria have too many fintech startups? What the numbers say",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are at least 150 fintech startups in Nigeria, depending on who you ask. Statista reports that there were 144 fintech startups as of 2021 and a 2020 McKinsey report puts the number of standalone fintech startups at over 200. Ongoing research by our data arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, reveals there are at least 270 active startups in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the McKinsey report, most of these startups are focused on payments and lending. Consequently, it is not unusual to hear comments on the proliferation of fintech startups in the country, which begs the question, are there too many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\nWhy is every Nigerian startup entrepreneur trying to create a fin-tech startup. Why do I need a 1000 different ways to pay for my plantain? \u2014 Aniekan (@ObiHabbibi) May 10, 2022\n\nA common criticism in the fintech conversation is that too many startups are solving the same problem and barely moving the needle. The value proposition for many startups revolves around banking the unbanked and providing better (read faster) financial services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, even with all this, one could argue that financial services have only marginally improved, with most fintech services unable to offer superior services to traditional financial institutions.\n\nFor example, lending apps in Nigeria offer loans in minutes without requiring collateral for users. As impressive as this is, startups still have to contend with debt recovery. While a few startups report repayment rates in the 90th percentile, there are widespread reports of lending startups resorting to desperate measures to get their loans back.\n\nCustomer service is another aspect that fintech startups do not seem to have completely figured out. In a test conducted by the Techpoint Africa team, we discovered that traditional financial institutions did not fare badly in customer service compared to fintech startups. In fact, in some metrics, they fared better than fintech startups.\n\nThe mission to bank the unbanked, which is frequently bandied about, is also moving slowly, and only 54.6 million Nigerians have a BVN, a vital requirement for opening a bank account in Nigeria.\n\nAdmittedly, people can only register for their BVN at banks. Therefore, there is only so much fintech startups can do in this regard. Still, one must wonder if most startups have not opted to build replicas of existing solutions rather than going after new frontiers.\n\nToo many fintech startups?\n\nLooking at the numbers alone will suggest that there are too many fintech startups, so let\u2019s look at how Nigeria compares to other countries.\n\nWith 1.4 billion people, India is only second to China in population. It is also home to 6,636 fintech startups. The largest country in South America, Brazil, has 1,446 fintech startups for its 215 million inhabitants.\n\nIn the United States and the United Kingdom, we have two world\u2019s largest economies. While the United States has 8,775 fintech startups for its 334.6 million people, the United Kingdom has 1,600 fintech startups serving 68.5 million people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBelow is the ratio of fintech startups to the population of each country:\n\nIndia \u2013 1 fintech for 210,970 people\n\nBrazil \u2013 1 fintech for 148,686 people\n\nUnited States \u2013 1 fintech for 38,131 people\n\nUnited Kingdom \u2013 1 fintech for 27,200 people\n\nNigeria \u20131 fintech for 740,740 people\n\nOn this evidence, there aren\u2019t too many startups in Nigeria. Looking at the numbers, one could say that we need at least 1,000 more fintech startups in the country.\n\nWhile the focus is often on how well they have improved financial services in the country \u2014 a fair metric for assessment \u2014 perhaps we should look at other metrics like how many jobs they have created and the industries or services they power.\n\nTo bring financial services closer to the last mile, fintech startups have used an agency banking model that indirectly provides jobs for these agents. OPay, TeamApt, Paga, and CrowdForce are some of the startups with the most agents; between them, they have at least 434,000 agents.\n\nWhen you add the 770,000 and 120,000 agents from MoMo and First Mobile, respectively, it is clear that fintech startups are creating value.\n\nFintech startups also power other industries. A familiar example is PiggyVest, launched in 2016 to help users digitise their savings. A crucial part of their success was launching after Paystack did. If they had launched earlier, users would have had limited options to deposit money, which may have shut the business down.\n\neCommerce startups also benefit from fintech startups with a wide range of payment options provided for merchants, which would have been impossible just a few years ago.\n\nTo the moon\n\nRegardless of the progress made by fintech startups, one thing is sure; much more can be done. While the population of Nigerians with a bank account has steadily grown, a 2021 EFInA report reveals that only 45% of Nigerians are banked.\n\nSimilarly, it states that less than 30% of adult Nigerians have or use financial services from non-banking institutions. With most active fintech startups focused on payments and lending, there is still room for innovation in insurance, where 97% of Nigerians do not have health insurance, investments/wealth management, and cross border payments.\n\nWith a growing population, more players are needed to do the hard work of providing financial services to rural dwellers or improving the services currently available to urban dwellers. Either way, as a wise man once said, \u201cit is day one.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

As part of this partnership, MARA will become the official crypto partner of the Central African Republic and an advisor to the President on crypto strategy and planning.\n\nMARA\u2019s launch comes at a critical inflection point in Sub-Saharan Africa. Political and economic instability has led to devaluation of currencies across the region, while the current centralized financial system continues to present ongoing obstacles to the development of both local economies and individuals. As a result, food prices have doubled to tripled in some areas and created record-breaking interest rates. These tired systems have prompted a dire need for a decentralized alternative.\n\nMARA\u2019s mission is to become the portal to the crypto economy for the African population. While cutting-edge technologies such as cryptocurrency have shown incredible promise among Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s predominantly young and technologically-native population, there are considerable hurdles to using them. Many existing global exchanges cannot operate in the region due to regulatory challenges as well as difficulty reaching the African consumer in an authentic way. These barriers to access significantly restrict both the number of people who can participate in the crypto economy and the potential uses for digital currency in the region.\n\nThe MARA suite of products addresses a variety of essential crypto-finance needs while complying with local regulations and being built authentically for the African audience. MARA\u2019s products include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMARA Wallet \u2013 a brokerage app offering the crypto-curious user a friendly, distilled experience through which they can buy, send, sell and withdraw both fiat and crypto assets instantly and without any prior crypto knowledge.\n\n\u2013 a brokerage app offering the crypto-curious user a friendly, distilled experience through which they can buy, send, sell and withdraw both fiat and crypto assets instantly and without any prior crypto knowledge. Pro-Exchange \u2013 a full-feature cryptocurrency platform focused on experienced users that offers a comprehensive suite of trading options and technical analysis tools.\n\nMARA Chain \u2013 a layer-1 blockchain, powered by the native MARA token, that gives savvy developers a place to build decentralized applications that will help shape the future of the African crypto economy.\n\nThe MARA executive team is led by Chi Nnadi, Lucas Llin\u00e1s M\u00fanera, Dearg OBartuin, and Kate Kallot, and is joined by board advisors Kojo Annan and Tatiana Koffman.\n\n\u201cMARA\u2019s mission is to facilitate a more equitable distribution of capital by providing a decentralized alternative that spans across tribes, class, cultures, and countries,\u201d says Chi Nnadi, co-founder and CEO of MARA. \u201cOur goal is to close the gap in opportunities for Sub-Saharan individuals and establish a financial infrastructure that they can build their lives upon.\u201d\n\nUnlike its competitors from North America and Europe, MARA\u2019s onboarding, support, and ecosystem reflects the needs of Africans. KYC/AML is compliant to global standards, and is compatible with international financial regulations. Customer support is easily accessed and will be available in both local and international languages.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to partner with MARA as it embarks on building a digital financial system for Sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d says Schuster Tanger, Co-Founder of TQ Ventures. \u201cWith the right resources, this region has potential for mass adoption of cryptocurrency. To that end, the local knowledge and specialized skills of the MARA team is quite promising.\u201d\n\nMARA will initially launch in Kenya, Nigeria, and surrounding regions. The MARA Wallet app will be available in the App Store and Google Play stores. Pre-registered users will join a queue to enable early access on a first-come, first-served basis. Users can jump up the queue by referring others, and earn crypto rewards by doing so, while increasing their odds of winning additional prizes and rewards in the process. Once onboarded, the MARA Wallet will enable users to invest in crypto and send money to their family members in real time, without processing times or delays.\n\nAbout MARA\n\nMARA is building Africa\u2019s portal to the crypto economy through a Pan-African suite of products that addresses a variety of crypto-finance needs while complying with local regulations and being built authentically for the African audience. MARA will initially launch in Kenya and Nigeria, with a simplified user-friendly consumer app through which users can easily buy, sell, send, and withdraw cryptocurrencies. MARA will also launch a pro-exchange for experienced users who prefer a full set of trading options and technical analysis tools. The MARA Chain will launch later in 2022, giving savvy developers a place to build decentralized applications that will help shape the future of the African crypto economy. MARA\u2019s executive team includes former executives from Amazon, PayPal, Uber, NVIDIA, Founders Bank, Rappi, and more.

          "title": "Cabinet reshuffle: Buhari\u2019s opportunity to engage technocrats \u2013 Experts",
          "text": "Ahead of the planned Cabinet reshuffle by President Muhammadu Buhari, Nigerians have advised him to see it as an opportunity to revamp the ailing economy, through appointment of technocrats.\n\nThe need for an urgent injection of fresh blood in the cabinet became evident Friday as President Buhari held a valedictory meeting with nine of the ministers at the Presidential Villa, Abuja with Emeka Nwajiuba, former Minister of State, Education, who was the first to resign, absent with apologies.\n\nMinisters of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio; Science, Technology and Innovation, Ogbonnaya Onu; State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva; Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige ( who later on Friday made a volte face), were present at the event.\n\nOthers are the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, Minister of State, Mines and Steel Development, Uche Ogah, the Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen and the Minister of State for Niger Delta Affairs, Tayo Alasoadura.\n\nSpecial Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina told BusinessDay Sunday in Abuja that the Ministers have until Monday, May 16th, 2022, to turn in their resignations.\n\n\u201cThat is what is in the public domain. They were given up to Monday to resign, so they can either resign or decide to remain in office,\u201d he said.\n\nEconomic experts believe that given the huge debt burden hovering around N40 trillion, power, security and unemployment challenges, this may be a last minute opportunity for the President to raise a team of economic experts to create \u201cstrong legacy for the outgoing government.\u201d\n\nKatchi Ononuju, a strong critic of Buhari\u2019s administration, said Nigeria\u2019s economic woes were recently compounded by de-listing of the country by global financial institution, JPMorgan, from its list of emerging market sovereign recommendations, over its fiscal woes.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cJPMorgan had hinged their decision on the grounds of insolvency, following failures by NNPC to transfer revenue to the government from January to March this year, due to petrol subsidies and low oil production\n\n\u201cThey moved Nigeria out of the bank\u2019s \u2018overweight\u2019 category, because the country has failed to take advantage of high oil prices.\u201d\n\nOnonuju, who also is a member of the PDP, said that Nigeria\u2019s fiscal woes have worsened global risks.\n\n\u201cSo, as you can see, there is nothing new in what the President is doing. I see this as a beginning to our taking over. The President has destroyed the economy. For the past ninety days, Nigeria did not remit revenue from oil sales to the economy. We no longer enjoy our credit line. They have removed Nigeria. He should be able to bring in Ministers who can restore confidence in the nation\u2019s economic system,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Adetokumbo Kayode, said that \u201cThe Presidency is already a lame duck Presidency.\u201d\n\nHe observed that \u201ceverybody is already looking towards the incoming presidency; everybody is looking towards the incoming administration.\u201d\n\nHe urged President Buhari to look for people who will rescue the country and return it to the process of quick recovery by appointing \u201ctechnocrats.\u201d\n\nKayode, who also served as Minister of Culture and Tourism, under the Yar\u2019Adua administration, advised the President to \u201cengage strong hands\u201d who are already knowledgeable in governance, adding that \u201cthis last one year should not be for experimentation, political compensation, or appointments of neophytes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the last year in office and considering the challenges, we cannot continue to experiment,\u201d he further said.\n\nHe also urged the Buhari administration to push the modular refineries issues beyond the current efforts, by waiving some of the payments.\n\n\u201cThe government can encourage governments at the sub-national levels to come in and invest in building these refineries,\u201d he said.\n\nRead also: Cabinet reshuffle imminent as Buhari bids farewell to 10 ministers\n\nFormer Minister of Health Alphonsus Nwosu, decried the confusion in the polity, describing it as \u201cunhealthy for the polity.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the President has the prerogatives to appoint whoever he wishes into his cabinet.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned, he can only appoint who he can work with; so, he should go ahead.

          "text": "With the huge size of the presidential aspirants in the two main political parties in the country, observers have said that there would be plenty wheeling and dealing at the primaries scheduled for the end of this month May.\n\nThey also predict that the primaries would witness a moral equivalence of war in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThe ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the main opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) will hold their presidential primaries between May 28 and 30, 2022.\n\nLike in the past primaries since 1998, the gatherings would feature a lot of intrigues, and it is expected that it would be more intense this time around because of the variegated interests and the unique nature of the 2023 general election.\n\nObservers also speak in tandem that it is going to be worse this time around with a retinue of aspirants jostling for the tickets of either of the parties.\n\nIn the APC where about 27 aspirants would be slugging it out, it is expected that money and subterfuge would be deployed in great measure to clinch the slot.\n\nThe party\u2019s costly expression of interest and nomination forms have been generating controversy in the polity. Those who bought the forms would not be smiling on that day, except they indeed, as being rumoured, were sponsored by the party to create a false impression that the APC remained a popular vehicle to actualise presidential ambition.\n\nThere is also the story making the rounds about a compulsory \u201cwithdrawal letter\u201d that aspirants were told to sign at the point of purchasing the form. The letter may be put to use at the event, where many of them would be forced to withdraw.\n\nRumours of a consensus option are also gaining ground. It is being said that the preferred presidential candidate would be foisted on the party in the manner that Abdullahi Adamu emerged as the national chairman of the party at the recent national convention.\n\nAlthough majority of the aspirants are from the South, alleged plans to throw up Ahmed Lawan, Senate president, are afoot. The intrigue is expected to yield the desired fruit at the primary.\n\nAs always, Southern elements who have been parading themselves as serious contenders would be promised various positions, contracts and an unlimited access to the seat of power from 2023 in the event of the victory of the party.\n\nSome of those who may prove \u201cstubborn\u201d may be coerced into submission with the mantra \u201cparty is supreme.\u201d\n\nFor the People\u2019s Democratic Party which has slated its presidential primary for May 29, the party is going in for the exercise with many aspirants already crest-fallen.\n\nThe decision of the leadership of the umbrella association to throw the ticket open against its own constitution that favours rotation/zoning is seen by many as the beginning of the intrigue that would culminate in the emergence of a Northern element as the party\u2019s candidate.\n\nAlready, it is becoming clearer to many of the aspirants that their N40million has become a serious gamble, hence the alleged nocturnal moves by some of them to be considered as vice presidential candidate.\n\nA political pundit who spoke with BusinessDay Sunday on condition of anonymity said that a whole lot of the aspirants may leave the venue of the primaries to a health facility because of the political horror they would witness that would agitate their minds and upset their blood pressure.\n\nObservers say that the contest for the presidential ticket in the APC may be between the consensus candidate and Tinubu in the primary.\n\n\u201cI think there will be more intrigue in the next few days, some of them know they can\u2019t go anywhere, they don\u2019t have structure anywhere to win a presidential election or primary.\n\n\u201cBut the fight for the APC ticket may be between the candidate backed by the Northern elders and leaders and PDP Southern governors. So, there won\u2019t be coercion but intrigues with horse trading,\u201d Kunle Okunade, a political analyst, said.\n\nOkunade added that several aspirants in the presidential race would soon realise they cannot go far and join force with stronger aspirants.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNo aspirant at this stage would be coerced to step down but what will happen is negotiation and renegotiation, alignment and realignment by promoters of aspirants. Intrigues are part of politicking and it would occur till a candidate emerges at the primaries.\u201d\n\nThe situation in the PDP may be almost similar scenarios; pundits believe that most of the aspirants may collapse into a consensus arrangement. They said that the aspirants from the South-East might adopt one aspirant, likewise the South-South and the North.\n\n\u201cI expect intrigues in the next few days, but where the challenge might be would be in the north with aspirants that have nursed life-long ambition of becoming president. At the end of the day, money might not be the deciding factor in the primaries,\u201d Anayo Ezegwu, political analyst, said.\n\nEzegwu predicted that the presidential primaries of the two major political parties may not be predictable as many Nigerians may think.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe forthcoming presidential primaries of the two major political parties in the country would be interesting. It will not be predictable as many Nigerians may think. But the most interesting of them all would be the APC primary because of the calibre of aspirants in the race.\u201d\n\nIdowu Omolegan, a public affair analyst and lawyer, said: \u201cThe coming party primaries will be marked by delegate-buying, financial inducements and manipulation by aspirants and their cliques. Forget about delegates looking at capacity, they are all there for what they can make and it will go to the highest bidder; ideologies will not count at this point; maybe, after the primaries we can start talking about ideologies, but for now, it\u2019s about money, clique and caucuses.\u201d\n\nPresidential conventions since 1998\n\nDuring the PDP\u2019s 1998 Jos Convention for the 1999 Presidential election, aspirants from the three Southern geopolitical zones participated.\n\nThere was no micro-zoning or gifting of the party ticket to any region or tribe, aside from the fact that it was exclusively zoned to the South, while the North sat on the sidelines, having wielded power for nearly two decades; First Republic under Tafawa Balewa, Military rule and the Second Republic under Shehu Shagari (1st Oct 1979 to 29th May 1999).\n\nIn 2003, the then incumbent president, Olusegun Obasanjo of the South West ran for re-election. As both Southerners and Northerners fought, there was no zoning. Alex Ekwueme of the South East, Abubakar Rimi of the North West, and Barnabas Gemade of the North Central also contested the primaries with him.\n\nObasanjo received 2642 votes (75percent), Ekwueme received 611 votes (17percent), Rimi received 159 votes while 17 votes were cast for Gemade.\n\nRochas Okorocha of the South East finished a distant second to the winner, Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua of the North West, in the PDP\u2019s 2006 Presidential primaries.\n\nThe same thing happened in the PDP primaries in 2011, when Jonathan from the South-South defeated Atiku Abubakar from the North East. Jonathan also ran unchallenged in 2014 as the incumbent.\n\nThe PDP Presidential primaries were strictly zoned to the north for the 2019 election. The primary contenders were Atiku and Dankwambo (North East), Bukola Saraki and David Mark (North Central); Aminu Tambuwal and Rabiu Kwankwaso, Ahmed Markafi, Ibrahim Saminu Turaki and Sule Lamido (North West), with Atiku becoming the flag bearer.\n\nThe most recent incidence of zoning in the South was in 2017 for the PDP National Chairmanship. Candidates from the South-West and South-South competed, with the South-South emerging victorious.\n\nRead also: 2023: Nine months enough to secure the nation for election \u2013 INEC\n\nFor the 2023 election, the PDP has now thrown the presidential ticket open, going against its constitution.\n\nThe current All Progressives Congress (APC) was registered as a political party in 2013, following the merger of the now defunct, Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), All Nigeria People\u2019s Party (ANPP), Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), a faction of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and the new People\u2019s Democratic Party (n-PDP).\n\nThe APC, which wrest power from the PDP in 2015, after 16 years in the saddle, has held two National Conventions for the nomination of Presidential candidate; in 2014 and 2018.\n\nAt the 2014 maiden Presidential Convention of APC held in Lagos, the incumbent President, Muhammadu Buhari contested against, the then Governor of Kano State, Rabiu Kwankwaso, former Vice President Atiku, Imo State Governor at the time, Rochas Okorocha and the Publisher/Chairman Leadership Newspaper, the late Sam Nda-Isaiah.\n\nAt the end of the polls, Buhari won the APC Presidential ticket with 3,430 votes; Kwankwaso got 974 votes; Atiku polled 954 votes; Okorocha secured 624 votes, while Nda-Isaiah scored 10 votes and 16 voided votes were recorded.\n\nThe Chief Returning Officer for the election, Kayode Fayemi, who would later become Buhari\u2019s Minister and now Governor of Ekiti State, declared the winner of the polls (Buhari).\n\nThere were also discreet attempts by some party leaders to pick a consensus candidate among the aspirants but that were unsuccessful as the five contenders preferred to go into real contest with the hope of securing victory.\n\nAs the former Governor of Borno State, Kashim Shettima recently disclosed, if not for the intervention of the former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, moneybags would have hijacked the process.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn 2015, some aspirants with very huge war chest were itching to clinch the ticket of the APC, like the rock of Gibraltar, Asiwaju and his progressive team stood solidly behind the candidate of Presidency Muhammadu Buhari.\u201d\n\nWhile Okorocha left to contest and won his second term as Governor of Imo State, Kwankwaso had vied for the Kano Central Senatorial District and won a seat in the Senate during the 8th National Assembly.\n\nFor the 2018 Convention ahead of the 2019 general election, Buhari contested alone via the direct mode of primary in which he scored about 15 million votes.",

He made this known during the quarterly meeting with civil society organizations (CSOs) at the Commission\u2019s office in Abuja.\n\nAccording to the chairman, the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise will be ending on the 30th June 2022.\n\nHe said, \u201d both the online pre-registration as well as the physical registration at designated centres are taking place simultaneously. However, online pre-registrants would require time to schedule appointments to complete their registration physically at designated centers.\n\nFor this reason, the Commission has decided to suspend the online registration in the next three weeks to enable the online registrants to complete their registration physically at the designated centres before the exercise is suspended on 30th June 2022.\n\nThis according to him, will enable the Commission to clean up the registration data, print the Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs)and compile the register ahead of the 2023 General Election.\n\nOn the cleaning up of the registration data,the chairman said that, the Commission addressed a Press Conference four weeks ago to present a report on the CVR exercise covering the period from June to December 2021.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, the Commission deployed the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) which is a comprehensive and robust system involving not just the fingerprint identification but also the facial biometric recognition. The report of the ABIS is included among the documents in your folders for this meeting. There will also be a presentation on the exercise by our ICT Department\u201d.\n\nHe also said that, the Commission has reviewed the functionality of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) following the complaints received after the recent Area Council elections in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) held on 12th February 2022; noting that the Commission has just finished the configuration of the BVAS for the Ekiti State Governorship election.\n\nProf. Yakubu also said that, \u201cbeyond the conduct of primaries by political parties, the Commission is required to make Regulations and Guidelines for the implementation of the provisions of the Electoral Act. These Regulations and Guidelines, together with the Constitution and the Electoral Act, constitute the electoral legal framework that govern the conduct of elections. I am glad to report that the Commission will finalise the Regulations and Guidelines next week to guide the conduct of future elections, including the forthcoming Ekiti and Osun Governorship elections as well as the 2023 General Election\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are many progressive provisions of the Electoral Act 2022 which require clear understanding to guide implementation. One of such provisions is the electronic transmission of election results. At this meeting, we will discuss the implementation of the provisions of Sections 60, 62 and 64 of the Electoral Act 2022 regarding the management of election results. We have prepared a document for discussion which is included in your folders for this meeting\u201d.\n\n\u201cSection 54(2) of the Electoral Act makes provision for assistive materials for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs).\n\nThis is another progressive provision of the new Electoral Act. Over the years, we have worked with the disability community in designing some of the assistive materials such as the Braille Ballot Guide and the provision of magnifying glasses for visually challenged voters and posters for the deaf. We are also working together to collect disaggregated data for PWDs to assist the Commission in optimally deploying the assistive materials. To deepen our collaboration, a meeting will be convened as early as next week with the disability community to discuss the implementation of the provisions of the new Electoral Act on inclusivity\u201d, he added.\n\nWhile commending the Commission for a job Welldone, Mrs Ene Obi, Country Director ActionAid & Convener Civil Society Situation Room who spoke on behalf of the CSOs said the Commission needs to do more to encourage citizens to register and come out to vote saying that that is one of the greatest challenges facing the electoral system.\n\n\u201cEven with the PVCs, a lot of people don\u2019t come out to vote and this is not helping the system. We want the Commission through its department for voters education to create more enlightenment,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Civil society organizations also urged the commission to do all within its powers to ensure there is serious improvement on the upcoming Ekiti state election and others.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Senate Chief Whip and former governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu, has said nine presidential aspirants of the All Progressives Congress (APC) are ready to step down to for Ahmad Lawan, president of the senate.\n\nLawan, a late entrant into the 2023 presidential race, obtained the N100 million APC presidential forms last week.\n\nThough Kalu did not list their names of the APC aspirants planning to step down for Lawan, he was the first to drop his presidential ambition in support of Lawan on the grounds of APC\u2019s failure to zone the presidential ticket to the South-East.\n\n\u201cLawan\u2019s candidature will rock like a hurricane. The issue of the APC presidential candidate will be settled even before the primaries. As I am talking to you, about nine presidential aspirants from our party have intimated me of their plans to drop their presidential ambition to support Ahmad Lawan.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes that not signify victory before the election? Lawan\u2019s candidature will rock like a hurricane. Lawan is from the North-East and has similar sympathy with the South-East that is yet to produce President.\n\n\u201cI have repeated my reasons for dropping my ambition for Lawan many times and I am sure Nigerians are aware already. We are also expecting an influential presidential aspirant from the opposition to join the APC.\n\n\u201cSo, you can see the party is very progressive and properly ready for Lawan\u2019s emergence.\u201d\n\nOn the call for the postponement of primary by some political parties, Kalu said he did not expect the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to listen to them.\n\nHe said the parties were duly informed and should have prepared well as mandated by the electoral body.\n\n\u201cExtension of the dates will only support irresponsibility. Nigerians find it difficult to keep to time and appointments and that is why they would always seek extra time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI support INEC to stick to their timetable, otherwise we will be living with postponement after postponement. Such a trend is not healthy for a society and its people.\n\n\u201cWe complain of indiscipline but not ready to be practical about the requirements of discipline. INEC should discipline any party that fails to meet up, because that is the only way they can take their jobs seriously,\u201d Kalu said.",

          "text": "Second-term governors who have come out openly to anoint successors are facing stiff opposition from other aspirants ahead of the party primaries for various elective positions that begin next week.\n\nNineteen of the 36 state governors are in their second and final terms in office and will exit on May 29, 2023. The governorship election in Ekiti State will, however, be held on June 18, 2022. All others are holding on March 11, 2023, according to the election schedule released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nThe governorship primaries must be held before June 3, 2022 and outgoing governors are consolidating their grip on party structures and the delegates who will elect the respective flag bearers.\n\nThe ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has planned its governorship primaries for May 24, 2022, while the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is scheduled to hold its primaries on May 23, 2022.\n\nSome governors are, however, yet to endorse any aspirants, causing tension within their own camps and parties, and leading to fears of possible imposition at the last minute.\n\nFindings by LEADERSHIP Sunday, however, show that the outgoing governors are in a good position to ensure their preferred aspirants emerge victorious at the primaries.\n\nOur correspondents compiled reports on who the governors have endorsed or are believed to be backing and, thus, likely to win their party tickets. `\n\nIn Katsina, All Eyes Are On Masanawa\n\nGovernor Aminu Bello Masari has promised to give all aspirants equal opportunity in the primary election of the APC, but there is rising speculation in the state pointing to the managing director of the Nigeria Security Printing and Minting Company (NSPMC), Umar Abbas Masanawa, as the most likely aspirant for the ticket.\n\nThis follows his purchase of interest and nomination forms last week.\n\nHowever, reports suggest that Masanawa is being sponsored by a renowned Katsina business mogul, Dahiru Bara\u2019u Mangal, while other stakeholders allegedly refer to him as \u2018Abuja politician.\u2019\n\nAlready, other aspirants have since resisted the claim, calling on delegates and their supporters to disregard the claim as they are confident of winning the race.\n\nKano: Ganduje Backs Gawuna\n\nKano State governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, officially endorsed his deputy, Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna, as gubernatorial candidate and his former Commissioner for Local Governments and Chieftaincy Affairs, Murtala Sule Garo, as the running mate for the forthcoming 2023 general election.\n\nLEADERSHIP Sunday reports that Ganduje made this known during a stakeholders\u2019 meeting of the ruling APC in the state, held at Government House,\n\nGanduje said, \u201cHe makes good use of his office, a very loyal lieutenant who is very loyal and dependable.\u201d For Garo, the governor said, \u201cHe is a real commander who is loyal and committed to our cause. This is a very fearless confidant. If you want to get a clear and clean political fight, you need somebody who is energetic, loyal and fearless. That is Murtala Sule Garo for you.\u201d\n\nKogi: Jamiu Could Be Bello\u2019s Pick\n\nGovernor Yahaya Bello is finishing his eighth-year two tenures and would like somebody to sustain his legacies.\n\nOfficially, the governor, who is contesting for president under the ruling APC, has not come out to endorse any aspirant as a possible successor. Three names however keep coming up:\n\nhis chief of staff, Pharmacist Asuku Jamiu; the deputy governor, Chief Edward Onoja and Senator Smart Adeyemi.\n\nHowever, political watchers in the state believe Bello\u2019s preferred aspirant is his chief of staff.\n\nBenue: Uba Emerges PDP Consensus Candidate In Benue\n\nIn Benue State, there were reports that Governor Samuel Ortom\u2019s anointed candidate is the immediate past commissioner of education, Professor Dennis Ityavyar.\n\nHowever, unconfirmed sources said the PDP chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, is more comfortable with the current speaker of the state assembly, Titus Uba, and for this Ityavyar was zoned out of the contest, with Uba emerging the consensus aspirant from the 14 Tiv speaking local government areas representing Benue North West.\n\nUba will be contesting against his only opponent, the current deputy governor of Benue state, representing Benue South senatorial district, Engr Benson Abounu.\n\nThe Benue North West senatorial district, which is currently occupying the governorship seat via Samuel Ortom, will not be presenting an aspirant during the delegates conference.\n\nKaduna: El-Rufai Endorses Uba Sani\n\nIn Kaduna State, Governor Nasir El-Rufai recently endorsed the senator representing Kaduna Central senatorial district, Uba Sani as a potential successor.\n\nThe governor had, in a meeting at the Kaduna State Government House with party stakeholders and his core team, called on his loyalists to support the senator in the party\u2019s primary.\n\nSenator Sani is contesting the governorship on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, APC.\n\nA former chief of staff to the Kaduna State governor, Muhammad Abdullahi Dattijo, stepped down for Sani after obtaining the APC gubernatorial nomination forms.\n\nDespite the governor\u2019s endorsement of Sen. Sani, a former member of the House of Representatives and one of the guber aspirants, Sani Sha\u2019aban, who is an in-law to President Muhammadu Buhari, revealed that he would participate in the APC governorship primaries in Kaduna State.\n\nAlso, the director-general of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, NIMASA, Bashir Jamoh, who is also running for the governorship under the APC, has purchased his nomination form and is ready for the primaries.\n\nEnugu: Ugwuanyi Yet To Endorse Successor\n\nGovernor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi has not endorsed any aspirants as his successor for the 2023 governorship election in the state.\n\nMore than 20 aspirants from the PDP, APC and All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) are vying to be the landlord of the Lion Building in Enugu.\n\nA delegate of the PDP, Dennis Egwu told our correspondent that they are waiting for the governor to tell them the anointed aspirant to follow.\n\n\u201cFor now, the governor has not anointed anybody. Nobody knows the anointed person and our leader, the governor of Enugu State, Ifeanyi Ugwuaji, has not told us anything. We are still waiting for him to anoint a candidate,\u201d he stated.\n\nSokoto: Dan Iya Takes On Shagari\n\nUnlike some other two-term governors who had endorsed their successors, Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal has kept mum on who succeeds him among the aspirants jostling for the coveted seat.\n\nEven the governor\u2019s body language has not betrayed him on his chosen successor. Rather, the choice candidate of PDP for the governorship ticket is expected to emerge through consensus at the behest of Sokoto elders.\n\nThe five aspirants ready to slug it out are the incumbent deputy governor, Manir Muhammad Dan\u2019Iya; immediate past commissioner for environment, Sagir Bafarawa; former minister of water resources, Muktari Shagari; ex-SSG, Sa\u2019idu Umar and incumbent PDP state chairman, Bello Goronyo.\n\nObservers are narrowing the PDP governorship candidature to a two-horse race between Manir Muhammad Dan\u2019Iya and Muktari Shagari.\n\nPlateau: Lalong\u2019s Body Language Points To Yiwaldat\n\nGovernor Simon Lalong is yet to officially or publicly announce his anointed successor.\n\nHowever, the body language of the governor points to the fact that he is going to anoint the former Benue Independent Resident Electoral Commissioner, Dr. Nentawe Yiwaldat as his successor.\n\nOn Monday18 April, APC governorship aspirants raised the alarm over the imposition of one of the aspirants, Dr. Nentawe Yilwatda and threatened to quit the party with their supporters if Governor Simon Lalong goes ahead to impose him on them as his anointed candidate.\n\nThe aspirants said the only condition that would make them remain in the APC is if due process is followed in the selection of the party\u2019s candidate during the May governorship primaries.\n\nThe chairman/convener of the Forum of APC Governorship Aspirants, Chief Amos Gizo, who addressed journalists in Jos, the state capital, insisted that any attempt by Governor Lalong and the party hierarchy to impose a candidate on them and the people of the state would be met with serious resistance.\n\nGovernor Lalong has earlier denied anointing his successor while addressing APC stakeholders meeting in Jos.\n\n\u201cI have not adopted or anointed any aspirant for governor or any other office. While very suitable members of our party have indicated interest to vie for different offices, we are carrying out consultations with all key stakeholders to ensure that at the end of the day, the best persons emerge to fly our party\u2019s flag,\u201d he said.\n\nRivers: Wike Has Two Preferred Candidates\n\nGovernor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike has two preferred successors as his second tenure expires on May 29, 2023.\n\nThe two candidates, who had already picked and submitted their nomination forms, are the secretary to the state government, Dr. Tammy Danagogo and the accountant-general of the state, Siminalaye Fubara.\n\nHowever, with the zoning of the Rivers West senatorial district ticket of the PDP to the Kalabari axis of the state where Danagogo comes from, the chances of the SSG getting the governorship ticket is very slim.\n\nTherefore, indications are rift that Fubara, who hails from Opobo Kingdom in Rivers South-East senatorial district, will be the governor\u2019s preferred successor to run on the PDP platform.\n\nDelta: Okowa Looks Towards Oborewori\n\nGovernor Ifeanyi Okowa has said openly that he has no preferred candidate but it is believed that he is supporting the Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Hon Sheriff Oborewori, who hails from Delta Central.\n\nHis body language and actions of his foot soldiers have given indications of where his heart is. There is also a cold war between the governor and former governor James Ibori over who should take over in 2023.\n\nThe chairman, PDP Leaders and Stakeholders\u2019 Forum in Delta South, Chief Mike Loyibo, said, \u201cWe have agreed to go with the Speaker and ensure that he clinches the ticket of the party even though the Urhobo Progress Union (UPU) Worldwide in a statement by its president general, Olorogun Taiga, and others endorsed David Edevbie\u2019s aspiration.\n\nPDP chairman in Delta State, Mr. Kingsley Esiso recently said he would support any governorship aspirant anointed by Okowa,\n\nEsiso\u2019s position came on the heels of the commitment by an influential pressure group, Delta Political Vanguard (DPV) to the Okowa cause. Speaking at a New Year rally in Agbor organised by DPV, Esiso said the person to decide who the next governor would be is the incumbent, adding: \u201cTherefore, on Okowa we stand.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Okowa\u2019s deputy, Mr Kingsley Otuaro, who hails from Delta South and once claimed to be the governor\u2019s anointed aspirant, said having completed the zoning arrangement among the three districts, any zone could produce the next governor.\n\nConversely, Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege has said the Delta State APC would frustrate Governor Okowa\u2019s plan to impose his successor on Deltans in the 2023 governorship election and determine who becomes the next governor.\n\nNiger: No Preferred Aspirant\n\nGovernor Abubakar Sani Bello has said he has no anointed aspirant, as he said those associated with him who may be seen supporting any candidate were on their own.\n\nThe governor was said to have endorsed the Blueprint Newspapers chairman, Mohammed Idris Malagi, but he came out to disown that notion.\n\nSimilarly, he was said to have given his deputy, Ahmed Mohammed Ketso, the go-ahead to contest, but he has refused to come out to categorically endorse him.\n\nAlso, the governor was said to have given two other contenders, Hon Mohammed Bago and Engr Sani Ndanusa, the greenlight to contest and had assured them of his support\n\nLEADERSHIP Sunday gathered that the governor is closely watching the key statesmen in the state in order not to be at crossroads with them if they choose to have a preferred aspirant.\n\nAnother source also hinted that the governor may naturally want a successor that will not rubbish his legacies, but he is wary of endorsing any aspirant considering the experiences in the state in 2007 and 2015 when the preferred aspirants and candidates of the incumbent governors could not scale through.\n\nAkwa Ibom: Pastor Eno has Udom Emmanuel\u2019s Confidence\n\nAgainst all odds, Governor Udom Emmanuel had on January 29, 2022, jolted the people of the state by declaring that Pastor Umo Bassey Eno would succeed him next year.\n\nIt was at the evening meeting deliberately convened by the governor for the purpose, with former governor, Obong Victor Attah; the Prelate Emeritus of the Methodist Church, Dr. Sunday Mbang and the Ibibio paramount ruler, Ntenyin Solomon Etuk, among eminent personalities who endorsed the choice. However, there are dissenting voices who believe Governor Emmanuel flouted the zoning order.\n\nPastor Eno, a business entrepreneur in the hotels and hospitality industry, was drafted into the politics of the state barely two years ago as a replacement for the former Commissioner for Lands and Water Resources, Architect Ime Ekpo, his kinsman, who died after a protracted ailment.\n\nThe governor\u2019s declaration has generated mixed reactions from the camp of Governor Emmanuel\u2019s loyalists and others including Senator Bassey Akpan; former Commissioner for Economic Development and Ibom Deep Seaport, Mr. Akan Okon; Mr. Akan Udofia and others who were angling to take over from him in 2023.\n\nApparently disturbed by the governor\u2019s action, which political bookmakers believe did not follow due consultations, horse trading and negotiations, Senator Akpan\u2019s camp and others rejected the decision.\n\nTaraba: Ishaku\u2019s Allies Stand Behind Kotolo\n\nThough there are insinuations that Governor Darius Ishaku has anointed the past accountant general of the state, Aminu Ayuba Kotolo to succeed him in the coming governorship election, the governor is yet to make a public pronouncement to the party members in the state with regard to the decision.\n\nSeven governorship aspirants have already been screened and cleared to contest the governorship primaries under the PDP in the state.\n\nThere are also indications that most of the governor\u2019s allies have been rallying round Kotolo, giving the impression that the former accountant general might be the anointed candidate among the seven aspirants.\n\nLEADERSHIP Sunday gathered that the likes of Joseph Albasu Kunini, speaker, Taraba state house of assembly, Bubajoda Mafindi, Victor Bala Kona, Joel Danlami Ikenya, Demien Dodo and Jerom Nyame, who have all been cleared to contest the election under PDP. are still hopeful of clinching the ticket at the end of the day\n\nCross River: Ayade Linked To Sen Otu\n\nProf Ben Ayade is said to have anointed a former senator representing Cross South senatorial district at the National Assembly, Senator Bassey Edet Otu, as his successor.\n\nIn the last election, Otu lost to Senator Gershom Bassey who is now the senator representing the Senatorial district.\n\nOut\u2019s re-election bid to the Senate was said to have been thwarted by the former governor, Senator Liyel Imoke, who had an interest in getting his bosom friend, Gershom Bassey, installed as senator to represent the Senatorial district.\n\nOti, popularly known by his people as \u201cSweet Prince\u201d, defected from the PDP to the APC to avert his political career being killed by Imoke who was at that time seen as the godfather of the PDP in Cross River State probably because of his closeness to former President Good luck Jonathan.\n\nCross River citizens had, at the kick-off of political activities in the state, felt that Ayade had already anointed the state Commissioner for Finance, Asuquo Ekpeyong Jr. as his successor.\n\nWhat played out at the critical stakeholders\u2019 meeting at Sheraton Hotels, Abuja, remains the greatest mystery and shock to many watching the political activities in the state.",

          "text": "BREAKING: Jihadists In Borno Plot To Kill Another Young Woman For Alleged Blasphemy, Post Death Threats On Facebook\n\nSome religious extremists in Borno State have threatened to kill a young woman named Naomi Goni, accusing her of insulting Prophet Muhammad (SAW) on Facebook.\n\nNEWS DIRECT has learned that one Abdulmajid Tanko Izge, who claims to be the President of a group called Borno Youth Support, is supporting the threat.\n\nHe promised Naomi that she would receive the death penalty.\n\nThe threat from Borno radicals comes as the country continues to grapple with the gruesome murder of Deborah Samuel, a 200-level Shehu Shagari College of Education student in Sokoto State, by a Muslim mob made up of her classmates last Thursday.\n\nThe incident has continued to attract nationwide condemnation and the police have arrested two suspects \u2013 although a protest by some Muslim youths over the arrest on Saturday turned violent in the state and forced Governor Aminu Tambuwal to impose a 24-hour curfew.\n\nIn the Borno episode, SaharaReporters learnt that the police had taken Naomi Goni into custody over the death threats by the Jihadists.\n\nWriting partly in Hausa, Tanko Izge said, \u201cA message to Government of Borno State. Akwai wata yarinya me suna Naomi Goni wanda tayi batanci ga manzo Allah wanda hakan a musulunci kisa ne hukunci Ko da soho ne koda musulmi ne ya kafurta. Dan haka muna kira ga gwamnatin Borno tayi gaggawan daukan mataki inhar ba haka ba kuma mu musulmai baza muyi bacci ba kuma zamu dauka da kanmu (There is a girl named Naomi Goni who insulted the Messenger of Allah (saw) and in Islam it is a death sentence even if it is a Muslim. We therefore call on the Borno State Government to take immediate action or else we Muslims will not sleep and we will take action).\u201d\n\nHe made the post on his Facebook as seen by SaharaReporters.\n\nHe added, \u201cNaomi you must face the consequences. We will continue raising our voice until action is taken. #Findnaomigoni.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Gaskiya Tura yakai Bango A gari Irin Borno wata Ta Zage ma aiki Amma gwamnati Bawani feed Back. Zuciyana yana Tapasa I will surely come for protest.! (In fact, the government has not yet commented on the situation. My heart is pounding I will surely come for protest).\u201d\n\nA check on Facebook also showed some northerners calling for her death.\n\n\u201cThe punishment for blasphemy is death! in most religions including Christianity. Respect people\u2019s religion. It\u2019s simple,\u201d one Farouq Umar Farouq wrote.\n\nAnother Facebook user identified as Ja\u2019afar M A Baggo said, \u201cAllah tsinewa duk wanda yasa hannu a wajen bata kariya ko wace iri ce. Allah ya rugurgusa duk wanda ke da niya/burin kare wannan la\u2019ananniyar bakar arniyar. Don Allah ku kashe ta mutanen Maiduguri. (God condemns anyone who engages in anything of this kind. May God destroy anyone who intends to protect this damn evil lady. Please the people of Maiduguri should kill her.)\n\nSpeaking to SaharaReporters, a security source said Naomi had been taken into custody by the police.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s currently under detention and denied making the post; she said her account was hacked after she gave birth last year. I don\u2019t think she will be released soon so she won\u2019t be killed. I heard some people are also planning to attack her father\u2019s house here in Maiduguri.\u201d",

We are however doing everything possible to reconnect the line to the national grid\u201d.\n\nHe noted that the collapsed tower was not the only one vandalized and that restringing the transmission line involves bringing down the 330kV DC line on some suspension towers, that were minimally vandalized, up to the nearest tension towers on both sides of the collapsed tower and fortifying the suspension towers before restringing the lines to ensure quality work is done,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe noted that work has reached 70% completion and that TCN is working hard to ensure that the 330kV DC transmission line is completed and reconnected to the national grid in one week, to ensure the evacuation of over 400MW stranded power at the Odukpani Power Plant near Calabar as well as the restoration of power supply to Cross River State.\n\nEngr. Adewumi appealed to the public to help TCN in the fight against the vandalism of power infrastructure, saying that such acts are detrimental to Nigerians and the expansion of power infrastructure in Nigeria.

ABCON under my leadership will continue to encourage our members to play the vital role of closing the exchange rate gaps in the market and reducing widening premium between the parallel market and the official window,\u201d he said.\n\nGwadabe listed several factors that continue to undermine the naira stability and the local currency\u2019s value against other currencies.\n\nThe ABCON boss called for the creation of BDCs\u2019 Autonomous Foreign Exchange Trading Window (BAFEX) with determined maximum daily limit for legible BDCs to access dollars from banks, autonomous market and diaspora forex widow at the prevailing market prices.\n\nHe requested for enhancement of existing BDCs\u2019 automation portals to file transaction returns on CBN/ABCON/NFIU/NIBSS portals for effective regulatory monitoring and supervisions.\n\nGwadabe also sought for the creation of an automation portal to encourage registration of undocumented and unlicensed operators for effective monitoring, identification and tracking of their transactions.\n\nHe said the reluctance of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to open new windows through which foreign exchange can be attracted to the economy remains a key factor in the naira continued fall.\n\nHe said the non-inclusion of BDCs in the list of channels through which diaspora remittances flow to Nigeria, under the CBN\u2019s guidance and regulation, has reduced the volume of dollar inflows to the economy.\n\nAccording to him, the World Bank\u2019s latest Migration and Development Brief showed that Sub-Saharan Africa attracting $49 billion in 2021. The bank said officially recorded remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries are expected to increase by 4.2 per cent this year to reach $630 billion.\n\nGwadabe said Nigeria\u2019s contribution to the remittances fund is expected to rise when BDCs are allowed to receive funds from Nigerians in Diaspora into the economy.\n\nHe said the BDCs are to perform this role through contactless and digitised channels that make collections easy and seamless.\n\nHe said there is urgent need to review the guidelines on BDC\u2019s Scope of Operations to include participation in payment space, such as agency banking, Point of Sale (PoS) services, inbound and outbound forex transfers, ATM Forex services, to reflect global business model practice.\n\nHe suggested that the BDCs should be allowed to access dollars or diaspora remittances through the autonomous forex windows that enable operators to receive IMTOs proceeds, carry out online dollar operations and Point of Sale (PoS) Agency, among others.\n\nGwadabe insisted that now is the time to break the current industry monopoly that puts the remittances market in the hands of few players depriving others from tapping into the plan.\n\nThe ABCON boss also called for the establishment of training institutes to enhance capacity and infrastructure in the industry and broaden players\u2019 business scope with cash-back incentives for those that patronize BDCs while also implementing a less cumbersome and complex documentation requirements for end users.\n\n\u201cThe BDCs should be able to operate a network of digital solutions for PTA/BTA. This would reduce overheads, and improve profitability. Some BDCs might still consider working closer with commercial banks. The ABCON can also be recognized as self-regulatory organization to enable it operate effectively and sanction erring members,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cWe wish to reiterate our resolve to align with the policy thrust of the apex bank and ensure that ABCON members play their roles professionally and strategically in the interest of the market and economy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that de-marketing of BDCs by regulators and security agencies is not good for the stability of the market. The suggested the strengthening of over 4,500 BDCs to bring forex closer to the retail end users and boost market liquidity.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has said that with the establishment of world class healthcare facilities in Nigeria, the country was set to become a destination for medical tourism, in addition to reversing the brain drain in the health sector.\n\nMohammed who spoke after a media tour of Duchess International Hospital in Lagos, said the world class healthcare facilities springing up in Nigeria will also curb medical tourism abroad, conserve foreign reserves and create jobs.\n\n\u201cToday, we are here at the Duchess International Hospital. During the guided tour, I am sure you all saw that this is indeed a purpose-built, state-of-the-art, 100-bed hospital, which is aimed at delivering the highest standard of healthcare, using the most advanced technology and treatments to provide Nigerians with the best medical expertise available anywhere in the world,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that according to available records, Nigerians spend between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion on medical tourism annually, a development he described as a huge drain on the country\u2019s foreign reserves.\n\nHe expressed delight that many of the doctors at Duchess International Hospital, a subsidiary of Reddington Hospital, are Nigerians who had\n\ntrained and worked abroad, but who have now decided to return home because of the availability of healthcare facilities with standard equipment and a good work environment.\n\nThe Minister said the Federal Government, through the Central Bank of Nigeria and the Bank of Industry, provided financial support for Duchess International Hospital, as part of its intervention in the health sector.\n\n\u201cThis is not new. Recall that in the wake of Covid-19, the CBN set up the N100 billion Healthcare Sector Intervention Fund, now expanded to N200 billion, to provide credit support for the healthcare sector through long-term, low-cost financing,\u201d he said, listing other interventions by the Federal Government, through the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority, NSIA, as including a total of $22.5 million which was spent in establishing two diagnostic centres in Kano and Umuahia ($5.5 million each) and the NSIA-LUTH Cancer Centre in Lagos ($11.5 million)\n\n\u201cThe essence of these financial interventions and projects in the critical healthcare sector is to fast-track the evolvement of world class healthcare facilities like the Duchess International Hospital.\n\n\u201cWith that, we can conserve our foreign reserves, earn foreign exchange for the country, create jobs, reverse brain drain, become a destination for medical tourists and also ensure affordable and standard healthcare for Nigerians,\u201d he said.\n\nMohammed commended the management of the hospital for making their world class services affordable and accessible to ordinary Nigerians, particularly with the launching of the \u2018World Class Affordable Healthcare Programme that coincided with the visit of the Minister and the over 30 journalists who accompanied him on the tour.\n\n\u201cWith what we have seen here today and the programme that has just been launched, Nigerians can now get access to affordable and world class treatment in whatever is ailing them in many areas, including emergency medicine, women\u2019s health, paediatric care, cardiovascular medicine, kidney dialysis, dental treatment, eye care, etc,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Minister said the visit to the hospital was in continuation of the media tour of the development projects of the Buhari Administration, disclosing that in the past 40 days, he had taken the media on a tour of the Dangote Refinery and Petrochemical Project as well as the Dangote Fertilizer Company in Lagos; the Lekki Deep Seaport and the Duchess Hospital, in addition to the tour of road, rail, bridge and other projects across the country.\n\nThe essence of these tours he further explained was to showcase what the present administration has achieved in the various sectors adding that even where the project was private-sector driven, the Federal Government has either provided the enabling environment or, in some cases, supported such projects with funding,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chief Executive Officer of the hospital, Dr. Tokunbo Shitta-Bey, who conducted the Minister round the hospital, said the multi-specialist hospital, which was already attracting foreigners coming for treatment, is poised to make its advanced elite service affordable and accessible to Nigerians, who would pay only N5,000 for registration and 5,000 for consultation.",

          "text": "By Kehinde Ibrahim, Lagos\n\nHALO Financial Services Ltd, a fintech start-up has launched with an innovative approach to help Nigerians manage and grow their money.\n\nSpeaking at a media round table to introduce the company, the Chief Executive Officer and co-founder, Chidimma Onyeokoro disclosed that Halo enables communities to provide financial services to their members. Halo defines a community as any group of people with defined membership and identifiable leadership. This includes professional or trade associations, cooperatives, social clubs, unions, even old boys and girls associations and more. Community members are able to leverage the strength of their union for better financial returns. By focusing on communities, Halo will be able to scale faster.\n\nShe said, \u201cNigerians, have always understood that we progress faster when we do things together. From traditional groups savings schemes like \u2018ajo\u2019, to communities putting money together for community development projects, even friends pooling resources to help one of their squad. There\u2019s strength in numbers. We are using technology to harness that strength to drive wealth creation for individuals through their communities.\u2019\n\nAccording to her, trust is the bedrock of all financial services. By leveraging existing trust networks, Halo will be able to reach more people with the products, tools and knowledge to meet their wealth creation goals.\n\n\u2018One key differentiator for us is that we hold two licenses. We have a micro finance bank license and an asset management license. This allows us to offer a full spectrum of financial services from basic banking to sophisticated investments. It also means we are regulated by both SEC and CBN, so our risk management and corporate governance is very rigorous.\u2019\n\nNoting that the company is keen on serving as many people as possible, she explained that Halo offers multi-channel access. For those comfortable with technology, there is an app, mass market customers can transact with Halo via a nationwide network of agents, and high net worth communities can access a managed service.\n\nShe stated that the fintech space in Nigeria is extremely competitive, so to meet Halo\u2019s very ambitious goals they have built a team of dynamic, knowledgeable, and committed professionals with a deep understanding of market realities, and more importantly, possess the right skills and experience to help communities and their members navigate the financial landscape and reach their goals.",

He livestreamed the attack online.\n\nUS President Joe Biden condemned what he called an \u201cabhorrent\u201d act.\n\n\u201cWe are investigating this incident as both a hate crime and a case of racially-motivated violent extremism,\u201d said Stephen Belongia, from the FBI\u2019s Buffalo office, adding there was evidence of \u201cracial animosity.\u201d\n\nCBS news reported that the attacker shouted racial slurs during the shooting and suggested that he had a racial slur written on his weapon. He also apparently posted a manifesto online which included racist language and ideas.\n\nThe suspect is believed to have driven for some 200 miles to reach the predominantly black area of the city. Thirteen people were shot in total and the majority of the victims were black, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said.\n\n\u201cHe exited his vehicle. He was very heavily armed. He had tactical gear. He had a tactical helmet on.

He later appeared in court charged with first degree murder.\n\nThe three wounded victims \u2013 who all worked at the supermarket \u2013 have not sustained life-threatening injuries.",

The issue of the APC presidential candidate will be settled even before the primaries.\n\n\u201cAs I am talking to you, about nine presidential aspirants from our party have intimated me of their plans to drop their presidential ambition to support Ahmad Lawan.\n\n\u201cDoes that not signify victory before the election? Lawan\u2019s candidature will rock like hurricane. Lawan is from the Northeast and has similar sympathy with the Southeast that is yet to produce president.\n\n\u201cI have repeated my reasons for dropping my ambition for Lawan severally and I am sure Nigerians are aware already. We are also expecting an influential presidential aspirant from the opposition (PDP) to join the APC.\n\n\u201cSo, you can see the party is very progressive and properly ready for Lawan\u2019s emergence.\u201d\n\nOn the call for postponement of primary elections by some political parties, the former Abia State governor said that he does not expect the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to listen to them.\n\nHe said the parties were duly informed and should have prepared well as mandated by the electoral body.\n\n\u201cExtension of the dates will only support irresponsibility. Nigerians find it difficult to keep to time and appointments and that is why they would always seek for extra time.\n\n\u201cI support INEC to stick to their timetable otherwise we will be living with postponement after postponement. Such a trend is not healthy for a society and its people.\n\n\u201cWe complain of indiscipline, but are not ready to be practical about the requirements of discipline.\n\n\u201cINEC should discipline any party that fails to meet up, because that is the only way they can take their jobs seriously,\u201d he explained.\n\nEjiofor Alike",
