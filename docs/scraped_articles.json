          "text": "The Federal Government on Tuesday launched a new enhanced electronic passport to improve passport application process for Nigerians at home and in diaspora.\n\nSpeaking during the rollout of passport at the Nigerian High Commission in London, United Kingdom, the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola said it is the responsibility of the government to provide the passport without stress within a reasonable period, adding that the Nigerian passport is the highest affirmation of Nigerian citizenship.\n\nThis was contained in a statement on Tuesday by the Minister Media Adviser, Sola Fasure.\n\nThe statement was titled, \u201cFG launches Enhanced Passport In The UK\u201d\n\nIt partly read, \u201cWhat we have come to do here is symbolic of the core mandate of the Ministry of Interior and indeed, the Federal Government of Nigeria \u2013 affirmation of citizenship integrity.\n\n\u201d The Nigerian passport is the highest affirmation of Nigerian citizenship. It is therefore our responsibility to provide the passport without any stress, within a reasonable period.\n\n\u201cAs we are all aware, there have been huge challenges to passport administration, from shortage of booklet to touting and an economy of corruption built around it.\n\n\u201cThese challenges have persisted for too long and a lot of people have become cynical while other have taken them as normal and then roll with it. But I come from a tradition of problem solving in public administration. I do not believe that any problem is insurmountable, so we are going to solve all the problems associated with passport administration and we are already succeeding.\u201d\n\nRevealing the features of the new enhanced Passport, Aregbesola was quoted to have said that, it is a huge improvement from the standard Passport that was introduced back in 2007, with more sophisticated security features, making it one of the most secured passports in the world.\n\nThe statement continued, \u201cThe Enhanced e-Passport is a great improvement on the Biometric Passport technology which Nigeria adopted in 2007 as a strategic step towards curbing forgery, impersonation and other forms of frauds associated with obtaining travel document under the old Machine Readable Passport regime.\n\n\u201d We are aware that technology rules the world and we are keeping abreast of the latest development in the field.\n\n\u201cOver the years, the Nigeria Immigration Service had worked assiduously and in close synergy with Messrs Iris Smart Technologies Limited to develop and implement Passport reforms that are in tandem with international best practices, including extant International Civil Aviation Organization\u2019s Standards and Regulations\u201d.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nA coalition of 76 Non-governmental Organisations and Civil Society Activists have knocked the intelligence arms of the military and the Department of State Security Services for continued attacks on military formations and other infrastructure of the state by the Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorists as well as kidnapping and robbery by bandits saying the attacks were not only a set back to the war against insecurity but a blatant embarrassment to the armed forces and Nigeria in general.\n\nThe group particularly quoted the recent kidnapping of travellers in a broad daylight along Abuja Kaduna road, an attack in Borno state that resulted in the killing of a General and three other soldiers, the attack on a Kaduna-Abuja bound train and several others as clear instances of intelligence failure.\n\nIn a statement entitled, \u2018poor intelligence frustrating war against insecurity and jointly signed by, Dr Aliyu Bello of Peace and Conflict Resolution Initiative and Ambassador Jude Uchenna of Alliance for Justice and Peace on behalf of the group, urged the Federal government and the military high command to immediately rejig those behind intelligence gathering as war against insecurity cannot be won with a defective intelligence unit.\n\nRecall that members of the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) recently attacked a military base and killed Brigadier General Zirkusu and three others in Askira Uba Local Government Area of Borno State.\n\nTo this end, the group urged the Federal government and military top brass not to give room to anything that could jeopardise the many gains made in the efforts to flush out terrorists and other criminal elements in the northeast and the country at large.\n\nAccording to the group, the continued failure of the Department of State Security (DSS) and Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) has made the office of the National Security Adviser a lame dog stressing that the office depends on intelligence provided to act accordingly and called for the sack of those manning the agencies.\n\n\u201cWe have x-rayed the several attacks our troops have suffered and have come to the realisation that poor intelligence made our troops vulnerable. The gallantry of our personnel is legendary; the tactical strategies are top-notch. However, we cannot say the same about intelligence gathering.\n\nTherefore, we call for the sack of those in charge of DIA and DSS as the nation cannot afford to keep persons who have demonstrated deficiency in such a critical position.\n\n\u201cThe Air Force planes can remain in the air perpetually for surveillance, but if intelligence is missing, the enemy with superior intelligence will continue to explore the missing links. As patriots, we are compelled to draw the attention of the authorities to this critical component of warfare.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to allow persons who are not committed to the course of defeating insurgents to occupy sensitive positions as far as intelligence gathering is concerned. We therefore in clear terms urge the federal government to immediately sanitise the Department of State Security service and Defence Intelligence Agency to put an end to these painful and embarrassing attacks leading to loss of precious personnel\u201d, the group noted.",

          "text": "Governor Benedict Ayade of Cross River State has called for deliberate empowerment of Nigerian youths and easy access to capitals to enable them to focus keenly on agriculture.\n\nHe bemoaned their inability to easily access capital and other limitations to prosecute agriculture.\n\nAyade, represented by his Commissioner for Finance, Asuquo Ekpenyong jr, briefed journalists in Calabar on the just concluded 2nd Intra-Africa Trade Fair held in Durban, South Africa, where he stood in for the governor where he lamented their poor skills and capacity in modern agriculture methodologies.\n\n\u201cNigerian youths have an array of limitations in Agriculture business and this does not encourage them to delve deeper into the business. One is access to cheap capital. Most of the countries in Africa have weak infrastructure in terms of power, in terms of roads to provide logistics, water and other inputs required in production or commerce.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for countries in Africa to deliberately set out to empower, to build capacity among the young people; provide access to capital; not just access to capital, but more importantly that they set up a framework that eliminates the issues of adverse selection and moral hazard. This will ensure that the money gets to the right people who have sustainable ventures in which they intend to pursue,\u201d he said.\n\nEkpenyong stated, \u201cIf we do not do this efficiently and effectively, the truth is, what will end up happening is that, while the trade agreement may be good, we may have a scenario where foreigners to the continents come into the continent, set up with as little footprint as possible on the continent, produce locally, trade unrestricted but repatriate the value out of the continent.\u201d\n\nAs a way of engaging the youths keenly in Agriculture, Ekpenyong said the governor has decided to break the many barriers inhibiting them through mechanized farming model.\n\n\u201cWhat the Governor has done is to develop a 360 Degree Model to drive youth participation in mechanized farming by identifying young people in the State.\n\n\u201cUnder this 360 Model, the state ultimately intends to off-take the various produce and crops for processing in the state-owned industries,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The Registrar, Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Prof. Is-haq Oloyede on Tuesday said the agency has uncovered 706,189 illegal admissions by universities, Colleges of Education, polytechnics and other allies.\n\nOloyede made the disclosures at the Consultative Sensitization Meeting with Select Stakeholders in Abuja said the illegal admissions have damaged the image of the country.\n\nHe said the illegality was perpetrated in all the six geopolitical zones by public and private higher institutions.\n\nWhile about 114 universities accounted for 67.795 of the illegal admissions, 137 polytechnics were responsible for 489,918, 80 Colleges of Education for 142, 818 and 37 other institutions involved in 5,678 cases.\n\nThe undisclosed admissions were perpetrated from 2017 to 2020 by the affected institutions.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHe said such admissions were unknown to JAMB as prescribed by law.\n\nBut the Minister of Education has assented to JAMB\u2019s plea for a last chance for the violators.\n\nHe said the institutions disregarded JAMB\u2019s Central Admissions Processing System (CAPS which allows institutions to \u201conly admit candidates that met the requirements.\u201d\n\nHe said the affected institutions\u2019 Vice Chancellors, Rectors and Provosts have admitted their mistakes by \u201csending a formal letter of confession and disclosure to the JAMB Registrar.\u201d\n\nIn the list of the 114 universities given to stakeholders, some of the top indicted for illegal admissions include University of Jos(7,600); Benue State University(6,171); Olabisi Onabanjo University(5,669); Kwara State University(4, 281); Novena University(3,432); University of Nigeria, Nsukka(2,732); and Imo State University(2,330).\n\nOthers listed were University of Nigeria, Nsukka(2,732); Imo State University(2,330); University of Calabar(2,074); NTA Television College(1,934); Baze University(1,717); Oduduwa University(1,450); Kaduna State College of Education(1,417); Tai Solarin University of Education(1,101); Al-qalam University(1,062); Gombe State University(1,017).\n\nOloyede said: \u201cAs a measure of mopping up the backlog of improperly admitted candidates, the Honourable Minister of Education, Malam Adamu Adamu, assented to the Board\u2019s plea for a last chance for the violators.\n\n\u201cHe also approved the caveat that the culprits should, first and foremost, declare the number of candidates admitted outside CAPS between 2017 and 2020 by sending a formal letter of confession and disclosure to the JAMB Registrar.\n\n\u201cThose minimally qualified would then be condoned to put an end to the period and finally put the matter to rest.\n\n\u201cThe Board was then directed to launch massive campaigns to educate the public against accepting such illegal admissions henceforth.\n\n\u201cIt is astonishing that so far, 706,189 candidates have been disclosed as illegally admitted between 2017 and 2020.\u201d\n\nOloyede said there will no longer be opportunities for illegal admissions by universities and other higher institutions.\n\nHe said the illegality had hindered the future of many graduates and it was time to stop it.\n\nHe added: \u201cMeanwhile, the graduates of the illegitimate process need admission letters to pursue post-graduation endeavours like housemanship, scholarship, enrolment into the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), among others, they are out of sync.\n\nSome candidates had been forced in the past to seek Direct Entry into other universities after graduation just because their degrees were not recognized as a result of lack of admission letters at critical stages. The physical, psychological and mental strain of such candidates is better imagined than experienced. This could have been avoided if everyone played the game according to the rules.\n\n\u201cThe Board is then constrained to condone these illegitimate admissions through a process known as \u2018condonement\u2019 which was previously known as \u2018Regularization\u2019. This was done out of sympathy for the candidates and consideration of the enormous resources expended on the training of such candidates.\n\n\u201cThus, the Board was condoning all these infractions in admissions conducted prior till 2017. It is noteworthy that the lawlessness is perpetrated in institutions across the six geopolitical zones of the country.\u201d\n\nOloyede also claimed that some university lecturers were recently arrested for engaging in massive fraud associated with \u2018A Level\u2019 examinations by the Joint Universities Preliminary Examinations Board (JUPEB) and Interim Joint Matriculation Board.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs a moderator of the two \u2018A-Level entrance examinations in Nigeria, Joint Universities Preliminary Examinations Board(JUPEB) and Interim Joint Matriculation Board Examination(IJMBE), the attention of the board was drawn to the massive fraud associated with the conduct of these examinations.\n\n\u201cIt is quite disappointing that some of our colleagues were arrested while conniving with various examination syndicates to compromise the noble objectives of these two examinations. The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) in conjunction with the Federal Ministry of Education conducted a sting operation the result of which is monumentally embarrassing.\n\n\u201cDistinguished ladies and gentlemen, you must have been disturbed by the recent indicting release of the ICPC on the scandal in its campaign to put an end to such illegal, destructive and disruptive activities.\n\n\u201cThe board has painstakingly taken some measures to forestall future recurrence. It has, for instance, initiated action to seek approval from the Honourable Minister of Education, Malam Adamu Adamu, to establish what it refers to as the \u201cA Level Task Team/ A Level Qualification and Verification Databank\u201d (ALQVD) as a repository for verified A/L qualifications in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am privileged to know that the Federal Ministry of Education is considering further necessary action on the matter. As soon as the appropriate approvals are secured, we would reach out to you for assistance.\u201d\n\nHe said JAMB was already addressing some unethical and unacceptable practices by Computer-Based Testing (CBT) Centres.\n\nHe said: \u201cFourthly, the review of our registration process has shown some unethical and unacceptable practices by Computer-Based Testing (CBT) Centres. These centres are allowed to collect only Seven Hundred Naira (#700.00) as registration charges but they use the opportunity to engage in conduct unbecoming, including extortion, during the exercise.\n\n\u201cIn order to put a stop to such extortion, we propose to make UTME registration henceforth cashless. In other words, JAMB will now be collecting the approved N700.00 registration fee on behalf of the CBT Centres along with its UTME registration fees and then remit what is due to each registration centre to its bank account on a weekly basis or any timeframe acceptable to the centre owners.\n\n\u201cThis intervention will block all loopholes through which hapless candidates are extorted by unscrupulous service providers.\u201d",
          "summary": "The Registrar, Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Prof. Is-haq Oloyede on Tuesday said the agency has uncovered 706,189 illegal admissions by universities, Colleges of Education, polytechnics and other allies.\nOloyede made the disclosures at the Consultative Sensitization Meeting with Select Stakeholders in Abuja said the illegal admissions have damaged the image of the country.\nWhile about 114 universities accounted for 67.795 of the illegal admissions, 137 polytechnics were responsible for 489,918, 80 Colleges of Education for 142, 818 and 37 other institutions involved in 5,678 cases.\n\u201cThe Board was then directed to launch massive campaigns to educate the public against accepting such illegal admissions henceforth.\n\u201cIt is astonishing that so far, 706,189 candidates have been disclosed as illegally admitted between 2017 and 2020.\u201dOloyede said there will no longer be opportunities for illegal admissions by universities and other higher institutions.",

          "text": "From Adetutu Folasade-Koyi, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has rejected the report of the Doris Okuwobi panel of inquiry set up to investigate the attack on unarmed EndSARS protesters at Lekki toll gate on October 20, 2020.\n\nLast year, Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, set up a Judicial Panel of Inquiry on Restitution for Victims of SARS Related Abuses and Other Matters, to investigate alleged massacre of Nigerians at the toll gate. On Monday, November 15, 2021, the committee submitted two reports, including one on shootings by security agencies at the tollgate, to the governor and almost immediately, its contents as well as recommendations leaked online.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nThe governor set up a four-man committee to examine the reports which would culminate in a White Paper to be considered by the Lagos State executive council.\n\nBut, the Federal Government is insisting that security agencies did not massacre Nigerians at the tollgate last October, reiterating that Lekki massacre is \u2018fake news\u2019.\n\nMinister of Information, National Orientation and Culture, Lai Mohammed, disclosed at a press conference in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nReminded that the United States of America\u2019s Secretary of State, Anthony Bliken, who met with President Muhammadu Buhari, in Nigeria, last week, had urged government to ensure accountability and address the grievances of the victims and their families, against the backdrop of the panel\u2019s report, Mohammed replied: \u201cIf it was set up by a panel in the US, would it pass the test?\u201d\n\nAsked why he was also speaking on a report which the state government had yet to issue a White Paper on, even after the president told Bliken that the Federal Government would wait \u2018for the steps taken by states\u2019 and would not impose its ideas on them, he replied: \u201cI\u2019m only commenting on a document which is circulating in public domain, of which many media houses have written editorials; a document of which many have commented freely and it\u2019s only fair government puts across its own side. This briefing has nothing to do and would not prejudice what Lagos State would bring out in its White Paper\u2026\u201d\n\nOn demands for his resignation, the minister said: \u201cThere have been clamour for my resignation since the day I resumed this office, so, I take it in my stride.\u201d\n\nOn the report, he said: \u201cThe submission happened while I was out of the country on national assignment. Unlike many commentators and analysts, we took our time to read and digest the report, and we are now well placed to respond.\n\n\u201cWithout mincing words, let me say never in the history of any judicial panel in this country has its report been riddled with so many errors, inconsistencies, discrepancies, speculations, innuendoes, omissions and conclusions that are not supported by evidence. What is circulating in public space is simply a rehash of the unverified fake news that has been playing on social media since the incident of October 20m, 2020. It is simply incredible that a judicial panel set up to investigate an incident has submitted a report laden with allegations, the same allegations it was set up to investigate in the first instance. Instead of sitting for one year, the panel could have just compiled social media \u2018tales by the moonlight\u2019 on the incident and submitted, saving taxpayers\u2019 funds and everyone\u2019s time. That report is nothing but the triumph of fake news and the intimidation of a silent majority by a vociferous lynch mob\u2026\n\n\u201cLet us, however, point out some key highlights of such discrepancies, errors, omissions, etc. The report threw away the testimony of ballistic experts who testified before it. The experts said, inter alia, in their testimony: \u2018The team finds that from the medical data examined, including the timeline of arrival at medical facility and the nature of the injuries sustained by the victims, who were taken to the five medical facilities, that no military grade live ammunition (high-velocity) was fired at the protesters at Lekki toll gate on October 20, 2020, within the timeframe of reference (18.30- 20.34hrs).\n\n\u201cThat the GSW (Gun Shot Wounds) injuries (four in number between 19:05 and 19:45 hrs), which were examined by the team, can be safely identified as being discharged by either low velocity calibre and/or artisanal/12-gauge firearms (artisanal firearms are locally-fabricated weapons). What is, however, certain is that had the military personnel deliberately fired military grade live ammunition directly at the protesters; there would have been significantly more fatalities and catastrophic injuries recorded. This was clearly not the case.\n\n\u201cThe same panel that said it deemed as credible the evidence of the Forensic Pathologist, John Obafunwa, that only three of the bodies on which postmortem were conducted were from Lekki and only one had gunshot injury went on to contradict itself by saying nine persons died of gunshot wounds at Lekki.\n\n\u201cThe man whose evidence (that he counted 11 bodies in a military van where he was left for dead before he escaped) was found to be crucial by the panel never testified in person. Rather, the video of his \u2018testimony\u2019 was played by someone else. It did not occur to the panel to query the veracity of the testimony of a man who said he was shot and presumed dead but still had time to count dead bodies inside a supposedly dark van at night.\u201d\n\nOn CNN and other foreign media reports on the report, Mohammed said: \u201cThe CNN has been celebrating the leaked report of the panel. In its rush to claim vindication, CNN apparently didn\u2019t even read the report before rolling out the drums in celebration. By that action, CNN has celebrated prematurely and has now committed a double faux pas: First, by relying on unverified social media stories and videos to carry out an investigation of the October 20, 2020 incident at Lekki, where it did not have a correspondent on ground. CNN goofed in its report on the findings of the panel, which fell below the main standards of journalism.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo, yesterday, urged the newly launched Yoruba World Centre (YWC) to champion the return of artefacts that were plundered, looted or illegally taken away from Yorubaland to any part of the world.\n\nHe gave the charge at the launch of International Centre for Yoruba Arts and Culture, initiated by the International Centre for Yoruba Arts and Culture (INCEYAC) in collaboration with the Institute of African Studies, and Yoruba Language Centre, University of Ibadan, held on the campus of the institution.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nOsinbajo said: \u201cYou must join in the global movement to champion the return of artefacts that were plundered, looted or illegally taken away from these shores. Indeed, the centre could serve as a home for such returned items where the immediate provenance or circumstances in which the items were taken is not clear or not known.\u201d\n\nThe vice president said the centre has \u201cinitiated a place that will give context and depth to our understanding of our past, our place and role in the present and hopefully our preparation for the future. A place that will help tell a fuller, deeper and richer story of a proud, creative and colourful people but also of the rich tapestry of cultures, races, ethnicities and faiths of which they are a part.\n\n\u201cAt a more reflective level, we will through this repository and the traditions embedded in the art works and cultural artefacts imbibe the triumphs, challenges, inventions and spiritual heritage of the Yoruba people. We know that well before contact with the Western world, the Yorubas had a fine artistic tradition that was rendered through sculpture and architecture, using wood, bronze, stone, terracotta and brass.\n\n\u201cBut beyond and yet inherent in the splendour and beauty of artworks and the genius of artists, are the histories and stories of our people. The forced relocation of Yoruba people by slave dealers to the Americas and the Caribbean and other unspeakable degradations and atrocities of slavery, and the ways in which Yoruba culture adapted and survived in the dehumanising humiliation, and suffering in those distant and hostile environments. And how here at home, Yoruba culture also had to adapt to the onslaught of colonialism, in Nigeria by the British and in Benin and Togo by the French.\u201d\n\nGovernors Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, and Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo States, represented by their deputies, Rauf Olaniyan, Noimot Salako-Oyedele, and Lucky Ayedatiwa, respectively, advocated preservation of Yoruba culture, urging the centre not to engage in distortion of fact of history, should not dabble into politics. The centre, according to them, must be used to promote the unity of Yoruba race, national unity and nation building.\n\nAlaafin of Oyo, Oba Adeyemi, who chaired the programme, said the YWC should be a focal point of return and restitution of stolen archives and artefacts by the colonialists, alleging that some archives, which recorded the rich history of the Yoruba were taken away by the colonialists, thereby depriving the younger generation of Yoruba race opportunity to read about their rich history. The archives, he said, now exists in some developed countries.\n\nAare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Gani Adams, in an interview with newsmen, said: \u201cWe need to document our history, brand our culture and we need to bring pride to our heritage because if you don\u2019t write your history, the enemy will write it in a wrong way and it will affect your pride.\n\nYoruba is one of the most important races in the world. This is a race that has been in existence for more than 15, 000 years. We have a lot of things to document so that the global village can know our importance and where we are coming from.\n\nThe convener of the project, Alao Adedayo, who is the publisher of Alaroye Newspaper, said the idea was first conceived in 2014 with the desire to create a place where researchers could conduct and complete their works on the history, arts and culture of the Yoruba people.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

While briefing newsmen, he frowned at politicians lobbying the president not to sign the Bill into law.\n\nUnlike Lawan who kept mum on the issue of indirect primaries yanked off from the Bill, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, last week, during a visit to the President, made a strong case. He explained why the inclusion of direct primaries was good for the country\u2019s democracy.\n\nAnother source said APC governors and leaders were sharply divided on the issue. It said southern leaders, especially those from the South West, believed it was a ploy by their northern counterparts to gain undue advantage in 2023.\n\nIt said the Speaker of the House of Representatives, who is the arrowhead behind the removal of indirect primaries from the 2010 Electoral Amendment Act is also under fire from his South West leaders for taking a decision without due consultations.\n\nAlready, PDP governors and National Assembly members elected on the platform of the party, have voiced out their opposition to the removal of indirect primaries, warning of dire consequences if the decision is not reversed. Unlike the divided APC leadership on the issue, the PDP is united in its call to have the decision rescinded or the entire amendment discarded by President Buhari.\n\nIt was gathered by Daily Sun that governors from the APC and the PDP may meet soon to take a common position on the issue and send a delegation to the President to veto the Bill.\n\nThe source said Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, who is expected to advice the president on the next line of action is siding with governors on the issue.\n\nBut Malami, speaking through his special assistant on media and public relations, Umar Gwandu, said he had no plans to advice the president against assenting to the Bill.\n\n\u201cIt is not true that the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, advised Mr. President for or against the amended Electoral Act.\n\n\u201cThe Honourable Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice has not offered any legal opinion to Mr. President on the matter.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the development, Senate spokesman, Ajibola Bashir, told Daily Sun that it was no longer within their powers to take any decision since the Bill has been transmitted to the president for assent. He said if he returned it, the Senate, vis-a-vis, the National Assembly, would decide on the way forward regarding the contentious issues.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

The unity of Nigeria is facing unprecedented challenges. Life in Nigeria is increasingly becoming brutish and short as insecurity ravages the land. Poverty is the forte of the ordinary Nigerian.\n\n\u201cThe health and education of our people has not improved. Our people are in want. The economy is in dire straits with the exchange rate now about N540 to a dollar from the N150 to a dollar when PDP left office. Prices of food stuff and essential commodities are unsustainable. Clearly beyond the reach of the average Nigerian.\n\n\u201cBetween 35 to 40 per cent of Nigerians are unemployed. And women and Youths bear the main brunt. Bandits, kidnappers, terrorists are having a field day. Almost unchallenged. Our children are not safe even in their schools. Corruption still stalk the land. Nepotism, ethnic and religious bigotry reign supreme in today\u2019s APC\u2019s Nigeria. Our infrastructure is still comatose.\u201d\n\nThe governor argued that restructuring the polity would unleash the energies of the people towards addressing national challenges.\n\n\u201cNigeria must embrace restructuring to survive. It must restructure its polity, economy, security and ways of doing things. It must embrace relative autonomy and decentralisation of power. This will unleash the energies of our people, especially, the young. It is time to allow Nigeria blossom. It is doable with all hands on deck.\u201d\n\nThe PDP national chairman-elect, Senator Iyorchia Ayu, in his remarks at the event, said the retreat with the theme\u201d It is time to Rescue and Rebuild Nigeria\u201d, was necessary to prepare new leaders of the party for the challenges ahead, prior to their assumption of office, noting that for the party to reclaim power, it must demonstrate to Nigerians that it could run a better government.\n\nHe said that Nigerians would not vote for the party simply because it had done it before, but must demonstrate that it could do it better than the ruling All Progressives Party, (APC).\n\nHe said that no other party in Nigeria was better equipped and placed to rescue and rebuild the country than the PDP, adding that the party did it before.\n\nHe recalled how PDP took over power from military rule in Nigeria and within short years under former President Olusegun Obasanjo administration reversed the collapsed economic.\n\nAyu said that the administration also stabilised the exchange and interest rates, made strides in the provision of infrastructure, secured relief from foreign creditors and restored faith in Nigeria both by its citizens and foreign investors.\n\n\u201cMany of our citizens in the diaspora returned and set up businesses here or contributed in other ways.\n\n\u201cForeign investors trooped in. Abuja and other cities transformed from sites of abandoned projects to thriving construction sites and livable cities.\n\n\u201cDo we remember what our telephone system was like before the PDP government gave us GSM?\u201d\n\nHe said that while PDP could do that again, it had to do the first things first.\n\n\u201cNigerians are not going to vote for us just because we had done well before. People do not vote for the past but for the present and the future.\n\n\u201cWe have to demonstrate that we can do better than the current APC government. But we must start with putting our own house in order.\n\n\u201cWe are a big tent, indeed a big umbrella. Yes, within the party we have different tendencies, worldviews and experiences. But our overriding interest should be Nigeria. To bring it back from the brink. To make it better. To present Nigeria to the world again as a country of serious, competent and committed people. When we rebuild it we will all benefit,\u201d Ayu said.\n\nHe said that the party had to rebuild Nigeria to provide education for all its citizens, secures its borders and protects its law-abiding citizens wherever they may live, whatever their occupation and whatever their language, religion or ethnicity.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "title": "W\u2019Bank: FG, States Won\u2019t Be Able to Pay Salaries in 2022 If Fuel Subsidy is Retained",
          "text": "\u00b7 Kyari: NNPC may start invoicing the federation to maintain subsidy\n\n\u00b7 Finance Minister reveals plan to introduce transport grant for vulnerable Nigerians\n\nEl-Rufai: Despite oil prices rising globally, there is no windfall\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos and Ndubuisi Francis in Abuja\n\nThe World Bank yesterday sounded the alarm bells to Nigeria, saying further delay in removing the fuel subsidy which had been described as a major drain and waste on the economy could see the federal and state governments unable to pay salaries from 2022.\n\nThe Lead Economist, Nigeria Country office of the World Bank, Marco Antonio Hernandez, painted a gloomy picture of Nigeria if the country decides to continue with the controversial fuel subsidy, while unveiling the Nigeria Development Update (NDU), a bi-annual report of the multilateral institution, at an even that held in Abuja as well as virtual.\n\nAlso, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, during a panel session at the event, lamented the huge burden the continuous retention of the subsidy on petrol had been to the corporation, warning that going forward, \u201cthe NNPC may have to start invoicing the federation to be able to maintain subsidy.\u201d\n\nThis is just as the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, reiterated that the government was working on introducing measures that would cushion the impact of fuel subsidy removal on vulnerable Nigerians.\n\nSpeaking further, Hernandez, in the report, urged Nigeria to remove subsidy on petroleum motor spirit (PMS) in February 2022, as prescribed by the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), warning that further delay could worsen the precarious revenue situation confronting the country.\n\nThe report also warned that the present fiscal condition of the sub-national governments would take a turn for the worse in 2022 with 35 of the 36 states unable to meet their financial obligations.\n\nHernandez stated that a situation where N250 billion goes into fuel subsidy monthly was unsustainable as the paucity of revenue confronts the country, especially the sub-national governments.\n\nHernandez who provided insights into the NDU report, titled \u201cTime for Business Unusual,\u201d stated that should the current revenue challenge continue till 2022, only Lagos State would be able to meet its financial obligations.\n\nThe report pointed to mounting fiscal pressures due to lower-than-expected revenues in 2021 and the rising cost of PMS subsidy.\n\nIt stated: \u201cBecause most states rely heavily on inter-governmental transfers, diminished revenue inflows to the Federation Account are jeopardising fiscal sustainability at the state level.\n\n\u201cFor example, in the oil-producing State of Bayelsa federal transfers account for 91 per cent of revenues, and declining transfers caused a 22-percent drop in Bayelsa\u2019s revenues per capita during the year.\n\n\u201cEven in the state of Lagos, which relies the least on Federal transfers, transfers accounted for 29 per cent of revenues in 2020. Most State expenditures cover salaries and administrative expenses, and given their rigid (i.e., nondiscretionary) nature, State-level expenditures are difficult to cut.\n\n\u201cConsequently, lower revenues are likely to intensify pressure on states\u2019 debt stocks and undermine their fiscal sustainability.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, in contrast to past periods of high oil prices, the Nigerian government has this time not been able to fully benefit from the oil boom because oil production has fallen below Nigeria\u2019s estimated capacity and the Organisation of Petroleum Countries (OPEC) quota due in part to rising insecurity and the higher cost of the PMS subsidy.\n\nIt stated: \u201cIn 2022 the federal government plans to spend about 3,000 naira (US$7) per person for health, while the cost of the PMS subsidy for next year could reach 13,000 naira (US$32) per person. Not only is the PMS subsidy costly, but it mainly benefits richer households.\n\n\u201cNigeria has the opportunity to establish a \u201ccompact\u201d with citizens that eliminates the subsidy and uses the savings to provide targeted cash transfers to lower-income-households, invest in job-creating programs, and improve its fiscal position.\u201d\n\nIt stated that the insufficient supply of foreign exchange (FX) issues related to the predictability of exchange rate management, the unsustainable subsidy on premium motor spirit (PMS), burdensome trade restrictions, and the sizeable fiscal deficit financing by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) are undermining the business environment, compounding underlying constraints on domestic revenue mobilisation, foreign investment, human capital development, and the delivery of public services.\n\nThe report noted that despite a strong initial recovery and resurgent global oil prices, Nigeria\u2019s pre-crisis challenges were threatening its post-crisis recovery, highlighting the need to depart from business-as-usual policies.\n\n\u201cEven though Nigeria\u2019s economy exited a pandemic-induced recession, several challenges persist including double-digit inflation, declining incomes, and rising insecurity.\n\n\u201cWhile the government took bold policy measures to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, the reform momentum has slowed which hinders Nigeria\u2019s ability to reach its growth potential,\u201d World Bank Country Director for Nigeria, Shubham Chaudhuri said.\n\nThe report prescribed policy options for Nigeria, including addressing fiscal pressures.\n\n\u201cUrgent priorities for the next three to six months include reducing inflation, improving exchange-rate management, mobilising additional oil and nonoil revenues, eliminating the PMS subsidy and redirecting expenditures towards targeted cash transfers and other priority investments, fostering competitive markets, and improving infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWhile Nigeria\u2019s macroeconomic projections have been updated since the previous edition of the NDU, the government\u2019s fundamental policy challenges remain unchanged,\u201d it added.\n\nIn his contribution, Kyari, pointed out that while all over the world, subsidies are introduced to bring cost control and less pains to citizens, in Nigeria, fuel subsidy has become a major fiscal burden that must be eliminated.\n\nThe NNPC boss explained: \u201cToday, we are evacuating about 60 million litres of gasoline from all the depots in the country. It is not national consumption and it is very understandable because of issues such as cross-border smuggling.\n\n\u201cAs long as you have arbitrage, traders don\u2019t see it as a crime, they just take advantage of that and exploit it. What we are dealing with is about N243 billion of fuel subsidy monthly. So, there is no magic around that.\n\n\u201cThis is the reality that we are facing. Going forward in 2022, we simply cannot afford this, we just don\u2019t have the resources. As a matter of fact, the NNPC may have to start invoicing the federation to be able to maintain subsidy.\n\n\u201cWhen you take out N243 billion from your total income every month, you are not able to fund your operations and so you can\u2019t meet your other fiscal obligations. Clearly, there is a challenge in the ability to pay. So, there is a reform going on, particular in the energy sector and no one can stop.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai wondered why the country would continue to allocate more monies to fuel subsidy compared with the allocations to education, roads and the health sectors.\n\n\u201cIs subsidising petrol more important than our health as even in a year we spent significant amount on health due to the pandemic, the budget for subsidy was still higher? Does it make sense?\n\n\u201cIs subsidising petrol about thrice as educating our children and preparing them for the future more important? The capital budget for roads is five times less than our budget for subsidy. We have to ask ourselves as Nigerians whether this makes sense at all,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to El-Rufai, \u201cthis is the first time in Nigeria that oil prices are rising globally, yet, there is no windfall. In fact, we are getting less. Why? Because according to Kyari, subsidy is taking N250 billion per month.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that this month, what the NNPC paid to the federation account, as part of its contribution to the amount to be shared by the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC), was only N14 billion as against the N120 billion stipulated in the budget, and, \u201cwith the threat that next month they would ask the federation account to give them a cheque to cover subsidy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, we have to ask ourselves if this subsidy still makes sense. Who is benefiting from it other than the smugglers and neighbouring African countries and some rich people? We have to stop this thing that will bring Nigeria to its knees,\u201d the state governor added.\n\nEarlier, in her opening remarks, Ahmed expressed optimism that recent developments in the oil sector, such as the Petroleum PIA 2021, the full reactivation of the four public refineries in the country, and the completion and coming on stream of the three private refineries under construction in 2022, would significantly boost contribution from the sector to economic growth.\n\nAccording to her, subsidies\u2019 regime in the sector remained unsustainable and economically disingenuous.\n\nShe disclosed that ahead of the target date of mid-2022 for the complete elimination of fuel subsidies, the government was working with its partners on measures to cushion potential negative impact of the removal of the subsidies on the most vulnerable at the bottom, which she estimated to be 40 per cent of the population.\n\n\u201cOne of such measures would be to institute a monthly transport subsidy in the form of cash transfer of N5,000 to between 30 \u2013 40 million deserving Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs a government, we remain committed to our broad objectives of stimulating broad-based growth through diversification and the active participation of the private sector to ensure that our growth is inclusive.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to prioritise investment in critical infrastructure needed to unlock production and supply constraints, to create adequate productive employment and preserve jobs, and to ensure macroeconomic stability and promote poverty reduction and equity.\n\n\u201cI agree with the Report that with the expansion of social protection policies during the pandemic, the government has an opportunity to phase out subsidies such as the PMS subsidy while utilising cash transfers to safeguard the welfare of poor and middle-class households.\n\n\u201cTowards this end, we intend to accelerate our structural reforms, particularly in the power sector, in governance, in business environment to unlock the huge potentials of the economy, scale up social safety net and deepen financial inclusion to reduce poverty and inequality gaps. We will carefully calibrate the sequencing of these reforms to manage their attendant political fallouts,\u201d she added.\n\nAhmed pointed out that digital revolution was looming in Nigeria and waiting to happen spontaneously.\n\n\u201cI agree that Nigeria\u2019s digital economy can transform economic activities by unleashing new productivity gains, offering new services, and improving the government\u2019s efficiency. We see enormous opportunity for our theming youth population in this sector which has largely remained unharnessed with isolated progress and possibilities.\n\n\u201cWe need greater investments in newer and competitive technologies to be made for the provision of critical infrastructure in the telecoms sector to unleash potentials.\n\n\u201cTo protect such investments, government has been mobilising national security outfits, and even local \u2018vigilantes\u2019 to provide added layers of security for the infrastructure, while at same time engaging local communities towards addressing the likely root causes of cases of infrastructure vandalisation,\u201d she added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Maintains stance on Lekki incident\n\n\u2022Panel concocted \u2018massacre in context,\u2019 Lai Mohammed insists\n\nEmmanuel Addeh and\n\nOlawale Ajimotokun in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday officially reacted to the report of the Lagos Judicial Panel of Inquiry (JPI) set up by the Lagos state government to probe the October 20, 2020 #EndSARs protest, insisting that there was nothing in the document to compel it to change its stand on the matter.\n\nThe government which had long held that there was no evidence of the killing of protesters, who among others, were demanding an end to police brutality, dissolution of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and harassment of young people, stated that the report was based on social media \u201ctales by moonlight\u201d.\n\nSpeaking through the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed, in Abuja, the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration maintained that the report was riddled with errors, inconsistencies, discrepancies, speculations, innuendoes, omissions and conclusions that were not supported by evidence.\n\nThe report which was leaked last week, had revealed that at least 11 persons were killed during the peaceful demonstration at the Lekki Tollgate.\n\nThe report had described as, \u201catrocious, the maiming and killing of unarmed, helpless and unresisting protesters, while sitting on the floor and waving their Nigerian flags and singing the National Anthem , stressing that the act could be equated to a \u201cmassacre in context.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, aside the 11 confirmed dead, four others were presumed dead, while in all, 48 were casualties of the Lekki incident which shook the entire country last year.\n\nIn the 309-page report, the panel had also stated that of the 48 casualties, 24 sustained gunshot injuries, while 15 others were assaulted by soldiers and police, and specifically indicted the army and the police for shooting directly at fleeing protesters who had run into the shanties and the Lagoon.\n\nBut Mohammed, in his assessment, argued that what had been circulating in the public space remained simply a rehash of the unverified fake news that had been playing on social media since the incident last year.\n\nHe posited that it was simply incredible that a judicial panel set up to investigate an incident had submitted a report laden with allegations, the same allegations it was set up to investigate in the first instance.\n\nThe minister opined that instead of sitting for all of one year, the panel could have just compiled social media stories on the incident and submitted, saving taxpayers\u2019 funds and everyone\u2019s time.\n\n\u201cThat report is nothing but the triumph of fake news and the intimidation of a silent majority by a vociferous lynch mob,\u201d he maintained.\n\nIn what he said was a \u201ccritical analysis\u201d of the document, Mohammed alleged that the panelists threw away the testimony of ballistic experts who testified before it.\n\nQuoting the experts, he said the team had told the panel that from the medical data examined and the nature of the injuries sustained by the \u201cvictims\u201d, no military grade live ammunition (high-velocity) was fired at the protesters at Lekki Tollgate on 20th October 2020, within the timeframe of reference, which was 18.30- 20.34 hours.\n\nFurthermore, the minister maintained that the panel did not consider the experts\u2019 position that gunshot wounds sustained, four in number, between 19:05 and 19:45 hours, which were examined by the team, were identified as being discharged by either low velocity calibre and/or artisanal/12-gauge firearms.\n\nHe pointed out that the team of experts had told the panelists that had military personnel deliberately fired military grade live ammunition directly at the protesters; there would have been significantly more fatalities and catastrophic injuries recorded.\n\nThe minister added that the same panel that said it deemed as credible the evidence of the Forensic Pathologist, Prof. John Obafunwa, that only three of the bodies on which post mortem were conducted were from Lekki and only one had gunshot injury went on to contradict itself by saying \u201cnine persons\u201d died of gunshot wounds at Lekki.\n\nHe contended that the man whose evidence that he counted 11 bodies in a military van where he was left thinking he was dead, before he escaped, was said to be crucial by the panel, never testified in person.\n\n\u201cRather, the video of his \u2018testimony\u2019 was played by someone else. It did not occur to the panel to query the veracity of the testimony of a man who said he was shot and presumed dead but still had time to count dead bodies inside a supposedly dark van at night.\n\n\u201cThe panel said trucks with brushes underneath were brought to the Lekki Tollgate in the morning of October 21, 2020, to clean up bloodstains and other evidence, but still found bullet casings at the same site when it visited on October 30, 2020.\n\n\u201cIt said soldiers picked up bullet casings from Lekki Tollgate on the night of October 20, 2020, yet claimed that policemen came to the same spot to pick the same bullet casings on October 21, 2020!\n\n\u201cThe panel was silent on the family members of those reportedly killed, merely insinuating they were afraid to testify. Even goats have owners who will look for them if they do not return home, not to talk of human beings.\n\n\u201cWhere are the family members of those who were reportedly killed at Lekki Tollgate? If the panel is recommending compensation for the families, what are their identities and addresses? Who will receive the compensations when no family members have shown up to date?\n\n\u201cHow did a man who reported seeing the lifeless body of his brother himself ended up being on the list of the panel\u2019s deceased persons? How can a judicial panel convince anyone that the names of some casualties of the Lekki Tollgate incident listed as numbers 3 (Jide), 42 (Tola) and 43 (Wisdom) are not fictitious names.\n\n\u201cWhy did the judicial panel feel compelled to concoct a \u2018massacre in context\u2019 as a euphemism for massacre? A massacre is a massacre. What is massacre in context?\u201d he queried.\n\nAccording to him, the report never mentioned cases of police personnel who were brutally murdered or the massive destruction of police stations, vehicles, e.t c during the EndSARS protest, arguing that it is possible the panel didn\u2019t consider policemen and women as human beings.\n\nIn addition, the minister stated that the report never made any recommendation on the innocent people whose businesses were attacked and destroyed during the protest in Lagos, \u201cbecause it was too busy looking for evidence to support its conclusion of \u2018massacre in context\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is clear, from the ongoing, that the report of the panel in circulation cannot be relied upon because its authenticity is in doubt. Besides, the Lagos State Government, being the convening authority, has yet to release any official report to the public. Neither has the panel done so.\n\n\u201cThe cowardly leakage of an unsigned report to the public is not enough. Assuming the report in circulation bears any iota of genuineness, it is basic knowledge that the report of such a panel is of no force until the convening authority issues a White Paper and gazette on it.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore too premature for any person or entity to seek to castigate the federal government and its agencies or officials based on such an unofficial and \u2018unvalidated\u2019 report,\u201d he posited.\n\nThe minister also took on the CNN for what he said was the celebration of the leaked report, insisting that in its rush to claim vindication, CNN apparently didn\u2019t read the report before rolling out the drums in celebration.\n\n\u201cBy that action, CNN has celebrated prematurely and has now committed a double faux pas: First, by relying on unverified social media stories and videos to carry out an investigation of the October. 20th 2020 incident at Lekki, where it did not have a correspondent on ground.\n\n\u201cCNN goofed in its report on the findings of the panel, which fell below the main standards of journalism. Secondly, CNN rushed to the air to celebrate an unsigned and unverified report that is riddled with inconsistencies, errors, discrepancies, innuendoes. That\u2019s double faux pas by a news organisation that is eager and willing to compromise standards just to claim vindication,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nThe minister added: \u201cThere is absolutely nothing in the report that is circulating to make us change our stand that there was no massacre at Lekki on October 20, 2020. For us to change our stand, a well-investigated report of the incident that meets all required standards and will withstand every scrutiny must be produced and presented to the public.\n\n\u201cThe report in circulation does not meet those requirements. We also appeal to the families of those allegedly killed in Lekki to speak out. It\u2019s untenable to say that some families did not come out because they are afraid. Any parent who is afraid to testify about the death of his or her child is not worth to be called a parent.\n\n\u201cWe reject the notion that our soldiers and policemen massacred innocent Nigerians at Lekki on October 20, 2020. That conclusion is not supported by the weight of available evidence. Indictment for murder is a very serious issue that cannot be done on the basis of allegations and corroborations, as the panel did.\n\n\u201cSuch allegations must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The report in circulation is calculated to embarrass the federal government and its agencies without fool-proof evidence.\u201d\n\nMohammed maintained that the federal government had never condoned the abuse of the rights of Nigerians by security agencies under any guise, hence it disbanded SARS and encouraged states to set up the panels to investigate reports of human rights abuses allegedly committed by the disbanded personnel.\n\n\u201cThe 37 policemen and six soldiers who died across the country during the EndSARS protest are also Nigerians and should not be forgotten.\n\n\u201cThose who have engaged in premature celebration of the report in circulation should now go back and read it thoroughly and tell Nigerians whether it can pass any serious scrutiny.\n\n\u201cWe are saddened that anyone died at all during the Endsars protest as the life of every Nigerian and indeed every human is sacrosanct. As we have disclosed many times, 57 civilians, 37 policemen and six soldiers were killed across the country during the protest, and we commiserate with their families,\u201d the minister stressed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says it\u2019s time to pay back as economy recovers\n\n\u2022Urges customers to challenge discretionary bank charges\n\n\u2022Leaves MPR unchanged at 11.5%\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday foreclosed further extension of the regulatory forbearance on its intervention facilities instituted by the apex bank to cushion the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on companies and businesses.\n\nHe said the global economy has since opened up with lockdowns lifted while companies and businesses have witnessed improved revenues, hence the need for borrowers to start repaying their loans.\n\nEmefiele, while addressing journalists after the two-day meeting of the CBN\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in Abuja, said he does not envisage a likelihood of loan default resulting from the forbearance programme.\n\nThis is just as the MPC yesterday resolved to leave all monetary policy parameters unchanged, retaining the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) otherwise known as the interest rate at 11.5 per cent with the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR.\n\nThe MPR is the rate at which the CBN lends to commercial banks and often determines the cost of borrowing in the economy.\n\nThe MPC also voted to maintain the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) at 27.5 per cent as well as the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nEmefiele said the existing policy stance had so far supported growth and recovery and expressed satisfaction at the moderation in inflation rate which had declined for six consecutive months.\n\nIn an effort to ameliorate the adverse effects of the pandemic on Nigerians and businesses, the apex bank and other financial institutions had reeled out forbearance packages for companies to help them weather the storm.\n\nPart of the programme was the restructuring of the loan repayment plans, moratorium as well as the CBN reducing interest rates on all its intervention programmes to five per cent from nine per cent till March 2022.\n\nThe CBN had extended the moratorium twice following threats posed by the Delta variant of the virus.\n\nHowever, as the forbearance regime draws to a close in March next year, the CBN governor, citing improvement in economic activities, urged businesses to resume loan repayment.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you recall from our standpoint, we granted a forbearance regime from just two areas.\n\n\u201cOne primarily had to do with the fact that we said all loans that companies and businesses that are impacted adversely by COVID-19, that they should be given about two years, we first started by saying one year, from 2020 to March 2021 and by February 2021, we extended it by one more year when the Delta strain of the pandemic continued. That made it two years that would expire by March 2022.\n\n\u201cAnother aspect had to do with the fact that we said for CBN interventions, that there is a need for us to reduce the interest rate from nine to five per cent. Indeed, another aspect of the intervention or forbearance is that because we knew that the adverse consequences of COVID-19 were resulting in a reduction in the revenue-generating capacity of businesses and companies, we also granted the banks an opportunity to allow their customers to ask for a restructure of their facilities. Maybe if it\u2019s a two-year facility, it would be extended to four years so as to reduce the burden of the cash flow on them.\u201d\n\nEmefiele added: \u201cAnd those were the periods when there was unprecedented lockdown of the global economy. All countries with no exception were on lockdown. Travels came to zero, people were not allowed to leave their homes and in Nigeria, this persisted for about three to four months.\n\n\u201cNow, from around September/October 2020, Nigeria began a process of easing the lockdown and notwithstanding the fact that we still saw that around February/March of 2021 that the Delta strain now reared its head. We still said that businesses should have this forbearance.\n\n\u201cAt this time, we believe that the global economy has opened up; the lockdowns have been lifted and of course, we know the economic damages and fatalities that were caused as a result of the that and I am so sure that not too many counties if at all will in the midst of this pandemic want to embark on a wholesome lockdown any longer.\n\n\u201cParticularly because most countries are all administering vaccines that they think should assist in reducing the impact of the strain of the virus.\n\n\u201cSo we believe that in Nigeria, businesses/companies are back to business, revenues have improved and if revenues have improved then companies or businesses that took loans. If we say the loans for intervention facilities moved from five to nine, if we see that the moratorium of two years expires in March 2022 and of course, the restructure that you have benefitted remains, then naturally we should expect that companies should be able to pay back their loans.\n\n\u201cSo as a result, we do not see any likelihood of an increase of NPLs. Indeed, we have worked so hard to bring the NPLs down from as high as nine, ten per cent about two years ago to the level that it is today which is 5.3 per cent and we are gratified that we are aggressively working NPLs down to the maximum threshold that has been set by the CBN. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need for anybody to worry at all.\u201d\n\nAlso commenting on the concerns over the arbitrary transaction charges by banks, the CBN governor urged bank customers to study the Guide to Bank Charges- and challenges any discretionary deductions which are not in tandem with the guide.\n\nHe said: \u201cTalking about bank charges, the CBN insists that consumers of bank services, in this case, customers must insist and indeed, if it\u2019s not on CBN website, I am going to ask that we place it on our website- the Guide to Bank Charges- go and read your guide to bank charges.\n\n\u201cYou should not allow any bank to just pass on any discretionary charges on your account that is not contained in the guide to bank charges. Hold it as your bible as you deal with the bank. If you find any that is not consistent, raise an alarm.\n\n\u201cWe have our consumer protection department and we have always advertised our hotlines and emails where you can always reach us and indeed, we have been cases in the past where people have raised an alarm and it has resulted in hundreds if not billions of naira reversal back to customers\u2019 accounts.\n\n\u201cSo, I can say that if you are being charged by any bank for transactions that did not happen or charges that are not inside or stated in the guide to bank charges, you have to ask the bank to reverse it because it is not meant to be there.\u201d\n\nHowever, Emefiele, who read the committee\u2019s communiqu\u00e9, explained that the MPC was gratified that its policy actions in the past had started to yield positive results given the remarkable improvement in GDP which stood at 4.03 per cent during Q3 of 2021 and the 6th consecutive month moderation in inflation to 15.99 per cent in October 2021.\n\nHe said given the level of its conviction about the efficacy of its actions on macroeconomic variables, MPC felt that whereas tightening would further help to rein in inflation aggressively, it nevertheless feels that tightening will increase the cost of funds and constrain output growth.\n\nHe said on the other hand, whereas loosening will lower policy rates, ease liquidity pressures, and stimulate additional credit creation which will boost output growth.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cMPC also thinks that loosening will further widen the negative real interest rate gap and compound the price distortions in the money markets which could fuel inflationary pressures. As for whether to hold its existing stance, MPC believes that the existing monetary policy stance has supported the growth recovery and should be allowed to continue for a little longer for consolidation to achieve the MPC mandate of price stability that is conducive for sustainable growth. The Committee also feels that a hold stance will enable it to carefully appraise the implications of the unfolding global development around policy tapering and normalisation by advanced economies.\u201d\n\nHe said the CBN\u2019s Targeted Credit Facility (TCF) was particularly highlighted by the Committee for its contribution to alleviating poverty at the grassroots adding that the MPC urged the bank to continue its support through the TCF to ensure that more people benefit from this programme.\n\nHe also said that with the announcement to commence monetary policy normalization by the US Fed and impending interest rate liftoff by central banks in some advanced economies, the MPC called on the federal government to intensify its drive towards a counter-cyclical fiscal policy in view of the imminent tightening of external financial conditions.\n\nCommittee members, therefore, noted with concern that the gradual normalisation of monetary policy by this group of economies would dampen the recovery of several emerging market and developing economies in the short to medium term due to the sharp reversal of capital flows.\n\nThe committee also evaluated the developments in China relating to the reoccurring pandemic, power outages and crisis in the property market, noting the likely impact these could have on Nigeria as a major trading partner.\n\nThe committee, therefore, called on the CBN to ensure that the necessary buffers are put in place to shield the economy from the downside risks associated with these developments.\n\nIn general, members expressed confidence in the ongoing policies of both the monetary and fiscal authorities which in their view was the hallmark of the current recovery and restoration of macroeconomic stability in the country as well as called on both authorities to look beyond the current position and plan towards attracting sustainable investment flows to Nigeria.\n\nWe are Excited Investors Are Scrambling for First Bank Shares, Says CBN Gov\n\nAlso, responding to a question about the ongoing development at FirstBank Nigeria Limited, Emefiele in commenting on tussle for majority stake in the bank, said the financial institution was too big to be owned by a single individual.\n\nHe also expressed satisfaction that, \u201cpeople are scrambling today for the shares of First Bank,\u201d which he said had been deserted six years ago, largely because of the burden of non-performing loans.\n\nThe CBN governor said, \u201cI think it\u2019s good for us to cast our minds back to the position of First Bank six years ago.\n\nSix years ago, when the CBN started its programme of looking at the bank to reposition it; let\u2019s not forget that FBN remains the oldest bank in Nigeria \u2013 1894. It is a strong, aggressive, domestically important bank in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf anything happens to First Bank, it means something has happened to the Nigerian banking system. And that is why we are taking our guidance on how to get the bank back afoot very seriously. Six years ago like I said, because of the aggressive build-up of non-performing loans in the books of First Bank, the share price of First Bank was about N2 per share.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Emefiele said: \u201cWe took it on \u2013 everybody was running away from the shares of First Bank. But because we have cleaned the bank\u2019s balance sheet now, the NPLs have dropped significantly, people are seeing that this money making machine, First Bank is back again on the race for profitability and they are now competing for the shares of First Bank.\n\n\u201cSo, why should I quarrel that people are competing for the shares of First Bank? The last time I looked at it, it was N11.55 kobo during the weekend and I was happy to see that they are competing for the shares.\n\n\u201cBut of course, they should all know that First Bank is so big that not one person can say he owns First Bank.\n\nThey are just one and they should see themselves as representing others in running the bank. I have read the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) clarifies the issue of shareholding percentages\u2026and indeed they are the people that are supposed to do so. Our examiners have also continued to look at it.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cAnd I think we should take SEC\u2019s position because SEC is the regulator of the capital market. We will take their position and they would give guidance on this subject but of course, as it affects the running and operation of the bank, we would take preeminence in ensuring that the right things are done.\n\n\u201cNaturally, returns are sent to the CBN about people and individual shareholders and of course, if our position is not in tandem with the position of SEC, we will talk to SEC about it and we will also advice the public but so far, I will say that we should take the position of SEC as a regulator of the capital market because regulating share price, ownership is the sole responsibility of SEC and we would not want to override SEC the regulator on these issues but we would continue to work with them and we have very good relationship with them.\n\n\u201cI would just say that I am very happy that people are scrambling today for the shares of First Bank.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe United States and other high oil-consuming nations, including China, Britain, India, Japan and South Korea, yesterday made good their threat to counter a slower-than-expected release of oil barrels by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in a coordinated bid to cool rising crude prices.\n\nOPEC+ producers have repeatedly ignored calls for more crude by the US President, Joe Biden, prompting the country to mobilise a handful of high oil consuming nations to release the commodity from their Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR).\n\nCrude oil prices recently touched seven-year highs and although still some way short of levels reached between 2011 and 2014, when they broke through $100 a barrel, many consumers are feeling the pain of a dramatic increase from a year ago.\n\nThe US announcement was for a release of 50 million barrels, the equivalent of about two and a half days of the country\u2019s demand; India would release five million barrels, while Britain would allow the voluntary release of 1.5 million barrels of oil from privately held reserves, according to a Reuters report.\n\nThe decision to collectively discharge stockpiled crude after OPEC countries rebuffed calls to significantly boost production marks a temporary diplomatic win for the US and a challenge to the grip that Saudi Arabia, Russia and other OPEC producers have on the market.\n\nDetails on the amount and timing of the release of oil from South Korea, Japan and China were not announced.\n\nSeoul said it would decide after discussions with the United States and other allies, while the Japanese media said Tokyo would detail its plans today.\n\nOfficials said it was the first time that the United States had coordinated such a move with some of the world\u2019s largest oil consumers. OPEC+ meets again on December 2, to discuss policy but has so far shown no indication it will change tactics.\n\nThe group has been struggling to meet existing targets under its agreement to gradually increase production by 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) each month \u2013 a pace Washington sees as too slow \u2013 and it remains worried that a resurgence of coronavirus cases could once again drive down demand.\n\nRecent high oil prices have been caused by a sharp rebound in global demand, which slumped early in the pandemic in 2021, and analysts have said that releasing reserves may not be enough to curb further rises.\n\nBut the market largely ignored the development, with benchmark Brent crude still traded above $80 a barrel on Tuesday, up from its levels before the announcement but still well below last month\u2019s three-year high of more than $86.\n\nThe release from the US SPR would be a combination of a loan and a sale to companies, US officials said. The 32 million barrels loan would take place over the next several months, while the administration would accelerate a sale of 18 million barrels already approved by Congress to raise funds for the budget.\n\n\u201cWe will continue talking to international partners on this issue. The president stands ready to take additional action if needed, and is prepared to use his full authorities working in coordination with the rest of the world,\u201d a senior US administration official told reporters.\n\nAn OPEC+ source and several market analysts said the release was not as big as the headline figure suggested. They said Britain and India were releasing modest amounts and the United States had already announced some releases, and so the additional quantity was less than expected.\n\nBut the effort by Washington to team up with major Asian economies to lower energy prices sends a warning to OPEC and other big producers that they need to address concerns about high crude prices, up more than 50 per cent so far this year.\n\nUnder a swap from U.S. reserves, oil companies taking crude must return it \u2013 or the refined product \u2013 plus interest. Swaps are typically offered when oil firms face supply disruptions, such as a pipeline outage or damage from a hurricane.\n\nOutright sales are less common. U.S. presidents have authorized emergency sales three times, most recently in 2011 during a war in OPEC member Libya. Sales also took place during the Gulf War in 1991 and after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\n\nNigeria, an OPEC member had said even if prices fall to between $50 to $60, it won\u2019t be much of an issue, with the country\u2019s oil benchmark for the 2021 budget being $40.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Africa's Richest Man, Dangote May Forfeit Refinery Project To Nigerian Debt Recovery Agency Over Rising Debts, Long Delay",
          "text": "Dangote Oil Refinery, which is reputed to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refinery, may soon run into a deep financial crisis as a result of a $7 billion debt burden \u2013 a situation which indicates a possible takeover of the project by the Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON).\n\nDangote Refinery is an oil refinery owned by the Dangote Group that is under construction in Lekki, Nigeria.\n\nDangote Group is a Nigerian multinational industrial conglomerate, founded by Aliko Dangote, Africa's richest man.\n\nThe Group's interests span a range of sectors in Nigeria and across Africa.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Money Management Series, Dangote Oil Refinery, a 650,000-barrel per day (BPD) integrated refinery project under construction in the Lekki Free Zone, Lagos, Nigeria, was expected to commence production in 2016 with $3.3 billion financing secured in 2013.\n\nWith the refinery now projected to commence operations in 2025, Dangote Group\u2019s indebtedness to financial institutions is estimated to hit $8.4 billion by 2025.\n\nPresently, this debt burden has risen to $7 billion with debt servicing of almost $700 million per annum.\n\nThe completion date of the refinery has been moved eight times.\n\nWhilst some might say this is not in the character for Dangote Industries and their numerous projects across different sectors, the problem is deeply rooted.\n\nA contractor at the delayed refinery project, speaking under the condition of anonymity, said that poor planning, underpayment of contractors, and a lack of proper project management with over 40 contractors on site have led to most of the delays. He also added that of the 40, none is willing to commission as there is no clear delegation of duty and over-decentralisation leading to absolute chaos.\n\nWith these incessant delays, some financing banks are already calling in their loans amid fears of liquidity crisis, while others are elated by the guarantee of huge interests to be recouped as soon as the refinery comes on stream.\n\nDangote has been able to restructure the facilities from various local and international banks twice so far, but most banks have totally refused to restructure for the third time with principal repayment also falling due as well as the annual interest payments.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has made available $3.8 billion as part of federal government\u2019s 20% equity in the project, providing $1 billion cash, while the remaining $2.8 billion will be in crude supply.\n\nHowever, analysts have pointed out that NNPC\u2019s 20% equity at $3.8 billion makes the Dangote refinery overvalued at $19 billion.\n\nWhen Aliko Dangote unveiled early plans for the refinery in September 2013 and announced that he had secured about $3.3 billion in financing for the project, the refinery was estimated to cost about $9 billion, of which $3 billion would be invested by the Dangote Group and the remainder via commercial loans, and begin production in 2016.\n\nHowever, after a change in location to Lekki, construction of the refinery did not begin until 2016 with excavation and infrastructure preparation, and the planned completion was pushed back to late 2018.\n\nIn July 2017, major structural construction began, and Dangote estimated that the refinery would be mechanically complete in late 2019 and commissioned in early 2020. Experts, however, posit that the construction would likely take at least twice as long as Dangote publicly stated, with refining capability not likely to be achieved until 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, last week the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, reiterated that Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the acquisition of 20 per cent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refinery.\n\nSylva, while briefing State House correspondents after the virtual FEC meeting presided by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo last Wednesday at the Presidential Villa, said the acquisition was in the sum of $2.76 billion.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Council also approved the acquisition of 20 percent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refineries in the sum of $2.76 billion,\u201d he said.\n\nThis development has been described by industry observers as strange because $2.76 billion falls short of 20 percent of the Dangote project valued by the sponsor at $16 billion. Using the $16 billion value, 20 percent should be $3.2 billion and analysts have expressed dissatisfaction at the disparity in the project\u2019s value and NNPC\u2019s funding.\n\nSpeaking with MMS Plus on the complexities with funding Dangote refinery, the Managing Director of Cowry Assets Management, Mr. Johnson Chukwu, argued that the banks wouldn\u2019t have any challenge from the financing because Dangote would have to pay the interests.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the banks being unable to meet their liquidity because of the monies tied down in the Dangote refinery. Ultimately, if the investment is economically viable, when it starts operation it should be able to meet up the arrears. I believe the banks that went into this project understood some of these constraints and didn\u2019t break their balance-sheets in the move to finance Dangote refinery. I don\u2019t envisage any bank having a liquidity challenge as a result of investing in Dangote refinery. If there is any challenge it would come from Dangote, but it should be resolved when the project takes off,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on the possibility that NNPC over-valued or under-valued the project in its 20% equity, Chukwu opined that NNPC may be looking at an enterprise valuation while the other value could be the net value.\n\n\u201cThe enterprise value could be higher than the amount Dangote has invested in the project. However, I wasn\u2019t involved in determining that, so anything I say will be purely speculative,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the massive support of the Nigerian government on the refinery project, things have got so bad for the billionaire that even income from his other businesses may not be enough to cover the interest rates, let alone the principal.\n\nThe $8.4 billion debt represents 75% of Dangote\u2019s net worth at $11.1 billion and Africa\u2019s richest man has to seek innovative ways to prop up his business now as the refinery project continues to be consistently delayed.",

          "title": "Africa's Richest Man, Dangote May Forfeit Refinery Project To Nigerian Debt Recovery Agency Over Rising Debts, Long Delay",
          "text": "Dangote Oil Refinery, which is reputed to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refinery, may soon run into a deep financial crisis as a result of a $7 billion debt burden \u2013 a situation which indicates a possible takeover of the project by the Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON).\n\nDangote Refinery is an oil refinery owned by the Dangote Group that is under construction in Lekki, Nigeria.\n\nDangote Group is a Nigerian multinational industrial conglomerate, founded by Aliko Dangote, Africa's richest man.\n\nThe Group's interests span a range of sectors in Nigeria and across Africa.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Money Management Series, Dangote Oil Refinery, a 650,000-barrel per day (BPD) integrated refinery project under construction in the Lekki Free Zone, Lagos, Nigeria, was expected to commence production in 2016 with $3.3 billion financing secured in 2013.\n\nWith the refinery now projected to commence operations in 2025, Dangote Group\u2019s indebtedness to financial institutions is estimated to hit $8.4 billion by 2025.\n\nPresently, this debt burden has risen to $7 billion with debt servicing of almost $700 million per annum.\n\nThe completion date of the refinery has been moved eight times.\n\nWhilst some might say this is not in the character for Dangote Industries and their numerous projects across different sectors, the problem is deeply rooted.\n\nA contractor at the delayed refinery project, speaking under the condition of anonymity, said that poor planning, underpayment of contractors, and a lack of proper project management with over 40 contractors on site have led to most of the delays. He also added that of the 40, none is willing to commission as there is no clear delegation of duty and over-decentralisation leading to absolute chaos.\n\nWith these incessant delays, some financing banks are already calling in their loans amid fears of liquidity crisis, while others are elated by the guarantee of huge interests to be recouped as soon as the refinery comes on stream.\n\nDangote has been able to restructure the facilities from various local and international banks twice so far, but most banks have totally refused to restructure for the third time with principal repayment also falling due as well as the annual interest payments.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has made available $3.8 billion as part of federal government\u2019s 20% equity in the project, providing $1 billion cash, while the remaining $2.8 billion will be in crude supply.\n\nHowever, analysts have pointed out that NNPC\u2019s 20% equity at $3.8 billion makes the Dangote refinery overvalued at $19 billion.\n\nWhen Aliko Dangote unveiled early plans for the refinery in September 2013 and announced that he had secured about $3.3 billion in financing for the project, the refinery was estimated to cost about $9 billion, of which $3 billion would be invested by the Dangote Group and the remainder via commercial loans, and begin production in 2016.\n\nHowever, after a change in location to Lekki, construction of the refinery did not begin until 2016 with excavation and infrastructure preparation, and the planned completion was pushed back to late 2018.\n\nIn July 2017, major structural construction began, and Dangote estimated that the refinery would be mechanically complete in late 2019 and commissioned in early 2020. Experts, however, posit that the construction would likely take at least twice as long as Dangote publicly stated, with refining capability not likely to be achieved until 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, last week the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, reiterated that Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the acquisition of 20 per cent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refinery.\n\nSylva, while briefing State House correspondents after the virtual FEC meeting presided by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo last Wednesday at the Presidential Villa, said the acquisition was in the sum of $2.76 billion.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Council also approved the acquisition of 20 percent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refineries in the sum of $2.76 billion,\u201d he said.\n\nThis development has been described by industry observers as strange because $2.76 billion falls short of 20 percent of the Dangote project valued by the sponsor at $16 billion. Using the $16 billion value, 20 percent should be $3.2 billion and analysts have expressed dissatisfaction at the disparity in the project\u2019s value and NNPC\u2019s funding.\n\nSpeaking with MMS Plus on the complexities with funding Dangote refinery, the Managing Director of Cowry Assets Management, Mr. Johnson Chukwu, argued that the banks wouldn\u2019t have any challenge from the financing because Dangote would have to pay the interests.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the banks being unable to meet their liquidity because of the monies tied down in the Dangote refinery. Ultimately, if the investment is economically viable, when it starts operation it should be able to meet up the arrears. I believe the banks that went into this project understood some of these constraints and didn\u2019t break their balance-sheets in the move to finance Dangote refinery. I don\u2019t envisage any bank having a liquidity challenge as a result of investing in Dangote refinery. If there is any challenge it would come from Dangote, but it should be resolved when the project takes off,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on the possibility that NNPC over-valued or under-valued the project in its 20% equity, Chukwu opined that NNPC may be looking at an enterprise valuation while the other value could be the net value.\n\n\u201cThe enterprise value could be higher than the amount Dangote has invested in the project. However, I wasn\u2019t involved in determining that, so anything I say will be purely speculative,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the massive support of the Nigerian government on the refinery project, things have got so bad for the billionaire that even income from his other businesses may not be enough to cover the interest rates, let alone the principal.\n\nThe $8.4 billion debt represents 75% of Dangote\u2019s net worth at $11.1 billion and Africa\u2019s richest man has to seek innovative ways to prop up his business now as the refinery project continues to be consistently delayed.",

          "text": "The management of an insurance corporation, Leadway Assurance Company has denied defrauding an Abuja-based man, Jolayemi Woleola.\n\nWoleola had accused the insurance corporation of fraud involving over multi-million naira claims on his damaged vehicle.\n\nHe described the attitude and disposition of the company to his insurance claim as appalling, disappointing, annoying and frustrating.\n\n\"I entered into a vehicle insurance contract with Leadway covering my Mercedes Benz E 300 2017 model. The insured car was involved in an accident with a trailer on Kubwa express in Abuja on 23/07/2021,\u201d he had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\"I presented my claim to Leadway after relevant documents like the police report were issued. The Leadway insurance has maliciously refused to reinstate me to the position I was in prior to the accident.\n\n\"Leadway has been coming up with excuses including outright lies to refuse the fulfilment of their obligation towards me.\n\n\"Leadway started from questioning the veracity of an accident which threatened my life to outright lies of claiming to visit the hospital where I was treated of bleeding and being told no patient was treated on that day to twisting outright glaring facts as to the value of the vehicle prior to insuring same.\u201d\n\nReacting in a letter signed by its Head of Legal Services Department, Sunday Oroleke to SaharaReporters, the company said it was shocked by the allegation of \u201cfraudulent intent\u201d made by Woleola and thereby rebutted it.\n\nLeadway said the insured rejected a settlement offer of N3,711,955.09 and demanded N13,443,982.77 for a vehicle he claimed to have bought for N15,000,000.00.\n\nThe letter read, \u201cOur attention has been brought to a publication by Sahara Reporters regarding an allegation by one of our customers, Mr. Jolayemi Woleola (insured), that we fraudulently denied his motor vehicle insurance claim.\n\n\"We are shocked by the allegation of 'fraudulent intent' made by the insured and hereby rebut it all. We value this responsibility and hereby tender the facts of the claim for clarity:\n\n\u201cWe confirm that Mr. Jolayemi Woleola is the holder of a comprehensive motor insurance policy with our company on his Mercedes Benz with registration number RBC 123 BL. He insured his vehicle for the sum of Fifteen Million Naira (N15,000,000.00) and the policy was effective 26th April, 2021 upon payment of Three Hundred and Seventy-Five Thousand Naira (N375,000.00) being the total premium on the policy.\n\n\u201cOn the 7th of June, 2021, barely two (2) months from the inception of the policy, the insured lodged a claim for a damage to the windscreen and front headlight of the insured vehicle and submitted a quotation of Three Million, Six Hundred and Sixty- Nine Thousand, Two Hundred and Seventy-Four Naira, Ninety-Three Kobo (N3,669,274.93). Upon receipt of the claim, we engaged an independent loss adjuster who adjusted the claim to One Million, Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand Naira (N1, 250,000.00). The insured accepted our settlement offer and we paid the adjusted sum to the insured on the 24th June, 2021.\n\n\u201cOn the 13th of August, 2021, barely two months after the initial claim and about four months into the policy, the insured lodged another claim following an accident involving the same insured vehicle which he stated that he rammed into a moving trailer. He presented a quotation of Thirteen Million, Four Hundred and Forty-Three Thousand, Nine Hundred and Eighty-Two Naira, Seventy-Seven Kobo (N13,443,982.77) being the cost of repair of his Mercedes Benz E300. As usual, we engaged an independent loss adjuster who adjusted the claim to Three Million, Seven Hundred and Sixty-Nine Thousand, Nine Hundred and Forty-One Naira, Fifty- Six Kobo (N3,769,941.56).\n\n\u201cOn the 10th of September, we communicated a formal net offer of the sum of Three Million, Seven Hundred and Eleven Thousand, Nine Hundred and Fifty-Five Naira, Nine Kobo (N3,711,955.09) and forwarded discharge form for cash in lieu of repairs, given that the insured appeared to want to write off the vehicle despite it being repairable.\n\n\u201cThe Insured rejected our offer, insisting that we should settle him on the basis of the sum insured which is contrary to the insurance principle of indemnity as we would be putting the insured in a position far better than he was immediately before the accident.\n\n\u201cIn accordance with standard policy terms, an insurance company can either 'repair, reinstate, or replace' the damaged vehicle. The choice is solely dependent on the professional assessment of the extent of damage. It is also worthy to note that where an accident results in a loss with repair value in excess of 55% of the Sum Insured Value of the vehicle, it is treated as a 'constructive total loss', entitling the insurer to pay for replacement of the vehicle and the possession of the salvage (i.e., the damaged insured vehicle). In this case, the cost of repair was 25.1% of the Sum Insured Value of N15m, which is far less than 55%.\n\n\u201cThe demand and insistence of the insured to claim full value of the insured vehicle appeared to be fraudulent, leading us to investigate why he wants to profit from insurance, particularly after the first accident with a similarly inflated claim that we allowed despite our reservations about it.\n\nSee Also Sahara Reporters Customer Accuses Leadway Assurance Company Of Fraud Over Multi-million Naira Claims On Damaged Vehicle\n\n\u201cIn the course of our investigation, we discovered that the insured had purchased the vehicle as an accident vehicle via auction with primary damage to the front end, secondary damage to the right front and other internal issues which the insured had fraudulently concealed from the insurer at the point of taking up the policy.\n\n\u201cFrom the second accident, the insured in his quotation included some vehicle parts which had been damaged at the time he purchased the accident vehicle and prior to the second accident claimed by him. Rather than deny his second claim altogether, we accepted the dodgy fact of a moving trailer, superficial injury following this moving trailer story and still made an offer on parts that could have been damaged, assuming his story to be true.\n\nPlease note that we remain reputable for our payment of genuine claims and hold ourselves to high standards of best practices.\n\n\u201cThis is evident in Mr. Jolayemi Woleola\u2019s claim that was settled earlier in the year and our net offer of Three Million, Seven Hundred and Eleven Thousand, Nine Hundred and Fifty-Five Naira, Nine Kobo (N3,711,955.09) less policy deductions, being the independently adjusted cost of repairs for his alleged damaged vehicle from an accident with a moving trailer.\n\n\u201cWe kindly request that you retract your publication by publishing our facts and also circulate to counter the fraudulent use of your media in an attempt to blackmail us on an entitlement that is not due to the insured. This would also help in educating and enlightening the public on insurance matters.\u201d",

          "text": "In Nigeria, insufficient purchasing power among middle-class citizens, coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing, puts car purchases out of reach for over 90% of the population. Also, most taxis and public transport buses in Nigerian cities are leased by drivers, who have to deliver rental fees to the owners periodically.\n\nThat means ride-hailing companies such as Uber and Bolt that launch in Nigeria are likely to face a shortage of driver-partners, especially if they\u2019re looking to cover all of the country\u2019s major cities.\n\nEarlier this year, Bolt launched a vehicle financing programme that offered drivers a flexible plan through which they could purchase their own vehicles. The scheme allows drivers to own a car or motorbike with low equity repayment for about four years and no interest.\n\n\u201cAs we expand our presence into more cities across the country, it is important to provide solutions that ensure working with Bolt is more flexible and profitable for drivers,\u201d Bolt\u2019s Country Manager, Femi Akin-Laguda, said at the time.\n\nAfter a pilot phase, which Akin-Laguda tells TechCabal \u201cenjoyed great success\u201d, the company has now partnered with Metro Africa Xpress (MAX), a Nigerian mobility company with a fintech play, to expand the program in the country.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMAX originally started out as a motorcycle-based operator for delivery services. With its mobile app, users could order pickup riders who could fulfil deliveries quickly in the congested city of Lagos. By 2017, MAX had expanded into bike hailing, becoming the first company to pioneer the innovation in Nigeria. But in February 2020, the Lagos government\u2019s restrictions on passenger motorcycles threatened the company\u2019s growth in Nigeria\u2019s largest city.\n\nIn an interview with TechCabal, MAX\u2019s CFO, Guy-Bertrand Njoya, explains that the company has had to double down on its other mobility solutions since the ban. One of these is a subscription platform for low-to-zero emission vehicles in five cities across Nigeria, and Ghana. The subscription product includes credit and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) services, which the more than 13,000 drivers on its platform opt into.\n\nFor the partnership with Bolt, the company\u2019s alternative credit-scoring technology will allow access to proprietary performance and revenue analytics to underwrite the Bolt car loans for drivers.\n\n\u201cMAX is a renowned vehicle subscription platform with the capacity to support a truly wide placement of this type of partnership,\u201d Akin-Laguda said on Bolt\u2019s preferred car financing partner in Nigeria. \u201cTheir approach and insight to meet our goal of empowering drivers suited our desired proposition.\u201d\n\nMAX motorcycle riders.\n\nThe car financing programme is currently open only to drivers in Lagos and Abuja, with Bolt planning to expand the offer to all active drivers across Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Bolt, an agreement can be reached for up to 100% of the purchase, both for new and used cars, within 24 hours of signing up. This is given that drivers have provided all the information required. They can choose to pay back their loans using a percentage of the weekly revenue generated while driving on Bolt for up to five years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to expand our commitment to helping those on the Bolt platform to earn more and at their own pace, either driving full-time or part-time,\u201d Akin-Laguda said. \u201cImproving the earnings of drivers is fundamental to our business operations.\u201d\n\nFor drivers, Bolt\u2019s loan repayment process is more flexible than what traditionally exists in the market. Loan tenors from Nigerian banks often don\u2019t exceed two years whereas Bolt\u2019s repayment duration ranges from two to five. In the long run, Yamaha-backed MAX plans to add electric vehicles to the financing mix.\n\nIn addition to extending the lease-to-own framework to more e-hailing drivers, the partnership is expected to enable drivers access value-add services provided by MAX. These include licenses and permits, insurance, health coverage, and other financial products.\n\nThe low rate of vehicle ownership in Nigeria is similar across Africa, a continent with the lowest per capita vehicle ownership in the world.\n\nWith the majority of Africa\u2019s more than one billion population having limited or no access to vehicle financing, the continent recorded fewer than 900,000 new vehicle sales in 2019, compared to more than 17 million in the United States alone.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

We\u2019re currently prospecting those regions for opportunities to expand safely,\u201d he said.\n\nThe startup recently launched a revamped version of its app that allows users to buy crypto for less than $1 (\u20a6550) while offering features such as one-click limit orders and automated recurring buys.\n\nIt intends to launch a savings feature that would allow users to earn interest on their crypto next month and early next year, another for users to spend cryptocurrencies at select online and offline retail outlets. The latter is being developed in partnership with SureGifts, a gift card company.\n\nThe Busha team.

          "title": "Ex-DealDey managers reunite to launch ThankUCash deals",
          "text": "The collapse of DealDey, a Nigeria-based online deals aggregator, three years ago, laid bare the difficulty of operating an internet-based commerce business in the country, especially with the similar failures of Efritin and OLX at the time.\n\nMuch like Groupon, DealDey connected customers with merchants that offered goods and services at slashed prices, a proposition that appealed to a largely low-income population. In some cases, consumers could purchase items at discounts of more than 90%.\n\nFounded in 2011 by Sim Shagaya, DealDey was a precursor for many e-commerce platforms in the country. And at its peak, the startup could claim to be sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest online deals platform.\n\nIt had more than 400 employees, over one million users, 15,000 active merchants, and 20,000 verified listed businesses, raised millions in equity funding, and looked set to play a big role in the Nigerian e-commerce space for decades to come.\n\nThat was before things went south. As Nigeria\u2019s 2016 economic recession bit hard, DealDey cut over 60% of its staff and reportedly owed merchants for months. In less than a year, the platform was sold to Ringier Africa Deals Group reportedly for $5 million, rather than the $75 million at which it valued itself, before eventually shutting down in late 2018.\n\nSo much has changed in the country since then. For one, more Nigerians now shop online, and arguably, younger populations in urban areas have more spending power. Interestingly, some of DealDey\u2019s former managers\u2014including Mohammed Abubakar, Juwon Ajao, and Joy Amadi\u2014now have an opportunity to take another shot at building the continent\u2019s largest online deals platform, but this time under the ThankUCash brand.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nA multi-merchant rewards platform\n\nSince its founding in 2018, ThankUCash\u2014a service that helps companies grow customer loyalty and increase revenue with data analytics and customer rewards\u2014has become a household name among bargain hunters.\n\nThe platform is the brainchild of Connected Analytics, a company founded by Simeon Ononobi (CEO), Suraj Supekar (CTO), Madonna Ononobi (COO), and Harshal Gandole (Senior VP). The founding members of ThankUCash, a kind of rewards platform hardly seen in African markets, were inspired by the need to address a significant market gap Simeon Ononobi and his team observed: the lack of consumer data and loyalty among businesses.\n\n\u201cWe saw that there were no records on buyers, which affected customer retention as people only bought what they needed and never came back. So we moved to solve this problem, and that\u2019s what brought about ThankUCash,\u201d he told TechCabal. \u201cWe also realised the need to make consumers happy and excited about spending.\u201d\n\nThankUCash enables merchants to give rewards (in the form of cashback, discounts, and points) seamlessly to their customers via a data analytics-powered reward system. Within the ThankUCash app, customers can use the rewards to buy deals, airtime, pay for utility bills, and cable TV subscriptions.\n\nBy giving such rewards, the startup hopes to help build customer loyalty and increase revenue for merchants while also collecting customer data for analytics, targeting, and decision-making purposes.\n\nIn this sense, Connected Analytics generates revenue by using one of the most common business models available: being a middleman. It charges a 30% commission on customer rewards, a monthly SaaS fee from merchants using its predictive analytics platform, and an upfront partnership fee for partners looking to use the platform, and commissions on future transactions.\n\nAs of March this year, ThankUCash had over 500 merchants it was helping to grow their businesses. These include Trebet, Dana Airlines, Gleeword, ENYO Retail, MedMart, PriceRite, Choplife, and CET Energy, among others. The startup claims to have also secured strategic partnerships with major banks and financial institutions in the country, such as UBA, Sterling Bank, First City Monument Bank (FCMB), and Wema Bank.\n\nWith 734,000 users, 90,000 of which are active monthly, the multi-merchant rewards platform has clearly gained significant traction across key indicators so far. But Connected Analytics is not resting on its laurels as it plans to add a new segment to its business offerings: Groupon-like deals.\n\nJuwon Ajao, Mohammed Abubakar, Simeon Ononobi and Joy Amadi.\n\nSucceeding where DealDey struggled\n\nBy expanding its service to include daily deals, Connected Analytics is stepping into a territory where very few Nigerian companies play, ever since the collapse of DealDey three years ago. Some platforms currently offer deals but not on the same scale as the pioneering startup did.\n\nThe decision to re-assemble the DealDey team, according to Simeon Ononobi, was necessitated by the need to tap their experience in achieving the startup\u2019s goals. \u201cWe realised we couldn\u2019t do this on our own and resorted to bringing on the team that had done it in the past,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nBut how does the company plan to avoid the pitfalls that brought down DealDey after seven years of operations?\n\nDealDey\u2019s collapse was based largely on the economic downturn of 2018 when the country\u2019s budget was approved late and consumers\u2019 buying power was affected. Customers wanted to get the same price points and same value. \u201cWith thin margins, we needed to sell more to cover overhead, and at that particular time, it was a tall order,\u201d Abubakar said.\n\nThankUCash intends to leverage its existing analytics capabilities in order to do things better now, according to Simeon Ononobi.\n\nAbubakar, who was the city manager at DealDey, and now serves as ThankUCash\u2019s deals manager, believes the surge in online commerce activity among Nigerians bodes well for the foray into daily deals by Connected Analytics.\n\n\u201cThings are different now compared to when DealDey shut down. More people are inclined to shop online and e-commerce numbers are increasing,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, there are many online platforms doing food delivery, event ticketing, hotel bookings, and other professional services that were not there three or four years ago.\u201d\n\nConnected Analytics plans to hire even more ex-DealDey staff and has also poached top employees from companies like KPMG, Jumia, and Econet Media.\n\nAccording to Simeon Ononobi, some failed businesses could have had better chances of survival if they had a better knowledge of their customers and leveraged that data to make decisions. ThankUCash\u2019s analytics platform solves this problem, and with the addition of the daily deals vertical, it can help businesses, from banks to airlines and hotels, boost sales.\n\nTake a hotel with a 70% occupancy rate during holidays, for instance. Instead of having vacant rooms while overhead costs remain constant, the company could salvage some revenue by offering discounts on bookings via ThankUCash.\n\nSimeon Ononobi is bullish on ThankUCash\u2019s chances of becoming a super aggregator of such deals, helping businesses grow and consumers access bargains. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d the CEO said of his company\u2019s ambitions in the online deals space. \u201cWe\u2019re planning a lot of things and intend to cover a wide range of product categories like DealDey did.\u201d\n\nFor Abubakar, he and his former (and now current) colleagues have a chance to \u201cfind our mistakes, fix them, and then innovate more\u201d at ThankUCash.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",
          "summary": "And at its peak, the startup could claim to be sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s largest online deals platform.\nInterestingly, some of DealDey\u2019s former managers\u2014including Mohammed Abubakar, Juwon Ajao, and Joy Amadi\u2014now have an opportunity to take another shot at building the continent\u2019s largest online deals platform, but this time under the ThankUCash brand.\nThankUCash intends to leverage its existing analytics capabilities in order to do things better now, according to Simeon Ononobi.\nSimeon Ononobi is bullish on ThankUCash\u2019s chances of becoming a super aggregator of such deals, helping businesses grow and consumers access bargains.\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d the CEO said of his company\u2019s ambitions in the online deals space.",

          "text": "A few streets away from Eko Atlantic City, the doors to the exhibition halls of Gallery B57 are open, revealing a black and white portrait of Instagram Influencer, Sanchan.\n\nPortrait of Instagram influencer, Sanchan\n\nLast year, during the global lockdown, Nigerian-born international visual artist, Ade Adekola, made an open call on Instagram for people who were interested in having their photographs turned into portraits. He opened a sign-up form with a commitment to do 30 portraits, but when he opened the form two hours later, the number of requests had exceeded 80. He had to close the call immediately to avoid being overwhelmed.\n\nDuring the process of creating the portraits\u2014all 80 of them\u2014he was able to improve his creative process, developing new techniques that helped him optimise the way he worked. He took the original photographs shared by interested persons, stripped them of all colours, turning them into black and white. He then turned them into engravings, before shading, cutting, and colouring them. Optimising this process, coupled with the overwhelmingly positive feedback he received from his 80 selected muses, encouraged him to create more portraits.\n\nIn the end, Adekola created 700 portraits, but there are only 40 portraits with striking designs and a collage of all 700 portraits on display at the exhibition halls of the gallery.\n\nThe allure of the 40 portraits on display, chosen by Adekola for their unique poses, circumstance or personal resonance to the subject, was elevated by presenting it in lightboxes.\n\nNow titled Lockdown Portraits, his project would go on to form a part of his exhibition titled, Dislocation &\u2026 alongside Anthology of an African Wedding and Diaspora Axis.\n\nOpening up conversations for dislocated people\n\nDislocation &\u2026 is an exhibition featuring NFT art, 3D textiles and augmented reality and events that feature creators from Tokyo, Israel and Singapore on social media and other digital collaborative platforms.\n\nThe artworks in the exhibition were conceived, executed and completed during the year-long lockdown, exploring and amplifying the effects of dislocation on humanity.\n\nIn Diaspora Axis, Adekola took a blend of various nationalities and used it to create a textile design. Ade set out to give agency to people with double or more nationalities, who were confused about their \u201ctrue identities\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo, the inspiration for the anthology series, from that disability perspective, are people who had an emotional roadmap, and that roadmap was truncated. I just open up the space for you to enter and think about what may or could have happened.\u201d\n\nThe design was adopted by an Israeli company to create and display dresses. Using 3D, over 70 design patterns are shown to consumers. \u201cSo, when you buy it, they send the physical garment to you, all cut,\u201d Adekola explained.\n\nA pandemic is a form of dislocation to Adekola, who said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to explore the different kinds of dislocation forces. So, the pandemic is a kind of dislocation where people are in isolation\u2014a prolonged one.\u201d\n\nBuying African emotional entanglement\n\nA scene from Anthology of an African Wedding\n\nAnthology of an African Wedding collection explores dislocation from the angle of emotional entanglement in Yoruba wedding cultures. The Yoruba nation hails from the southwest region of Nigeria, and their wedding culture is colourful, vibrant, and in many ways, extravagant.\n\nViewable using augmented reality, Anthology of an African Wedding collection brings viewers a step closer to experiencing a Yoruba wedding with its traditional gowns, headgear and rings.\n\nAdekola has evolved his art using Photoshop for over 20 years, creating over 20,000 texture designs that he used to create Anthology of an African Wedding. Anthology of an African Wedding, which also sells as an NFT on OpenSea, consists of 18 art pieces\u20149 showing traditional wedding scenes and 9 white wedding ones.\n\nDislocation &\u2026 is on display at Gallery B57 until December 1st.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Price of cooking gas rises 63%, to last longer",
          "text": "Nigerians are facing tough times as average price for refilling a 12.5kg cylinder of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (cooking gas) has risen by 62.8 percent over the past one year. Analysts say it could get worse next year.\n\nAccording to the October 2021 Cooking Gas Watch report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the average price of 12.5kg of the commodity increased by 62.8 percent to N6,638.3 in October 2021 from N4,078.7 in October 2020. While on a month-on-month basis it rose marginally by 7.7 percent to N6,164.9.\n\nThe report notes that states with the highest average price for refilling 12.5kg cooking gas were Oyo (N7,718.2), Abuja (N7,660.0) and Imo (N7,655.6). While states with the lowest were Borno (N5,133.3), Nassarawa (N5,764) and Niger (N6,000).\n\nAccording to some LPG distributors, the hike in price is expected to continue into next year.\n\n\u201cThe soaring cooking gas prices may continue till March next year, as winter in Europe will increase the demand for natural gas for heating,\u201d Emmanuel Uwandu, founder of GAS360, a local gas distributor, states.\n\nSimilarly, Ogboji Sunday, a sale representative at Sungas Company Limited, says it is possible for the price to keep increasing till January based on the current challenges facing the sector.\n\nNigeria imports more than 60 percent of domestic gas while the Nigerian LNG supplies the rest.\n\nExperts blame the price hike of cooking gas on the dearth of infrastructure, global shortfall in gas supply, inadequate local production, and shortage of Foreign Exchange, devaluation of the naira, logistic hitches and the recent introduction of VAT charges on imported gas by the Federal Government.\n\nDamilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, says this situation means tougher times lie ahead for consumers.\n\n\u201cIt is unlikely that gas prices will trend downwards in the near term considering inadequate local supply of the commodity, foreign-exchange induced pressure on importation and the fact that petroleum products will remain on the high-side for a while,\u201d Adewale states.\n\nFindings reveal that LPG price, which has increased five times in the last two months, adds to the difficulty consumers, already stretched due to inflation and low incomes, are facing.\n\nRead also: Nigerians grumble as Cooking Gas price keeps rising\n\nIn order to cope with the rising cost, some Nigerians are switching to dirtier alternatives like charcoal and firewood, while others have started rationing the use of cooking gas to save cost.\n\n\u201cI alternate between cooking gas and firewood because I have to factor into the business my children\u2019s school fees. The current rising price of cooking gas now allows me to consider it as an option,\u201d Eunice Okon, a fruit seller and resident of Lagos State, said.\n\nShe says, \u201cThe little I make from my rice and beans sales are channelled into different responsibilities. With N200 firewood, I will prepare food for my customers for two days and channel other money for the needs of my children.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Marian Godei, a mother of five, says before she used to fill her 12.5kg cylinder full but now she just fills it halfway, saying, \u201cI also had to minimise the amount of food that I cook now.\u201d\n\nThere are concerns that the price of LPG may jump to N10,000 soon unless urgent steps are taken to increase local production and improve supply to the market.\n\nRecently, Bassey Essien, executive secretary at Nigerian Association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas Marketers, said the re-introduction of Value Added Tax meant most businesses had no option than to increase their prices in order not to run at loss. He warned that Nigerians might soon end up paying more than N10,000 for a 12.5kg of cooking gas.\n\nIn September, Mele Kyari, group managing director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), said poor supply of gas was still a major challenge in Nigeria\u2019s domestic market.\n\n\u201cToday, this country is under-supplied with gas. I can tell you that we are having difficulty feeding our network across the country with gas. Every day, it is troublesome to deliver gas. Once your supply is weak, it will affect pricing,\u201d Kyari said.\n\nTo solve the problem of galloping prices of domestic LPG, analysts at CSL Stockbrokers advise the government to actively collaborate with the private sector and provide incentives to elicit investors\u2019 participation in the LPG infrastructure that would enhance local production of gas.\n\n\u201cThe government, on its part, needs to implement policies aimed at removing existing unfriendly tariffs and taxation of the product and its associated equipment so as to attract the much needed private sector investment,\u201d they say.",

          "title": "Rising food price and wellbeing of Nigerians",
          "text": "The welfare of Nigerians is deteriorating every day due to rising prices, especially that of food items in the market.\n\nAn increase in food prices has been in existence even before COVID-19, which may be attributed to the level of insecurity experienced in the North, pronounced conflicts between farmers and herders within the country, the closure of Nigeria\u2019s land borders by the government, among others.\n\nDuring COVID-19, however, the limitations encountered during the production process put more pressure on the prices of goods.\n\nAn observation of the price of some commodities from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) data set shows that the average cost of 1kg local rice year-on-year increased by 4.95 percent and month-on-month 0.01 percent increase. Likewise, the average price of 1kg tomatoes increased year-on-year by 19.28 percent, while a 1kg of white Garri, the popular poor man food, experienced a year-on-year 27.91 percent increase.\n\nFurthermore, Akandu Godwin, the Rivers State chairman of Nigerian Rice Producers Association, complained about the lack of mechanised equipment like caterpillars and bulldozers needed for cultivation by rice farmers, which made rice production difficult. He warned the government against the neglect of rice farmers in the state.\n\nRead Also: Rising food prices threaten Nigeria\u2019s economic recovery -IMF\n\nA World Bank report shows that most Nigerians cannot afford three square meals nor have one time or the other skipped a meal during the day. The report shows that between July and September 2018, 43.3 percent of adults missed at least one meal, 39.3 percent ran out of food, while 13.5 percent went the whole day without food. A decline was experienced between January and February in 2019.\n\nThe percentage of adults who skipped food, ran out of food and went the whole day without food in Nigeria were 27.3 percent, 25.1 percent, and 6.4 percent, respectively. These were the period before the COVD-19.\n\nHowever, by November 2020, 56.1 percent of households skipped at least one meal, 48.0 percent ran out of food, and 18.3 percent went the whole day without eating. The increase in these percentages may be attributed to the economic effect of the pandemic on the country.\n\nThe inability of people to eat well and quality food also have a great impact on their physical and mental health as well as causing malnutrition and stunted growth in children.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, the inflation rate for October 2021 is 15.99 percent year-on-year, which is 1.76 percent more than the 14.23 percent recorded in October 2020.\n\nThe expert also noted a high probability that food prices will double by the end of 2021. This implies that the purchasing power of people will reduce, which may also be attributed to the fall in per capita GDP.\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 1.87 year-on-year in the first quarter of 2020 despite the global disruption experienced from COVID-19, the fall in oil prices, and the barriers to international trade. The real GDP of Nigeria, which was expected to grow by 2.1 percent, was -6.1 percent and -3.6 percent respectively in the 2nd and 3rd quarter of the year but increased in the last quarter of 2020 by 0.01 percent.\n\nSince 2015, the per capita Gross Domestic Capita growth rate has been negative. The growth rate in Nigeria\u2019s GDP per capita are -0.03 in 2015, -4.17 in 2016, -1.79 in 2017, -0.68 in 2018, -0.38 in 2019 and -4.26 in 2020\n\nIn a bid to mitigate the rising effect of poverty among the people, the Federal Government disbursed a cash transfer of N58 billion in the past two months. The national coordinator of Home Improvement Programme Conditional Cash Transfer, Halima Shehu, in a statement during the two days sensitisation training programme for the beneficiaries said that the program was meant to support development goals to enhance household consumption. Shehu explained that this program was founded with the slogan \u201cBeta don come\u201d to help the lower class.\n\nHowever, Nigeria, with over 200 million as of 2021, still has over 40% of its entire population living below the poverty line. The report further shows that more than 4 out of 10 people in Nigeria live below the national poverty line. Millions more just live above the poverty line, thus making them susceptible to falling back into poverty due to the shock experienced from the pandemic. The World Bank report in 2020 shows an expectation of a future rise in extreme poverty in Nigeria by about 15 to 20 million Nigerians moving into poverty. There is a high level of poverty experienced, especially among rural dwellers and specifically women.\n\nCOVID-19 has added around 88 million to 115 million people to the list of impoverished people. World Bank estimates show that 97 million people moved into poverty as a result of the pandemic.\n\nThis implies that the government must put in place adequate measures and programs to curtail the economic effect of the pandemic on Nigerians, as it is evident that the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the welfare of the citizens.",

This is an example of the kind of innovation and collaboration needed to close the energy access gap, enable a just and inclusive energy transition, and unlock a sustainable future for all.\u201d\n\nThe DART Programme aims to improve the overall investment case of the renewable energy sector and attract more international and local investors, particularly commercial banks as lenders to the sector.\n\n\u201cI am particularly impressed by this collaboration between All On, Odyssey, and the Global Energy Alliance, and that Nigeria has been selected as the country in which to kick start this initiative,\u201d said the Rural Electrification Agency MD, Ahmad Salihijo. \u201cThis could be a breakthrough in bridging the finance gap that hinders the growth of small and medium sized enterprises in the nascent renewable energy sector in Nigeria.\u201d",

They are the litmus test of the system. The workshop is to let them know what they will be facing as they retire and assure them that the system is not a death sentence.\n\n\u201cThey will be the first set to witness the scheme and don\u2019t know what it holds for them, which is what prompted this sensitization.\u201d\n\nWashington further noted, \u201cThe challenges of the former system led the Federal Government to source for another credible system, which led to the present system of pension being operated in this country.\n\n\u201cOver time, pensioners retire monthly without payment of gratuity and only get an irregular pension. This new scheme enables workers to save towards their final disengagement from the system. Workers are asked to contribute eight percent of their monthly pay, while the state adds its own 10 percent matching fund, making it 18 percent.\u201d\n\nNoting some advantages of the new system, the PS stated, \u201cThis system enables the retirees to have direct contact with their pension fund administrations by presenting letters of disengagement and by the same month, there would be seamless migration from salary to pension payment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a win-win situation for all involved in the scheme as the Government will continue to fulfill its 10 percent matching fund. These are the first set of intending retirees that will be migrating into the contributory pension scheme.\u201d\n\nAddressing the intending retirees, the guest speaker, Mr. Adebola Bello, who spoke on \u2018Retirement Benefits Under the Contributory Pension Scheme,\u2019 said the scheme came with modalities, which include transparency and uniform regulation.\n\n\u201cFrom day one, the retiree\u2019s programme is for 18 years. It doesn\u2019t mean that after 18 years the retiree doesn\u2019t have money there again. There will be funds since the fund is being invested. Returns on investment give value to the Contributory Pension Scheme,\u201d he added.\n\n...",

We see a university as a place for learning and dispatching knowledge via technology.\n\n\u201cThe strategy used two or three decades ago for our university education might not be applicable today.

          "text": "The federal government says it is difficult to bring the price of cooking gas down as the product is not subsidised by the government and its price is determined by international market forces.\n\nThe Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, said this Tuesday in response to rapidly rising prices of cooking gas that has seen more Nigerians seek other energy sources. He said the government will nonetheless \u201ctinker\u201d with some aspects of gas pricing within its control.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the recent steep rise in European gas prices has been driven by a combination of a strong recovery in demand and tighter-than-expected supply, as well as a particularly cold and long heating season in Europe last winter, and lower-than-usual availability of wind energy.\n\nThe prices of cooking gas in Nigeria have more than doubled in the last year with many Nigerians switching to firewood and charcoal.\n\nSpeaking with journalists at the presidential villa, Abuja, after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, Mr. Sylva said cooking gas is a deregulated commodity and therefore not subsidised. He also said VAT charges on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) imports is also a contributory factor.\n\n\u201cSo the price of cooking gas is not determined by the government or by anybody in the industry. In fact, gas prices are determined internationally,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd you all are aware that in Europe, today, gas prices have gone up; there was even a crisis in Europe relating to gas prices. So the pricing of gas internationally now also affects the price of gas in the country.\n\n\u201cApart from that there are some issues around VAT charges on imported gas, and of course, taxes on imported gas, which we are handling.\n\n\u201cBut of course, quite frankly, these taxes on imported gas, you must also juxtapose it side by side with the local producers of gas. So if you incentivize the importation too much, then you will also kill the local industry.\n\n\u201cAnd also, you don\u2019t want to incentivize the local industry at the expense of the imports, because if you incentivize the local industry at the expense of the imports, then you will not have enough gas produced within the country. So these are the issues of balancing that the midstream and downstream regulatory authorities are handling and I want to assure you that we are quite concerned.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, President Buhari is also very concerned and aware that the price of gas is high in the market, and \u201cwe\u2019re doing everything trying to see how we can bring down the price of gas especially as we approach the yuletide\u201d.\n\nAsked whether the government will address the situation soon as the yuletide season approaches, the minister insisted that there is little the government can do.\n\n\u201cWell, as I said, this is a commodity, whose price is not determined by us. If you tell us, for example, that crude oil prices are high, there\u2019s nothing we can do about it because crude oil prices are not determined in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe also, like you, check for what the price of crude oil is for today because it is not determined here. In the same vein, when we see gas prices going up, gas prices are not also determined in Nigeria, just like you, we are also checking what the price of gas is in the international market.

This is highly impressive and impactful.\n\n\u201cThough, I never thought I could benefit from this but with this, I have a positive story to tell. It is a good thing that aside the style adopted for distribution, it is now being taken to market places.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the initiative, the State Commissioner for Regional Integration and Special Duties, Engr. Hon. Olalekan Badmus, said there is no going back in giving back to the people.\n\nHe said the market approach strategy was adopted as part of effort to further reach out to the masses at the grassroots, saying the present administration was making deliberate efforts to ensure that citizens benefit directly and indirectly from policies and programmes of the government.\n\n\u201cWe have gone to see how far we have been able to reach out to the people.

This is highly impressive and impactful.\n\n\u201cThough, I never thought I could benefit from this but with this, I have a positive story to tell. It is a good thing that aside the style adopted for distribution, it is now being taken to market places.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the initiative, the State Commissioner for Regional Integration and Special Duties, Engr. Hon. Olalekan Badmus, said there is no going back in giving back to the people.\n\nHe said the market approach strategy was adopted as part of effort to further reach out to the masses at the grassroots, saying the present administration was making deliberate efforts to ensure that citizens benefit directly and indirectly from policies and programmes of the government.\n\n\u201cWe have gone to see how far we have been able to reach out to the people.

He was aged 63.\n\nAdebowale, in a viral video on Monday, accused family members and friends of neglecting the veteran actor while he battled the illness.\n\nHowever, while speaking at the residence on Tuesday, he apologised for making the video, saying he did not mean to disrespect anyone.\n\nSpeaking on his father\u2019s sickness, Adebowale said the illness started after the NDLEA ordeal.\n\nHe said, \u201cMy father was a lovely person. Whenever I showed him his videos, he would start laughing and sometimes burst into tears and ask if it was him and if he would ever act again and I would console and assure him that he would act again, just to make him happy.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t really say this was the cause of my father\u2019s sickness, but since his matter with the NDLEA, my dad was not himself; he used to think about his wife and he used to think about us too because he still told me a few days ago that he was not sure if he would be with us for long and I told him that he would be with us.\u201d\n\nNarrating Baba Suwe\u2019s last moments, Adebowale said he was in the gym on Monday when he was called that his father was not breathing well.\n\n\u201cI asked them to call a nurse to treat him and when I got home, I went to his room, talked to him; he was trying to talk to me, but he could not.\n\n\u201cHe was taking his first drip when I got home and when he was taking the second drip, I went out to wash my kits. I was washing my kits when my mum came to tell me that my dad was dead. I had to ask her if she was joking because I just left him about five minutes ago; I rushed to his room and found out that he was dead.\n\n\u201cI was in shock and had to make a short video and because of the shock, I didn\u2019t know what I was doing at that moment, so I posted it on my WhatsApp status and from there it went viral.\n\n\u201cI was surprised that within five minutes, the video had gone viral. What I have to say is that I\u2019m sorry; I appeal to family members that I never meant it that way because I\u2019m still young, but the shock affected me.\u201d\n\nThe Governor of the Lagos State chapter of the Theatre Arts and Motion Picture Practitioners\u2019 Association of Nigeria, Olufunmilayo Oyewunmi, while also speaking at the residence of the deceased on Tuesday, described him as a hero.\n\nThe Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, in a statement, described Baba Suwe as a man who used his gift to advance the course of mankind.\n\nHe noted that his death had left a vacuum in the entertainment industry.\n\nMeanwhile, another son of the deceased, Adesola Omidina, has stated that the actor will be buried on Thursday at his house in Ikorodu, Lagos State.

It is sad, pathetic and disappointing that the Minister spoke even before a White paper is published by the Lagos State Government and it shows that he has no respect for the sensitivity and sacredness of the many lives that were needlessly wasted by soldiers and police.\n\n\u201cHe has no valid reason to remain as a minister because he has lost all modicum of self respect and I think Nigerians will no longer take the Federal government serious if he remains in office as the official spokesperson of the Government.\u201d",

          "text": "The federal government Tuesday disowned the report of the Lagos #ENDSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry and Restitution at the Lagos Court of Arbitration, describing it as mere rehearse of allegations previously made.\n\nIt also said the report was meant to embarrass the federal government and its agencies.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed said this while addressing journalists in Abuja.\n\nIn the report, the panel concluded that Nigerian soldiers and police October 20, 2020, shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters at Lekki while waving the Nigerian flag and singing the national anthem during the protest.\n\nThis, however, runs contrary to the federal government\u2019s position that no one was killed during the Lekki gathering which was to protest police brutality.\n\nPanel wrong \u2013Mohammed\n\nBut the leaked panel report indicted security agencies as having killed dozens of protesters, a position the information minister challenged at the media parley in Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cWithout mincing words, let me say that never in the history of any Judicial Panel in this country has its report been riddled with so many errors, inconsistencies, discrepancies, speculations, innuendoes, omissions, and conclusions that are not supported by evidence. What is circulating in public space is simply a rehash of the unverified fake news that has been playing on social media since the incident of October 20, 2020.\n\n\u201cIt is simply incredible that a Judicial Panel set up to investigate an incident has submitted a report laden with allegations, the same allegations it was set up to investigate in the first instance. Instead of sitting for all of one year, the panel could have just compiled social media \u2018tales by the moonlight\u2019 on the incident and submitted, saving taxpayers\u2019 funds and everyone\u2019s time. That report is nothing but the triumph of fake news and the intimidation of a silent majority by a vociferous lynch mob.\u201d\n\nThe minister who felt vindicated by the \u201ccritical analyses\u201d of the report by a courageous few further said: \u201cOne commentator, a lawyer, said it raised more questions than answers. Another commentator, a journalist, called it a \u2018disgraceful report by a disgraceful panel\u2019, saying it reported allegations instead of investigating the allegations. Yet another wondered how a Judicial Panel could use the words \u2018massacre in context\u2019 and equate such to a massacre. All these and many more have raised valid questions on that report. We salute their courage and refusal to be cowed by the rampaging lynch mob that has been screaming blue murder since the report was released.\u201d\n\n\u2018Leakage cowardly\u2019\n\nWhile acknowledging that both Lagos state government as the convening authority and the panel itself were yet to formally release the report, Mohammed said: \u201cThe cowardly leakage of an unsigned report to the public is not enough. Assuming the report in circulation bears any iota of genuineness, it is basic knowledge that the report of such a panel is of no force until the convening authority issues a White Paper and Gazette on it. It is therefore too premature for any person or entity to seek to castigate the Federal Government and its agencies or officials based on such an unofficial and unvalidated report.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018errors\u2019\n\nThe minister listed the observed errors in the panel\u2019s report thus: \u201cWe do not intend to bore you by rehashing details of the discrepancies, innuendoes, inconsistencies, and errors in that report. They are already in the public space. Let us, however, point out some key highlights of such discrepancies, errors, omissions, etc.\n\n\u201cThe report threw away the testimony of ballistic experts who testified before it. The experts said, inter alia, in their testimony:\n\n\u201cThe Team finds that from the medical data examined, including the timeline of arrival at the medical facility and the nature of the injuries sustained by the victims, who were taken to the 5 medical facilities, that no military grade live ammunition (high-velocity) was fired at the protesters at Lekki Tollgate on 20th October 2020, within the timeframe of reference (18.30- 20.34hrs). That the GSW (Gun Shot Wounds) injuries (4 in number between 19:05 and 19:45 hrs), which were examined by the Team, can be safely identified as being discharged by either low-velocity caliber and/or artisanal/12-gauge firearms (artisanal firearms are locally-fabricated weapons).\n\n\u201cWhat is however certain is that had the military personnel deliberately fired military-grade live ammunition directly at the protesters; there would have been significantly more fatalities and catastrophic injuries recorded. This was clearly not the case.\n\n\u201cThe same panel that said it deemed as credible the evidence of the Forensic Pathologist, Professor John Obafunwa, that only three of the bodies on which post mortem were conducted were from Lekki and only one had gunshot injury went on to contradict itself by saying nine persons died of gunshot wounds at Lekki!\n\n\u201cThe man whose evidence (that he counted 11 bodies in a military van where he was left for dead before he escaped) was found to be crucial by the panel never testified in person. Rather, the video of his \u2018testimony\u2019 was played by someone else. It did not occur to the panel to query the veracity of the testimony of a man who said he was shot and presumed dead but still had time to count dead bodies inside a supposedly dark van at night!\n\n\u201cThe panel said trucks with brushes underneath were brought to the Lekki Toll Gate in the morning of Oct. 21 2020 to clean up bloodstains and other evidence, but still found bullet casings at the same site when it visited on October 20, 2020. It said soldiers picked up bullet casings from Lekki Toll Gate on the night of October 20, 2020, yet claimed that policemen came to the same spot to pick the same bullet casings on October 21, 2020!\n\n\u201cThe panel was silent on the family members of those reportedly killed, merely insinuating they were afraid to testify. Even goats have owners who will look for them if they do not return home, not to talk of human beings. Where are the family members of those who were reportedly killed at Lekki Toll Gate? If the panel is recommending compensation for the families, what are their identities and addresses? Who will receive the compensations when no family members have shown up to date?\n\n\u201cHow did a man who reported seeing the lifeless body of his brother himself end up being on the list of the panel\u2019s deceased persons? How can a Judicial Panel convince anyone that the names of some casualties of the Lekki Toll Gate incident listed as numbers 3 (Jide), 42 (Tola), and 43 (Wisdom) are not fictitious names.\n\n\u201cWhy did the Judicial Panel feel compelled to concoct a\u201dmassacre in context\u201d as a euphemism for\u201dmassacre\u201d? A massacre is a massacre. What is\u201dmassacre in context?\u201d\n\nPanel and security agencies\n\n\u201cThe report never mentioned cases of police personnel who were brutally murdered or the massive destruction of police stations, vehicles, e.t c during the Endsars protest. Does this mean that the panel didn\u2019t consider policemen and women as human beings?\n\n\u201cThe report didn\u2019t make any recommendation on the innocent people whose businesses were attacked and destroyed during the protest in Lagos. I think it was too busy looking for evidence to support its conclusion of \u2018massacre in context\u2019,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nConcluding, the minister said, \u201c\u2026there is absolutely nothing in the report that is circulating to make us change our stand that there was no massacre at Lekki on October 20, 2020.\n\n\u201cFor us to change our stand, a well-investigated report of the incident that meets all required standards and will withstand every scrutiny must be produced and presented to the public. The report in circulation does not meet those requirements.\n\n\u201cWe also appeal to the families of those allegedly killed in Lekki to speak out. It\u2019s untenable to say that some families did not come out because they were afraid. Any parent who is afraid to testify about the death of his or her child is not worth being called a parent.\n\n\u201cWe reject the notion that our soldiers and policemen massacred innocent Nigerians at Lekki on October 20, 2020. That conclusion is not supported by the weight of available evidence. Indictment for murder is a very serious issue that cannot be done on the basis of allegations and corroborations, as the panel did.\n\n\u201cSuch allegations must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The report in circulation is calculated to embarrass the Federal Government and its agencies without foolproof evidence. The Federal Government has never condoned the abuse of the rights of Nigerians by security agencies under any guise, hence it disbanded SARS and encouraged states to set up the panels to investigate reports of human rights abuses allegedly committed by the disbanded SARS personnel.\n\n\u201cThe 37 policemen and six soldiers who died across the country during the Endsars protestare also Nigerians and should not be forgotten.\n\n\u201cThose who have engaged in premature celebration of the report in circulation should now go back and read it thoroughly and tell Nigerians whether it can pass any serious scrutiny.\n\n\u201cWe are saddened that anyone died at all during the Endsars protest as the life of every Nigerian and indeed every human is sacrosanct. As we have disclosed many times, 57 civilians, 37 policemen, and six soldiers were killed across the country during the protest, and we commiserate with their families.\u201d",
          "summary": "The federal government Tuesday disowned the report of the Lagos #ENDSARS Judicial Panel of Inquiry and Restitution at the Lagos Court of Arbitration, describing it as mere rehearse of allegations previously made.\nPanel wrong \u2013MohammedBut the leaked panel report indicted security agencies as having killed dozens of protesters, a position the information minister challenged at the media parley in Abuja.\nAnother commentator, a journalist, called it a \u2018disgraceful report by a disgraceful panel\u2019, saying it reported allegations instead of investigating the allegations.\nYet another wondered how a Judicial Panel could use the words \u2018massacre in context\u2019 and equate such to a massacre.\n\u201cWhy did the Judicial Panel feel compelled to concoct a\u201dmassacre in context\u201d as a euphemism for\u201dmassacre\u201d?",

          "text": "\u2026Poor Nigerians to get N5, 000 monthly allowances \u2013 Minister\n\nGroup Managing Director Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) Mele Kyari has said the regime of fuel subsidy would become an illegality by the year 2022 when it would come to an end.\n\nSpecifically, Kyari said by the end of February 2022, the law provides that Nigeria should be out of the subsidy regime.\n\nHe said the subsidy would have gone in 2020 but for some factors which made it impossible.\n\nThe NNPC boss spoke at November 2021 edition of World Bank Nigeria Development Update.\n\n\u201cThere will be no provision for it legally in our system, but I am also sure you will appreciate that government has a bigger social responsibility to cater for the ordinary and therefore engage in a process that will ensure that we exit in the most subtle and easy manner,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari assured that fuel subsidy removal would \u201cdefinitely\u201d be achieved in 2022 as it is now fully backed by law, and that the price of the product may range between N320 and N340 per litre.\n\nAt the moment, petrol (PMS) in Nigeria sells for N165, and giving the current market data, the commodity presently sells at between N165 to N170.\n\nN5, 000 allowance\n\nAlso speaking at the event, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning Zainab Ahmed said in the place of fuel subsidy removal, the federal government would pay a monthly N5,000 transport grant to poor Nigerians.\n\nThis, she said, would target about 30 to 40 million Nigerians who make up the poorest population of the country.\n\nThe government has consistently argued in favour of fuel subsidy removal, contending that the proceeds would be used in funding critical infrastructure, a position canvassed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nThe minister said: \u201cThe subsidies regime in the (oil) sector remains unsustainable and economically disingenuous.\n\n\u201cAhead of the target date of mid-2022 for the complete elimination of fuel subsidies, we are working with our partners on measures to cushion potential negative impact of the removal of the subsidies on the most vulnerable at the bottom 40% of the population.\n\n\u201cOne of such measures would be to institute a monthly transport subsidy in the form of cash transfer of N5, 000 to between 30 \u2013 40 million deserving Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe are very optimistic that the recent developments in the oil sector, such as the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021, hopefully, the full reactivation of the 4 public refineries in the country, and the completion and coming on stream of the 3 private refineries under construction in 2022, would significantly boost contribution from the sector to our economic growth efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree with the Report that with the expansion of social protection policies during the pandemic, the government has an opportunity to phase out subsidies such as the PMS subsidy while utilizing cash transfers to safeguard the welfare of poor and middle-class households,\u201d the minister further said.\n\nGas price hike\n\nIn a related development, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Timipre Sylva has said the federal government has no control over the price of cooking gas.\n\nThe minister said this while fielding questions from State House correspondents after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari where he formerly presented the Chief Executives Officers of Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), Mr Faruk Ahmed, and the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Mr Gbenga Komolafe.\n\nHe said, like crude oil, prices of gas are determined by global markets, stressing that efforts were being made to reduce the price to bearable level for Nigerians before Yuletide season.\n\nAsked what was responsible for the hike in the price of cooking gas and what government was doing to address the situation, the minister said government cannot subsidise the product as it was fully deregulated.\n\n\u201cWe must understand that cooking gas is not subsidised. It is already a deregulated commodity. So the price of cooking gas is not determined by government or by everybody in the industry. In fact, gas prices are determined internationally.\n\n\u201cAnd you all are aware that in Europe, today, gas prices have gone up, there was even crisis in Europe relating to gas prices. So the pricing of gas internationally now affects also the price of gas in the country.\n\n\u201cApart from that, there are some issues around VAT charges on imported gas, and of course, taxes on imported gas, which we are handling. But of course, quite frankly, these taxes on imported gas, you must also juxtapose it side by side with the local producers of gas.\n\n\u201cSo if you incentivize the importance too much, then you will also kill the local industry. And also, you don\u2019t want to incentivize the local industry at the expense of the imports, because if incentivize the local industry at the expense of the imports, then you will not have enough gas produced within the country.\n\n\u201cSo, these are the issues of balancing that the midstream and downstream regulatory authority are handling and I want to assure you that we are quite concerned. Mr. President also is very concerned. He is aware that the price of gas is high in the market, and we\u2019re doing everything trying to see how we can bring down the price of gas especially as we approached the yuletide,\u201d he said.\n\nNembe oil spillage\n\nThe minister also said President Buhari has also directed him to proceed to Nembe, Bayelsa state, to investigate the level of damage by the recent oil spillage in the area.\n\n\u201cAnd the question which is on the spillage in OML 29, we are quite aware of it. Unfortunately, it has happened. It is also one of the issues I discussed with the president as minister and he has actually asked us to go and visit the site to assess the situation and report back.\n\n\u201cDefinitely, we are quite concerned with what is happening in Nembe and will be going there very soon; tomorrow in fact, to go and look at what is happening and report back.\n\n\u201cMr. President is personally very interested and we have discussed it and he said we should go there and come back and report to him because environmental degradation issues are things that we are not going to condone, but of course we\u2019ll work with the operators of OML 29 to ensure that this spillage is brought under control as quickly as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, the CEO of the Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, Mr Faruk Ahmed said payment of logistics in United States Dollars was responsible for fuel queues in some parts of the country.\n\n\u201cYou see intermittent queues in some parts, maybe of Abuja and maybe the environs. Basically, what happened is that some of the depot owners are selling PMS above the official ex-depot price of N148; they are selling at N156, N157.\n\n\u201cAnd the reason they adduced is that they are paying for their logistics like shipping in US dollars, they\u2019re paying for NPH, port charges and NIMASA charges in US dollars.\n\n\u201cThey have to go to black market to source these US dollars. And that differential between the official and the black market they buy that is why they added about N9 to N10 to N15 and it depends on whether you are in Lagos, Calabar, Port Harcourt, or Oghara.\n\n\u201cNow we had a meeting the week before last Tuesday, the ninth, and the NPA was there represented and the DG NIMASA was there as well NNPC, major marketers were all there and we all agreed and resolved that NNPC excess capacity of their shipping their vessels will be chartered to all marketing companies will be charging in Naira so that NNPC now will go and source for converting US dollars through the CBN.\n\n\u201cAs for the NIMASA and NPA charges, it was all agreed that they will revert to their supervising ministry to get direction on the receipt of these charges in Naira rather than US dollars and I understand the process of that engagement with their supervising ministry has already commenced.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC from the 15th of this month has already converted to charging naira instead of dollar for their excess capacity charter to all marketing companies. So I believe with this, there will be no reason for the depot owners to increase their price beyond the official selling price of N148 naira.\n\n\u201cNow, we have been working tirelessly in the past few years, to sensitize our people to start using LPG for example. And they were making an effort to do so. And the production at that time was more like titling so, people are now interested in are working towards utilization of LPG, but then the production is not commensurate with the demand.\n\n\u201cAnd this is why we want to focus on investment in the area. Now a lot of major oil companies like their IOCs want to invest, but the pricing framework is an issue for them. So we\u2019re working with the guidance of the Honourable Minister of State for Petroleum Resources to ensure that we\u2019ll put the pricing framework that is attractive enough for the investors but at the same time is simple enough for the consumers, whether it is power, or industrial base, or the commercial sectors,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, the CEO of NUPRC, Mr Komolafe said full implementation of the PIA had commenced.\n\n\u201cWe have resumed in the office. Like for the Nigeria Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission, which I am the Chief Executive, I\u2019ve been in office in the past 30 days. And in the process, we\u2019ll be able to come up with six point agenda in line with prescriptions of the way the Act, with which we intend to transform and add value to the Nigeria upstream activities in a manner that we can optimize value across the value chain of the Nigerian upstream activities.\n\n\u201cAmong these, is we intend to basically work towards enhancing our daily production, which at the moment, hovers around 1.6 million barrels a day, in fact, that is the data as of today. So, we intend to actually optimize that and that is put measures in place to do that in alignment with the IOCs and producers.\n\n\u201cWe equally intend to put measures in place. We are actually initiating Public Private Partnership Initiative, which we tend to use to curb the issue of prospect which is acting negatively on financial revenue. We intend equally to ensure full digitization of the upstream activities in a manner that the nation will have advantage of monitoring on real time basis that is the activities of the upstream.\n\n\u201cAnd in addition as part of the agenda we intend to unfold, we are very conscious of the threat to investment in the upstream that is by the fact that when energy transition regime begins, as a matter of fact, we are the regulator in energy transition period, so, we tend to operate in a manner that will facilitate and enable investment in the industry in a manner that will mitigate the effects because we are conscious of the fact that there will be effects of that energy transition and part of the effect that has already been noticeable is funding challenges.\n\n\u201cSo, we put in place strategic plans to mitigate the expected challenges of energy transition. So, by and large, this is the agenda we have put in place for us to optimize value for the nation in the upstream industry,\u201d he said.\n\nNNPC board\n\nMeanwhile, President Buhari has directed the immediate suspension of the inauguration of the newly constituted board of the NNPC Limited, Secretary to the Government of the Federation Boss Mustapha has said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe SGF did not give any reason for the postponement of the event earlier scheduled for Wednesday (today).\n\n\u201cA new date for the inauguration of the Board will be announced in due course.\n\n\u201cWe deeply regret inconveniences caused to members by this suspension, please,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Nigeria: FG, States Won\u2019t Be Able to Pay Salaries in 2022 If Fuel Subsidy is Retained, World Bank Says \u2013 Arise News",
          "text": "The World Bank on Tuesday sounded the alarm bells to Nigeria, saying further delay in removing the fuel subsidy which had been described as a major drain and waste on the economy could see the federal and state governments unable to pay salaries from 2022.\n\nThe Lead Economist, Nigeria Country office of the World Bank, Marco Antonio Hernandez, painted a gloomy picture of Nigeria if the country decides to continue with the controversial fuel subsidy, while unveiling the Nigeria Development Update (NDU), a bi-annual report of the multilateral institution, at an even that held in Abuja as well as virtual.\n\nAlso, the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, during a panel session at the event, lamented the huge burden the continuous retention of the subsidy on petrol had been to the corporation, warning that going forward, \u201cthe NNPC may have to start invoicing the federation to be able to maintain subsidy.\u201d\n\nThis is just as the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, reiterated that the government was working on introducing measures that would cushion the impact of fuel subsidy on vulnerable Nigerians.\n\nSpeaking further, the Hernandez, in the report, urged Nigeria to remove subsidy on petroleum motor spirit (PMS) in February 2022, as prescribed by the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), warning that further delay could worsen the precarious revenue situation confronting the country.\n\nThe report also warned that the present fiscal condition of the sub-national governments would take a turn for the worse in 2022 with 35 of the 36 states unable to meet their financial obligations.\n\nHernandez stated that a situation where N250 billion goes into fuel subsidy monthly was unsustainable as the paucity of revenue confronts the country, especially the sub-national governments.\n\nHernandez who provided insights into the NDU report, titled \u201cTime for Business Unusual,\u201d stated that should the current revenue challenge continue till 2022, only Lagos State would be able to meet its financial obligations.\n\nThe report pointed to mounting fiscal pressures due to lower-than-expected revenues in 2021 and the rising cost of PMS subsidy.\n\nIt stated: \u201cBecause most states rely heavily on inter-governmental transfers, diminished revenue inflows to the Federation Account are jeopardising fiscal sustainability at the state level.\n\n\u201cFor example, in the oil-producing State of Bayelsa federal transfers account for 91 per cent of revenues, and declining transfers caused a 22-percent drop in Bayelsa\u2019s revenues per capita during the year.\n\n\u201cEven in the state of Lagos, which relies the least on Federal transfers, transfers accounted for 29 per cent of revenues in 2020. Most State expenditures cover salaries and administrative expenses, and given their rigid (i.e., nondiscretionary) nature, State-level expenditures are difficult to cut.\n\n\u201cConsequently, lower revenues are likely to intensify pressure on states\u2019 debt stocks and undermine their fiscal sustainability.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, in contrast to past periods of high oil prices, the Nigerian government has this time not been able to fully benefit from the oil boom because oil production has fallen below Nigeria\u2019s estimated capacity and the Organisationof Petroleum Countries (OPEC) quota due in part to rising insecurity and the higher cost of the PMS subsidy.\n\nIt stated: \u201cIn 2022 the federal government plans to spend about 3,000 naira (US$7) per person for health, while the cost of the PMS subsidy for next year could reach 13,000 naira (US$32) per person. Not only is the PMS subsidy costly, but it mainly benefits richer households.\n\n\u201cNigeria has the opportunity to establish a \u201ccompact\u201d with citizens that eliminates the subsidy and uses the savings to provide targeted cash transfers to lower-income-households, invest in job-creating programs, and improve its fiscal position.\u201d\n\nIt stated that the insufficient supply of foreign exchange (FX) issues related to the predictability of exchange rate management, the unsustainable subsidy on premium motor spirit (PMS), burdensome trade restrictions, and the sizeable fiscal deficit financing by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) are undermining the business environment, compounding underlying constraints on domestic revenue mobilisation, foreign investment, human capital development, and the delivery of public services.\n\nThe report noted that despite a strong initial recovery and resurgent global oil prices, Nigeria\u2019s pre-crisis challenges were threatening its post-crisis recovery, highlighting the need to depart from business-as-usual policies.\n\n\u201cEven though Nigeria\u2019s economy exited a pandemic-induced recession, several challenges persist including double-digit inflation, declining incomes, and rising insecurity.\n\n\u201cWhile the government took bold policy measures to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis, the reform momentum has slowed which hinders Nigeria\u2019s ability to reach its growth potential,\u201d World Bank Country Director for Nigeria, Shubham Chaudhuri said.\n\nThe report prescribed policy options for Nigeria, including addressing fiscal pressures.\n\n\u201cUrgent priorities for the next three to six months include reducing inflation, improving exchange-rate management, mobilising additional oil and nonoil revenues, eliminating the PMS subsidy and redirecting expenditures towards targeted cash transfers and other priority investments, fostering competitive markets, and improving infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWhile Nigeria\u2019s macroeconomic projections have been updated since the previous edition of the NDU, the government\u2019s fundamental policy challenges remain unchanged,\u201d it added.\n\nIn his contribution, Kyari, pointed out that while all over the world, subsidies are introduced to bring cost control and less pains to citizens, in Nigeria, fuel subsidy has become a major fiscal burden that must be eliminated.\n\nThe NNPC boss explained: \u201cToday, we are evacuating about 60 million litres of gasoline from all the depots in the country. It is not national consumption and it is very understandable because of issues such as cross-border smuggling.\n\n\u201cAs long as you have arbitrage, traders don\u2019t see it as a crime, they just take advantage of that and exploit it. What we are dealing with is about N243 billion of fuel subsidy monthly. So, there is no magic around that.\n\n\u201cThis is the reality that we are facing. Going forward in 2022, we simply cannot afford this, we just don\u2019t have the resources. As a matter of fact, the NNPC may have to start invoicing the federation to be able to maintain subsidy.\n\n\u201cWhen you take out N243 billion from your total income every month, you are not able to fund your operations and so you can\u2019t meet your other fiscal obligations. Clearly, there is a challenge in the ability to pay. So, there is a reform going on, particular in the energy sector and no one can stop.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai wondered why the country would continue to allocate more monies to fuel subsidy compared with the allocations to education, roads and the health sectors.\n\n\u201cIs subsidising petrol more important than our health as even in a year we spent significant amount on health due to the pandemic, the budget for subsidy was still higher? Does it make sense?\n\n\u201cIs subsidising petrol about thrice as educating our children and preparing them for the future more important? The capital budget for roads is five times less than our budget for subsidy. We have to ask ourselves as Nigerians whether this makes sense at all,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to El-Rufai, \u201cthis is the first time in Nigeria that oil prices are rising globally, yet, there is no windfall. In fact, we are getting less. Why? Because according to Kyari, subsidy is taking N250 billion per month.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that this month, what the NNPC paid to the federation account, as part of its contribution to the amount to be shared by the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC), was only N14 billion as against the N120 billion stipulated in the budget, and, \u201cwith the threat that next month they would ask the federation account to give them a cheque to cover subsidy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, we have to ask ourselves if this subsidy still makes sense. Who is benefiting from it other than the smugglers and neighbouring African countries and some rich people? We have to stop this thing that will bring Nigeria to its knees,\u201d the state governor added.\n\nEarlier, in her opening remarks, Ahmed expressed optimism that recent developments in the oil sector, such as the Petroleum PIA 2021, the full reactivation of the four public refineries in the country, and the completion and coming on stream of the three private refineries under construction in 2022, would significantly boost contribution from the sector to economic growth.\n\nAccording to her, subsidies\u2019 regime in the sector remained unsustainable and economically disingenuous.\n\nShe disclosed that ahead of the target date of mid-2022 for the complete elimination of fuel subsidies, the government was working with its partners on measures to cushion potential negative impact of the removal of the subsidies on the most vulnerable at the bottom, which she estimated to be 40 per cent of the population.\n\n\u201cOne of such measures would be to institute a monthly transport subsidy in the form of cash transfer of N5,000 to between 30 \u2013 40 million deserving Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs a government, we remain committed to our broad objectives of stimulating broad-based growth through diversification and the active participation of the private sector to ensure that our growth is inclusive.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to prioritise investment in critical infrastructure needed to unlock production and supply constraints, to create adequate productive employment and preserve jobs, and to ensure macroeconomic stability and promote poverty reduction and equity.\n\n\u201cI agree with the Report that with the expansion of social protection policies during the pandemic, the government has an opportunity to phase out subsidies such as the PMS subsidy while utilising cash transfers to safeguard the welfare of poor and middle-class households.\n\n\u201cTowards this end, we intend to accelerate our structural reforms, particularly in the power sector, in governance, in business environment to unlock the huge potentials of the economy, scale up social safety net and deepen financial inclusion to reduce poverty and inequality gaps. We will carefully calibrate the sequencing of these reforms to manage their attendant political fallouts,\u201d she added.\n\nAhmed pointed out that digital revolution was looming in Nigeria and waiting to happen spontaneously.\n\n\u201cI agree that Nigeria\u2019s digital economy can transform economic activities by unleashing new productivity gains, offering new services, and improving the government\u2019s efficiency. We see enormous opportunity for our theming youth population in this sector which has largely remained unharnessed with isolated progress and possibilities.\n\n\u201cWe need greater investments in newer and competitive technologies to be made for the provision of critical infrastructure in the telecoms sector to unleash potentials.\n\n\u201cTo protect such investments, government has been mobilising national security outfits, and even local \u2018vigilantes\u2019 to provide added layers of security for the infrastructure, while at same time engaging local communities towards addressing the likely root causes of cases of infrastructure vandalisation,\u201d she added.\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos and Ndubuisi Francis in Abuja",

          "title": "CBN Governor Emefiele Rules Out Further Forbearance Extension for Intervention Loans",
          "text": "The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, on Tuesday foreclosed further extension of the regulatory forbearance on its intervention facilities instituted by the apex bank to cushion the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on companies and businesses.\n\nHe said the global economy has since opened up with lockdowns lifted while companies and businesses have witnessed improved revenues, hence the need for borrowers to start repaying their loans.\n\nEmefiele, while addressing journalists after the two-day meeting of the CBN\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in Abuja, said he does not envisage a likelihood of loan default resulting from the forbearance programme.\n\nThis is just as the MPC yesterday resolved to leave all monetary policy parameters unchanged, retaining the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) otherwise known as the interest rate at 11.5 per cent with the asymmetric corridor of +100/-700 basis points around the MPR.\n\nThe MPR is the rate at which the CBN lends to commercial banks and often determines the cost of borrowing in the economy.\n\nThe MPC also voted to maintain the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) at 27.5 per cent as well as the Liquidity Ratio at 30 per cent.\n\nEmefiele said the existing policy stance had so far supported growth and recovery and expressed satisfaction at the moderation in inflation rate which had declined for six consecutive months.\n\nIn an effort to ameliorate the adverse effects of the pandemic on Nigerians and businesses, the apex bank and other financial institutions had reeled out forbearance packages for companies to help them weather the storm.\n\nPart of the programme was the restructuring of the loan repayment plans, moratorium as well as the CBN reducing interest rates on all its intervention programmes to five per cent from nine per cent till March 2022.\n\nThe CBN had extended the moratorium twice following threats posed by the Delta variant of the virus.\n\nHowever, as the forbearance regime draws to a close in March next year, the CBN governor, citing improvement in economic activities, urged businesses to resume loan repayment.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you recall from our standpoint, we granted a forbearance regime from just two areas.\n\n\u201cOne primarily had to do with the fact that we said all loans that companies and businesses that are impacted adversely by COVID-19, that they should be given about two years, we first started by saying one year, from 2020 to March 2021 and by February 2021, we extended it by one more year when the Delta strain of the pandemic continued. That made it two years that would expire by March 2022.\n\n\u201cAnother aspect had to do with the fact that we said for CBN interventions, that there is a need for us to reduce the interest rate from nine to five per cent. Indeed, another aspect of the intervention or forbearance is that because we knew that the adverse consequences of COVID-19 were resulting in a reduction in the revenue-generating capacity of businesses and companies, we also granted the banks an opportunity to allow their customers to ask for a restructure of their facilities. Maybe if it\u2019s a two-year facility, it would be extended to four years so as to reduce the burden of the cash flow on them.\u201d\n\nEmefiele added: \u201cAnd those were the periods when there was unprecedented lockdown of the global economy. All countries with no exception were on lockdown. Travels came to zero, people were not allowed to leave their homes and in Nigeria, this persisted for about three to four months.\n\n\u201cNow, from around September/October 2020, Nigeria began a process of easing the lockdown and notwithstanding the fact that we still saw that around February/March of 2021 that the Delta strain now reared its head. We still said that businesses should have this forbearance.\n\n\u201cAt this time, we believe that the global economy has opened up; the lockdowns have been lifted and of course, we know the economic damages and fatalities that were caused as a result of the that and I am so sure that not too many counties if at all will in the midst of this pandemic want to embark on a wholesome lockdown any longer.\n\n\u201cParticularly because most countries are all administering vaccines that they think should assist in reducing the impact of the strain of the virus.\n\n\u201cSo we believe that in Nigeria, businesses/companies are back to business, revenues have improved and if revenues have improved then companies or businesses that took loans. If we say the loans for intervention facilities moved from five to nine, if we see that the moratorium of two years expires in March 2022 and of course, the restructure that you have benefitted remains, then naturally we should expect that companies should be able to pay back their loans.\n\n\u201cSo as a result, we do not see any likelihood of an increase of NPLs. Indeed, we have worked so hard to bring the NPLs down from as high as nine, ten per cent about two years ago to the level that it is today which is 5.3 per cent and we are gratified that we are aggressively working NPLs down to the maximum threshold that has been set by the CBN. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need for anybody to worry at all.\u201d\n\nAlso commenting on the concerns over the arbitrary transaction charges by banks, the CBN governor urged bank customers to study the Guide to Bank Charges- and challenges any discretionary deductions which are not in tandem with the guide.\n\nHe said: \u201cTalking about bank charges, the CBN insists that consumers of bank services, in this case, customers must insist and indeed, if it\u2019s not on CBN website, I am going to ask that we place it on our website- the Guide to Bank Charges- go and read your guide to bank charges.\n\n\u201cYou should not allow any bank to just pass on any discretionary charges on your account that is not contained in the guide to bank charges. Hold it as your bible as you deal with the bank. If you find any that is not consistent, raise an alarm.\n\n\u201cWe have our consumer protection department and we have always advertised our hotlines and emails where you can always reach us and indeed, we have been cases in the past where people have raised an alarm and it has resulted in hundreds if not billions of naira reversal back to customers\u2019 accounts.\n\n\u201cSo, I can say that if you are being charged by any bank for transactions that did not happen or charges that are not inside or stated in the guide to bank charges, you have to ask the bank to reverse it because it is not meant to be there.\u201d\n\nHowever, Emefiele, who read the committee\u2019s communiqu\u00e9, explained that the MPC was gratified that its policy actions in the past had started to yield positive results given the remarkable improvement in GDP which stood at 4.03 per cent during Q3 of 2021 and the 6th consecutive month moderation in inflation to 15.99 per cent in October 2021.\n\nHe said given the level of its conviction about the efficacy of its actions on macroeconomic variables, MPC felt that whereas tightening would further help to rein in inflation aggressively, it nevertheless feels that tightening will increase the cost of funds and constrain output growth.\n\nHe said on the other hand, whereas loosening will lower policy rates, ease liquidity pressures, and stimulate additional credit creation which will boost output growth.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cMPC also thinks that loosening will further widen the negative real interest rate gap and compound the price distortions in the money markets which could fuel inflationary pressures. As for whether to hold its existing stance, MPC believes that the existing monetary policy stance has supported the growth recovery and should be allowed to continue for a little longer for consolidation to achieve the MPC mandate of price stability that is conducive for sustainable growth. The Committee also feels that a hold stance will enable it to carefully appraise the implications of the unfolding global development around policy tapering and normalisation by advanced economies.\u201d\n\nHe said the CBN\u2019s Targeted Credit Facility (TCF) was particularly highlighted by the Committee for its contribution to alleviating poverty at the grassroots adding that the MPC urged the bank to continue its support through the TCF to ensure that more people benefit from this programme.\n\nHe also said that with the announcement to commence monetary policy normalization by the US Fed and impending interest rate liftoff by central banks in some advanced economies, the MPC called on the federal government to intensify its drive towards a counter-cyclical fiscal policy in view of the imminent tightening of external financial conditions.\n\nCommittee members, therefore, noted with concern that the gradual normalisation of monetary policy by this group of economies would dampen the recovery of several emerging market and developing economies in the short to medium term due to the sharp reversal of capital flows.\n\nThe committee also evaluated the developments in China relating to the reoccurring pandemic, power outages and crisis in the property market, noting the likely impact these could have on Nigeria as a major trading partner.\n\nThe committee, therefore, called on the CBN to ensure that the necessary buffers are put in place to shield the economy from the downside risks associated with these developments.\n\nIn general, members expressed confidence in the ongoing policies of both the monetary and fiscal authorities which in their view was the hallmark of the current recovery and restoration of macroeconomic stability in the country as well as called on both authorities to look beyond the current position and plan towards attracting sustainable investment flows to Nigeria.\n\nWe are Excited Investors Are Scrambling for First Bank Shares, Says CBN Gov\n\nAlso, responding to a question about the ongoing development at FirstBank Nigeria Limited, Emefiele in commenting on tussle for majority stake in the bank, said the financial institution was too big to be owned by a single individual.\n\nHe also expressed satisfaction that, \u201cpeople are scrambling today for the shares of First Bank,\u201d which he said had been deserted six years ago, largely because of the burden of non-performing loans.\n\nThe CBN governor said, \u201cI think it\u2019s good for us to cast our minds back to the position of First Bank six years ago.\n\nSix years ago, when the CBN started its programme of looking at the bank to reposition it; let\u2019s not forget that FBN remains the oldest bank in Nigeria \u2013 1894. It is a strong, aggressive, domestically important bank in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf anything happens to First Bank, it means something has happened to the Nigerian banking system. And that is why we are taking our guidance on how to get the bank back afoot very seriously. Six years ago like I said, because of the aggressive build-up of non-performing loans in the books of First Bank, the share price of First Bank was about N2 per share.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Emefiele said: \u201cWe took it on \u2013 everybody was running away from the shares of First Bank. But because we have cleaned the bank\u2019s balance sheet now, the NPLs have dropped significantly, people are seeing that this money making machine, First Bank is back again on the race for profitability and they are now competing for the shares of First Bank.\n\n\u201cSo, why should I quarrel that people are competing for the shares of First Bank? The last time I looked at it, it was N11.55 kobo during the weekend and I was happy to see that they are competing for the shares.\n\n\u201cBut of course, they should all know that First Bank is so big that not one person can say he owns First Bank.\n\nThey are just one and they should see themselves as representing others in running the bank. I have read the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) clarifies the issue of shareholding percentages\u2026and indeed they are the people that are supposed to do so. Our examiners have also continued to look at it.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cAnd I think we should take SEC\u2019s position because SEC is the regulator of the capital market. We will take their position and they would give guidance on this subject but of course, as it affects the running and operation of the bank, we would take preeminence in ensuring that the right things are done.\n\n\u201cNaturally, returns are sent to the CBN about people and individual shareholders and of course, if our position is not in tandem with the position of SEC, we will talk to SEC about it and we will also advice the public but so far, I will say that we should take the position of SEC as a regulator of the capital market because regulating share price, ownership is the sole responsibility of SEC and we would not want to override SEC the regulator on these issues but we would continue to work with them and we have very good relationship with them.\n\n\u201cI would just say that I am very happy that people are scrambling today for the shares of First Bank.\u201d\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja",
          "summary": "The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, on Tuesday foreclosed further extension of the regulatory forbearance on its intervention facilities instituted by the apex bank to cushion the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on companies and businesses.\nHowever, as the forbearance regime draws to a close in March next year, the CBN governor, citing improvement in economic activities, urged businesses to resume loan repayment.\nHe said: \u201cTalking about bank charges, the CBN insists that consumers of bank services, in this case, customers must insist and indeed, if it\u2019s not on CBN website, I am going to ask that we place it on our website- the Guide to Bank Charges- go and read your guide to bank charges.\n\u201cYou should not allow any bank to just pass on any discretionary charges on your account that is not contained in the guide to bank charges.\nThe CBN governor said, \u201cI think it\u2019s good for us to cast our minds back to the position of First Bank six years ago.",

          "text": "A spacecraft that must ultimately crash to succeed was launched late on Tuesday from California on a NASA mission to demonstrate the world\u2019s first planetary defense system, designed to deflect an asteroid from a potential doomsday collision with Earth.\n\nThe DART spacecraft soared into the night sky at 10:21 p.m. Pacific time on Tuesday (1:21 a.m. Eastern/0621 GMT Wednesday) from Vandenberg U.S. Space Force Base, about 150 miles northwest of Los Angeles, carried aboard a SpaceX-owned Falcon 9 rocket.\n\nThe launch was shown live on NASA TV.\n\nThe DART payload, about the size of a small car, was released from the booster minutes after launch to begin a 10-month journey into deep space, some 6.8 million miles (11 km) from Earth.\n\nOnce there DART will test its ability to alter an asteroid\u2019s trajectory with sheer kinetic force, plowing into it at high speed to nudge the space boulder off course just enough to keep our planet out of harm\u2019s way.\n\nCameras mounted on the impactor and on a briefcase-sized mini-spacecraft to be released from DART about 10 days beforehand will record the collision and beam images of it back to Earth.\n\nThe asteroid DART is aimed at poses no actual threat and is tiny compared with the cataclysmic Chicxulub asteroid that struck Earth some 66 million years ago, leading to extinction of the dinosaurs. But scientists say smaller asteroids are far more common and pose a greater theoretical danger in the near term.\n\nDART\u2019s target is an asteroid \u201cmoonlet\u201d the size of a football stadium that orbits a chunk of rock five times larger in a binary asteroid system named Didymos, the Greek word for twin.\n\nThe team behind DART, short for Double Asteroid Redirection Test, chose the Didymos system because its relative proximity to Earth and dual-asteroid configuration make it ideal for observing the results of the impact.\n\nBUMPING ASTEROID MOONLET\n\nThe plan is to fly the DART spacecraft directly into the moonlet, called Dimorphos, at 15,000 miles per hour (24,000 kph), bumping it hard enough to shift its orbital track around the larger asteroid.\n\nCameras on the impactor and on a briefcase-sized mini-spacecraft released from DART about 10 days beforehand will record the collision and beam images back to Earth. Ground-based telescopes will measure how much the moonlet\u2019s orbit around Didymos changes.\n\nThe DART team expects to shorten Dimorphos\u2019 orbital track by 10 minutes but would consider at least 73 seconds a success. A small nudge to an asteroid millions of miles away would be sufficient to safely reroute it.\n\nDART is the latest of several NASA missions of recent years to explore and interact with asteroids, primordial rocky remnants from the solar system\u2019s formation 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nLast month, NASA launched a probe on a voyage to the Trojan asteroid clusters orbiting near Jupiter, while the grab-and-go spacecraft OSIRES-REx is on its way back to Earth with a sample collected last October from the asteroid Bennu.\n\nThe Dimorphos moonlet is one of the smallest astronomical objects to receive a permanent name and is one of 27,500 known near-Earth asteroids of all sizes tracked by NASA.\n\nAlthough all none poses a foreseeable hazard to humankind, NASA estimates many more asteroids remain undetected in the near-Earth vicinity.\n\nThe DART spacecraft, cube-shaped with two rectangular solar arrays, is due to rendezvous with the Didymos-Dimorphos pair in late September 2022.\n\nNASA put the entire cost of the DART project at $330 million, well below that of many of the space agency\u2019s most ambitious science missions.",
