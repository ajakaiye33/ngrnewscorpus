          "text": "The Serving Overseer of Citadel Global Community Church, formerly known as Latter Rain Assembly, Pastor Tunde Bakare, on Saturday, reaffirmed his conviction that he had a date with history as Nigeria prepares to choose its 16th leader in 2023.\n\nIn an address, titled, \u2018The Portrait of a New Nigeria: The 16th Unveiled\u2019, which he delivered during a virtual meeting with some Nigerians in the Diaspora, the clergyman declared, \u201cI do have a vision of a New Nigeria that was birthed in me from childhood and an honest aspiration to serve as the 16th president of my beloved nation, Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIt was the umpteenth time that Bakare would be telling the world that he would be Nigeria\u2019s President after the incumbent, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), who is the nation\u2019s 15th leader.\n\nThe preacher, who was Buhari\u2019s running mate during the former\u2019s failed presidential bid in 2011 on the platform of the Congress for Progressive Change, had first in September 2019 declared that he would succeed Buhari by a divine arrangement come 2023.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll probably be the first President preaching on Sunday,\u201d he said then in an address delivered in his Lagos church.\n\nAt Saturday\u2019s \u2018Virtual Meeting Towards Unveiling Project 16 to Nigerians in the Diaspora, Courtesy of PTB4Nigeria\u2019, Bakare, who said becoming Nigeria\u2019s President was a vision he had conceived from childhood, reiterated his earlier declaration that the number 16 was significant for him, as the staircase in his father\u2019s house had 16 flights.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs a young boy, I had a vision of Nigeria. I grew up in my father\u2019s house in Abeokuta, a storey building with 16 steps, which today is the first family heritage historical museum in Abeokuta courtesy of the Ogun State Government during the Otunba Gbenga Daniel administration.\n\n\u201cAs a child, I was groomed in the traditions of my fathers and graduated from Koranic school on April 16, 1967. Just before that day, on April 10, 1967, exactly 55 years ago tomorrow (Sunday), as a 12-year-old, I saw myself in a night dream climbing the 16 steps in my father\u2019s house. I exited through a door that opened up to a mountain top, where I took a seat between two of Nigeria\u2019s notable leaders, General Yakubu Gowon, who was the then Head of State and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, and Chief Obafemi Awolowo, who was then the leader of government business.\n\n\u201cIn the said dream, we were overlooking Nigeria and strategising on how to shape the future of the nation. That dream stirred in me an unquenchable conviction about Nigeria\u2019s great destiny and my role in the fulfilment of that destiny. Afterwards, I understood that the 16 steps in my father\u2019s house in Abeokuta were symbolic of the 16 administrations in Nigeria from independence to the next administration, and a pointer to the fact that I would play a leading role as we approach the 16th step to the Nigeria of our dreams.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Ozioruva Aliu\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 NOT less than five persons and several others were maimed as suspected criminal herdsmen attacked Odiguetue, an agrarian community in Ovia North-East Local Government Area of Edo State.\n\n\n\nA villager told journalists on Saturday that the attack and killing happened on Thursday and that members of the community have constituted themselves into vigilance groups to protect themselves.\n\n\n\nIt was gathered that the herdsmen, who had about a month ago, attacked security personnel in the locality and burnt down a patrol van, came back on Thursday morning to unleash mayhem on the locals, who for sometime had been resisting the headers from feeding their cows with the farm produce of the villagers.\n\nBut the Police Public Relations Officer, Bello Kontongs is yet to confirm the incident but a community leader, Lt. Commander Anthony Ogie (Rtd), said: \u201cfor sometime now, the herdsmen have been harassing us. You can\u2019t go to the farm anymore because of them. Last week, around 7pm, they came close to the houses, shooting but when the people came out, they went back to the bush\u201d.\n\n\u201cThen on Thursday, people were on their farms when the herdsmen came and killed three people. That was in the morning. Later in the evening, they came again and killed two more but this time on the expressway. There is a police check point on the highway. The police saw them but didn\u2019t do anything.\n\n\u201cAnytime the herdsmen come , we usually call the police and soldiers, who will come but will not go into the bush where these herdsmen have their camps, even when the villagers volunteer to lead the security men. Odiguetue is a peaceful community. How can you do this to a people who are peaceful and who go about their normal businesses\u201d?. Ogie lamented.\n\nAlso speaking, another community leader, Elder John Osagiede, said that he got the information that the village was going to be attacked and tried to reach the authorities to no avail.",

How can bandits drive from Kaduna to Abuja unhindered? This can happen because they are aware of our security lapses,\u201d\n\nHe said security will be his major focus if opportune to become the next Nigerian president. \u201cI will look into our security architecture and provide a new set of equipment with a new set of trained officers who will fish out bandits from their hidden places through intelligence gathering.\n\n\u201cThe officers will be trained, well kitted with good welfare and insurance packages so that they can put in their best.\u201d He added.",

          "text": "Senator Chris Ngige\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nA meeting of traditional rulers of Igbo extraction, (Ndieze Igbo) in Diaspora and Igbo Delegate Assembly (IDA) comprising Igbos living in the 19 states of Northern Nigeria rose on Saturday in Abuja, with a unanimous resolution to support the Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige for the 2023 presidential race.\n\nThey said Ngige should henceforth stop his consultations and join the race for the country\u2019s topmost political office.\n\nRecall that Ngige had said that he was consulting his friends and political associates across the country and that he would make his presidential ambition open after Easter.\n\nBut the President-General of IDA, Chief Chi Nwogu who announced the resolution, said Ngige by his antecedents had proved his mettle in leadership and if Nigerians decide to seek for an Igboman to lead the country, he should be the one.\n\nNwogu in a statement issued by the Minister\u2019s Media Office said Igbos were tired of playing a second fiddle in Nigerian politics and wished to produce the successor to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe want to produce the President of Nigeria in 2023. We don\u2019t want Vice President. Please Ngige, you have done enough consultations. Don\u2019t consult again. Join the presidential race.\n\n\u201cWe know your antecedents from the periods you served as governor of Anambra State and Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. You have been in the labour room for the past seven years as the Minister of Labour and Employment, attending to all the labour disputes brought to your table. Please, join the presidential race. We will support you. We will follow you to Aso Rock.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in a similar vein, the Eze-Ndigbo Bauchi, Igwe Jude Umezika, described Ngige as a unifier and bridge-builder who would unify Nigeria and safeguard the lives and property of the Igbos and other Nigerians wherever they live in the country.\n\n\u201cThe roads he built in Anambra 16 years ago are still intact. There is no Igbo man who is his match. He is one of the Igbo leaders that will call us whenever there is a problem in the North. He has the fear of God.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Ezeudo of Abuja, Dr Uche Egenti, described Ngige as a bold, courageous and brave man, expressing confidence that if given the opportunity to serve as President, he would replicate his excellent performance in Anambra State in Nigeria.\n\nEarlier while consulting the group on his presidential ambition, Ngige reaffirmed his belief in one united, fair, equitable and just Nigeria, saying Igbos have properties scattered across the country.\n\nHe said the president of Nigeria should be for the most competent person irrespective of where he or she comes from.\n\n\u201cThe president is for all but certain areas in the constitution, particularly Section 14 (3) said that the government of Nigeria must be dominated by persons from different groups and no one group should dominate in other to command national loyalty and patriotism.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we believe in unity and diversity. We believe in justice, equity and fair play, to the extent that today, our party, APC, has said that the next president should come from the people of Southern stock of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Igbos of the South-East are part of Southern Nigeria. Some of us have taken the pains to serve our country for the past 40 years in the public service of Nigeria. I started my journey as medical officer 1 at the National Assembly clinic in Lagos. From there, I went into the Federal Ministry of Health and rose to become consultant and later, Deputy Director in charge of Hospital Services. I left the civil service without blemish and became a party official in the PDP. Working with former Vice President, Dr Alex Ekwueme, we conceded presidency to the South-West in 1999 and General Olusegun Obasanjo became President. I was among those who made it possible for the unity of the country. The party conscripted me to become Governor in Anambra State.Obasanjo stayed 1999 to 2007 and afterwards, the presidency moved to the North and Yar\u2019Adua who was my mate as Governor became President.\n\n\u201cThose who are from Anambra here know what I did in the State as Governor in just 34 months. I didn\u2019t do for Anambra alone, but for the entire South-East.\u201d\n\nNgige recalled that his administration in Anambra State executed 105 road projects transversing the entire 21 local government areas of Anambra State and linking neighbouring states of Imo, Abia and Enugu.\n\nHe said Anambra people rewarded him with a seat at the Senate where he represented Anambra Central and they made good laws for the country, such as the 2013 Health Act he made in collaboration with Sen. Ifeanyi Okowa, the incumbent Delta State Governor.\n\nNgige said he has been Minister of Labour and Employment for two terms since in 2015 and has been labouring in the labour room ever since , attending to labour disputes from ASUU, doctors and other unions, so that things would continue moving.\n\n\u201cI am doing all these as your ambassador, trying to represent the Igbos well. I think I have done well. Now, we are talking about the president of Nigeria. President Muhamnadu, my friend has worked for Nigeria. But, no one man will finish every work. His tenure is coming to an end. I have told him that those who will replace him are those who understand what is being said, to ensure that we execute our programmes 100 percent. I don\u2019t have money but I know I have the capacity to do the job. I am still consulting and will take a decision by Easter. Being a good Christian, I have committed everything to God.\u201d",

And we also think that equity and justice is an important pillar that will ultimately stabilize our politics towards our journey in rescuing Nigeria. This is our position and that is why we have met today.\u201d\n\nIkpeazu, while fielding question on the reasons on which the zoning committee reportedly resolved to throw the ticket open, said: \u201cIf you want to take a position of policy, you don\u2019t look at problems in their face and take decision. You take a decision and remain firm on that decision. We think what this country is lacking today is our ability to dispense equity and justice. It may be difficult, it may be a bitter pill, but we need to stand with the truth.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Anyim Pius Anyim; former Anambra State governor, Peter Obi; former President, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Sam Ohuabunwa and American-based medical doctor, Nwachukwu Anakwenze, yesterday, resolved to work together to ensure that the Southeast produces the 2023 PDP presidential ticket.\n\nAnyim, who spoke on behalf of the other aspirants, after a meeting, in Abuja said that their resolve to have a South Easterner as the PDP 2023 presidential candidate is based on equity, fair play and national unity.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cfour of us are presidential aspirants on the platform of our great party, the Peoples Democratic Party. We met this morning and resolved as follows: we have agreed to work together as a team. We will work together to ensure that a South Easterner emerges as PDP flag bearer for 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cWe intend to consult with other zones on this issue and it is based on fairness and equity. In doing so, it is important to note that we have always supported other zones, and we now expect them to reciprocate.\u201d\n\nOn whether the four aspirants, will come up with a consensus candidate from the Southeast, Anyim said: \u201cWhen we get to the bridge, we\u2019ll cross it. But we will work together in the interest of the party, in the interest of the nation, and in the interest of Southeast.\u201d\n\nThe former SGF, while responding to a question whether they have the support of Governors Ugwuanyi and Ikpeazu of Enugu and Abia states respectively, said that the question should rather be directed to the governors.",

We don\u2019t want Vice President. Please Ngige, you have done enough consultations. Don\u2019t consult again. Join the presidential race.\n\n\u201cWe know your antecedents the periods you served as governor of Anambra State and Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. You have been in the \u2018labour room\u2019 in the past seven years as the Minister of Labour and Employment, attending to all the labour disputes brought to your table. Please, join the presidential race. We will support you. We will follow you to Aso Rock.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in a similar vein, the Eze-Ndigbo Bauchi, Igwe Jude Umezika, described Ngige as a unifier and bridge-builder who would unify Nigeria and safeguard the lives and property of the Igbo and other Nigerians wherever they live in the country.\n\n\u201cThe roads he built in Anambra 16 years ago are still intact. There is no Igbo man who is his match. He is one of the Igbo leaders that will call us whenever there is a problem in the North.

We believe in justice, equity and fair play, to the extent that today, our party, APC, has said that the next president should come from the people of Southern stock of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Igbo of the Southeast are part of Southern Nigeria. Some of us have taken the pains to serve our country for the past 40 years in the public service of Nigeria. I started my journey as medical officer 1 at the National Assembly clinic in Lagos. From there, I went into the Federal Ministry of Health and rose to become consultant and later, Deputy Director in charge of Hospital Services. I left the civil service without blemish and became a party official in the PDP. Working with former Vice President, Dr Alex Ekwueme, we conceded presidency to the Southwest in 1999 and General Olusegun Obasanjo became president. I was among those who made it possible for the unity of the country. The party conscripted me to become governor in Anambra State. Obasanjo stayed 1999 to 2007 and afterwards, the presidency moved to the North and Yar\u2019Adua who was my mate as governor became president.\n\n\u201cThose who are from Anambra here know what I did in the state as governor in just 34 months. I didn\u2019t do for Anambra alone, but for the entire Southeast.\u201d\n\nNgige recalled that his administration in Anambra State executed 105 road projects traversing the entire 21 local government areas of Anambra State and linking neighbouring states of Imo, Abia and Enugu.\n\nHe said that Anambra people rewarded him with a seat at the Senate where he represented Anambra Central and they made good laws for the country, such as the 2013 Health Act he made in collaboration with Sen. Ifeanyi Okowa, the incumbent Delta State governor.\n\nNgige said that he has been Minister of Labour and Employment for two terms since in 2015 and has been labouring in the labour room ever since, attending to labour disputes from ASUU, doctors and other unions, so that things would continue moving.\n\n\u201cI am doing all these as your ambassador, trying to represent the Igbo well. I think I have done well. Now, we are talking about the president of Nigeria. President Muhamnadu, my friend, has worked for Nigeria. But, no one man will finish every work. His tenure is coming to an end. I have told him that those who will replace him are those who understand what is being said, to ensure that we execute our programmes 100 per cent. I don\u2019t have money, but I know I have the capacity to do the job. I am still consulting and will take a decision by Easter. Being a good Christian, I have committed everything to God.\u201d",

          "title": "My sexy eyes often attract lesbians -Bella Ebinum, actress",
          "text": "By Christian Agadibe\n\nAs long as there is love, star actress, Bella Ebinum wouldn\u2019t mind marrying a man old enough to be her father.\n\nWeird? Okay, wait for this. The Delta State-born thespian cum entrepreneur insists she would forgive her husband if she catches him cheating on her.\n\nIn this rare interview, the graduate of Economics from University of Port Harcourt opens up on the challenges of stardom, among other issues. Here are excerpts:\n\nYou\u2019ve been off the screen for some time now, what could be responsible for the long absence?\n\nI never knew I was off; maybe I was having other plans. I think it was when I was planning to put together my Foundation and I had to channel my energy on that.\n\nHow did you get into the movie industry?\n\nMy childhood friend, who is a producer, introduced me to the industry. Then I was in Uniport; I told her that I have been trying to get into the movie industry. She told me I have to come down to Asaba, that she would introduce me to her (film) director, because she trusted and believed that I could do it, and perfectly too.\n\nWhat was the first movie you acted in and how many movies have you done so far?\n\nProfessionally, my first movie was Deceptive Act. I have also featured in Daughters of Karashika, When Love Beckon, My Village Wife, Detective Wife, Ajuwani the Village Goddess, Marry Me, Fire of Love, and 24 Elders of the Gods.\n\nWhat were some of the challenges you faced?\n\nIt\u2019s trying to adapt to the system because where I was coming from, I didn\u2019t know how to lick ass to get what I want. I believe in merit. So, you just have to tolerate a lot of things to get what you want, and I had to play along. At first, they thought I was a snub because it was not my thing to fall for somebody in order to get something.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nAside acting, what else do you do?\n\nI have my Foundation, my cosmetic line (Bella Secret) and right now, I want to open my Foundation house.\n\nAre you single or married?\n\nI\u2019m in a private relationship.\n\n\n\nWhat is your definition of an ideal man?\n\nThis is such a sweet question I like answering. I have to say this because a lot of girls make the mistake of wanting to get married to a handsome man instead of a good father to their children. Anyway, I always get high on an intelligent man, a man with a good heart.\n\nWith the rate of extra-marital affairs among married men, would you forgive your husband if you catch him cheating?\n\nWhy would I not forgive him? Men are polygamous by nature. Forget insecure men, they know where their hearts belong. A man does not really love, as they only want to have fun. Women are the ones you should even be scared of, because they are the ones that love with their hearts.\n\n\n\nYou made news recently when you bought your Benz; it seems the industry is more profitable for actresses than actors?\n\nThe favour of God is better than labour. I never said I bought it with my money. It was a gift. People labour because they do not have favour. It was not a fan that bought it for me. I told you I am in a relationship, right? So, that is it!\n\nYou posted on your Instagram page a picture of you touching your breast in a sexy manner, was it a media stunt to get more followers?\n\nOh yes, it\u2019s a media stunt. As a matter of fact, someone came to my DM to dash me money as regards that post.\n\n\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nSome celebrities have accused men of usually masturbating using their pictures; do you think that might be the case with your video?\n\nWith this my video, I am very sure they will masturbate with it. Before that person \u2018dash\u2019 me money it\u2019s possible he don come self (laughs).\n\nHow do you handle randy men?\n\nOne sent me a dick three months ago. If you see the kind of dick that this man carries, eh\u2026 I didn\u2019t even know what to do; I just had to block him.\n\nSo, how do you handle the stubborn ones that might want to have sex with you?\n\nIn one of my posts, I said that if a man is claiming to be nicer than your husband, just block him immediately so you will not be tempted, because that nice attitude is just for him to get into your pants. Some would come with business ideas; I just refer them to my manager.\n\nCan you marry a man that is old enough to be your father?\n\nI am not supposed to marry my age mate. Yes, I can. Love has nothing to do with age. In fact, I like older men. But like I said, I\u2019m not looking for a relationship.\n\nCan you be a second wife?\n\nI will not be a second wife except the woman is no longer in the marriage.\n\n\n\nHow would you describe your fashion style?\n\nI like it simple and classy. I dress to attract class.\n\nHas fame denied you of anything?\n\nNo, it has not. But maybe the fact that I can no longer go to the market like I used to do before the fame\u2026.\n\nAs a result of your sexy eyes, have you had any experience or encounter with lesbians?\n\nYes, I have. I remember a day on set, a girl came to me and told me that she smokes and then asked if I smoke. I said \u2018no\u2019. So, she asked if I could try something out with her. I said \u2018okay what is it?\u2019 She said she would pop out smoke from her mouth and that since I don\u2019t smoke, I should inhale the smoke and then give it back to her. I said \u2018okay, cool let\u2019s do it\u2019. So, when she popped it (smoke) out and I took it and wanted to give it back to her, she tried to hold my head close to her, saying that she wanted to kiss me. Jesus! I was like\u2026 what? Because my (sexy) eyes are a gift from God, a lot of people are jealous; and many lesbians come to me for that. They believe from the way I look, I\u2019m a lesbian but I am not.\n\nWhich of the movies would you say gave you stardom?\n\nIt\u2019s My Village Wife.\n\nHow was your growing up, you sound like someone born with a silver spoon?\n\nMy dad was an accountant with Shell but now retired. My mom was a nurse, and we are just three in number. I went to Cambridge and had the best life traveling the world. It is really not about being born with a silver spoon but about exposure. A lot of people down here in the East where I\u2019m working are exposed; but I was not really exposed before I came into the industry, so they cannot think like me. I don\u2019t think that has to do with silver spoon; I just think their level of reasoning cannot be like mine. So, sometimes I just have to come down to their level.\n\nHave you turned down any movie role as a result of soft porn content?\n\nYes, I have. I was born a Jehovah Witness and my mom is a preacher, so I have turned down many of those movie roles.\n\n\n\nWhy do you think Nollywood love movies always end up on bed?\n\nIt\u2019s because in the Nigerian movie industry, the only way they interpret love is on bed. We don\u2019t know how to show love except on the bed and through sex.\n\nWhat project are you currently working on?\n\nMy plan for 2022 is to use my foundation to open a production house, because I realise a lot of people want to go into acting and they don\u2019t have the means or the opportunity. So, I want to use my Foundation as a launch pad for this course, be it actors, scriptwriters, costumiers etc. This is going to serve as an opportunity for them to showcase their talents and leave the street life.",

          "title": "Search for Consensus Presidential Candidate in PDP Falters, Atiku Insists on Primary Election",
          "text": "\n\nOur Correspondents\n\nThe quest by some presidential aspirants of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for a consensus flagbearer for the party ahead of their Presidential primaries is looking more like a fruitless mission, with former vice president Atiku Abubakar and two others (Dele Momodu and Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa) insisting that all aspirants must face the party\u2019s delegates in \u201cdemocratic primary election.\n\n\u201dThe four aspirants in the forefront of the campaign for consensus \u2013 former President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki; Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State; Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State and the former Managing Director of FSB International Bank, Mohammed Hayatudeen \u2013 have been crisscrossing the country in the last few weeks, promoting the consensus flagbearer idea. Only last Wednesday, the pro-consensus aspirants led by Saraki met with Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, where the issue of consensus flagbearer topped the agenda and strategies for actualising the mission mapped out.\n\nWike, while speaking after the meeting, said their interest was to ensure the consolidation of unity in the party.He said they were developing a formidable strategy that would enable the PDP coast to victory in the 2023 presidential election. Atiku was, however, absent from the meeting. The pro-consensus presidential aspirants had earlier met with Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State and Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State on the issue.\n\nA source close to the former vice president told THISDAY last night that Atiku would never be part of any consensus arrangement for the presidential ticket of the PDP. The source said some of the pro-consensus presidential aspirants, led by Saraki, met with Atiku in his house in Abuja last week and that the former vice president told them bluntly that what they were pushing for was undemocratic, can\u2019t work and that he would never be part of it.\n\nAtiku was said to have advised that all aspirants should go and face the party\u2019s delegates at the National Convention. Another source close to the former vice president told THISDAY: \u201cThe push for consensus is by people aiming to shut out a particular aspirant. Are they saying the 13 aspirants that took forms would sit down and pick one of them as the consensus flagbearer? Does this make sense? Who will step down for who? The aspirants should be meeting and selling their ideas to delegates; not meeting over consensus candidate. That is the position of Atiku.\n\n\u201dNewspaper publisher and another presidential aspirant, Dele Momodu told THISDAY last night that the move for consensus PDP flagbearer was dead on arrival.Momodu stated: \u201cI see a very dangerous kind of desperation in our career politicians in Nigeria as our country prepares for the 2023 Presidential election. It is unfortunate that some of our leaders are toying with the hard-fought democracy most of them were never part of.\n\n\u201cAt a time our country is at its worst state in decades, career politicians are only interested in hijacking power for themselves and are totally disinterested in engaging the electorates on how they plan to rescue our country and its long-suffering people from the brink of total collapse.\n\n\u201cThe concept of consensus as practised in Nigeria is anathema to democracy because it is based on everything that democracy is not. It denies merit, enshrines illegality and enthrones mediocrity. Moreover, it embraces corruption, bullying and other unseen ills and threats.\n\nHow are the proponents of consensus different from President Muhammadu Buhari who has virtually taken over the control of APC as the Alpha & Omega? \u201cHow will they enforce their consensus on someone like me when I have bought my nomination form and I\u2019m ready to contest all the way? They should please conserve and preserve their energies and let the people make their choices in a free and fair contest. That is the essence of democracy.\n\nWe need to save hapless Nigerians from this unnecessary distraction.\u201dAnother PDP Presidential aspirant, Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa questioned the principles that would govern the choice of a consensus presidential candidate being promoted.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen I see Bukola Saraki moving round the country canvassing for a PDP consensus Presidential candidate, he reminds me of his father many years ago, moving round the country saying it was the turn of the North to present a Presidential candidate.\u201cHowever, what are the principles governing the choice of a consensus Presidential candidate? It is worth consideration when consensus is anchored on the principle of equity, justice and fair play, not the brow beaten saga, which APC was compelled to submit to by Mr. President recently.\n\nConsensus should not approximate to an arm twisting scenario or drama.\u201cWhy is the talk of consensus at this time when the clamour for a Nigerian President of Southeast extraction has gained critical mass at the national level? Someone brought the idea of this consensus to my attention, to buy into it. When 10 people are contesting or vying for a position, you don\u2019t exclude nine to the advantage of one person. Consensus must be a collective decision of all those involved in this game. Period.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeeting with Makinde, Okowa\n\nAt the PDP pro-consensus presidential aspirants meeting with Makinde, the governor said the party would work to ensure the success of a consensus presidential candidate arrangement for the PDP. \u201dWe have discussed behind closed doors the issue of the consensus arrangements we are trying to put together. We did it at the last convention of our party, and that was the first time the PDP was able to achieve bringing in a national chairman for the party through a consensus arrangement,\u201d Makinde said.\n\nAt the meeting with Makinde, Saraki declared: \u201cOf course, we all have our individual interests to become the president, but we have decided in our meetings that we are ready to subject ourselves to a consensus arrangement. It is not just for one part of the country, but for the PDP as a party.\u201dAt another meeting with Okowa, Saraki also made a case for consensus candidate: \u201cThis is important because we believe that the country needs unity.\n\nWe are all eminently qualified to lead this country but we believe that only one person will lead and that person needs everybody to make Nigeria better and to fix this country.\u201dThe former governor of Kwara stated that the interest of the aspirants was second to that of the country, adding, \u201cThis also goes to show that this consensus arrangement is not just about the issue of the North but about Nigeria.\n\n\u201dSaraki said any of them is qualified to lead the country and that they had agreed to a consensus arrangement to elect the party\u2019s presidential flagbearer.Also, Saraki, during a consultative visit to Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State last month, said some of the PDP presidential aspirants from the north were ready for a consensus candidate.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the end of the day, it is only one person that will lead this country in 2023; and we also resolved that we are going to work closely to ensure that we come out with a way that consensus arrangement would come among the three of us on how to go forward into leading this country.\u201dThe aspirants that have purchased the PDP presidential forms are Atiku, Saraki, Wike, Anyim Pius Anyim, Governor Mohammed, Governor Tambuwal, Hayatudeen and Dele Momodu.\n\nOthers are a United States based medical doctor, Nwachukwu Anakwenze; former governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi; Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Udom Emmanuel; a pharmacist, Sam Ohuabunwa and an unknown politician from Imo State, Mrs. Oliver Tareila Diana.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Refuses to acquit, discharge him, strikes out 8 other counts, to rule on bail application May 18\n\n\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nJustice Binta Nyako of a Federal High Court, Abuja yesterday ordered the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu to stand trial on only seven of the 15-count alleged terrorism charges against him.\n\nJustice Nyako made the order while ruling on Kanu\u2019s application to quash the charge preferred against him by the federal government.The application, premised on 34 grounds and supported by a 36-paragraph affidavit, also sought an order to acquit and discharge Kanu.Delivering ruling in the application, Justice Nyako struck out eight of the 15-count charges because the prosecution failed to disclose any form of offence alleged to have been committed by the defendant.\n\nThe judge ruled: \u201cIn this instant preliminary objection application, I have read the counts and come to the conclusion that counts 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 14 have not disclosed any offence against the defendant. \u201cCounts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 15 show some allegations, which the defendant has to answer.\u201cThe court shall proceed to try the defendant on those counts.\u201dBy the ruling, Kanu would now stand trial on counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 15, which the court believes he needs to respond to. Meanwhile, the court has fixed May 18 to deliver ruling in Kanu\u2019s application for bail.The court fixed the date after listening to arguments for and against granting the application.\n\nKanu\u2019s lead counsel, Chief Mike Ozekhome, SAN, in moving the bail application said: \u201cUntil a person is tried and convicted, he should be allowed to walk free.\u201dHe reminded the court that a defendant ought to enjoy the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.\n\n\u201cI humbly urge my lord to use your discretion to grant him bail subject to my lord\u2019s condition,\u201d he said.\u201cYou can limit him to stay in my house and I will not allow him to move around,\u201d the lawyer added jokingly.Responding, prosecution counsel, Mr. Shuaibu Labaran, prayed the court to refuse the application, adding that Kanu had allegedly violated the earlier bail granted him.\n\n\u201cMy lord granted him bail in 2017 on health grounds, but since then until date, no medical record was submitted to the court until he jumped bail,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat we should be saying is contempt of court because he has flagrantly violated the orders of the court.\u201dHe urged the judge to be guided by her discretion vis-a-vis the circumstances of the case \u201cand in the alternative, order accelerated hearing on this matter so that the defendant can know his fate one way or the other.\n\n\u201dIn a short ruling, the judge announced May 18 to deliver the ruling on the bail application.The IPOB leader was arraigned last year on an amended criminal charge, shortly after he was arrested and repatriated to Nigeria.He had fled the country in 2017 after soldiers invaded his family house in Abia State and was reported to have committed most of the alleged offences from his hideout somewhere in the United Kingdom.\n\nAfter he was repatriated and arraigned, he pleaded not guilty to the 15-count amended charges bordering on alleged treasonable felony and asked the court to quash the charges for being defective and baseless, adding that the court lacked the jurisdiction to try him based on those charges.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Emefiele: InfraCo to Unlock N8 trillion Pension Funds\u2019 Assets for Deployment to Bankable Infrastructure Projects Across Nigeria",
          "text": "\n\n*Signs terms sheet with four asset managers\n\nNume Ekeghe\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Mr. Godwin Emefiele yesterday announced that the Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria (InfraCo) would unlock N8 trillion of pension funds\u2019 assets to be deployed into bankable infrastructure projects across Nigeria. Emefiele also announced the appointment of Mr. Lazarus Angbazo as Chief Executive Officer of InfraCo and signed terms agreement with four Infrastructure Asset Managers \u2013 the AAA Consortium, Chapel Hill Denham, Africa Infrastructure Investment Managers and Sanlam Infra works.\n\nInfracorp is being promoted by the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) and the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority, with KPMG as transaction advisers. Also, with their Legal Advisers \u2013 Kenna Partners, Olaniwun Ajayi, and Ukiri and Lijadu \u2013 they are to deliver InfraCo as a catalyst to accelerate public-private solutions for infrastructure in Nigeria, with initial capital raising of N15 trillion. At a press briefing in Lagos yesterday, Emefiele said:\n\n\u201cWe have done our scoping, we believe that a substantial portion of the N15 trillion is available locally. There is a lot of liquidity today not just in the banking industry; there is a lot of liquidity that is currently held by our pension funds managers. I understand from the last count that the size of Nigeria pension fund is over N13 trillion. I am told that in another three to five years, Nigerian pension assets would rise to almost N20 trillion to N25 trillion.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of local capital and liquidity in Nigeria and what we would like to say is that we would begin by talking to people, the institutions that have this liquidity to come in and take up this kind of debt and that is why I am trying to say that out of the N14 trillion that will be debt, we imagine that on looking at it on a straight line, we should be looking at N8- N9 trillion available say within the Nigerian banking industry and the pension fund administrators.\n\n\u201cAnd of course, naturally the rest will be raised through foreign debt like Eurobond and the rest of them. So, yes, there will be Eurobond, but because we are moving very quickly, very fast, we will be looking at more in Nigeria.\u201cSo, let\u2019s not forget these are projects from viability stand points and that they will be generating Naira revenue. Most of the roads will be carrying the traffic cam, they will be tolled but we will try as much as possible to ensure that the tolls are not too high and become so burdensome on the road users.\n\n\u201cThe important thing I think is we must begin to come to a realisation that for us to have good infrastructure, for us to have good roads, we will need to make them commercially viable and that means we have to really pay for them.\u201dFurther speaking on how InfraCo would be financed, Emefiele said the first phase of this financing is to raise N14 trillion debt plus N1 trillion equity which is being contributed by the CBN, AFC and NSIA. He added: \u201cUpon signing the terms sheet today, we will go straight into execution mode because Nigeria very badly needs to develop its infrastructure.\n\nThere is infrastructure deficit in the public sector, there is infrastructure deficit in the private sector and we would like to see that we played our part at this time to support the efforts of not just the government but also the private sector in doing whatever can be done to develop infrastructure in Nigeria. \u201cWe are determined to do this because we all travel to different parts of the world and we see state of the development of their infrastructure and indeed most of the developing countries that we like to compare ourselves with also have some sort of our type of InfraCo and that is why they have moved very aggressively in developing infrastructure in those countries.\n\nWe are determined to see to it that from today InfraCo is open for business.\u201cFrom today we are unveiling InfraCo to Nigeria and because we are sure, we are confident that the funding of N15 trillion is available.\u201cIn other countries where infrastructure corporations have worked, pension funds have been used to develop the infrastructure of those countries.\n\n\u201cEmerging market economies have used private sector funds coming from either pension fund managers or the banking industry to set an example that we here in Nigeria stand ready to support infrastructure development, to support the government in the development of Nigeria infrastructure, and that is our solemn pledge today that we will.\n\nI am so sure that with the gap in the Nigerian infrastructure, this is the first tranche and I believe it will soon very quickly be used up and we can now go to a phase two and phase three.\u201cNigeria as the biggest economy in Africa and a country with the largest population in Africa truly deserves that at this time. Its infrastructure must be top notch so as to continue to encourage investors both locally and foreign to have confidence to come and do business in Nigeria.\u201dOn his part, Angbazo said:\n\n\u201cThe specific mission of InfraCo is to harness opportunities for infrastructure development in Nigeria by originating, structuring, executing and managing end-to-end bankable projects. These projects would be managed privately by asset managers that are private entities and they would do this in partnership with public and private sector participants to provide long and attractive investment returns required not just in terms of financial returns but also in terms of social impact.\u201d\u201cInfraCo is a dedicated vehicle to unlock and enable development of infrastructure.\n\nIt is a catalyst to unlock private capital by leveraging local and international pools of capital and finally it is an enabler for economic growth and development by driving local capacity building, inclusive growth and development with impact.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

We demand that the President of Humanists Association of Nigeria be set free and reunited with his family.\n\n\u201cMr Mubarak Bala has languished under illegal detention for two years despite court orders for his immediate release. During this period, the Islamic community, which apparently controls the government and social structures of the state have made significant threat and intimidation to compel him to admit guilt when it is apparent to all that he is innocent.\n\n\u201cMr Bala is a chemical engineer, husband and father, and whose travails began in 2014 when he announced on his Facebook page that he is no longer a Muslim, but an atheist. He should not have done that? He should have respected the sensitive nature of his community? Apparently, this public declaration saved him from being tried in a Sharia court. It also saved him from living a life of pretence as every Muslim is expected to observe the compulsory daily rituals that define Islam.\n\n\u201cHe was no longer obliged to pray five times daily and to fast during Ramadan. But the religious community wouldn\u2019t have it. His immediate family were the first to strike. He was accused of being insane and forcefully admitted into a mental institution for 18 days. During this period he was given medications to \u2018correct\u2019 his alleged mental defects until the atheist community in Nigeria was able to secure his release. From then onwards, he became a marked man. He received death threats regularly from members of his former faith. Before his deconversion, he was a pious Muslim who attended the Saudi funded Islamic Foundation, Aliyu Bin Abi Talib primary school. He was trained in the Wahhabi Islamic thought, with a jihad ideology and later attended an all-Muslim private science secondary school, Hassan I. Gwarzo, in Kano State, where Islamic (Qur'anic) study is given a very high priority.\n\n\u201cMr Bala was arrested again in April 2020 for making posts on Facebook against Islam. Despite court orders to release him on bail, the police authorities ensured that he was kept behind bars for two years in Kano. On April 5th 2022, against the advice of his lawyers, he pleaded guilty to the charges of making inciting statements on his Facebook page and the judge immediately passed a 24 years sentence. It is worthy to note that these posts were not taken down by Facebook for breach of community standards or hate speech, nor was the claim proven in court. Mr Bala pleaded guilty because he might have suffered a mental meltdown and wanted to end the charade by giving in to the pressure from the kangaroo court.\n\n\u201cAs a community for atheists, it is sad to announce that a large number of atheists and humanists living in northern Nigeria (officially regarded as religious minorities) constantly face human rights violations. Despite their using anonymous identities online, we keep seeing fanatics making death threats.\n\n\u201cMr Bala is a good man who tried to do something about the rise in fanatical adherents to the Islamic faith with literal and destructive interpretations of a 9th-century religious text. But it is apparent that he cannot fight alone. He needs everyone with empathy and conscience to join this fight for a better world. We can begin by being united in the demand for his freedom.\u201d",

Gwarzo, in Kano State, where Islamic (Qur'anic) study is given a very high priority.\n\n\u201cMr Bala was arrested again in April 2020 for making posts on Facebook against Islam. Despite court orders to release him on bail, the police authorities ensured that he was kept behind bars for two years in Kano. On April 5th 2022, against the advice of his lawyers, he pleaded guilty to the charges of making inciting statements on his Facebook page and the judge immediately passed a 24 years sentence. It is worthy to note that these posts were not taken down by Facebook for breach of community standards or hate speech, nor was the claim proven in court. Mr Bala pleaded guilty because he might have suffered a mental meltdown and wanted to end the charade by giving in to the pressure from the kangaroo court.\n\n\u201cAs a community for atheists, it is sad to announce that a large number of atheists and humanists living in northern Nigeria (officially regarded as religious minorities) constantly face human rights violations. Despite their using anonymous identities online, we keep seeing fanatics making death threats.\n\n\u201cMr Bala is a good man who tried to do something about the rise in fanatical adherents to the Islamic faith with literal and destructive interpretations of a 9th-century religious text. But it is apparent that he cannot fight alone. He needs everyone with empathy and conscience to join this fight for a better world. We can begin by being united in the demand for his freedom.\u201d",

That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time.

          "title": "Can Hytch succeed where GoMyWay failed?",
          "text": "At the end of October 2018, the Nigerian ride-sharing platform GoMyWay ceased to exist after operating for about 4 years. According to a statement by the company\u2019s CEO Damilola Teidi, this was due to a lack of follow-on funding, as its investors had decided not to continue backing the company.\n\nIt was a surprising event, owing to the promise of the business at launch. Within its first month of launch, it announced that it would quickly expand into Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa. A pan-African expansion within launch month is unusual, but the calibre of investors\u2014Konga founder and CEO Sim Shagaya, and Co-Creation Hub (CcHub) and former Amazon and Naspers executive Bill Paladino\u2014on the startup\u2019s capital table somewhat made the possibility considerable. Though the expansion didn\u2019t eventually happen, the prospect of it happening, however, was an indication that the business was meeting its projection.\n\nIt\u2019s now 4 years since anybody last used GoMyWay, and another startup is ready to take up the challenge of scaling digital vehicle-pooling in Nigeria. Founded by Laolu Onifade, Hytch Africa was launched to the public last month\u2014after months of public building and teasing its internet community with product videos and pictures\u2014to help people share rides and move faster and cheaper.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLike GoMyWay, Hytch has also begun to ramp up users. The company announced, on its social media platforms, that it had acquired 600 users in just 3 days, with zero spend on marketing. Its CEO also tweeted that they are looking to get 2,000 users by the end of the second quarter.\n\nGoMyWay, before it went into oblivion, had said it had over 12,000 users and had completed 106,630 rides across 16 states in Nigeria. But how the 2 startups acquired users is different. While the defunct company ran free services, accompanied by giveaways, like offering car owners one month\u2019s supply of fuel, Onifade told TechCabal that Hytch hasn\u2019t spent a kobo on user acquisition.\n\nBusiness model is king\n\nGoMyWay had traction but wasn\u2019t making money. According to Teidi\u2019s statement, the plan by its shareholders and investors was to run a free service for a year or 2, then focus on growing the user base. So, there was traction with zero revenue and no way to monetise the business.\n\nFor Hytch, the opposite is the case as they want to make money as they go, and are already doing so. \u201cWe are already making money. We charge 15% on every ride and, since launch, we\u2019ve recorded an average of 25 rides daily,\u201d Onifade told TechCabal.\n\nLaolu Onifade, founder and CEO at Hytch\n\nHytch operates a cashless payment method and it provides an inbuilt wallet for both drivers and riders, and riders are automatically debited at the end of every trip they take.\n\nGoMyWay and others\u2014like Jekalo and Ridebliss, 2 other local carpooling services that\u2019ve since failed\u2014are great learning references for Hytch. Hytch, in a bid to capture the vehicle-pooling market, allows not just carpooling, but bus-pooling; buses can pick up people going their way. This means that public bus owners can also use the platform to get riders daily.\n\n\u201cHytch is not just for private car owners; there is a bus-pooling option as well,\u201d Onifade said.\n\nRide-sharing is essential\n\nVehicle-pooling is not new to people: globally, it\u2019s one common way for people to move from one place to another, hitching rides with an unknown driver at random locations or bus stops. What if this same experience can be digitised?\n\nThis is the question companies like Hytch are answering.\n\nDifferent ride-hailing companies are currently trying to incorporate ride-sharing into their product. Last year, Uber in Kenya was reported to be testing Pool Chance, a feature that lets riders heading in the same direction share the cost of the journey. They have plans to roll out the service to Ghana and Nigeria. The company first introduced the service to its San Francisco market, and it was reported to be a success until the pandemic forced its pause.\n\nAnother disturbing factor is that the ride-hailing sector\u2014even though it\u2019s not the most-funded tech sector\u2014requires a lot of capital to scale. At least that\u2019s what the top companies have done and made the world believe is best practice: burn heavy cash to acquire users. Bolt recently raised $607 million in a Series F round; Uber raised a total of $25.2 billion over 33 rounds before it IPOed in 2019; and even French BlaBlaCar, which is primarily doing the same thing as Hytch, has raised more than $443 million in venture capital since its founding in 2006 (its recent funding of $115 million came in April last year).\n\nFor now, it looks like the company has learnt a great deal from the defunct startups in the sector and may be well on its way to success. But it\u2019s too early to say.\n\nOnifade believes that his company has the skill and drive to build the product and a business model that works but do they have the money needed to fully build? Per investment, the CEO said they have raised a family-and-friends\u2019 round and are currently raising pre-seed.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Everyone is encouraged to wear teal \u2013 a dark greenish-blue colour \u2013 to support the nationwide effort to raise counsellor awareness and promote mental health.\n\nWhile we are not in the US, I believe now is an excellent time to sensitise you on the importance of counselling.\n\nSo, what is counselling? Counselling \u2013 also known as therapy \u2013 is a therapeutic approach that focuses on a client\u2019s emotional and intellectual experience: how they feel and what they think about the issue for which they have sought help.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, there is a widespread misconception that therapy is only for people who have been diagnosed with a mental illness. This is wrong; people seek therapy for various reasons, including discussing their lives and emotional upheavals, resolving conflicts, healing from trauma, and having a safe space to talk with someone who is not a part of their personal life.\n\nCounselling can offer immediate solutions and support. It\u2019s a collaborative effort between the client and the counsellor to clarify issues, explore options, develop strategies, and raise self-awareness.\n\nMost importantly, it isn\u2019t a waste of time because talking about your problem helps you feel better. So, why not give therapy a shot? While you\u2019re thinking about it, here\u2019s what I\u2019ll be discussing today:\n\nNIN-SIM linkage deadline extension\n\nImaliPay\u2019s $3 million seed\n\nFolklore Group\u2019s shift to B2B\n\nUnrelated, but an update is needed. Help Techpoint Africa determine how much African tech workers earn by filling out this form.\n\nIs the NIN-SIM linkage deadline extension really over?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat appeared to be an order that would never be carried out due to its deadline extension is now in effect. That came unexpectedly!\n\nWhat is the gist? On Monday, April 4, 2022, the Nigerian federal government barred all outgoing calls from all Subscriber Identity Modules (SIM) cards not linked to the National Identification Number (NIN) of the telecom subscriber.\n\nFollowing the continuous extension of deadlines, one might have concluded that the government wasn\u2019t serious about the NIN-SIM linkage. To put things in perspective, the deadline has been extended NINE times.\n\nThe initial January 19, 2021 deadline was pushed back to February 9, April 6, May 6, June 30, July 26, October 31, December 31, and finally, March 31, 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer the minister, the March 31, 2022 extension was granted in response to requests from stakeholders, including citizens, legal residents, and Nigerians in the diaspora. He also revealed that 71 million Nigerians had obtained their NIN, with an average of three to four SIMs per NIN.\n\nAs the famous phrase goes, \u201ceverything that has a beginning has an ending.\u201d I think we might have come to the end of the SIM-NIN-linkage deadline extension. B-but could this really be it?\n\nI mean, won\u2019t some stakeholders and Nigerians in the diaspora file an appeal, given that only 125 million subscribers had their NINs submitted for immediate linkage, verification, and authentication when the order was issued?\n\nMoreover, as of February 2022, Nigeria had 197,768,482 active mobile subscribers across all networks, according to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), the telecoms industry regulator.\n\nGiven that a single subscriber has more than two lines registered to their name, it appears that approximately 37 million telecom subscribers across networks have been affected.\n\nInterestingly, yesterday, April 7, 2022, at the National Identification Management Commission\u2019s (NIMC) headquarters in Alausa, Lagos State, a crowd gathered at the gate, with issues ranging from enrolment to validation to corrections of an error on their NIN slip. Nonetheless, it appears that a larger number were there to register for their NINs.\n\nTechpoint Africa went on a short trip to confirm the situation but encountered some unpleasant scenes. For an in-depth look at the drama, please read here: NIN-SIM linkage: Worrying scenes at NIMC office, as the Nigerian government directs telcos to block defaulting subscribers\n\nImaliPay\u2019s $3 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to careers, most countries consider full-time work to be the norm. And if you don\u2019t have a 9-5, in some cases, you aren\u2019t regarded as employed and unlikely to be treated with respect. Also, if you appear younger than your age \u2013 as I do \u2013 know that you\u2019re just another adolescent on the street.\n\nAs an example, last year, a 200-level medical student approached me. To them, I was just another student in class 9 (JSS3). This might surprise you, but I get things like that or related to it, and they can be amusing or humiliating.\n\n2020 heralded a new era where the world transitioned to remote work, with COVID-19 leading to an increase in informal employment through digital platforms and innovation, thereby boosting the gig economy.\n\nConsequently, the gig economy in Africa has grown significantly, serving as a temporary measure for consumers when businesses closed during the lockdowns and providing employment for those who are excluded from formal and even informal opportunities.\n\nFor context on the gig economy in Africa, please, read: The gig economy is a big boost, but still a different story in Africa\n\nWhile the gig economy is growing, per research, gig workers in Africa do not have access to certain financial services. And ImaliPay, a \u201cone-stop-shop financial services platform,\u201d claims it addresses this issue.\n\nFounded in late 2020 by Tatenda Furusa and Oluwasanmi Akinmusire, the platform which provides financial services to ride-hailing companies to drive productivity has announced that it has raised a $3 million seed round in debt and equity.\n\nImaliPay, which is already present in Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa, will use the funds to expand its 50-person team, improve its technology, and expand into new markets such as Ghana and Egypt.\n\nFolklore Group\u2019s shift to B2B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing The Folklore Group\u2019s $1.7 million pre-seed announcement yesterday, Thursday, April 7, 2022, the company also revealedf a shift from business-to-consumer (B2C) to business-to-business (B2B) wholesale.\n\nDo you know what B2B and B2C are? If you don\u2019t, please, read this: B2B vs B2C Ecommerce: What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nThe funding round was led by Slauson & Co., a Los Angeles-based Venture Capital firm focused on early-stage technology investments, with participation from the Fearless Fund and other notable Black angel investors, including WNBA star Nneka Ogwumike.\n\nFounded by Amira Rasool (CEO) in 2018, the e-commerce company previously sourced, shipped, and did last-mile delivery to customers in 20 countries, including the US. However, that didn\u2019t allow it to grow quickly enough.\n\nWhat changed? A surge in demand for the fashion and lifestyle items the company sold accelerated the startup\u2019s transition to B2B wholesale. Now called Folklore Connect, the company will connect luxury fashion brands in emerging markets with bulk retailers in North America and, later, Europe.\n\nThe company is also launching a new marketplace for fashion brands or platforms to become affiliate partners and The Folklore Edit, an online media site that will feature fashion stories.\n\nThe CEO claims that the Folklore Group is opening up new markets for luxury and emerging brands from Africa and worldwide while also meeting the growing demand from retailers who value diversity and inclusion.\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\neLimu (CcHub) is hiring a mid-level Game Developer.

          "title": "NIN-SIM linkage: Worrying scenes at NIMC office, as Nigerian telcos block defaulting subscribers",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, April 4, 2022, after nine deadline extensions, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Government directed all telcos to block Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) cards that have not been linked National Identity Numbers (NIN) from making outgoing calls. A decision that seems to have spurred Nigerians into action.\n\nAt the National Identification Management Commission\u2019s (NIMC) headquarters, Alausa, Lagos State, today, April 7, 2022, a crowd gathered at the gate, with problems ranging from enrolment to validation to corrections of an error on their NIN slip. However, it appears that a larger number were there to enrol for their NINs.\n\nIn December 2020, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) ordered all mobile subscribers to link their NINs to their SIM cards. People without NINs were to quickly register or risk being blocked by December 30, 2021.\n\nA decision that seemed questionable, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you have your NIN, linking your SIM to your NIN is relatively seamless and can be done by dialling a code specific to your telecom provider or by calling customer care.\n\nHowever, going by the unhappy crowd at NIMC\u2019s office, the prospect of a NIN-SIM linkage could still be a long way off for some people.\n\nTechpoint Africa embarked on a little trip to confirm the situation but met with some unpleasant scenes.\n\nMembers of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) were on the ground to disperse the crowd. It took over 45 minutes to make it across the gate, even when we had an ID card with PRESS boldly written on it.\n\nUsing forceful methods for crowd control, the Civil Defence Corps flogged Nigerians in the crowd. Sadly, our Senior Reporter, Oluwanifemi Kolawole, also received a few strokes and a shove on the chest from the trigger-happy corps member.\n\nWhips and batons are used in riots and other violent situations. However, for a civil action like registering for a national identity, we find it worrying that whips, and not more humane solutions, are the preferred method for crowd control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn NSCDC member using a whip on Techpoint journalist\n\nUnnecessary NIN-SIM linkage crowds\n\nA lady at the scene confirmed that her SIM had been banned from making calls. While she could receive calls and use the Internet, she has been unable to make any calls since Monday.\n\nAccording to another lady, she has been coming to the NIMC office since the directive was given on Monday and has not been able to move past the gate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSince Monday, there has been a crowd here. I\u2019ve been coming since Monday.\u201d\n\nA glance at the NIMC website reveals that these crowds and the ensuing whipping by Civil Defense staff could have been significantly avoided.\n\nInterestingly, one of our reporters, who had two of his SIMs blocked was able to quickly remedy this after dialing the respective NIN-SIM linkage codes for both service providers. One of his network providers is yet to block him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the NIMC compound. Some of these people have been here since Monday\n\nFrom the lady\u2019s explanation, she went to an agent enterprise to enrol for her NIN, had received her NIN, and linked it to her SIM. However, she has not been able to make calls since Monday.\n\n\u201cIf you want to use money and to do it in another place, when you bring it, they will say that one is fake,\u201d she said.\n\nNIMC licenses these agents to serve as registration centres for enrolment and retrieval, among other things.\n\nHowever, going by the lady\u2019s story, even people who have registered and gotten their NIN are also affected.\n\nWe also noticed that people who lost their SIMs and had to retrieve them also faced the same predicament. Even though they had valid NINs already linked to the lost line.\n\nHow to validate your NIN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross-section of the crowd at the NIMC office\n\nPeople in the lady\u2019s predicament and those in the latter situation have to go through a separate process called validation.\n\nSpeaking to staff within the compound concerning validation, we could not glean much.\n\n\u201cYou come here and validate,\u201d the staff said.\n\nWhen asked if it was a new process, she answered in the affirmative. \u201cIt\u2019s better to validate immediately you register.\u201d\n\nApparently, the validation process is usually done along with enrolment, which some people might have skipped for some reasons (including going through backdoors?); having your NIN might not be enough as it may be inactive.\n\nYou can solve this problem using the NIMC app, but you have to make sure to use the number connected to your NIN as you would receive a one-time password.\n\nDear Applicants,\n\n\n\nFor NIN Validation:\n\n\n\n1. Download the NIMC Mobile App\n\n2. Insert your NIN on the App\n\n3. The mobile number tied to you would be shown on the screen pic.twitter.com/ha1gPJYTQZ \u2014 NIMC (@nimc_ng) March 25, 2022\n\nIntriguingly, even though telecom companies can enrol people for their NINs, people on the scene complained that their network providers had redirected them to NIMC.\n\nMeanwhile, we hope you can make do with the information provided above and in this article.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

Sani Abacha, when the Super Eagles Squad won the African Cup of Nations in Tunis, Tunisia, in 1994.\n\nFashola said it was an opportunity to remember the country\u2019s heroes, the valiant Super Eagles to whom the country made a promise of providing houses for winning the 1994 African Cup of Nations, which had remained unfulfilled.\n\n\u201cWe arrange with members who were beneficiaries to choose where they will be allocated and we anticipated that it is possible we give you allocation letters.\n\n\u201cWe decided that we will be handling over at the commissioning site so that there are no more gaps to fill. We promised this and we will want to make sure that it does not delay any further.\n\n\u201cSo you heard that Emanuel Amuneke and others have been given their own during the commissioning and so now this is what we are planning for you. Some of you were absent during the commissioning.\n\n\u201cSo we invited you here to come and collect your certificates so that you will have your documents and your keys will be presented to you.\n\n\u201cThe others in Uyo and few other states will get their own as planned. The beneficiaries will get their titled documents and the keys at the sites.\n\n\u201cWe planned that this will be done in a conducive environment so that there will be no more loopholes.\n\n\u201cAnd indeed, we found out that the name of Finidi George was not included and we told Mr President and I\u2019m sure that he will provide remedy for that.\u2019\u2019\n\nResponding, Peter Rufai, the Goal Keeper of the team, said he felt demoralised and pained for the number of years that they had to wait and hope that they would be given their houses.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, it was not easy thinking about it. I thank President Muhammadu Buhari for taking the bold step in making sure that we get this promise made to us 28 years ago.\n\n\u201cI also want to use this platform to show my appreciation to the Minister of Sports, Sunday Dare for the effort he put into this to ensure that today we are here to receive these houses.\n\n\u201cAgain to our minister of works, we say a big thank you to you; as you all know, some of our colleagues are not present to see this happen and their loved ones have come here to collect on their behalf.\n\n\u201cWith this any other upcoming child, sport men or women in any department of sports, be it football or athletics now has hope that whenever I am selected to represent Nigeria, I will give all my best and be rewarded.\n\n\u201cAnd I pray that this system continues so that we will see the beauty of our men and women, it doesn\u2019t matter your field and we will also be happy with our leaders.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe players presented with CoOs are Peter Rufai, Steven Elema, Isaac Semitoje, Sunday Oliseh represented by his brother Albert Oliseh,.\n\nOthers are Victor Ikpeba, Chief Anthony Okeleke, Uche Okafor represented by his daughter Tochukwu Okafor, Austine Egwuavon, the coach of the senior team.",

          "text": "By Adenike Ayodele/Ikeja\n\nA teenager has narrated to an Ikeja Domestic Violence and Sexual Offences Court how her 43-year-old biological father serially defiled her, in the name of the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe survivor, now aged 16, testified at her father\u2019s trial.\n\nShe was led in evidence by Lagos State counsel, Ms Bukola Okeowo.\n\nThe witness said that before the serial defilement began after her mother had relocated to South Africa.\n\nAccording to her, her mother relocated in 2014.\n\nShe said that her father had been having sex with her since she was 14 years.\n\nThe survivor said that her father told her that \u201cHoly Spirit\u201d instructed him to have sexual intercourse with her.\n\n\u201cI was 14 years\u2019 old when the incident happened. It started with him touching my body.\n\n\u201cWhen I noticed this, I moved away my body from him. I told my twin brother about it the following morning, but he did not believe me.\n\n\u201cThe next day, he had sex with me . I could not shout nor do anything because my father threatened me,\u201d the survivor told the court.\n\nShe testified that her father continued to defile her even after they relocated to Badore, Ajah, Lagos State.\n\n\u201cAt this point, it became an issue because he had sex with me almost every time on a bench.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a night he woke me up and told me that \u2018holy spirit\u2019 told him to have sex with me and when he realised I was not ready to submit myself, he forcefully had sex with me.\n\n\u201cThere was also a time my father had issues with his girlfriend. He woke me up and took me to the kitchen to have sex with me.\n\n\u201cI did not make any sound because he threatened to kill me \u2013 the reason I could not tell my mother.\u201d\n\nShe testified that her father later took her and her twin brother to his girlfriend\u2019s residence at Chevron area of Lekki, Lagos State, to live with her, adding that he still had sex with her (survivor) there.\n\nShe said that her father asked her to pack out of his girlfriend\u2019s house one midnight but she objected and neighbours waded in.\n\n\u201cI saw him at my back at midnight telling me to pack my things and leave the house that day.\n\n\u201cAs I was packing, I was scared he might have sex with me again; so, I locked the door from inside,\u201d she testified\n\nThe minor told the court that after interventions from the landlord and another old man, she opened the door.\n\n\u201cHe took my bag and dragged me out. It was from there I started shouting for help.\n\n\u201cSome youths in the neighbourhood came out and confronted him, asking him where he wanted to take me to at that time of the night.\n\n\u201cHe told them that I would not stay in that house again.\n\n\u201cIt was at that time I told the other old man that my father had been having sex with me.\u201d\n\nThe survivor said the old man called the estate chairman the following morning.\n\n\u201cThe man asked if I wanted to pursue the case and I told him, \u2018Yes.\u2019\n\nShe said that she also told her father\u2019s girlfriend about the alleged defilement in April 2021 and she connected with her mother on Facebook and informed her about the alleged crime.\n\nShe said that her father and mother communicated to each other once in a while and mostly ended up in a fight.\n\n\u201cThe case was later reported at Langbasa Police Station in Ajah. After that, it was transferred to the State Command.\n\nI later went to the Gender Section of the State Police Command and they took me to Mirabel Medical Centre where tests were carried out on me.\n\n\u201cI also went to the Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Agency (DSVRA) for counselling,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile responding to questions from defence counsel, Mr Buhari Momodu, the teenager testified that she was once defiled before her father had carnal knowledge of her.\n\nShe also said that she did not have any quarrel with her father.\n\n\u201cBut he said we were not peaceful; that was the reason he took us to his girlfriend\u2019s place.\n\n\u201cI saw my father as a role model before, because people respect him. He always prays; sometimes, he wakes us up at midnight to pray.\n\nAnother witness, Dr Oyedeji Alagbe, a forensic examiner at the Mirabel Centre, told the court that he carried out medical examinations on the survivor on June 28, 2021.\n\nHe said that his findings showed no fresh injuries on the vagina but showed that the survivor had repeated forceful vaginal penetration.\n\nJustice Ramon Oshodi adjourned the case until June 6 for continuation of trial.",

          "text": "Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Imran Khan has been ousted from power after losing a no-confidence vote in his leadership.\n\nThe vote was held past midnight after opposition parties brought a motion against him, which was upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nMr Khan had said he would not recognise an opposition government, claiming \u2013 without evidence \u2013 that there was a US-led conspiracy to remove him.\n\nThe assembly will now appoint a new prime minister.\n\nPakistan\u2019s parliament will meet to vote for the country\u2019s new leader on Monday.\n\nThat person will be able to hold power until October 2023, when the next election is due to be held.\n\nAyaz Sadiq, who is in charge of the national assembly while there are no ruling party members or designated speakers, said nomination papers for candidates should be filed by 11:00 local time (06:00 GMT) on Sunday.\n\nMr Khan becomes the first Pakistani prime minister to be ousted by a no-confidence vote.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that Mr Khan, 69, had acted unconstitutionally when he blocked the no-confidence vote and dissolved parliament.\n\nThis made several opposition members furious, with some accusing the prime minister of treason.\n\nMinutes before the vote started, the speaker of Pakistan\u2019s lower house of parliament \u2013 an ally of Mr Khan \u2013 announced his resignation. Members of Mr Khan\u2019s party (PTI) left the building, insisting he was the victim of an international conspiracy.\n\nOpposition parties were able to secure 174 votes in the 342-member house in support of the no-confidence motion, the house speaker said, making it a majority vote.\n\nIn a tweet, opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif said Pakistan and its parliament were \u201cfinally freed from a serious crisis\u201d.\n\nMr Sharif added: \u201cCongratulations to the Pakistani nation on a new dawn.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, PTI senator Faisal Javed Khan said the 69-year-old walked out of his prime ministerial residence \u201cgracefully and he didn\u2019t bow down\u201d.\n\nThe senator went on to say that Mr Khan had \u201clifted the entire nation\u201d.\n\nThe former captain of Pakistan\u2019s national cricket team was elected prime minister in 2018, and promised to fight corruption and fix the economy.\n\nBut those pledges have gone unmet with the country gripped by a financial crisis.\n\nIn late March a series of defections deprived him of his majority and left him fighting for his political career.\n\nThe BBC\u2019s Secunder Kermani says Mr Khan is widely regarded as having come to power with the help of Pakistan\u2019s army, but now observers say they have fallen out.\n\nMr Khan has repeatedly said that Pakistan\u2019s opposition parties are working with foreign powers. He also claims that he is the target of a US-led conspiracy to remove him because of his refusal to stand with Washington on issues against Russia and China.\n\nThe US has said there was \u201cno truth\u201d in these allegations, and Mr Khan has never provided any evidence.\n\nHe visited Moscow to meet President Vladimir Putin as Russia was launching the invasion of Ukraine and has previously criticised what the Bush administration called the war on terror.",

With in this period, I have also served as the Director-General of President (Muhammadu) Buhari\u2019s campaign organisation twice.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Soludo Swears In 20 Commissioners, Says Anambra People Expect Excellence\n\nThe minister believes his 23 years of service in various capacities have equipped him with great experience in governance and public service.\n\nHe added that the period has afforded him the opportunity to show compassion for the ordinary citizens of the country.\n\n\u201cAfter more than two decades in the public arena, I had wanted to go on a holiday and spend more time with my family before charting a new course outside politics, but at 56 \u2026 I am compelled by the urgency of our present challenges to place my experience and proven capacity at the service of the nation at the highest level,\u201d Amaechi said.\n\nSome of the party chieftains at the event include Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State and former APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole.\n\nOthers include the Minister of State for Transportation, Gbemisola Saraki, as well as former governors and lawmakers elected on the platform of the ruling party.\n\nWith his declaration, Amaechi is expected to vie for the APC presidential ticket alongside former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu; Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, and Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, among others at the party\u2019s primary.\n\nRead the full text of the minister\u2019s speech below:\n\nFellow Nigerians,\n\nI stand before you today to declare my intention and submit my application to serve as your next President. I did not come to this decision lightly. I have served our nation for the last seven years as Minister of Transportation.\n\nFor eight years before that, I served as Governor of Rivers State. In the preceding eight years before that, I was Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly. These 23 years of service have equipped me not only with great experience in governance and public service but also compassion for the ordinary citizens of our dear country.\n\nAfter more than two decades in the public arena, I had wanted to go on holiday and spend more time with my family before charting a new course outside politics. But at 58, and a member of the generation born after independence who has seen the good, the bad and the ugly of Nigeria, I am compelled by the urgency of our present challenges to place my experience and proven capacity at the service of the nation at the highest level.\n\nThose who know me can testify that I have always been a straight talker. This trait has not always made me popular, but I speak truth with conviction. So, allow me to speak the truth here today. We are facing some very serious challenges as a country. These are problems of insecurity, challenges of greater accountability in governance, youth unemployment and the scourge of spiralling poverty.\n\nThese problems are however not the exclusive preserve of Nigeria. We live in a troubled world. The reality we used to know has altered in nearly every nation. Climate change has brought about food scarcity in some places. Population explosion has produced unusual pressure on resources and supplies. Poverty has become a challenge all over the world, especially in the developing world.\n\nThe Covid crisis has placed unanticipated burdens on the budgets of nations and put pressure on available resources. Transborder crises have erupted in unusual places and placed the internal security of many nations under pressure. We are part of the Sahel, an area of the world that is subject to frequent terrorist attacks. Let us look at our current challenges as part and consequences of these global trends.\n\nI admit that Nigeria\u2019s problems did not begin today. And they will not be solved overnight. But they are not beyond the capacity of our people to solve. Fortunately, that process has already started. There is an ancient proverb that \u201ca society grows great when old men plant trees under whose shade they know they\u2019ll never sit.\u201d\n\nThe current administration under the able leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari has planted many such trees in Nigeria\u2019s future. We have invested billions in infrastructure, human capital development and made reforms that will pay off over time in terms of socio-economic growth and stability. We have invested heavily in projects and initiatives that will secure a brighter, better future for Nigeria.\n\nI am proud to have been part of this success story. It has been an honour overseeing the Ministry of Transportation in reviving the moribund railways and working tirelessly to create an integrated national transportation system that will positively impact our economy, trade, employment, business, and national cohesion. Have we achieved everything we set out to do? Off-course not. Could we have done more? Undoubtedly, there is always room for improvement.\n\nOn reflection, the notion of running for President would have been far beyond the imagination of the young lad running around the streets of Diobu or our small compound in Ubima. Not to talk of the young indigent student leader, mobilizing peers at the University of Port Harcourt. But my aspiration is not about fulfilling any personal ambition. I am contesting for office because I believe that it is my moral duty to give what I can in the service of my country.\n\nTo sustain and intensify present efforts at solving our national problems, our democracy must ensure the emergence of a leadership that is equipped with broad experience in governance to ensure stability and continuity. To sustain our democracy and preserve our unity, we need a steady hand and a passion for success in a nation that remains united to pursue prosperity for all Nigerians.\n\nIt is this combination of experience and patriotic passion that I bring to the table. I have been in the political arena for 23 years. I have served at every level of government \u2013 local, state, and federal. I have served both as a political appointee and an elected official. I have served both as an executive \u2013 as Governor of Rivers State and as a legislator \u2013 as Speaker of the State House of Assembly.\n\nIn these capacities, I did not just fill vacant posts. As a Speaker, I managed the legislative process in a difficult transition from military rule. As Governor, I defeated mercantile militancy and restored security. As a minister, I can modestly claim to have justified the trust of Nigerians.\n\nI do not come from a privileged background. I grew up poor. I understand how it feels to go without some meals in a day. I know the pain of lack and the agony of want. I know what it means to see your parents toil just to keep a roof over your family\u2019s head.\n\nI know what it is to feel the weight of expectation when you are are the only one in your family who enjoys the opportunity to attend university. Subsequently, I funded the education of my siblings to be university graduates as well. I know what it is to scrimp and save and struggle.\n\nIn spite of all odds, I have journeyed to this point. I could not have come this far without my parents, Fidelis, and Mary, who sacrificed so much for me. I could not have come this far without the support of my siblings. I could not have come this far without the mentors, friends, and sponsors who have believed in me.\n\nI could not have come this far without the precious wife of my youth and my best friend, Judith, and my children who mean everything to me. I could not have come this far without the support of Dr. Peter Odili and his wife. I could not have come this far without the support of Chief Rufus Ada-George. Neither could I have come this far without the support of President Muhammadu Buhari. Above all, I could not have come this far without the Grace of God.\n\nThe next leg of my political journey will be tough. But I am excited to go out and engage with Nigerians from every walk of life. I am ready to go from Maiduguri to Makurdi, from Sokoto to Sagbama, from Yola to Oyo, from Badagry to Birnin Kebbi. To each town and village, I will have one message: Hope is around the corner.\n\nI look forward to meeting you in your towns, villages, cities, campuses, and creeks. I want to hear your desires, needs and pains. I want to know what matters most to you. I want to listen and learn. I will be coming with one assurance: I will be welcome everywhere because the blood of every Nigerian flow in my veins. I shall be the president of all and every Nigerian.\n\nI believe that despite our cultural differences, we remain one people under God. We may speak different languages or worship in different ways, but we all want the same things \u2013 a better life for our children, the ability to support our families, the freedom to live in peace without fear for our lives or properties.\n\nI have never been the type who folds his arms and complains about inadequacies I see around me. I have always jumped in with both feet to do whatever I can to help, to try and bring relief to those suffering, to work to make things right where I see wrong. If you elect me as your President, I promise to play my part to the best of my ability. Every day I will rise and go to work for you. I will never forget the fact that I am there to serve you.\n\nToday, I stand as an aspirant to the position of President because of that same passion for people; that same drive for results. More than ever before, I am burning with the zeal to make a decisive difference in the lives of all Nigerians.\n\nNo matter the darts and arrows that come my way, I will remain steadfast because the stakes are too high. We cannot afford to fail. We cannot afford to veer off-course.\n\nI pledge my heart, mind and soul to the task of building a Nigeria in which every child can go to school, every young person can find work or support to start a business, every citizen can travel safely around the country and sleep at night knowing that law and order prevails and every Nigerian feels included, heard, and respected.\n\nThe road ahead will be long and arduous. But we go forward with faith.\n\nForward with courage.\n\nForward with compassion.\n\nForward with hope.\n\nForward with pride for who we are as a people and who we are yet to become.\n\nThe future is bright because of YOU.\n\nGod bless you and God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nCHIBUIKE ROTIMI AMAECHI",

Atletico also lost 1-0 to City in the first leg in Manchester last week.\n\nREAD ALSO: Chelsea Run Riot Against Southampton As Arsenal Fall To Brighton\n\nKarim Benzema, the hat-trick hero of Real Madrid\u2019s 3-1 win over Chelsea, started against Getafe but came off in the 74th minute, departing to a standing ovation which felt like the Santiago Bernabeu crowd paying tribute to his performance at Stamford Bridge.\n\nGareth Bale came on to make only his second La Liga appearance since August and his first at the Bernabeu since February 2020. Madrid had gone 20 home games in between without the Welshman, who was whistled by a section of disgruntled supporters.\n\nBale\u2019s latest misstep with the Real Madrid fans was to play, and score, for Wales at the end of last month, four days after pulling out of the Clasico defeat by Barcelona through injury.\n\nBale is likely to be back on the bench again for the visit of Chelsea on Tuesday and, despite another dynamic performance from Eduardo Camavinga, the rested Modric and Kroos will surely return to Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s midfield in midweek. Neither were even needed off the bench.\n\nReal Madrid\u2019s commanding lead in La Liga has afforded Ancelotti the luxury of rotation now around European games.\n\nBarcelona play at Levante on Sunday and have two games in hand but the Catalans are 15 points behind in third.\n\nAny hopes they had that the Clasico might send Madrid into a tail-spin have fizzled, Ancelotti\u2019s side instead responding with two wins in a row.\n\nBenzema had an early goal ruled out for offside but it did not take long for Madrid to break through Getafe, a sumptuous cross from the outside of Vinicius Junior\u2019s right foot finding Casemiro\u2019s head six yards out.\n\nVazquez\u2019s second came in the 68th minute, as he flicked the ball down the right-hand channel to Rodrygo and kept running, receiving the pass back from Rodrygo and guiding a finish into the far corner.\n\nAtletico suffer surprise loss\n\nAtletico Madrid\u2019s run-in could be less comfortable after they were dragged back into the fight for the top four following a surprise defeat by relegation battlers Mallorca.\n\nThe loss leaves Diego Simeone\u2019s side just a point in front of Real Betis in the table after Betis had earlier come from behind to beat Cadiz 2-1 thanks to a late penalty from Borja Iglesias.\n\nAnd at the other end of the table, Mallorca\u2019s victory gives them a major boost in their bid for survival as they climb out of the relegation zone, one point ahead of Cadiz, who slipped to 18th.\n\nA trip to the Balearic Islands between the two Manchester City games was always going to be awkward but even if a degree of fatigue or distraction played its part, Atletico were well below-par.\n\nThe result also raises questions over Simeone\u2019s decision to restore Luis Suarez to the starting line-up, even if Mallorca\u2019s goal actually came shortly after Suarez was replaced by the in-form Joao Felix.\n\nThe decisive moment came in the 68th minute, after Atletico\u2019s Reinildo Mandava kicked through the back of Mallorca\u2019s Pablo Maffeo from behind and just inside the area.\n\nVedat Muriqi tucked away the penalty and Atletico had no answer, managing just one shot on target after they failed to muster any against City.\n\nAFP",

(Anthony Hopkins, who won for his role in \u201cThe Father\u201d last year, handed the best actress statuette to \u201cThe Eyes of Tammy Faye\u201d star Jessica Chastain this year.)\n\nIn recent weeks, Smith, who won a best actor Oscar for \u201cKing Richard\u201d after he hit Rock, faced intense scrutiny over his behavior at the Dolby Theatre on March 27.\n\nIn a tearful acceptance speech, Smith apologized to the academy. He apologized to Rock in a statement the next day.\n\nIn the open letter, signed by academy president David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson, the organization thanked Rock for keeping his cool immediately after he was slapped.\n\n\u201cWe want to express our deep gratitude to Mr. Rock for maintaining his composure under extraordinary circumstances,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe also want to thank our hosts, nominees, presenters and winners for their poise and grace during our telecast.\u201d\n\nThe academy apologized for not taking steps to \u201cadequately address the situation in the room\u201d after the incident.\n\n\u201cFor this, we are sorry. This was an opportunity for us to set an example for our guests, viewers and our Academy family around the world, and we fell short \u2014 unprepared for the unprecedented,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe academy\u2019s standards of conduct rules are not tied to awards eligibility, a spokesperson for the group said, meaning that Smith could conceivably be nominated for his work in a film over the next decade and beyond. He next stars in the slavery-themed drama \u201cEmancipation,\u201d which Apple TV+ has said it plans to release sometime this year.\n\nIn \u201cKing Richard,\u201d Smith portrays Richard Williams, the ambitious father of tennis superstars Venus and Serena Williams.

          "text": "It emerged on Friday that six banks were fined N1.315 billion by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in the 2021 financial year for failing to comply with regulations prohibiting their customers from trading in cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn the latest revelation from the banks\u2019 full year 2021 financial report, First City Monument Bank (FCMB), Fidelity Bank Plc. and Wema Bank were fined a total of N514 million crypto infractions.\n\nThe FCMB was fined N400 million over its failure to close four accounts of customers said to be involved in cryptocurrency trading.\n\nFidelity Bank Plc. received a sanction of N14.28 million for cryptocurrency infractions, the bank said in its 2021 audited financial statement.\n\nWema Bank got a penalty of N100 million for contravening the CBN circular on cryptocurrency.\n\nIt also emerged earlier in the week that a N800 million penalty was imposed by the CBN on three banks \u2013 Access Bank Plc., Stanbic IBTC, and the United Bank for Africa Plc. \u2013 also for violating regulations barring customers from transacting in cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe UBA was fined N100 million for a customer\u2019s digital-currency transactions. Access Bank Plc. was fined N500 million for failing to shut down customers\u2019 crypto accounts, according to a filing with the Nigerian Exchange Limited.\n\nStanbic IBTC Bank was fined N200 million for two accounts allegedly used for crypto transactions.\n\nThe total penalties imposed so far for contravening the CBN circular on cryptocurrency is a massive N1.315 billion for the six banks.\n\nThe apex bank issued a circular on February 5, 2021, warning and reminding local financial institutions against conducting crypto transactions or enabling payments for crypto exchanges.\n\nIt directed financial institutions to close the accounts of anyone participating in or operating cryptocurrency exchanges immediately.\n\nThe CBN has ignored pushback against its crypto regulation and has advised Nigerians to adopt its CBDC, the eNaira.\n\nThe penalties are part of efforts by the apex bank to ensure that banks implement an order to block trading in cryptocurrencies due to the threat they pose to Nigeria\u2019s financial system.\n\nDespite these regulations, Nigeria accounts for the largest volume of cryptocurrency transactions outside the United States., according to Paxful, a Bitcoin marketplace.\n\nThe country also has the largest proportion of retail users conducting crypto transactions under $10,000, Chainalysis says.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Stanbic IBTC, Wole Adeniyi, during an investor conference call in Lagos last Tuesday confirmed that his bank was fined N200 million for two accounts alleged to have been used for crypto transactions.\n\nAdeniyi said that while Stanbic IBTC followed the apex bank\u2019s directive, the transactions it was sanctioned for might have passed through its system undetected.\n\nHe noted that the CBN was able to detect the relevant transactions using an \u201cadvanced capability\u201d that\n\nNigerian banks don\u2019t have access to, and they\u2019ve asked the apex bank to share the technology.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem that they are going to entertain a refund, but they are now sharing intelligence with us to be able to kind of deter clients,\u201d he added.\n\nBennett Oghifo",
