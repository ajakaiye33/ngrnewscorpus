Gen. Buba Marwa (retd) as his deputy.\n\nWriting under a coalition of Keke Marwa Coalition (consisting of several Commercial Keke Marwa Operators Associations), the group, in an open letter to the APC\u2019s presidential candidate in the 2023 election, said, \u201cMarwa is the choice of the common people.\u201d\n\nAccording to the letter signed by the Zonal FCT Chairman of the association Kabiru Usman Akula and the Secretary, Babangida Isa, the group acknowledged Marwa\u2019s contribution to creating livelihoods for millions of people through the tricycle transport system.\n\nThe letter reads: \u201cWe are members of a coalition of Commercial KEKE MARWA OPERATORS consisting of different Keke Marwa operators Associations.\n\n\u201cOur roots as Keke Marwa operators can be traced back to a leader of people with big vision and foresight for whom we voluntarily gather here today to write this letter.\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge the ingenious contribution of Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa to birthing the tricycle transportation system that has provided jobs for hundreds of thousands and sustained millions of households across the country.\n\n\u201cAs critical decisions are made in Nigeria in the days ahead, we wish to call on the APC presidential standard-bearer and candidate, His Excellency, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to consider and pick Gen. Buba Marwa as his running mate for the forthcoming presidential election.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the Tinubu -Marwa\u2019s ticket will naturally indicate and demonstrate capacity, competence and care for the people, and it will become the most popular team to beat.\n\n\u201cAlso, our associations and affiliates support the excellent work that Gen. Marwa is doing through the War Against Drug Abuse, and it is our considered view that such a leader with vast military experience could help the administration of Tinubu to fight terrorism, banditry and insecurity.\n\n\u201cWe are therefore calling on the APC presidential flag bearer Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to pick an experienced, widely accepted, and competent hand in the person of Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa, as his Vice, to helpIng the APC win the 2023 presidential election with a landslide.\n\n\u201cThe coalition wishes to appeal to all Nigerians of goodwill from the north and south to join the call for selecting Marwa as the Vice Presidential choice of the APC.\n\n\u201cWe wish to call on President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC Governors to assess, consider and adopt the Tinubu-Marwa option as the ticket that will rise above religious sentiment, the North-South divide and transform Nigeria,\u201d said the coalition.",

Alfred Adewale Martins has condemned in very strong terms the stoning and killing of Deborah Yakubu in Sokoto State by a mob of overzealous students for alleged blasphemy.\n\nHe also charged the law enforcement agencies to quickly swing into action to investigate the matter to identify the culprits and bring them to justice according to the Nigerian criminal law.\n\nHe said that the alleged killing of young Deborah Yakubu a female student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education is appalling, provocative, and inhuman.\n\nSuch acts, if not checked forthwith, he warned, are capable of further exacerbating religious tension, thereby causing disaffection amongst the peace-loving people of Nigeria.\n\nIn a release signed by the Director of Social Communications, Rev. Fr. Anthony Godonu, the Archbishop, while condoling with the family of the deceased student and the good people of Sokoto State and indeed all Nigerians of goodwill, also prayed for the repose of the soul of the deceased whose life was cut short in her prime.\n\n\u201cI feel very saddened by the callous manner Deborah Yakubu\u2019s life was cut short in her prime by a bloodthirsty jungle justice mob. It shows how little the value that some people place on human life. This act once again attests to the fact that much still needs to be done in this country for us to appreciate the fact that every human life is sacred and invaluable, something to be nurtured and never trivialized. When you murder a fellow human being on an allegation of blasphemy you have not only committed murder but have sown the seed of hatred, suspicion and triggered corresponding negative emotions that could snowball into a deep crisis.\n\nNo one has a right to arbitrarily shed human blood. It is not in our constitution; it is not in our customs or tradition. Such an act is archaic and reprehensible and should be expunged totally from our DNA. All those found culpable in this killing must be made to face the consequences and we must all ensure that justice is seen to be done.\u201d\n\nArchbishop Martins also called upon all Nigerians to be calm and to shun all acts of violence as we all await the action of the Security Agents in dealing with this heinous act of criminality irrespective of the motive behind it.",

          "title": "Tracking the gains, pains of de-risking agricultural financing The Nation Newspaper",
          "text": "With the vast majority of Nigerians living in the country\u2019s massive rural areas, agriculture can be a key driver of both human and economic development. However, farming is seen as a risky business, especially where small and medium-scale farmers often have to contend with risks and uncertainties related to financing, among other challenges. In this report, ASSISTANT EDITOR NDUKA CHIEJINA reviews efforts in the last 45 years to promote agricultural lending and insurance as a strategy to promote employment and higher levels of productivity\n\nFor 45 years, Nigeria has been grappling with how to solve one serious problem without creating another. For years, successive administrations have struggled to make access to finance easy for small and medium-scale farmers by de-risking rural agricultural finance or opening up access to credit in order to promote productivity; while at the same time assuring the banks that the credits they extend to farmers will not go down the drain.\n\nTo this end, many interventions were initiated by the government and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to make access to credit easier for farmers. However, the banks that were supposed to provide the credits were uncomfortable channelling credit to the farmers for several reasons. Top among the reasons was the risk and unpredictability that surrounds the practice of agriculture in Nigeria. Also, agricultural insurance was practically non-existent; so were the crisis of not having high-yielding seeds that are resistant to drought and negative vagaries of weather, weak debt recovery strategies and the mind-set of many farmers that bank loans are their share of the national cake and, as such, they did not factor in paying back the loans given to them by the banks.\n\nTo de-risk agriculture and make it attractive to the banks, the federal government and the CBN came up with two interventions. The Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund (ACGSF) and the Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL Plc) were conceived.\n\nThe Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund (ACGSF)\n\nThe Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund (ACGSF) was established by Decree No. 20 of 1977 to guarantee agricultural credit facilities granted to farmers. The Federal Government and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) both contribute to the fund in the ratio of 60 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively. The CBN doubles as the managing agent of the scheme and the secretariat of the ACGSF.\n\nThe scheme encourages deposit money banks and microfinance banks to lend to those engaged in agriculture by providing guarantee. It mitigates risks associated with banks\u2019 lending to agriculture by guaranteeing to pay banks 75 per cent of the net amount in default in accordance with the provisions of the enabling Act. The ACGSF Amendment Act was assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari on June 24, 2019. In the Amendment Act, new strategies were introduced to repackage and reposition the scheme for greater effectiveness and efficiency with the aim of positioning Nigeria to become a self\u2013sufficient food producer, creating millions of jobs, supplying key markets across the country and dampening the effects of exchange rate movements on local prices.\n\nUnder the new ACGSF Amendment Act 2019, the maximum for a non-collateralised loan has increased from N20,000.00 to N100,000.00 and the maximum for a collateralised loan rose from N10 million to N50 million. The ACGSF Amended Act 2019 ensured that agricultural value chain financing is now allowed under the scheme these includes; the financing of the production of farm machinery, implements and equipment for production, processing, storage and transportation as well as any purpose connected with activities within the agricultural value chain.\n\nSpeaking on the issue, Mr Stephen Okon, Chairman, Board of the ACGSF, said: \u201cThe Board in 2021 approved the increase of the interest drawback rebate for farmers and participants in the agricultural value chain from 40 per cent to 50 per cent to cushion the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase took effect from 1st January, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe ACGSF scheme has proved relatively successful in de-risking the agricultural sector in Nigeria as evidenced in the number of loans guaranteed from inception to date. A total of 1,232,326 loans, valued at N130.903 billion, were guaranteed from inception to May 2022 out of which 973,646 beneficiaries had repaid a total of N98.91 billion.\u201d\n\nNarrowing the guarantees to the state level, Okon noted that the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) from January to May 2022 has guaranteed a total of 82 loan beneficiaries under the scheme, valued at N22.580 million. This brought the total guaranteed loans in the FCT from inception of the scheme in 1978 to May 2022 to 14,258, valued at N1.748 billion. In terms of loan recovery, 11,726 loans, valued at N801.058 million, were repaid under the scheme in the FCT from the inception of the scheme. These records, Okon said, show the level of \u201cdetermination of the farmers to utilise the opportunities offered by the scheme to empower themselves and improve their lots.\u201d He urged participants in the agricultural value chain in the FCT to take advantage of the opportunities provided in the Amended Act.\n\nLack of collateral to secure the loans was identified as a major challenge, which the farmers and banks had worked around. However Okon noted that \u201cthe major challenge for the farmers was taken care of by the Central Bank through its credit register and de-risking of the loans thought its credit guarantee schemes. As a result, the scheme has recorded 85 to 90 per cent repayment success from the farmers.\n\nOgbu Onyeka Michael, Branch Controller, CBN, Abuja Branch, said the ACGSF is not only an important programme of the CBN, but the first development finance intervention scheme to be established by the bank. \u201cIn fact, the scheme heralded the birth of the Development Finance Department (DFD) of the Bank.\u201d The success achieved under the ACGSF, he said, \u201chas led to significant improvement in Deposit Money Banks\u2019 (DMB) lending to the agricultural sector and has led to remarkable growth in agri-business value chain in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL)\n\nLaunched in 2011 and incorporated in 2013, the CBN set up a $500million non-bank financial institution wholly-owned by it but operates with a private sector disposition to executing projects. That was how the Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL Plc) was born. NIRSAL was established and incorporated by the CBN to stimulate the flow of affordable finance and investment into the agricultural sector by de-risking the agribusiness finance value chain, fix agricultural value chains, build long-term capacity and institutionalising incentives for agricultural lending through five strategic pillars namely: risk-sharing, insurance, technical assistance, rating and incentives. Essentially, NIRSAL was created to deliver bespoke solutions to de-risking agriculture.\n\nIn 2018, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released a report that Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector received the highest allocation of private sector credit, around 22 per cent of the total credit. Second place was manufacturing with 14 per cent; while all other sectors received less than 10 per cent. Agriculture, which employed at the time around half of those working in Nigeria and contributed around a third of the country\u2019s GDP, received only three per cent of total bank credits.\n\nCommercial banks are set up purposely for profit-making. They are basically interested in short-term lending with high returns. Oil and gas companies fit perfectly into what the banks would like to do business with as they export crude oil and the import of its refined products \u2013 a short-term activity with high returns. Investment in agriculture, on the other hand, is a long tenured investment. It has a longer gestation period. Commercial banks don\u2019t want to tie down their facilities. Added to this is the lack of sophistication, proper book keeping, and collateral, all of which characterised small holder agricultural ventures across Nigeria. These inadequacies made financing agriculture unattractive to the banks.\n\nTo bring finance to the farmers NIRSAL Plc came in to act as a guarantor for commercial banks. It will stand as a guarantor that lending commercial banks will go to should \u2018something\u2019 go wrong with the facility extended to an agro-businesses. In discharging this important mandate of creating linkage between segments of Nigeria\u2019s agricultural value chain (AVC), NIRSAL has facilitated over N73billion into Nigeria\u2019s agro processing industry from inception till date. NIRSAL does not give credit facilities to farmers; it mobilises funds from sources, including deposit money banks, development finance institutions, private equity investment firms and other financial institutions to lend out to farmers.\n\nNIRSAL\u2019s credit risk guarantee (CRG) in agriculture value chain contributes immensely to boosting federal government\u2019s agricultural promotion drive. The CRG is the agency\u2019s core item for sharing agribusiness-related credit risks with commercial banks and financiers by up to 75 per cent depending on the segment that the CRG applicants operate in. The riskier the farmer group or agribusiness operations, the higher the percentage of risk NIRSAL shares.\n\nBy protecting financiers and investors from possible losses when they facilitate credit to agricultural business, NIRSAL has built up their confidence to lend to players in the sector, a sector once widely considered as a no-go area in finance circles. With NIRSAL CRG now in place, farmer groups and agribusinesses, which hitherto before advent of CRG had difficulty securing loan approvals from commercial banks, now enjoy smoother approval processes for the loans they require to expand their operations, increase their profits and enhance their livelihoods.\n\nAlso critical in the creation of NIRSAL CRG-backed loans is NIRSAL Plc\u2019s constant engagements with commercial banks and training of their officers. Over 4,250 bank officials have been trained on NIRSAL CRG guidelines and efficient agriculture lending, resulting in a better understanding of the two, an improvement of banks\u2019 disposition towards agriculture lending and an increase in bank lending. With the introduction of the NIRSAL Plc\u2019s CRG scheme, banks\u2019 lendings to agriculture have jumped from 1.4 per cent pre CRG to 5.4 per cent as of Q3 2021. As at the time of this report, NIRSAL\u2019s CRG portfolio now stands at N152,859,549,314.5\n\nSpeaking recently on NIRSAL\u2019s role as a credit guarantor, Managing Director/CEO Mr. Aliyu Abdulhameed, said that as a guarantor, its support positively impacts financiers, borrowers and the nation\u2019s economy. According to him, \u201cwhile financiers are now able to confidently invest in profitable agribusiness ventures, agribusinesses who borrow from them can improve productivity and profitability, all of which generate much-needed local economic activity.\u201d\n\nThe agency\u2019s finance facilitation efforts have generated around US$2.5 billion worth of economic activity through agricultural products/outputs and other value chain economic activities, created 360,000 direct jobs and positively impacted the lives of 1.8 million Nigerians. As a result of the success of NIRSAL\u2019s risk-sharing model, commercial banks have pledged a combined US$500 million to fund agriculture and agribusiness. Furthermore, NIRSAL has been approached by other African countries to provide support for the establishment and implementation of risk-sharing facility models in their respective jurisdictions.\n\nIn specific terms, NIRSAL issued 50 per cent Credit Risk Guarantee (CRG) and 20 per cent Interest Drawback (IDB) on respective loans of Gbagolo Integrated Farms Limited \u2013 a livestock producer and TOAJ Nigeria Limited a cocoa dealer. Leveraging on its CRG, NIRSAL facilitated the approval and disbursement of N81.8 million and N150 million from Union Bank Plc and Sterling Bank Plc respectively to Gbagolo and TOAJ. While Gbagolo Integrated Farms Limited will use its N81.8 million Term Loan to finance the purchase of 25,000 point of lay birds, 25,000 capacity battery cages and feeding compliments, TOAJ Nigeria Limited will channel its N150 million Export/Trade Finance facility towards the sourcing and purchase of cocoa for export.\n\nThe injection of these finances will create a positive knock-on effect for players along each segment of both value chains and the agribusinesses\u2019 host communities at large. Another element for de-risking agriculture is the provision of insurance coverage. Abdulhameed, at an event in Lagos, once disclosed that NIRSAL had provided insurance cover worth N6.5 billion to protect farmers in the country. He said NIRSAL had developed and launched the Area Yield Index Insurance product and protected over 37,399 farmers, with over N121 million paid out as compensation.\n\nIn another development, NIRSAL, in collaboration with the Royal Exchange General Insurance Company (REGIC), recently developed the Hybrid Multi-Peril Crop Indemnity-Index Insurance (HM-II).\n\nThe new product is designed to protect farmers from losses during a planting season caused by bad weather (low and high rainfall, early and late season dry spells, lightning, hailstorms and thunderstorms), pest outbreak, disease outbreak, fire outbreak and permanent disability or death of the farmer. A key advantage of the HM-II is that in cases where such risks happen, benefits paid out to the farmer would be up to the maximum loan or the insured amount after confirmation by advanced satellite technology, an assessment by an agriculture expert, or both.\n\nDespite these interventions to de-risk agricultural financing, many banks are still sceptical when it comes to lending to the sector. What this means is that the banks still consider agriculture to be a high risk venture to finance. The fears being exhibited by the banks are justified considering wide-ranging socio-economic/structural issues like insecurity in many parts of the country, inadequate infrastructure characterised by almost non-existent power, poor rural roads to facilitate the evacuation of farm products. Also, lack of sophistication, that is the adoption of modern technology to boost agriculture and poor booking methods, is bound to scare away the banks.\n\nHowever, NIRSAL and ACGSF appear determined to bridge the gap between farmers and finance to change the narrative from mere farming or agriculture to a full-scale commercial enterprise with all the trappings of a modern business enterprise.",

          "text": "A youth corps member, Orji Nkenna (29), and two INEC staffs, have been arrested for alleged Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) fraud.\n\nNkenna is attached to the INEC office in Osu, Atakunmosa West Local Government Area, and in charge of PVC distribution. It was gathered that two members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) gave Nkenna money in exchange for 38 PVCs.\n\nA security source said: \u201cOne of the electorate, whose PVC was among the 38, wanted to collect his card when he realised that someone had collected it as indicated in the register. He then reported to the police.\u201d\n\nPolice spokesperson Yemisi Opalola confirmed the development in a statement.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe have arrested a corps member, Orji Nkenna, and INEC supervisor Mrs. Makanjuola Bilahu (58) and Oluwatobi Ogini (32), to investigate the level of their involvement.\n\n\u201cNkenna, who is in charge of distributing PVCs, collected stolen PVCs on the order of one Wale Ojo and Ijamakinwa Olaoluwa, now at large, both of the PDP, for financial gain. Effort is ongoing to arrest the fleeing suspects.\u201d\n\nThe National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) said it has begun investigation into Nkenna\u2019s misconduct.\n\nA statement yesterday by the NYSC Director of Press and Public Relations, Eddy Megwa, reads: \u201cIt is rather unfortunate that corps member Orji Nkenna, who is one of the accused persons, could debase himself. We have also noted that the case is under investigation. If found guilty, the law should be invoked accordingly.\n\n\u201cThe NYSC hereby dissociates itself from such unpatriotic acts; we condemn it totally. The involvement of corps members in previous elections was borne out of their track record of impeccable performances in several previous national assignments, and we are proud of that.\n\n\u201cAll corps members are sensitised on their roles during elections, including the statutory sanctions if they violate the electoral laws.

          "text": "Activist-lawyer Femi Falana (SAN) has urged the courts to stop imposing politicians on Nigerians.\n\nHe said the involvement of the courts in the electoral process has not been favourable to the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nFalana said: \u201cThis involvement has been forced by the neglect of its duties by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the arbitrariness and impunity of some of the members of the Executive, and the corrupt activities of political parties.\u201d\n\nThe popular lawyer stated this in a paper, titled: The Role of the Courts in the Electoral Process and the Time Bomb of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022, which he delivered on Friday at the Law Week of the Ondo branch of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA).\n\nHe said: \u201cIn order to respect the democratic wishes of the electorate, there has to be a new electoral jurisprudence. Since the people are the greatest defenders of democracy, INEC must be made to ensure the votes of the electorate count.\u201d\n\nWhile perusing how the courts have influenced electoral processes, Falana said: \u201cThe courts have been involved in the appointment of party officers and endorsement of candidates sponsored by political parties to contest elections.\n\n\u201cEven the meetings of the organs and national conventions of political parties are fixed by the courts.\n\n\u201cCases arising from the management of political parties are filed in the high court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) or at the Federal High Court, outside the venue of the dispute.\n\n\u201cThe winners of primaries and general elections are no longer determined by the electorate but by the election petition tribunals and courts\u2026\u201d\n\nTo restore functional democratic norms in the polity, Falana listed some steps the various arms of government and other stakeholders should take. He said: \u201cThe INEC must own up to its constitutional responsibility and stop pushing their powers to the courts. The Judiciary must steer clear of the electoral process and allow the INEC to do its work accordingly. The courts must stop usurping the powers of the people to elect their leaders.\n\n\u201cThe courts must entertain only matters that are within their jurisdiction and not usurp those within the power of the INEC or those that concern parties\u2019 internal affairs. \u201cPolitical parties should abide by the provision of the Electoral Act and the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria pertaining to the conduct of elections. They should be able to reject aspirants that are violating the extant laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe call on the trade unions and other progressive people to mobilise the Nigerian people to defend democracy and socio-economic rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe phenomenon of conflicting court orders calls for an urgent review on the part of the NBA and the National Judicial Council (NJC).\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to point out that conflicting orders are not limited to the high courts alone, as some of the judgments of the appellate courts have put INEC officials in total confusion\u2026\n\n\u201cThere was an aspirant who did not participate in the governorship election in Rivers State but who was made the governor by the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cThere was another instance where the Supreme Court overruled the judgment of the Court of Appeal without jurisdiction in order to install a governor.\n\n\u201cAt the material time, all appeals arising from governorship elections terminated at the Court of Appeal in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo other governors who lost the 2019 governorship elections were installed as Governors by the Supreme Court. In declaring another candidate a governor the Justices of the Supreme Court not realise that the results computed by their Lordships showed surpassed the number of votes cast by the electorate.\n\n\u201cThe decision was so embarrassing that in his minority judgment the Honourable Justice Chima Centus Nweze concluded on a note of dire warning to the effect that: \u2018This decision of the Supreme Court will continue to haunt our electoral jurisprudence for a long time to come\u2019.\u201d\n\nBesides the courts, the activist-lawyer noted that other stakeholders contribute to the current state of affairs.\n\n\u201cThe increasing involvement of the courts in the electoral process cannot be blamed solely on judges. The INEC has contributed to the tribunalisation of democracy by abdicating its constitutional duties.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201c\u2026I was compelled to draw the attention of INEC to provisions of the Electoral Act 2022 and the Constitution that empower the INEC to reject the names of candidates who did not emerge from valid primaries.\n\n\u201cHowever, for reasons best known to INEC, electoral offenders have been allowed to manipulate and discredit the democratic process.\n\n\u201cSuch anti-democratic forces commit electoral offences which include fraudulent registration of voters, bribing of delegates and inducement of voters, bribing of party agents, bribing of electoral officers and law enforcement officers, fraudulent accreditation of voters, multiple thumb-printing of ballot papers, attack on voters by thugs, intimidation of voters.\n\n\u201cThe offence of corruption may be established against lawyers who allow themselves to be paid millions of dollars and billions of Naira as professional fees, if such payment is traced to the public treasury.\u201d\n\nTo restore functional democratic norms in the polity, Falana listed some steps the various arms of government and other stakeholders should take.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe INEC must own up to its constitutional responsibility and stop pushing their powers to the courts.\n\n\u201cThe Judiciary must steer clear of the electoral process and allow the INEC to do its work accordingly. The courts must stop usurping the powers of the people to elect their leaders.\n\n\u201cThe courts must entertain only matters that are within their jurisdiction and not usurp those within the power of the INEC or those that concern parties\u2019 internal affairs.\n\n\u201cPolitical parties should abide by the provision of the Electoral Act and the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria pertaining to the conduct of elections.

We are in charge of 22 states of the federation. We have the majority in the national and state Houses of Assembly. They are not going to betray him.\n\n\u201cEven in the Southeast, that has never been our (APC) stronghold, on the day of the election, we are going there to protect our mandate.\u201d\n\nOkechukwu argued that aside from the growing popularity of the APC flag bearer, he said all political appointees in the current administration who are party members would equally ensure victory for Asiwaju Tinubu.\n\nHe added: \u201cWhatever is my preference? If I want my office to remain, it means I must support Asiwaju. It\u2019s applicable to those who are board members, whether you are coming from Yenogoa or Dutse. So, that is the power of incumbency.\u201d\n\nAlso, a socio-political group, the Akoko Youths Patriotic Front (AYPF), has given reasons why Asiwaju Tinubu will win all votes in the four local government areas of Akoko land in Ondo State.\n\nIt said the ruling APC achieved a lot for the people of Akoko land through the senator representing Ondo North, Ajayi Boroffice.\n\nThe group noted that the construction of skills acquisition centres in Ikare, Ifon, Oka, Ikaram and Owo, has provided skills for self-reliability for hundreds of Akoko youths.\n\nAYPF President Segun Omojola, who spoke through a statement in Akure, the state capital, stressed that the people of the areas would reciprocate the APC empowerment of the residents with massive votes.\n\nOmojola said thousands of lives have also been saved through the construction of primary health centres in Oka, Irun and Arigidi.\n\nThe AYPF president said Boroffice\u2019s scholarship scheme for over 250 students would boost votes for the APC.\n\nHe said thousands of Akoko indigenes have been employed in the ceramic industry at Epinmi and the bio fuel ethanol plant in Ajowa.\n\nOmojola added: \u201cThe stepping down from the presidential race by Senator Boroffice for Asiwaju Tinubu was a brilliant step to moving our democracy forward.\n\n\u201cWe believe the victory of Asiwaju Tinubu at the primary will be carried onward to the general election. The entire Akoko youths are in support of Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s presidential race.

We are in charge of 22 states of the federation. We have the majority in the National and State Houses of Assembly \u2013 they are not going to betray him.\n\n\u201cEven in the South-East, that has never been our (APC) stronghold, on the day of the election, we are going there to protect our mandate.\u201d\n\nOkechukwu argued that aside from the growing popularity of the APC flag bearer, he said all political appointees of the present administration who are party members would equally ensure victory for Asiwaju Tinubu.\n\nAccording to the VON boss, \u201cWhatever is my preference, if I want my office to remain it means I must support Asiwaju, it\u2019s applicable to those who are board members whether you are coming from Yenogoa or Dutse so that is the power of incumbency.\u201d\n\nOn the opposition parties, Okechukwu dismissed the Labour Party candidate as no match and argued that the emergence of Atiku Abubakar as the PDP and Musa Kwankwaso as New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) candidates negate the convention of rotation system, adding that this would be their albatross.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t believe in rotation convention. For them, the agitation or the glue and the bound that rotation created since independence. When Tafawa-Balewa as Prime Minister, the president or governor-general was Nnamdi Azikiwe from the South. When Gowon became Head of State, Obafemi Awolowo was his deputy, the same thing with Murtala and Obasanjo. Obasanjo/Shehu Yar-Adua; Shagari/Ekwueme down the line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as if rotation is a new thing. So, for the PDP because of Atiku\u2019s muscle, they jettison the rotation of the presidency which was an injury to himself. Some of us in the south will forbid him because he touched on the ligament that is holding the country.\n\n\u201cThat is why we thank the northern governors because they recognised the import of that ligament. You may not take it seriously but if you know the sense of belonging it brings to the north and south you can\u2019t just dismiss it.\n\n\u201cSo APC obeyed it. Kwankwaso I know they were afraid of us. I don\u2019t want to name names. This rotation may not have its legal teeth but rotation is a convention. It has its moral angle. That\u2019s why the UK does not have a written constitution they live on conventions. Atiku will not know what he did to himself until the day the votes come.\n\nSo is also the way Kwankwaso is playing with us. The areas he will capture in the north, I know he is not going to give up and since he doesn\u2019t obey the convention, he will not nominate somebody to go with Peter and if Peter does not go strong north, we will be in CPC and ANPP in 2003 we had 12 million votes we didn\u2019t win the south.\n\nNobody can win in Nigeria if you can\u2019t have northern support. No northerner can win without a southern stronghold. Atiku has lost in the southern stronghold. That\u2019s why I\u2019m giving Tinubu about 60% chances.\u201d",

          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nAs the search for running mate to the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, enters a critical stage, governors and leaders of the party from the North West have kicked against the possible exclusion of the region.\n\nThis is despite the fact that the region occupies the number one position and had occupied several top positions in the country in the recent past.\n\nBoth incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari and late Umaru Yar\u2019adua elected president in 2007, hail from the North West state of Katsina.\n\nIn 2003 and 2011, Bello Masari and Aminu Tambuwal, were elected Speakers of the House of Representatives, both hail from the North West states of Katsina and Sokoto states respectively.\n\nAnd in 2010, following the death of Yar\u2019Adua, former President Goodluck Jonathan, picked Namadi Sambo, also from North West state of Kaduna as vice president.\n\nOn the other hand, the North Central and North East, the two other geo-political zones in the North have not enjoyed the same privileges since 1999.\n\nDaily Sun reliably gathered that Tinubu, a Muslim from the South West, has settled for a serving Muslim governor from the North East, as his running mate.\n\nAPC screens Tinubu, Amaechi, Umahi,... To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video APC screens Tinubu, Amaechi, Umahi, 9 others\n\nThe development, it was learnt, has not gone down well with North West governors and leaders, who are insisting on getting the coveted position.\n\nLast week, national vice chairman for North-West, Salihu Lukman, speaking on behalf of leaders from the region, boasted that they have contributed more than 39 per cent of votes recorded by the party during presidential elections in 2015 and 2019.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the zone resolved to aggregate its interests and vital concerns and engage accordingly with the presidential candidate of the party,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was learnt that Tinubu\u2019s inability to convince North West leaders to concede the position to the North East, has led to the delay in the announcement of his running mate.\n\nAn APC source told Daily Sun that series of meetings held between Tinubu\u2019s search team and Northern leaders all settled for a North East candidate. He, however, said the stakeholders had left the choice of picking his running mate to the presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cThe North West has the voting strength, they can roll out the drums for the APC. Bauchi, though in the North East, can swing votes for the APC because they gave votes to Buhari, twice,\u201d the source said.\n\nHe said leaders also urged Tinubu to pick a sitting governor, who is popular in the region and viewed as a liberal Muslim by the South.\n\nThough he declined to name the possible choice of Tinubu, he, however, said the governor is well-known within the media space in the country.\n\nSpeaking on a Muslim-Muslim ticket, which he claimed APC has settled for, he said: \u201cMost southerners, northern minorities see APC as a Muslim party. So, going for a Muslim-Muslim ticket in the APC is a matter of enlightened self-interest. Some APC governors stood for the South getting the APC ticket and it\u2019s payback time. It now comes to bringing out the votes.\u201d\n\nHe ruled out the chances of Plateau Governor, Simon Lalong, or Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, both Christians from the North East, for the position.\n\n\u201cYou take a Lalong, you take a Boss Mustapha and put them on the ballot, it\u2019s a zero for the APC in 2023. How do they convince their voters to vote if these people are on the ballot? Shettima sincerely wants to be Chief of Staff (CoS) and he wants Zulum to stay back in Borno because if Tinubu takes Zulum as his VP, Shettima\u2019s ambition is in jeopardy; he can\u2019t be CoS. The relationship between the Muslim North and the Christian minorities in the North is not cordial.\u201d\n\nAPC spokesman, Mr. Felix Morka, however, told Daily Sun on telephone that could not confirm if the presidential aspirant had settled for a running mate from the North East.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t confirm that. I can\u2019t deny it either.

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nSome stakeholders have begun a search for a replacement for the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Iyorchia Ayu, amidst rising tension over the face-off between supporters of Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, and leadership of the party, indications emerged, at the weekend.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that the anti-Ayu group, who are insisting he must be removed before the 2023 polls were looking towards the South East for replacement.\n\nMultiple sources alleged that the move is spear-headed by supporters of the Rivers State Governor, in th National Executive Committee (NEC), and leaders of the party, who voted for Wike as their preferred choice for the vice presidential candidate, at a panel set up by opposition to shop for a suitable running mate for former vice president, Atiku Abubakar.\n\nThe opposition party has been in crisis since the unveiling of Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as vice presidential candidate. The choice of Okowa has not gone down well with loyalists of the Rivers State governor.\n\nAccording to them, Wike ought to have been the vice presidential candidate, especially as 14 out 17 members of a special panel to shop for a running mate for Atiku reportedly voted in favour of the Rivers governor.\n\nThe aggrieved party leaders accused Ayu of bias in the processes leading to the emergence of both the PDP candidate and his running mate. Besides, the party chairman is also accused of running the party as a one man show.\n\nThe PDP chairman\u2019s case, it was gathered, is worsened by his recent face-off with his state governor, Samuel Ortom, over nomination of party candidates in the just-concluded primaries.\n\n2023: PDP panel tips Wike for vice ... To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video 2023: PDP panel tips Wike for vice presidential candidate\n\nDaily Sun gathered that the development has polarised different organs of the PDP, including the Governors\u2019 Forum and the National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nOn the one side are Wike, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Okezie Ikpeazu, Samuel Ortom and Seyi Makinde governors of Rivers, Enugu, Abia, Benue and Oyo states respectively; while on the other side are governors Okowa, Aminu Tambuwal, Darius Ishaku, Diri Douye, Udom Emmanuel, Godwin Obaseki and Ahmadu Fintiri of Delta, Sokoto, Taraba, Bayelsa, Akwa Ibom, Edo and Adamawa states. Though Bauchi Governor, Bala Mohammed enjoys good relationship with Wike, it could be immediately ascertained which side of the divide he belongs.\n\nSimilarly, Daily Sun gathered that members of the PDP NWC are split into two groups led by Ayu and the deputy national chairman (North) on the one hand and the Deputy National Chairman (South), Taofeek Alapaja, and National Secretary, Samuel Anyanwu, on the other hand.\n\nA party source told Daily Sun that the anti-Ayu group has vowed to stop at nothing to ensure he is removed.\n\nThe source said: \u201cThey have started looking for a replacement for the national chairman. And they are looking towards the South East, as a way of placating the zone, which is aggrieved that it has lost out in the party.\n\n\u201cMost of those who voted for Wike at that panel as their preferred vice presidential candidate are part of them. The NWC is equally split. Atiku may not want Ayu to go. But he will not come out to defend him.\u201d\n\nA source close to one of the governors told Daily Sun that it is only a matter of time, before the PDP chairman is sent packing.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cyou will remember that when Ayu became a national chairman, at a thanks giving that was held for him in Makurdi, the governors came and Wike told Ayu, Mr. National Chairman, you have come to the party at the time that the party needs to heal itself. But if you begin to do otherwise, me, I will \u2018shout o\u2019. He said it three times. I will not keep quiet. It is flowing from there, it is expected that when you are able to help someone, he should be dealing with you with a open hand.\u201d\n\nThe source also said: \u201cAyu went into the competition (nomination exercises) with a biased mind. He had a candidate in mind. And he worked against the very people that worked for him to be chairman. To make matters worse for Ayu; he was fighting Ortom over a House of Representatives seat.\u201d\n\nHowever, in his reaction, Ayu, who spoke through his Special Assistant on Communication and Strategy, Simon Imobo-Tswam, said the alleged plot to oust him is in the realm of rumour.\n\nImobo-Tswan told Daily Sun that the PDP chairman was neither biased in the nomination processes nor is he \u2018running a one man show\u2019.\n\n\u201cIf anyone or group is truly pushing for Ayu\u2019s removal, such a person or group is/are operating from a position of gross ignorance. Do they know what Ayu\u2019s removal entails? If Ayu resigns now, who takes over? A northern candidate? It changed nothing. So, let\u2019s suppose it\u2019s a southern candidate because the presidential candidate is from the North.\n\n\u201cOkay. So, he resigns and the chairmanship goes to the South. Will the South have the national chairman and national secretary? That is an unseen disruption.\n\n\u201cThose calling for Ayu\u2019s resignation are not thinking these things through; they are being driven largely by emotions,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen contacted, PDP National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, said there is neither a crack in the opposition party nor in the NWC. Nevertheless, Ologunagba told Daily Sun that the party has a robust conflict resolution mechanism to resolve any issue in the PDP.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthere is no division whatsoever in the party and in the NWC. Any report or idea whatever will be in the realm of fake news intended to divide the party. Knowing fully well that we are united in our mission to rescue and rebuild Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe PDP is united. We must recognise one thing, politics is about interest and conflicting interests. Whatever you hear today, which are in the realm of speculations, in the next 48 hours, they will be saying different things, positively about the party.\u201d",

He said out of the 25 people involved in the accident, six males, one female and one male child were identified, while 17 others were still unidentified.\n\n\u201cThe collision of the two Mazda buses with unidentified colours and registration numbers with the Previa bus resulted in an explosion which involved all the three vehicles. However, seven out of the two Mazda buses on the right lane survived, while others were caught up in the inferno and got burnt beyond recognition.\n\n\u201cAnd those in the Previa bus, which assumedly committed the road traffic violation, got burnt beyond recognition,\u201d he said.\n\nKazeem said that four more charred bodies were found while clearing the obstructions, adding that an unburnt body was also found on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, opposite the crash scene.\n\nHe said that obstructions had been cleared and traffic diversion closed, and that free flow of traffic had been restored. He quoted the Corps Marshal, FRSC, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, as saying that motorists should avoid night travels, adding that life had no duplicate, hence the need to drive with caution.\n\nOyeyemi said that road traffic violations and speed, heightened the spate and fatalities of road traffic crashes during night travels. He advised all road users to endeavour to drive safely to save the lives of other road users by adhering to all road traffic rules and regulations. The FRSC boss assured that the corps was working effectively to ensure a significant shift in the attitude of motorists and all road users across the country.",

          "text": "From Tony Osauzo, Benin\n\nTwo Catholic priests have been reportedly abducted by gunmen in Edo State.\n\nThe priests, Rev. Fathers Udo Peter and Philemon Oboh, of St. Patrick Catholic Church, Uromi and St. Joseph Retreat Centre, Ugboha, respectively, of the Catholic Diocese of Uromi, were said to be travelling from Benin to Uromi when they were abducted, along the Benin-Auchi road, on Saturday.\n\nThe incident occurred less than one week after Rev. Fr. Christopher Odia was gruesomely killed by suspected Fulani kidnappers, at Ikabigbo, in Etsako West Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe Edo State Police Command yesterday confirmed the abduction of the two priests. Spokesman of the Command, SP Chidi Nwabuzor, in a statement, yesterday, said: \u201cThis is to confirm the kidnap incident of two Catholic Reverend Fathers, Rev. Fr. Udo Peter of St. Patrick\u2019s Catholic Church Uromi and Rev. Fr. Philemon Oboh of St. Joseph Retreat Centre, Ugboha, in Esan South East Local Government Area of Edo State.\n\n\u201cThe Edo State Police Command was informed of the incident by the Divisional Police Officer, Ugboha, Edo State, that on Sunday, 03/07/2022, one Rev. Father Amos Abhulimen of St. Dominic Catholic Church Ugboha reported that he was informed by the Catholic authority, via WhatsApp, that the above named Catholic Rev. Fathers were attacked, kidnapped and taken to unknown places by some kidnappers, along Benin-Auchi expressway, between Ehor and Iruekpen communities.\n\n\u201cImmediately, the Commissioner of Police, Edo State, Abutu Yaro, dispatched police operatives to the area and warned to carry out aggressive and well coordinated manhunt in arresting the kidnappers and for the rescuing of the Rev. Fathers unhurt. The CP solicits the cooperation of the general public in giving information to the police and other sister security agencies in policing Edo State,\u201d the statement added.\n\nHowever, the Catholic Bishop of Uromi Diocese, Bishop Donatus Ogun, could not be reached for comments, as he was said to be in a meeting.\n\nAgain gunmen invade, bomb Kogi poli...

The Bishop is in a meeting,\u201d an aide to the Bishop told Daily Sun on telephone.\n\nAlso, a childhood friend of Fr Oboh, Mr Fred Itua, told Daily Sun that \u201cFr. Oboh is a religious priest who, contrary to popular held views, doesn\u2019t have money. His abduction is unfortunate and disheartening. We can only appeal to his abductors to set him free. It\u2019s an appeal. This is very traumatising.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the family of slain abducted Catholic priest of Ikabigbo, Fr Christopher Odia, has debunked media reports that her mother, Philomena Odia Ogedegbe is dead.\n\nThe family, in a statement signed by the late priest\u2019s elder brother, Comrade Robert Ogedegbe, said contrary to the false report, their mother was healthy and mourning her son. Besides, the statement said Kebiru, the arrested Fulani man who masterminded the kidnap and killing of Fr. Christopher Odia, was not his gardener nor gateman.\n\n\u201cWe, however, wish to set the records straight that the said Kebiru was neither Fr Christopher\u2019s gardener nor gateway, but was only living in the same Ikabigbo community, where our son/brother was pastoring the Catholic faithful as priest,\u201d the statement added.",

He said on sighting the police, the hoodlums took to their heels, but the gallant officers went after them.\n\n\u201cSomewhere around Old Welfare Road, the hoodlums went into a gun duel with the operatives, but could not withstand the superior firepower of the police.

          "text": "As a prominent president of an African nation once explained to then US President Barack Obama, there are lines that Africans should never cross regardless of what the international community thinks. One of such lines is sexuality. While the rest of the world considers the pairing of a man and a woman to be conventional and can be flipped in the name of homosexuality, most of us are not having it. Even so, not everybody has been brave enough, like that African President, to speak out against the rising tide of this behaviour. But the Director-General of the National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC), Segun Runsewe, is leading the conversation.\n\nNot long ago, there was a viral video that almost turned social media on its head: the video of Bobrisky (real name Idris Okeneye) in his female fa\u00e7ade during his alleged housewarming ceremony. In the beginning, Bobrisky received knocks because he claimed that he bought the house for N400 million.\n\nDuring the ceremony, however, Bobrisky was not the main attraction, rather the Islamic clerics who attended the housewarming ceremony took the spotlight.\n\nThe clerics were not at Bobrisky\u2019s party to renounce his cross-dressing lifestyle. They were there to pray for him, which is the norm on this side of the world whenever one accomplishes something worthwhile. Even though Bobrisky was dressed, spoke, and acted as a female, the clerics had nothing to say except to smile and bob their heads in the face of his aberrant behaviour.\n\nWhat Runsewe predicted not long ago is gradually taking root. According to him, if the Nigerian government does not take a firm stand on the matter of homosexuality and its associated lifestyles (including cross-dressing), it is only a matter of time before it becomes accepted. And if clerics can ignore it, who will have the courage to fight against it?\n\nAnd so Runsewe is vindicated. His vision, needless to say, is on point, as is his counsel on the matter.",

          "text": "Troops of the Nigerian military comprising the Navy and the Army have reportedly killed dozens of innocent citizens in the productive age bracket in Ogbaru communities of Anambra State.\n\nSaharaReporters was told that the wanton killings, it was gathered took place on Tuesday night, 28th and early hours of Wednesday, 29th June 2022 at Ossomala, Umunankwo and Obeagwa communities.\n\nThe deployment of the military personnel in the area had begun in the evening of Tuesday during which they claimed to be looking for unknown gunmen that recently laid the area under siege, according to sources.\n\nThe soldiers, according to information SaharaReporters obtained,later turned their guns on the defenceless and unarmed natives and others, while abandoning the forests where the locals said were the hideouts of the unknown gunmen located inside big river/swamp forest of Obene-Ochuche/Umuzu/Okija divided by Ulasi River.\n\nThe soldiers were said to have been mobilised from Ogbaru Naval Base and Onitsha 302 Artillery Regiment in over 20 trucks with arms and ammunition. They were said to have targeted defenceless locals mainly young males and opened fire on them at close range and killed dozens. They also wounded and arrested others who are later to be questionably labelled them as \"ESN/IPOB hoodlums\".\n\nVideos and pictures of the massacre which SaharaReporters obtained on Saturday, showed abandoned corpses shot on foreheads, heart regions, stomach and back and penis region littered in one of the community's playground and other locations.\n\nRelatives were equally seen crying besides corpses.

Based on the information we gathered, six soldiers were confirmed dead.\n\n\u201cThe next day in the morning, when the soldiers went to conduct search to confirm the number of casualties, about 23 soldiers were discovered dead.

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s constitutional court has ruled against Khumbudzo Ntshavheni\u2019s decision to switch off analogue broadcast systems by June 30, 2022, declaring it unconstitutional. Ntshavheni \u2013 who serves as the country\u2019s current Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies \u2013 wants South Africa to migrate to digital broadcast systems.\n\nThis follows an appeal by e.tv and two other applicants, Media Monitoring Africa (MMA) and SOS Support Public Broadcasting, who sought to overturn a judgment and order of the High Court of South Africa that had ruled in favour of the minister and government earlier this year.\n\nIn 2006, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), of which South Africa is a member, resolved that all member states in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East should migrate from analogue broadcasting systems to digital broadcasting systems by the year 2015.\n\nCurrently, in South Africa, traditional analogue broadcast systems are occupying the frequency bands between 700 MHz and 800 MHz which could be used for mobile data. Digital migration would free up those bands, making the provision of mobile data services cheaper.\n\nTo comply with the ITU resolution, in September 2008, the then minister of communications and digital technologies in South Africa, Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, published a Broadcasting Digital Migration Policy (BDM Policy) which stated that the analogue switch-off would be on November 1, 2011, 4 years earlier than the ITU\u2019s proposed deadline.\n\nIn February 2021, South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, announced that the phased switch-off of analogue transmitters would be completed by the end of March 2022.\n\nOn October 5, 2021, the minister made a final call for those qualifying for state-sponsored set-top boxes (STBs) to register, with the deadline for registration set for October 31, 2021. STBs would enable households to continue having access to television channels on their analogue television sets after the analogue switch-off.\n\nAfter this announcement, e.tv brought an application to the High Court against minister Ntshavheni, seeking to prevent the minister from disconnecting millions of people who had not yet migrated to digital transmission.\n\nIn the court order, the applicants wanted the minister to, among other requests, consult all affected parties before determining the analogue switch-off date as well as provide a report on the steps taken to ensure access to STBs within 1 month of the date of the court order.\n\nIn its judgement on March 28, the court had accepted that out of over 14 million television sets in South Africa, 10.5 million were compliant with digital transmission and 3.75 million were analogue.\n\nThe High Court held that 3 months would be sufficient to allow the minister to complete the outstanding installation of STBs in households with analogue television sets.\n\nIn the final ruling, the High Court dismissed the application from e.tv, MMA and SOS but extended the analogue switch-off date to June 30, 2022.\n\nFollowing the ruling by the High Court, e.tv, MMA and SOS appealed the matter against the minister in the Constitutional Court arguing that the Minister had a duty to consult the public, including the applicants, before imposing the STB registration cut-off date and determining the analogue switch-off date.\n\nIn a unanimous judgment, the Constitutional Court ruled that the power to determine the analogue switch-off date and the registration deadline for STBs is located within the minister\u2019s original constitutional policymaking function. The court thereafter had to determine whether the minister exercised this power rationally and lawfully.\n\nIn that respect, the Constitutional Court held that it was not only irrational but also unlawful for the minister to set a switch-off date without adequate notice to the analogue broadcast providers and the public.\n\nAs to the remedy, the Court held that the decisions of the minister, as well as the order of the High Court, had to be set aside.\n\nThe judgement will further delay South Africa\u2019s migration into digital broadcasting, meaning that services like mobile data which could do with the freed-up space on the frequency spectrum as a result of digital migration will continue to be expensive, further hurting citizens\u2019 pockets.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Pastor Enoch Adejare Adeboye, the general overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) has cleared the air on his \u2018fire for fire\u2019 comment. He said the comment did not at any time mean that Christians should go and buy guns for protection.\n\nAdeboye disclosed this during the monthly church thanksgiving service the church which was transmitted online for all members of the church on Sunday, July 3 from Mount Camel at Ifewara in Osun State.\n\nThe general overseer of the RCCG had made the \u2018Fire for fire\u2019 comment during the denomination\u2019s Holy Ghost Service on July 1, at the Redemption camp where, according to the clergyman, he was misunderstood and misquoted by a sector of the media as a call for Christians to go and buy guns in order to protect themselves in the face of attack.\n\n\u201cI never instructed anybody to buy guns for self-protection; you do not need guns to defend yourself. And even if you want to get a gun, they won\u2019t give you the license, so don\u2019t go and buy guns,\u201d he said.\n\nRead also: 5 reasons Adeboye\u2019s comments are a hit on social media\n\nDaddy G.O as he is popularly called stated that Christians do not necessarily need guns to protect themselves. He cited Samson as a Biblical example of a Christian warrior who did not use guns but the jaw bone of an ass to defeat his enemies.\n\n\u201cSamson used the jaw bone of an ass and how do you demonstrate that to the children? You show them the jawbone of an ass,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe said that any enemy that comes near the church will meet God at the gate. He, therefore, urged his members not to forsake the church services and/or fellowships for fear of being attacked.\n\nA group of unknown gunmen had attacked Saint Francis Catholic Church, Owo in Ondo State on Sunday, June 5, killing more than 40 worshippers and injuring many others, and recently some Christians were attacked and some kidnapped during a vigil at a church in Ogun State\n\nDaddy Go who spoke on the topic, \u201cMade for the Top\u201d, explained that nothing happens on earth \u2013 good or bad \u2013 without the knowledge of God. He explained that nobody can attack or kill a Christian without God knowing about it.\n\nHowever, he encouraged his members to aspire to get to the top because that is exactly the mind of God for them.\n\n\u201cLife is like a pyramid, you move from the base to the peak,\u201d he said.\n\nThe clergyman reiterated the qualities needed to get to the top which he said are diligence, having the Spirit of God, and leading a pure life.\n\nHe further stated that it is an error for Christians to be busy praying when he or she is supposed to be working hard. To such people, he said they cannot get to the top. He cited proverbs 22:29 as a pointer to the fact that diligence is needed to get to the top.\n\n\u201cIntelligence is important, but diligence is more important,\u201d he noted.",

          "text": "Cinemas are among the most hit by the high inflation rate in Nigeria as movie ticket prices have increased.\n\nAs new films are released, experts express concerns that rising ticket prices may drive many people away from the cinema.\n\n\u201cThe ticket prices are higher than what they used to be; we still have patronage from customers. The truth is that going to a cinema is like going to have fun and be entertained. Nigerians will always go out to have fun,\u201d Oluchi Wemere, one of the branch managers at Genesis Cinema, said.\n\nAccording to her, inflation doesn\u2019t have much effect on cinema. \u201cPeople understand that the prices of things are higher than they used to be but then they have no choice but to pay,\u201d she added.\n\nExperts have said should ticket prices keep rising, many would stop going to watch movies in the cinema and resort to streaming films with their phones.\n\nOluchi revealed that the average movie ticket price at Genesis Cinema before inflation hit was normally sold for N2,000 but the price has increased to N3,000, exclusive of the popcorn and drink.\n\nRead also: Inflation, unemployment, bad policies widen income inequality in Nigeria\n\nThe country\u2019s inflation rate accelerated to 17.71 percent in May from 16.82 percent in April, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nKabri Danjuma, one of the cinema-goers at Festival Mall, said: \u201cDespite the price increase, I usually come here on weekends to watch movies. I prefer watching new movies and relaxing here on the weekends.\u201d\n\nAgainst increasing movie ticket prices, cinema-going remains the most popular form of cultural participation and public social engagement.\n\nA cinema manager who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cMost cinema goers are not necessarily repelled by the price of tickets and cinema food. Considering that the price of tickets in Nigeria is not the same, so in most cities, it might be a concern if the price changes differently from what they are used to.\n\n\u201cThe footfall either reduces or increases depending on movie release at times. The numbers seem to have dropped in the past week because there have been no blockbuster releases since the release of \u2018Dr Strange\u2019; most people are now looking forward to the movie \u2018Thor: love and thunder\u2019 to be released in about a week.\u201d\n\nHe said high inflation had led to an increase in the price of tickets and other things.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is not necessarily a huge factor that affects sales and footfall. Most cinemas across the country have had to review their pricing in recent times and others have to stay the same, depending on what the charges were before inflation.\n\n\u201cDiesel is a factor; however, we are not oblivious to the current situation of the country. There is a lot to be involved in cinema operations like rent, power, among others; so these things are carefully considered before any changes are made.\u201d\n\nPatrick Lee, national chairman of the Cinema Exhibitors Association of Nigeria, said the association generated N653 million from tickets sold across the country in May, up 12 percent when compared with April.\n\n\u201c21 Nollywood films shown in May accounted for 28 percent of total ticket sales while 14 films, Hollywood films accounted for about 69 percent, with \u201cDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\u201d being the major outliner,\u201d he was quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria as saying.\n\nCinema has made the Nigerian film industry the second-largest globally, accounting for five percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\n.",

          "text": "The 2023 primaries of the major political parties including the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) have continued to draw negative ripple effects at the backdrop of alleged injustice and lack of fairness.\n\nThe ruling APC has embarked on fence-mending to ward off defection from the party and possible implosion, resulting from the acrimonious primaries.\n\nSection 84(1) of the Electoral Act 2022 as amended, mandates political parties to \u201chold primaries for all aspirants to all elective positions which shall be monitored by the Commission.\u201d\n\nThe Act goes further in Section 84(3) to insist that \u201cA political party shall not impose nomination qualification or disqualification criteria, measures, or conditions on any aspirant or candidate, for any election in its Constitution, guidelines or rules for nomination of candidates for elections, except as prescribed under sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 177 and 187 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (1999) as amended.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Section 84(5)(c) (i &ii) also mandate parties to hold special congresses in respect of Senatorial, House of Representatives and States House of Assembly contests, in \u201cSenatorial District, federal constituency and State Assembly Constituency respectively, with delegates voting for aspirants of their choice in designated centres on specific dates, and that \u201cthe aspirant with the highest number of votes cast at the end of voting shall be declared the winner of the primaries of the party and the aspirant\u2019s name shall be forwarded to the Commission as candidate of the party.\u201d\n\nClarifications over the reason for the substitution of names, sought from the leadership of the APC, could not yield the desired fruit.\n\nFor instance, the presumed winner of the Yobe North Senatorial seat under the APC, Bashir Machina, denied handing over his mandate to Ahmad Lawan.\n\nMachina had insisted that he would not surrender the ticket to Lawan.\n\nLawan had contested for the APC presidential ticket but lost to Bola Tinubu at the primary election.\n\nSoon after he lost the Presidential primary, Lawan was said to have mounted pressure on the party and Machina to allow him return to the Senate.\n\nMachina, while fielding questions on a current affairs programme on Channels Television, declared that he was under \u201cpressure\u201d to surrender his mandate to Lawan.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any clear-cut person or message directly that says I should step down but from the headquarters of my party (APC), recently I was informed that if I was still in the race, I should write formally to inform the party that I am.\u201d\n\nAt the expiration of the Friday June 27th, 2022 deadline for the submission of names of Presidential and National Assembly candidates, Machina\u2019s name was substituted with that of Ahmad Lawan as the \u201cSenatorial candidate\u201d for the Yobe North.\n\nThere was however, no records of Machina\u2019s withdrawal from the Senatorial race as required as required by the Electoral Act.\n\nWhen asked to clarify why he unilaterally dropped Machina\u2019s name in preference for Lawan\u2019s, Abdullahi Adamu, national chairman of the APC responded, \u201cDon\u2019t get yourself in the court of law. Is it that you were told or they are saying it?\u201d\n\nWhen reminded that as leader of the party, he should give the public the right perspective, Adamu again said: \u201cI don\u2019t have time for negativities. I don\u2019t just have time for that. If you face me with positives, I have time for all of that. I will stand here and answer all of your questions.\n\n\u201dI cannot respond to every speculation particularly when they are negative, especially when they are from mischief makers.\u201d\n\nBut in another interview after the release of the INEC\u2019s reports, Adamu had insisted that Ahmad Lawan \u201cremains the candidate recognised by the party as far as Yobe North senatorial district was concerned.\u201d\n\nReacting to the development, an Abuja-based legal practitioner, David Ityonyiman, said that when people try to circumvent the process, the only hope for the common man should be the regulatory body\n\n\u201cWe feel very much concerned about what is going on in our political process as well as who becomes the next President of Nigeria. This is why we keep urging INEC to remain a credible umpire as a regulatory body,\u201d Ityonyiman said.\n\nHe however commended the roles played by INEC so far and urged it not to relent.\n\n\u201cAs far as Nigerians are concerned, INEC remains our hope for a free, fair and credible election in 2023. They must remain resolute,\u201d he said\n\nIn a related development, the fate of aggrieved senators of the All Progressives Congress (APC) is still hanging as the promise of President Muhammadu Buhari to look into their grievances with a view to addressing them may not translate to having the lawmakers on the ballot for 2023 general election.\n\nMany APC lawmakers are angry that the governors of their states frustrated them from getting return tickets back to the National Assembly, a development which caused the defection of seven APC senators to opposition parties with insinuation that about 20 were planning to dump the ruling party.\n\nThe Chief Whip of the Senate, Orji Uzor Kalu, in a desperate approach to address a further defection from the party, had led 22 aggrieved senators to meet with President Muhammadu Buhari in Aso Rock Villa.\n\nBuhari had also assured the aggrieved senators of the party\u2019s plan to address their grievances particularly as it concerns the just concluded primaries.\n\nThe President assured them that he would continue to address the challenges through the party\u2019s machinery and to exercise restraint, promising that justice will be done.\n\nHe said: \u201cI thank you for the decision to approach me with your concerns over the future of the party and for pursuing a solution approach for the challenges thrown up by the recent election-related activities, particularly the primaries.\n\n\u201cAs the leader of the party, one of my primary roles is to ensure that our culture of internal democracy and dispute resolution is strengthened by creating the opportunity for members to ventilate their opinions, views and grievances at different levels.\n\nRead also: 2023: Buhari moves to halt defection of more APC lawmakers\n\n\u201cI have noted your grievances, particularly as it concerns the just concluded processes. The cost to the nation, the threat to the majority of positions held by our party in the legislative chambers and the likely consequence to the electoral fortune of the party as we approach the general elections. We must not allow these dire threats to come to pass.\u201d\n\nThe President further said: \u201cI must acknowledge that in every contest there must be a level playing ground, just as there would be grievances at the end. That is the test of our democratic credentials, systems and practices.\n\n\u201cI have since the conclusion of the process been inundated with various reports and complaints. In keeping with our ethos therefore, I shall continue to address the insuring challenges and grievances through the party machinery while paying keen attention to the outcomes.\n\n\u201cI must also remind you of the primary primacy of justice in all our actions if justice is denied its outcome is usually unpleasant, this is because you the members keep the party running. I should add that as part of the policy of using the party machinery for effective resolutions of conflict, the chairman and some members of the national working committee visited the National Assembly recently to dialogue with our legislators.\u201d\n\nHowever, there seems to be end of road for the aggrieved lawmakers in the APC as the party has already submitted the names of senatorial candidates to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nThe only window left is if the President and the party exploit the provision of Section 31 of the Electoral Act 2022 to enable the aggrieved lawmakers to be on the ballot for the 2023 general election.\n\nSection 31 of the Electoral Act, 2022 provides that: \u201cA candidate may withdraw his or her candidature by notice in writing signed by him and delivered personally by the candidate to the political party that nominated him for the election and the political party shall convey such withdrawal to the Commission not later than 90 days to the election.\u201d\n\nBut again, Festus Okoye, INEC national commissioner in charge of publicity, had hinted that such arrangement may not be that easy.\n\nOkoye had said: \u201cThere is a provision in the Electoral Act for withdrawal of candidates validly nominated and the law provides that a political party cannot substitute a candidate that has been validly nominated except in two instances; if the nominated candidate dies or if the nominated candidate withdraws from the race.\n\n\u201cAnd in terms of withdrawal, the nominated candidate shall \u2013 in his own writing \u2013 write a letter to the political party that nominated him, indicating that he has withdrawn from the race and that must also be accompanied by an affidavit duly sworn to by the said candidate.\n\n\u201cThen the political party that nominated the candidate will now forward same to the Independent National Electoral Commission saying that our candidate has withdrawn, or our vice-presidential candidate has withdrawn, and these are the documents of withdrawal and this is the person we are using to replace.\n\n\u201cBut as of today, the political parties nominated their candidates so the issue of withdrawal is at the absolute discretion of the duly nominated candidate and no one else.\u201d",

I am talking about internal rancour amongst us. In one, two, three weeks, we will be able to resolve what the issues are. The issues are not about the governorship candidate. I need to sit with them and say, can we move forward.\u201d\n\nReacting to the decision of the Rivers State government to prosecute him over the alleged sales of the state assets, the former Rivers governor declared that neither the police nor any of the anti-graft agencies has invited him for interrogation.\n\nHe said: \u201cI hope that the governor has good lawyers. The Supreme Court said in their judgement that he has powers to set up a panel and the job of the panel is to gather information. That after gathering the information, they should pass the information to either ICPC, Police or EFCC. The police have not invited me; ICPC has not invited me and EFCC has not invited me.\n\n\u201cSecondly, there is what we call fair hearing. At that point when they will invite me, it is called a fair hearing because they will hear my own side of the story. You have not heard my own side of the story and you went to court to do what? Something must be giving you confidence.\n\n\u201cIt is not about being served by the court. The Supreme Court said before you go ahead, you have to send it to the investigating authorities and it is when they finish the investigation that they will decide whether the matter will come to court or not. You have not done any of those things and you are in court. So, what will you be telling the court?\n\n\u201cTwo, everything that was done was done transparently. There was an agency called the Public Procurement Agency and all those things passed through.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be talking about an issue that is before the court. Let the court decide. Tonye Cole did not act in his personal capacity. He represented Sahara Energy. You know this is political because they are afraid.\u201d\n\nHe urged APC members to go and work for the party\u2019s victory, stressing that the election is a contest and one person must emerge victorious.\n\nThe former presidential aspirant defended the Minister-designate, Udi Odum, who is the leader of Abual/Odual local government area, correcting the impression that he was an unpopular candidate.",

          "text": "Ahead of the formal announcement of substantive vice presidential candidate of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC), the party has declared that it will prioritise competence ahead of religion or any other consideration.\n\nThe party had submitted a place holder\u2019s name temporarily as a running mate to its presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nVarious interest groups, including religious bodies and others, have expressed divergent opinions on the issue.\n\nWhile some are insisting on the political desirability, others are of the view that a Muslim-Muslim ticket won\u2019t be a fair decision.\n\nA case for competence\n\nBut speaking with newsmen Sunday in Abuja, APC\u2019s Deputy National Organising Secretary Nze Chidi Duru said the party would nominate a very competent and capable person to complement Tinubu\u2019s strength and weakness.\n\nAccording to Duru, APC has not taken a decision that it must come from a particular religion or tribe.\n\n\u201cOn Muslim-Muslim joint ticket, I think we must not bicker about denomination of who eventually emerges as our vice president. What is clear is that the party will nominate a very competent and capable person that will complement the strength and weakness of our candidate.\n\n\u201cAs it is today, what we have is a Muslim-Muslim joint ticket. Religion is no longer an issue for the party. I have said that we are looking for a capable and competent nationalist to complement our candidate.\n\n\u201cIt may be that we are going to reap the benefit of 1993 where people will no longer talk about religion and tribe but those that will do well for us and lift the country and provide the required leadership that Nigeria deserves.\n\n\u201cAll I want to say is that he will come from the Northeast, Northwest or North Central. This is the stand of the party for now. We will not bathe in the realm of congestion of whether he is the rightful candidate. He is capable in his own right,\u201d Duru said.\n\nWhen asked whether Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of Labour Party is a threat in 2023, Duru said: \u201cSowore is a threat, Atiku among other candidates are a threat to the APC. But what is important is that we are not complacent. APC understands that the party in power is a sitting duck waiting to be taken out.\n\n\u201cWe also understand that what could change is for the opposition to take over power and the party in power becomes the opposition party. We will work hard. While other parties are struggling to resolve their crisis, APC has managed the various tendencies and it is, therefore, easy for us across the board to handle situations.\u201d\n\n\u2018Christians abound in the North\u2019\n\nBut another APC chieftain and Director General Voice of Nigeria, Osita Okechukwu, said Tinubu has a wide range of areas in the North to look for a Christian running mate.\n\nOkechukwu said there are Christians in Sokoto, Kebbi, Borno and many other states in the North to choose running mate from.\n\nThe VON boss also declared that Tinubu would win the presidential election by 60 percent.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe last I heard from our presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu is that he is still searching and luckily, he has a wide variety of areas to search from, from River Benue up to the last point in Jibia, Dutse, Lake Chad boundary. So, if you are the one searching in a wide vast area where we have over 100 people with about 44 million voters which might go up to 50 million, you have a wide range of areas to search.\n\n\u201cLuckily for us, a lot of people will not know that even in Kebbi, Sokoto, there are Christians. Even in Borno, there are Christians. He has a wide range of areas to look for Christians. So Asiwaju has 60% of winning this election. We are in charge of 22 states of the federation. We have the majority in National and State Houses of Assembly \u2013 they are not going to betray him.\n\n\u201cEven for us in the South/east that has never been our stronghold on the day of election we are going there to protect our mandate. Otherwise, if I don\u2019t defend it, did I get appointment before APC won presidential election?\n\n\u201cWhatever is my preference, if I want my office to remain, it means I must support Asiwaju, it\u2019s applicable to those who are board members whether you are coming from Yenogoa or Dutse, so that is the power of incumbency.\u201d\n\nGroup cautions\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Democracy Defence Watch (NDDW) Sunday warned on the danger of presenting a Muslim/Muslim ticket by the governing APC in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nIt said such development would not only be a threat to national stability but could also retard peace and security in Nigeria.\n\nIn a seven-page letter to President Muhammadu Buhari, a copy of which was obtained by Blueprint, the civic group said if the APC goes ahead with the Muslim/Muslim ticket agenda, it would only portray Nigeria as an Islamic and sectarian nation which will be ultimately resisted by the nation\u2019s millions of practicing Christians, moderate and progressive Muslims and civic groups, ethno-cultural associations and enlightened members of the International community.\n\nNDDW National Coordinator and National Secretary, Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Adamu, and Otunba Adeniji Niyi Adegoke respectively, sounded the caution in the letter titled \u2018APC\u2019s Muslim/Muslim ticket in Nigeria\u2019s 2023 Elections: A Threat to National Stability, Regional Peace and Security.\u2019\n\nThe group said it is worried more, particularly with the international dimension it is taking with a recent letter by five United States senators to the US Senate where they are calling for readmission of Nigeria as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) due to the worsening sectarian violence in the country.\n\n\u201cThe US senators observed that \u2018horrific acts of deadly violence have been committed against Nigerian Christians in recent weeks, including the massacre of church goers on Pentecost Sunday and the stoning of a Christian college student.\n\n\u201cSadly, such violence has become all too familiar for Christians in Africa\u2019s most populous country\u2026Religious violence and intolerance directed toward Nigerian Christians has worsened in recent years. One report documented more than 4,650 cases of Nigerian Christians who were killed for their faith in 2021,\u201d the body said.\n\nThey therefore called on President Buhari to direct the security forces to do the needful by advising the APC presidential candidate and the ruling party on the possible threats the action could pose to security in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is pertinent to note the serious implications of the above with regards to security. This is especially when one rightly imagines that Christians will feel threatened with a Muslim/Muslim ticket, and may resort to pulpit preaching and mobilization of opinions across the Christendom.\n\n\u201cCivil society organisations and students would likely protest this destructive introduction into our polity in various manners which may constitute security concerns. However, it should be noted that the \u201coriginal sin\u201d is the adoption of a Muslim/Muslim ticket by the ruling APC, and not the reactions and responses that may follow it,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe letter, copied to all heads of democratic and security institutions in Nigeria as well as other international concerns, also warned on the danger such political arrangement could cause on the continental security.\n\n\u201cThe West African sub \u2013 regional, and indeed, African regional peace and security are basically predicated on the presumption of Nigeria\u2019s political stability, or at least, the absence of any conflict that can overwhelm the Nigerian State. This is because there is nothing in the African Peace and Security Architecture that is designed to contain a conflict in Africa\u2019s largest population of over 200 million people in a country that shares very porous borders with three sub \u2013 regions \u2013 West, Central and North Africa.\n\n\u201cIn the first place, its humanitarian consequences are frightening to imagine \u2013 in the event of a civil war or armed conflict in Nigeria, there will be a complete sub \u2013 regional melt down in 72 hours, if just 5 percent of the Nigerian population crosses the borders. Its economic repercussions will be a total calamity across the entire sub regions of West and Central Africa. The security implication of weapons proliferation and explosion of the two deadly terrorist organizations currently based in Nigeria, into the rest of the entire continent of Africa, can only be better be imagined.\n\n\u201cWe therefore implore you to use your good offices to weigh in on Sen Bola Ahmed Tinubu to thread with caution and refrain from his unyielding desire to foist on the nation a MUSLIM-MUSLIM ticket which if it succeeds will make the above tragic and destructive humanitarian quagmire a distinct possibility,\u201d the NDDW further cautioned.\n\n\u2026HURIWA too\n\nSounding similar warning, the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) said an APC Muslim-Muslim ticket was tantamount to playing with fire.\n\nIn a statement by its national coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, HURIWA said the emergence of a Muslim-Muslim ticket presidency would further heighten the aggression against Christians by bandits and terrorists claiming allegiance to Islam.\n\nHURIWA condemned the alleged plan insisting it is unconstitutional and violates Section 14 (3) and (4) and Section 318 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which specifically states that the principle of federal character should be reflected in the composition of the government and that no group, religious or ethnic, should dominate the other.\n\nOnwubiko said: \u201cThe nomination will endanger national unity and will divide Nigeria irretrievably. If Tinubu goes on with a Muslim running mate, the APC should just forget about Nigeria because religious war will break out and Nigeria\u2019s case will be worse than Somalia\u2019s.\u201d\n\nGroup roots for Lalong\n\nAlso, the National Coalition for Democracy, Peace and Unity has rejected APC\u2019s planned bid for a Muslim-Muslim ticket, while urging Asiwaju Tinubu to pick Plateau state Governor Simon Lalong.\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of a one-day political summit held Sunday in Kaduna, NCDPU said it would only work with political parties and candidates with considerations for the diversity and regional interests of Nigeria.\n\nIt said topic of the summit, \u201cThe 2023 Presidential Elections; Need for a United and Peaceful Nigeria\u201d was carefully selected to discuss the best approach to addressing the issues overheating the polity ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 jointly signed by the National Coordinator and Secretary, Comrade Ibrahim Ringim and Comrade Peter Emmanuel respectively, said: \u201cAs concerned democrats, we are deeply worried about the potential threats and political crisis that would be created if the ruling party resolved to consider a Muslim-Muslim ticket during the forthcoming 2023 presidential elections. The political summit was informed by the palpable tension stirred up by regional agitations and the impending crisis that the idea of Muslim-Muslim ticket could cause.\n\n\u201cAfter an exhaustive deliberation by the Executive Members on the way forward for a sustainable peace and progress of our dear country, we resolved that in the interest of national unity, it is good for the ruling APC and its presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu to pick a Christian running mate in the same manner the main opposition party, PDP has done. We are asking all political parties to strike a balance along religion and ethnicity for a united and peaceful coexistence.\u201d\n\nWhile endorsing Governor Lalong as Tinubu\u2019s running mate, they said: \u201cIt is in public domain that Lalong has shown himself to be a unifier, who has managed the crises in Plateau very well that even the Muslims in the state are comfortable with him, evidence that he will no doubt be fair to all.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "text": "The Coordinator, Stand Up Nigeria, Sunday Attah, on Saturday berates the action of some oil marketers who are hiding under various claims to create artificial logjams in order to force the government to increase the pump price of fuel.\n\nAttah describe the development as most unfair as even under the current arrangement where the official pump price is N165 the marketers still make huge profits.\n\nThe Coordinator, in his One Day Rally Text on the Lingering Fuel Crisis in FCT and Some other States in Nigeria said, the rally became pertinent in view of the toll the fuel crisis is taking on the economy of Nigeria and the attendant socio-economic effect on citizens.\n\n\u201cQuite unfortunately, queues have resurfaced in many states including the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, that many are finding it difficult to go about their normal schedule without incurring further costs.\n\nConsequently, Nigerians have expressed outrage at the build up of these queues and the resultant hardship.\n\nWhile the outrage is justifiable given Nigeria status as the 6th largest oil nation in the world and the hardship occasioned by the need to access Premium Motor Spirit, the angst is misplaced as the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, (NNPC) which some are blaming for the current situation is totally blameless as it is equally worried and doing all it could to bring the situation to normal.\n\nThe NNPC under the able leadership of Mele Kyari has no hand in the resultant hardship being suffered by Nigerian in the bid to access the petroleum product as the corporation has been up and doing to ensure that Nigerians have enough fuel to power their vehicles and other devices for the well being of the citizenry\u201d the statement\u201d.\n\nThe group however, exonerated the NNPC from playing any role in the ongoing scarcity after carrying out investigation into the cause of the problem.\n\n\u201cOur investigation have revealed NNPC has not relented in its task of importing products so as to ease transportation and other challenges that have to do with the use of fuel.\n\nWe can authoritatively say that all the jetties are fully stocked as a result of these efforts and currently have no less than 1. 9 billion liters of fuel which ordinarily should serve Nigerians for 32 days non stop even if a single liter is not been imported within the intervening period.\n\nOur findings have also revealed that there is no problem with transportation of products as government has not only paid but has increased the incentives for transporters.\n\nThe problem, we have since established is not with the NNPC but with the marketers who are hiding under various claims to create artificial logjams in order to force the government to increase the pump price of fuel.\n\nThis is most unfair as even under the current arrangement where the official pump price is N165 the marketers still make huge profits\u201d.\n\nFurther more, that in order to maximize the profit for transporters, the government has even increased the freight cost with N10 per liter which brings to about N24 per liter the amount it pays to transporters on every liter\n\nThis is a huge amount that when multiplied results in huge profits for the marketers and ordinarily should have encouraged them to work harder in line with government\u2019s bid to satisfy the citizenry.\n\nThis is more so as the government did that without transferring the responsibility to consumers so as not add to the hardship on Nigerians.\n\nWe therefore frown at the artificial scarcity being created by marketers all in the bid to maximize profit at the expense of millions of Nigerians who are being forced to pay double for fares in order to move from one place to the other and the man hours being wasted just to buy fuel.\n\nVital component of the economy like banks, courts, factories etc are forced to reduce their working hours due to lack of fuel.\n\nWe therefore call on the marketers to show more sense of patriotism by taking into cognisance the pains they put other Nigerians through just to make profit.\n\nWe commend the NNPC GMD for standing firm for Nigeria in this trying period and for shunning all forms of intimidation to take actions that are against the interest of the masses.\n\nLooking at other countries and the global price of PMS across the world today, we can confidently say that Mallam Mele Kyari is a miracle worker to see that Nigeria and Nigerians are still buying PMS for 165 per liter.\n\nIn the USA a gallon of PMS is sold for 5.4 dollars, in Europe it is sold for 4.9 Euro, while back home in Africa, Ghana is selling for 11.87 cedi which is about 587 naira.\n\nThe landing cost of PMS to our country today is 600 per liter and government has not added one naria to what the marketers were buying before so should the marketers think of selling above government price all in the name of transportation cost?\n\nThis is why we are calling on all oil marketers and other stakeholders in the industry to be patriotic and shun sharp practices and put the interest of Nigeria and Nigerians above their high profit-making Target\u201d, Sunday added.",

          "title": "Economy Diversification: Why Nigeria\u2019s mining sector offers robust economic potential- Adegbite",
          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn efforts to boost the nation\u2019s economy through the mining sector, the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologist, NSEG has held its 1st international conference and exhibition in Abuja, with the theme: \u201cEconomic Diversification: The Role of the Geoscientist, Government and Private Sector\u201d, to brainstorm on the better ways to explore the sector.\n\nDeclaring the two- day event open, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite noted that as part of its effort to reposition the Solid Minerals Sector, the Ministry in early 2016, had identified insufficient geoscientific data, geological knowledge, weak\n\nimplementation and enforcement of mining law and regulations, and poorly regulated and informal artisans and small-scale mining sub-sector as critical binding constraints to the mining sector\u2019s development.\n\nAdegbite who was represented by the Director General, Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, MCO, Engr Simon Obadiah Nkom stated that this had propelled the Ministry to immediately begin the process of preparing a detailed sector Roadmap aimed at advancing certain strategic objectives, which would eventually result in the: creation of a globally competitive sector capable of contributing to wealth creation;\n\nprovision of jobs and advance social and human security by focusing on using its mining assets to drive domestic industrialization; and\n\nmigration to winning in global markets through a value chained-based growth plan.\n\nAccording to him, he considered the theme as strategic and timely, given the compelling\n\nurgency to diversify the economy for the prosperity of the nation adding that the\n\ntheme seeks to define the roles of the critical stakeholders in developing\n\nthe minerals sector, key amongst which were the government, private\n\nsector, and the professionals driving the mineral sector development\n\nprocess.\n\nHe said undeniably, Nigeria\u2019s Minerals sector offered a robust economic potential for diversification of the nation\u2019s economy yet the country and indeed, many other African Countries have continued to suffer under\n\nutilization of their mineral resources\n\nThis he reasoned has accounted for the slow phase of socio-economic\n\ndevelopment in Nigeria and many African countries noting that \u201cOur country is known\n\nto operate a mono economy where oil accounts for almost 90% of the foreign exchange earnings. This present administration found this appalling and described the situation as unacceptable and promised to urgently find solutions to redress the challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government through the Ministry of Mines and Steel\n\nDevelopment, MMSD, over, which I preside as the Honourable Minister\n\nplays the role of administrator and regulator of the mining industry\n\nactivities. Some of the key reform programmes include amongst others the\n\nothers the following: Formulation of a robust Policy/Legal/Regulatory/ Institutional frameworks and a Roadmap for the development, growth and good\n\ngovernance of the mineral sector development activities in line with global best practices.\n\n\u201cFacilitating the development of seven (7) Strategic Minerals including Gold, Barite, Coal, Lead/Zinc, Iron ore, Bitumen and Limestone as a matter of priority; generating geoscience data through the National Integrated Mineral\n\nExploration Project, NIMEP, for subsequent concession to\n\nprospective genuine investors. This is the first exploration project funded directly by the Federal Government in the history of Nigeria; upgrading of the mineral title administration and management system of MCO to standard online application processes.\n\nConcessioning of the delineated Bitumen blocks to prospective\n\ninvestors through transparent competitive bidding process, which is ongoing.\n\nThe minister asserted that the private sector on its part plays the role of owner and operator\n\nof commercial mining entities and businesses saying that this shows the high premium, which government places on the private sector in driving\n\neconomic development activities.\n\n\u201cThe geoscientist plays such an invaluable role, which cannot be\n\noverstated in driving mineral exploration activities leading to discoveries of minerals and preparation of definitive feasibility reports on the viability of mineral reserves. The works of the geoscientists produce the treasured\n\nmineral raw materials that form the backbone of modern-day industrial revolution\n\nHe also called on all geoscientists and\n\nstakeholders to support Government\u2019s policy and efforts in diversifying the\n\nnation economy using the mineral sector as one of the key drivers stating that \u201cthe\n\noutcome of such efforts will benefit all of us and the generation of Nigerians yet unborn,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reassured them of government\u2019s commitment in continuous support towards the growth and development of the minerals sector by generating geoscience data to de-risk and make it more attractive to genuine investors maintaining that \u201cGovernment will also continue to support Research and Development, R & D, endeavours tailored towards addressing real time mineral sector development challenges.\u201d\n\nEarlier, delivering his Welcome Address Director General, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, who also doubles as the President of the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologists, NSEG, Dr. Abdulrazaq Abubakar Garba, emphasized that the strategic objectives, professional targets and timelines set as enshrined in the constitution of the society needed to be pursued and met.\n\nGarba noted that the essenc of the conference was to discuss and brainstorm on the emerging challenges arising from the dynamic operating environment of its profession especially in the face of the new normal occasioned by the much-talked-about need to diversify the Nigerian economy away from its sole dependence on crude oil by focusing more on other areas including the solid mineral and agricultural sectors to boost the wealth of the Nation.\n\n\u201cEconomic geology can succinctly be defined as a subdiscipline of the geosciences that focuses on earth materials that can be used for economic or industrial development purposes. Often, much of the purpose of study is to identify new ore deposits for excavation as well as understanding how ore deposits are generated and localized within the Earth\u2019s crust.\n\n\u201cThe theme of this year\u2019s conference, was chosen to underscore our role in the diversification agenda of the Federal Government. Economic geologists play vital roles across the entire mineral value chain from exploration to mining; and even during the post-mining phase as the issues of environment and land reclamation for sustainable use are addressed. Additionally, economic geologists also have to interface with interested stakeholders in obtaining social and mining permit licenses to operate while at the same time provide investors with the prerequisites to raise capital for mineral exploration and mining. Economic geologists therefore provide veritable and robust linkages in the entire mineral development, utilization and environmental preservation chain and are therefore key to the Federal Government\u2019s economy diversification programme targeted at job and wealth creation.\n\n\u201cLet me emphasis that, investment in the minerals and mining sector by stakeholders is a patriotic duty of every citizen who believe in the Nigerian Project. In this respect, the role of governments, both at the national and sub-national levels, is to coordinate and ensure a responsible development of the country\u2019s natural resources. To this effect, necessary laws and regulations have been put in place by government, setting clear requirements that must be met by the industry operators. The economic diversification policy of government, which is anchored on shared and sustainable mining prosperity, emphasizes the need for cooperation of governments to unlock the full potentials of the minerals and metal sector. The Federal government is developing a well governed mining sector with sustainable capacity and has also articulated a roadmap to address some of the identified challenges in the mining sector. The initiatives and strategies outlined in the roadmap are designed largely to make the mining and minerals sector an irresistible destination for global capital.\n\nHe maintained that the success of the Ministry\u2019s National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP executed through the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA and other collaborating Agencies was mainly attributable to the role played by geoscientists from its conceptualization, design and execution.\n\n\u201cThe recent approval by the Federal Executive Council of a Scale of Fees for professionals in geosciences and mining is a testimony of government\u2019s resolve to stimulate the sector and ensure commensurate benefits to the professionals who are indeed the \u2018brain\u2019 and think tank of the sector.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the nation is witnessing a re-awakening in this sector, and the Government is not resting on its oars to grab the bull by the horn. Happily, the organized private sector such as the likes of Thor Exploration (Segilola Gold), Iron Ore/Aurelia, AG Vision, etc are now taking up the gauntlet,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe added that the economic geologist is unique with skills cutting across many of the specialists listed above.\n\nAlso the President of Nigeria Mining Geological Scientist, NMGS, Surv. Charles Alabo said that a lot has been done in providing the necessary framework and conducive environment for mining to play a pivotal role in this regard.\n\nAlabo also said that although Nigeria was committed to a system of free enterprise, Government should continue to play vital roles in the mining industry apart from its traditional regulatory functions.\n\n\u201cThe federal government also supplies some vital information necessary to stimulate and encourage investment for the optimum utilization of the huge mineral wealth of our country.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution gives the Federal Government control of all-natural resources, meaning that there is no private ownership of solid minerals in Nigeria. Though mining is within the purview of the Federal Government, sub national govemments can contribute to the growth and effective functioning of the mining sector by partnering with the federal government to ensure sustained economic growth, environmental protection, occupational safety and provision of infrastructure in host mining communities. In addition, developmental plans should take into cognizance the overall development aspirations of the State alongside the prospects and challenges of mining activities\n\n\u201cThe Mining sector to significantly contribute to Nigeria\u2019s economy cannot be over-emphasized. The Roadmap for the Growth & Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry highlights the potential for a progressive increase in the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP over the next decades. It is envisaged that this shift would translate to increased public and private sector investment, more employment creation for the citizenry and overall growth and financial stability for the economy International investor interest in the sector will continue to improve with the federal government also recognizing the sector as a potential prime income generator away from oil. However, so much more still needs to be done to tap the full potentials of the mining sector given the large mineral resources of the Nation,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe further stated that the NMGS will continue to support NSEG and indeed all the other Specialist Groups of the NMGS as they play their roles as drivers of the technical think tank of the society adding that \u201cWe shall continue to empower them to drive geosciences and mining innovations under the umbrella of our great Society. Key programs of relevance to the sector must be critically and more robustly assessed by qualified professionals in the mix of our national development. Economic geologists particularly have an obligation to future generations in providing safe and sustainable mineral exploration, exploitation and utilization programs while also ensuring minimal environmental impact. As professionals, we must therefore aim at providing sustainable geosciences and mining information for investors and policy makers including national representatives, federal and state agencies, industry, academia, and other stakeholders in the sector. Professionals in geosciences and mining should be poised to expand their roles and lead in finding sustainable solutions for modern socio-economic challenges through mineral resources development and innovative efforts.\n\n\u201cThe need for full integration of mining into national, regional, and continental development frameworks cannot be over emphasized as such integration would bring about accelerated development to national and sub national economies to ensure maximum benefits for our people.\u201d",

This is complemented by the deployment of the Human Resource Module of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System, IPPIS, the Federal Civil Service Strategy Implementation Plan and the reinforcement of the Innovation Division in all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs.\n\n\u201cLEAD-P and SMART-P trainings have also been consistently carried out to realise this laudable vision of the HCSF.\n\n\u201cMMSD is among the first set of MDAs to receive these facilities and efforts are on to ensure that we blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation. We have achieved a major improvement in the ACTU rating from about 26.5% to 74.5% compliance and have also surpassed our revenue projections,\u201d Akinlade said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary disclosed that efforts had also been made within the ministry\u2019s limits of available resources to provide facilities that would enhance productivity and welfare of Staff, adding that in that regard, \u201cwe now have a clinic that can provide basic health services to all staff to ensure that our health is given the priority that it deserves\u201d.\n\nShe said many may be unaware that within the few months of operation of the clinic, health crises had been averted for some staff just through routine check by the medical team in the clinic.\n\n\u201cAlso, we can easily see the massive deployment of ICT infrastructures within office complex aimed at achieving the full automation of the work processes in the ministry,\u201d she added.\n\nCongratulating the members of management and staff of the ministry on week-long activities being commemorated, Akinlade craved their indulgence over the delay in the commemoration which was being held this week instead of last week that was officially set aside to mark the event, adding that it was due to exigencies of duty.\n\n\u201cSince 1999 when the African Union, AU, set aside 23rd June, as the \u201cAfrica Public Service Day, APSD, Nigeria has consistently\n\ncommemorated the day annually with series of activities and we are grateful to God for the opportunity to be part of this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cIn her characteristic style of celebrating civil servants, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation approved a full package of week-long activities for this year including Jumat and Church Services, Keep-fit/aerobics session, a Town-hall Meeting and Special Awards to selected officers for outstanding performance,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe told the workers that the occasion also affords the opportunity to specially acknowledge members of staff that have distinguished themselves through outstanding performance.\n\nSpeaking further, she said, \u201cAs usual, one person was nominated from each department out of which three were selected and forwarded to OHCSF. I want to therefore congratulate all the recipients of this year\u2019s award and appreciate them for their diligence.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly congratulate Engr. Umar Adamu Tsoho who was honoured with the \u201cPresidential Public Service Award\u201d by the OHCSF for outstanding service. He made it to the top ten among the nomination from all the MDAs. We are proud of you and we thank you for bringing honour to this Ministry.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the HCSF, I want to congratulate and specially thank all the retiring staff for the year 2022. It is indeed a noble achievement to successfully exit the Federal Civil Service through retirement. It is the beginning of new life for you and we wish you good health of mind and body as well as a fulfilling life after retirement from public service.\u201d\n\nAlso Member of staff and retirees of MMSD were rewarded with gift items and plaques for the outstanding dedication to duty.",

The only opportunity now is the NNPP. I believe it is in the interest of Labour Party and the NNPP, and even in the interest of this country.\u201d",

Ronaldo is said to view playing in the Champions League and competing for major trophies as essential.\n\nUnited has appointed Ajax head coach Erik ten Hag to replace interim coach Ralf Rangnick, and during his unveiling last month, he said that Ronaldo was part of his plans for the coming season.\n\nRonaldo first joined United from Portuguese side Sporting CP in 2003.\n\nHe scored 118 goals in 292 games before leaving for Real Madrid in 2009, where he remained until joining Juventus in 2018.\n\nRonaldo failed to win the Champions League with Juve in his three seasons with the Turin giants, but he lifted the trophy with United in 2008 and four times with Madrid. He was the top scorer in Serie A for the last two seasons he was in Turin and scored 101 goals in 134 appearances.\n\nThe former Real Madrid star has won 32 titles in his career, including seven league titles and five Champions Leagues.\n\nHe captained Portugal to Euro 2016 glory and the 2019 UEFA Nations League.\n\nA five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner, Ronaldo is the men\u2019s world-record holder for most goals scored (117) in internationals.\n\nHe is set to captain Portugal at the World Cup later this year.",
