          "text": "Russia said Wednesday it has banned entry to several dozen Japanese officials, including Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, after Tokyo joined international sanctions against Moscow over its military campaign in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe administration of F. Kishida launched an unprecedented anti-Russian campaign (and) allows unacceptable rhetoric against the Russian Federation, including slander and direct threats,\u201d the foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt is echoed by public figures, experts, representatives of Japanese media, who are completely engaged by the attitudes of the West towards our country,\u201d the ministry added.\n\nHere are other latest developments in the war in Ukraine:\n\n\u2013 New EU sanctions, oil ban take shape \u2013\n\nEU chief Ursula von der Leyen says the bloc will impose a gradual Russian oil ban, as part of new sanctions to punish Russia for invading Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe will phase out Russian supply of crude oil within six months and refined products by the end of the year,\u201d she tells the European Parliament.\n\nIn a document seen by AFP, von der Leyen\u2019s proposal asks that Hungary and Slovakia, both hugely dependent on Russian oil, be given more time to meet the ban.\n\nThe EU executive also proposes sanctioning the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, and excluding Russian bank Sberbank from the SWIFT network.\n\n\u2013 Attack on Azovstal \u2013\n\nRussian forces launch a \u201cpowerful assault\u201d on the Azovstal plant in Mariupol, Ukraine\u2019s army says. The Kremlin says its forces, along with pro-Moscow Ukrainian separatists, are using artillery and planes to target the site.\n\n\u2013 A deadly day \u2013\n\nIn one of a series of assaults in Ukraine\u2019s east, 21 civilians are killed and another 28 wounded in the Donetsk region Tuesday, local authorities say.\n\nTen of the 21 dead are killed in the shelling of the Avdiivka coke plant, according to regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko, who says the daily death toll is the highest since a Russian strike on a train station in Kramatorsk about a month ago.\n\n\u2013 Evacuees reach Zaporizhzhia \u2013\n\nFurther evacuations from the long-besieged port city of Mariupol are expected Wednesday, a day after 156 people arrived in (the Ukrainian-held city of) Zaporizhzhia.\n\n\u2013 Strikes in west \u2013\n\nA rocket strike knocks out power in part of Lviv, the western city near Poland that has turned into a haven for the displaced due to its comparative calm, mayor Andriy Sadovy says on Twitter.\n\nMissiles also strike far to the country\u2019s west in Transcarpathia, a region bordering Hungary that has largely been spared to date, says Victor Mykyta, head of the local military administration.\n\n\u2013 Belarus launches surprise manoeuvres \u2013\n\nBelarus, a Moscow ally that shares a border with Ukraine, launches \u201csurprise\u201d military manoeuvres, to test the reactive capacity of its army, its defence ministry says.\n\nBelarus military units were testing their capacity to \u201cgo on the alert, move to predetermined zones and undertake combat training,\u201d it says.\n\n\u2013 Russia accuses Israeli \u2018mercenaries\u2019 \u2013\n\nA spokeswoman for Russia\u2019s foreign ministry claims Israeli mercenaries are fighting \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d with the far-right Azov Regiment in Ukraine.\n\nAzov rose to prominence in 2014, when its far-right activists took up arms to fight pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donbas region, but have since fallen under the command of Ukraine\u2019s military.\n\nThe comments by Maria Zakharova further fuel tensions with Israel after Russia suggested Adolf Hitler had \u201cJewish blood\u201d.\n\n\u2013 EU to support Moldova \u2013\n\nEuropean Council President Charles Michel pledges to increase EU military aid to Moldova, Ukraine\u2019s neighbour that has seen a series of attacks in a pro-Moscow separatist region.\n\n\u201cThis year we plan to significantly increase our support to Moldova by providing its armed forces with additional military equipment,\u201d Michel tells a press conference with Moldova\u2019s President Maia Sandu during a visit to the country.\n\n\u2013 Russia to boycott UN meet \u2013\n\nIn a rare move, Russia will boycott a UN Security Council meeting Wednesday with the EU\u2019s Political and Security Committee, diplomats say, a further sign of deteriorating relations between Moscow and its United Nations partners.\n\nAFP\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Emmanuel Elebeke\n\nThe Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) has said that at least 60,000 people have been killed in Nigeria\u2019s 18 northern states in the last 10 years due to insecurity,\n\nIn a new report by CDD titled \u201cMultiple Nodes, Common Cause: National Stocktake of Contemporary Insecurity and State Responses in Nigeria,\u201d the CDD said in the Northwestern states of Jigawa; Kaduna, Kano, Kebbi, Sokoto and, Zamfara about 14, 000 people lost their lives between 2011 and 2021.\n\nThe report, which was signed by CDD Director, Idayat Hassan said the report also measured conflict related casualties in the North Central states of Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Kogi, Kwara, Nasarawa, Niger and, Plateau revealed that around 11, 000 people were killed in the period under review, while about 35, 000 people were killed in Northeast states of Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Taraba and Yobe.\n\nTracing similar development and casualties across other geo-political zones, CDD in the report disclosed that similar development continued to fuel the ugly situation, especially, lack of education, absence of state actors, economic war, security forces, cultism, land use dispute, ethnicity, religion, failure of justice system, overstretched security forces and others.\n\nIn the South-South region of the country, sea piracy and robbery remained key concerns as illegal bunkering, political violence, herders/farmer clashes, oil spill, cultism, marginalisation, human trafficking, ritual killing are said to be fueling violence and insecurity.\n\nAccording to the report, the growing insecurity and violence in the country were also fueled by shifting livelihoods, circulation of small arms and light weapons, corruption and inadequate access to justice, geographic and regional dynamics as well as ideological grievances.\n\nThe report noted the increasing prevalence of misinformation and disinformation across traditional and new media spheres, which may have deepened public anxiety and intergroup tensions about the mounting insecurity in the country and state responses to it.\n\nIn the Southeastern region, the report noted an approximate number of people killed as follows: 50 people were killed in 2011; 92 in 2012; 68 in 2013; 22 in 2014; 50 in 2015; 225 in 2016; 325 people in 2017; 160 people in 2018. In 2019 the figure stood at 114; 110 in 2020 and; settled at 647 in 2021.\n\nThe report revealed that the development equally traverses the Southwestern states, especially cases of herders/farmers clashes and political issues, leading to kidnapping, rape, arson as well as inert-communal unrest and division.\n\nTo address the prevailing situation, CDD said local, and national stakeholders would need to be willing to try new approaches to curtailing insecurity, stressing that the kinetic approaches favoured by the federal government may remain a mirage.\n\n\u201cPeace building interventions are urgently needed in most if not all geopolitical zones to improve community cohesion in conflict-affected areas,\u201d the report stated. The body also called for further research to strengthen understanding of situation in the country, noting that arms flow throughout Nigeria remains imprecise and would benefit from more refined, local-level analysis and mapping of sources, destinations, and routes.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the relationship between narcotics production, consumption, and trafficking on the one hand and insecurity on the other remains largely subject to speculation. While militants are known to consume drugs (bandits, for example, consume notable quantities of Indian hemp and tramadol) it is worth interrogating whether production centres have also emerged within the country and whether bandits or other militants profit off the trans-shipment of narcotics through the country.\u201d",

The technology is also expected to bring substantial network improvements, including higher connection speed, mobility and capacity, as well as low-latency capabilities.\n\nFollowing a transparent, diligent, fair and credible auction of 3.5GHz on December 13, 2021, the National Frequency Management Council (NFMC), chaired by the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Prof. Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, had on February 22, 2022, officially handed over the spectrum allocation for 5G deployment as well as Federal Government-approved National Policy on 5G to the Commission.\n\nSubsequently, the Commission, on February 24, 2022, confirmed the full payment of $273.6 million each by the two spectrum winners, in addition to the spectrum assignment fee paid by MTN, for the 5G spectrum licence.\n\nThe Commission is optimistic that effective implementation of the National Policy on 5G will accelerate the actualisation of the national targets in the Nigerian National Broadband Plan (NNBP) 2020-2025, the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) 2020-2030, as well as other sectoral policies designed to enhance Nigeria\u2019s digital transformation.\n\nWhile the licensees are expected to meet the timetable regarding their 5G network rollout obligations, the NCC requires collective efforts and support of the private sector and government toward transforming every aspect of the nation\u2019s economy through 5G, which will herald greater transformation than what the nation witnessed with the 1G, 2G, 3G and 4G.",

          "text": "Members of the Ogun State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday protested alleged imposition of ward ad-hoc delegates by the state Executive Committee (Exco) of the party.\n\nThe protesters, who carried placards, besieged the party\u2019s secretariat located at Magbon, Abeokuta stretch of the IBB Presidential Boulevard, chanting protest songs to buttress their arguments against the party\u2019s governorship hopeful, Ladi Adebutu and some executive leaders.\n\nThey accused the National Working Committee (NWC) of working in connivance with Adebutu to impose delegates suspected to be loyal to the politician, thereby throwing away the results of a duly monitored election across the 20 local governments.\n\nSome of the inscriptions on their placards read: \u201cIyochia Ayu, Save Ogun PDP from autocracy\u201d, \u201cElection rigging is worst than armed robbery\u201d, \u201cRecognised elections monitored by INEC\u2019, No INEC, no Election\u2019, \u2018Ogun PDP position not for questionable characters\u2019, \u2018Enough of Ladi Adebutu imposition in Ogun PDP\u2019, and \u2018Ogun PDP, not an arm of Baba Ijebu\u2019.\n\nThe leader of the protesters, Idris Taiwo Olabode, said the party was streamlined to favour just a candidate at the coming governorship primaries, adding that it was a dangerous trend which would work against the party in the general election.\n\n\u201cOn Saturday, delegates\u2019 elections were held in all the 20 local governments of Ogun State, but the National Working Committee from Abuja accepted the results of the local governments, whose chairmen are loyal to Ladi Adebutu and disregarded the remaining.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a case where the leadership of the party is unfair and unjust. It is very dangerous for the party.\n\n\u201cIt means the NWC are trying to disregard an election duly monitored by INEC, and trying to forcefully announce the results of a small group of people, who in any case, did not hold any congress. If they held any congress, let them provide video evidence.\n\n\u201cBut there is a group who held a congress, duly monitored by INEC, DSS, the Police and the Civil Defence. There is pictorial and video evidence for this.\n\n\u201cThe implication is that Ladi Adebutu is trying to impose an unpopular delegate over a popular delegate. How can a man select over 40 elective posts in the party? He is trying to impose delegates in all the local governments for his selfish purpose. This is uncalled for,\u201d he added.\n\nThe protesters called on the state Exco, led by Sikirulai Ogundele, to look into the matter, noting that the issue, if not properly managed, might spell doom for the party at the general election in 2023.",

          "text": "By Emmanuel Badejo, Frank Ikpefan, Abuja and Osagie Otabor, Akure\n\nThe agitation for zoning of the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) intensified yesterday.\n\nOndo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu urged the ruling party to make a categorical statement on which zone should produce its next presidential candidate.\n\nHe said the principle of rotation guided the party\u2019s decision at the recent national convention in Abuja.\n\nAkeredolu maintained in a statement in Akure that it was the turn of the southern part of the country to produce the next president.\n\nHe said the adoption of a power shift would make the APC avoid self-inflicted crises ahead of next year\u2019s election.\n\nAlso yesterday, Ijaw leader Chief Edwin Clark, former Senate Majority Leader Ali Ndume and Employment and Labour Minister Chris Ngige renewed their call for zoning in the spirit of equity, fairness and justice.\n\nUrging the party leadership to make a pronouncement on zoning without delay, Akeredolu said: \u201cIt will be disingenuous for anyone to argue against rotation at this period.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe must not keep our party men and women guessing on the position of the leadership of the party. This is the time to weigh in and take control of the process.\n\n\u201cNo statement must suggest, even remotely, that the party harbours certain sentiments, which may predispose it to consider throwing the contest open. This is certainly not the time for equivocation. Equity dictates we take a stand.\n\n\u201cWe cannot, therefore, afford any internal bickering, which holds the potential promise of causing distrust and militating against cohesion, harmony and the zeal to achieve set objectives.\n\n\u201cThe current democratic dispensation is anchored on the unwritten convention driven by a principle of equity.\n\n\u201cPolitical expediency dictates, more appealingly, that while adhering to the spirit and letters of the laws guiding the conduct of elections and succession to political offices, we must do nothing capable of tilting the delicate balance against the established arrangement which guarantees peace and promotes trust.\n\n\u201cOur party just elected officers on the established principle of giving every part of the country an important stake in the political calculus.\n\n\u201cThe focus has now shifted to the process, which will culminate in the participation of our party in the general elections scheduled for next year.\n\n\u201cAll lovers of peace and freedom must do everything to eschew tendencies, which may predispose them to taking decisions which promote distrust and lead to a crisis, the end of which nobody may be able to predict.\n\n\u201cIt is expected, fervently, that it will proceed to complete the process by limiting the propensities for disagreement to a region for possible micro-management. It is very expedient that we avoid self-inflicted crises before the general elections.\u201d\n\nNdume backs Akeredolu on Southern presidency\n\nNdume, who spoke on Channels yesterday, agreed with Akeredolu\u2019s position, saying that it would be unfair for the party to do otherwise.\n\nThe senator, who said the principle of zoning was part of the federal character, added that zoning was adhered to during the election of party executives.\n\nNdume said: \u201cI support the position of Governor Akeredolu 100 per cent. I adopt the counsel of the governor to the party.\n\n\u201cI believe in equity, fairness and justice. This, we did during the emergence of our national chairman. That was why nobody from the south contested for the chairmanship position of our party.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, based on the principle of zoning, it was agreed that the presidency should be zoned to the north. And that was why most of those that contested were from the north. This time around, I don\u2019t think that should change.\u201d\n\nNdume dismissed the argument that zoning would disenfranchise some Nigerians.\n\nHe believes zoning and rotation are issues of equity under the principle of federal character, which according to him, covers both elective and appointive positions.\n\nHe added: \u201cOn the principles of fairness, justice and equity, we should allow the south to put forward their candidates and let the party members decide.\u201d\n\nHe said though he was not at the top of the party affairs, he expressed confidence in President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s desire and determination to ensure justice and equity prevail.\n\nWhen asked if the APC would heed Akeredolu\u2019s call, Ndume said: \u201cI am hopeful that the party under the leadership of Abdullahi Adamu, the APC chairman, will heed the counsel by Governor Akeredolu.\u201d\n\nHe said Adamu was quoted out of context when he said the party has not taken a position on zoning.\n\nHe disagreed with the notion that if the PDP gives its ticket to a northern aspirant, the APC should also do the same.\n\nHe said as a northerner, many from the region, especially the poor, believe in equity and justice.\n\nLending his voice to the demand for a power shift, Ngige said it was in tandem with the agreement of the founding fathers of the APC when it was formed in 2014.\n\nNgige, who spoke with our reporter on phone on Tuesday, said: \u201cMy position on zoning is what the founding fathers agreed on and the subsequent organs of the party have been adopting and doing.\n\n\u201cFor example, they decided that party positions in the South should go to the North and all in the North go to the South. That is what it is. There is no cause for alarm.\n\n\u201cThe South should have the Presidency in 2023. That is what the founding fathers agreed and that is what our organs of the party had been implementing.\n\n\u201cPresidency North, chairman South and thereafter, Presidency South, chairman North. We have done chairman North during our convention.\n\n\u201cSo, we are now operating for the elective offices, which the presidency is the numero uno. There is no cause for alarm.\u201d\n\nThe minister allayed the fears of party members over plans to jettison the zoning of the Presidency.\n\nHe said at the right time, the party would make its position known.\n\nNgige said: \u201cThe National Chairman says the party has not officially zoned the Presidency and if he says so, that is what it is.\n\n\u201cWe have organs of the party and the organ that can speak now after him (Adamu) is the National Working Committee.\n\n\u201cLuckily, a lot of members of the working committee were members when we formed the legacy party called APC.\n\n\u201cThey are members of All Nigeria Peoples Party, Congress for Progressive Change, a portion of the All Progressives Grand Alliance and of course, the Action Congress of Nigeria, being the major and most senior partner in the whole arrangement. We came there with six governors.\n\n\u201cWe have no fear. They all know what the agreement was at the formation and they all know what the subsequent NEC and conventions have been adopted.\n\n\u201cAt the right time, I think not too long to come, they will make the position of the party known.\u201d\n\nYouth leaders across the six geo-political zones called on the two major political parties \u2013 the APC and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to zone their 2023 presidential tickets to the South to foster equity, justice and unity.\n\nThey said since the North has produced President Muhammadu Buhari, his successor should come from the South.\n\nThe youth leaders made their position known in a joint statement by Okpanachi Jacob (Northcentral); Mr Femi Akindele Lawson (Southwest); Alhaji Ibrahim Mohammed (Northwest); Dr. Uzoh Chukwuemeka (Southeast) and Blessing Hossanah (Southsouth).\n\nConvener, Concerned Nigeria Citizens, Femi Osabinu, who addressed reporters in Abuja on behalf of the youth leaders warned that if zoning was jettisoned, it may throw the country into confusion and shake the unity of the nation.\n\nThere is no doubt that the North has had its fair share of the country\u2019s leadership for the past seven years and now it is time to zone the Presidency to the Southern part of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe thus urge all political parties to follow what will retain the unity of the country and zone presidency to Southern states come 2023. Parties should stop playing politics with Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe hereby reiterate our call for the need of our political parties to shift power to the South for equity, justice and unity of the country. This will sustain our unity and ensure that the country remains one with each region seeing itself as a stakeholder in the Nigeria Project.\n\n\u201cWe must respect zoning, and now is the time for this to be done,\u201d he added.\n\nThe leader of the Pan Niger Delta Forum, Edwin Clark, insisted that the next president should come from the Southeast extraction.\n\nHe alleged that Southerners are treated as second-class citizens in the country, adding that there may be no Nigeria without zoning in 2023.\n\nHe spoke on Arise TV.\n\nAccording to him, there is a monopoly of leadership by the North.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy idea of zoning the Presidency to the South-East is well-known. No Nigerian will like to live in a country where certain people believe that they have the only right to lead.\n\n\u201cNigeria stood on three legs, and it has never been steady since one of the legs was destroyed during the Civil War.\n\n\u201cIf zoning which will heal the wounds is not done, there will be no Nigeria. Nobody will remain in this country as a second class citizen.\n\n\u201cThe North believes their population can be used to oppress other Nigerians. This is not acceptable. The era of that has gone. There are many good Northerners but the Fulani-oriented ones want to dominate everywhere.\u201d",

          "text": "Dangote Oil Refinery, which is reputed to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refinery, may soon run into a deep financial crisis as a result of a $7 billion debt burden \u2013 a situation which indicates a possible takeover of the project by the Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON).\n\nDangote Refinery is an oil refinery owned by the Dangote Group that is under construction in Lekki, Nigeria.\n\nDangote Group is a Nigerian multinational industrial conglomerate, founded by Aliko Dangote, Africa's richest man.\n\nThe Group's interests span a range of sectors in Nigeria and across Africa.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Money Management Series, Dangote Oil Refinery, a 650,000-barrel per day (BPD) integrated refinery project under construction in the Lekki Free Zone, Lagos, Nigeria, was expected to commence production in 2016 with $3.3 billion financing secured in 2013.\n\nWith the refinery now projected to commence operations in 2025, Dangote Group\u2019s indebtedness to financial institutions is estimated to hit $8.4 billion by 2025.\n\nPresently, this debt burden has risen to $7 billion with debt servicing of almost $700 million per annum.\n\nThe completion date of the refinery has been moved eight times.\n\nWhilst some might say this is not in the character for Dangote Industries and their numerous projects across different sectors, the problem is deeply rooted.\n\nA contractor at the delayed refinery project, speaking under the condition of anonymity, said that poor planning, underpayment of contractors, and a lack of proper project management with over 40 contractors on site have led to most of the delays. He also added that of the 40, none is willing to commission as there is no clear delegation of duty and over-decentralisation leading to absolute chaos.\n\nWith these incessant delays, some financing banks are already calling in their loans amid fears of liquidity crisis, while others are elated by the guarantee of huge interests to be recouped as soon as the refinery comes on stream.\n\nDangote has been able to restructure the facilities from various local and international banks twice so far, but most banks have totally refused to restructure for the third time with principal repayment also falling due as well as the annual interest payments.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has made available $3.8 billion as part of federal government\u2019s 20% equity in the project, providing $1 billion cash, while the remaining $2.8 billion will be in crude supply.\n\nHowever, analysts have pointed out that NNPC\u2019s 20% equity at $3.8 billion makes the Dangote refinery overvalued at $19 billion.\n\nWhen Aliko Dangote unveiled early plans for the refinery in September 2013 and announced that he had secured about $3.3 billion in financing for the project, the refinery was estimated to cost about $9 billion, of which $3 billion would be invested by the Dangote Group and the remainder via commercial loans, and begin production in 2016.\n\nHowever, after a change in location to Lekki, construction of the refinery did not begin until 2016 with excavation and infrastructure preparation, and the planned completion was pushed back to late 2018.\n\nIn July 2017, major structural construction began, and Dangote estimated that the refinery would be mechanically complete in late 2019 and commissioned in early 2020. Experts, however, posit that the construction would likely take at least twice as long as Dangote publicly stated, with refining capability not likely to be achieved until 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, last week the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, reiterated that Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the acquisition of 20 per cent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refinery.\n\nSylva, while briefing State House correspondents after the virtual FEC meeting presided by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo last Wednesday at the Presidential Villa, said the acquisition was in the sum of $2.76 billion.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Council also approved the acquisition of 20 percent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refineries in the sum of $2.76 billion,\u201d he said.\n\nThis development has been described by industry observers as strange because $2.76 billion falls short of 20 percent of the Dangote project valued by the sponsor at $16 billion. Using the $16 billion value, 20 percent should be $3.2 billion and analysts have expressed dissatisfaction at the disparity in the project\u2019s value and NNPC\u2019s funding.\n\nSpeaking with MMS Plus on the complexities with funding Dangote refinery, the Managing Director of Cowry Assets Management, Mr. Johnson Chukwu, argued that the banks wouldn\u2019t have any challenge from the financing because Dangote would have to pay the interests.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the banks being unable to meet their liquidity because of the monies tied down in the Dangote refinery. Ultimately, if the investment is economically viable, when it starts operation it should be able to meet up the arrears. I believe the banks that went into this project understood some of these constraints and didn\u2019t break their balance-sheets in the move to finance Dangote refinery. I don\u2019t envisage any bank having a liquidity challenge as a result of investing in Dangote refinery. If there is any challenge it would come from Dangote, but it should be resolved when the project takes off,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on the possibility that NNPC over-valued or under-valued the project in its 20% equity, Chukwu opined that NNPC may be looking at an enterprise valuation while the other value could be the net value.\n\n\u201cThe enterprise value could be higher than the amount Dangote has invested in the project. However, I wasn\u2019t involved in determining that, so anything I say will be purely speculative,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the massive support of the Nigerian government on the refinery project, things have got so bad for the billionaire that even income from his other businesses may not be enough to cover the interest rates, let alone the principal.\n\nThe $8.4 billion debt represents 75% of Dangote\u2019s net worth at $11.1 billion and Africa\u2019s richest man has to seek innovative ways to prop up his business now as the refinery project continues to be consistently delayed.",

We have enclosed herein and marked \u2018Annexure 1\u2019our proposal in that regard.\n\n\u201cFor data services, we wish to request that the commission implements the recommendations in the August 2020 KPMG report on the determination of cost-based pricing for wholesale and retail broadband service in Nigeria. Excerpts from the report are attached and marked \u2018Annexure 2\u2019 to provide a further illustration.\n\n\u201cIn implementing the said recommendations, however, we recommend that the 40 per cent increase in the cost of doing business be factored in to arrive at a cost price per GB in view of the current economic situation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group also highlighted other demands to the commission such as to explore other penalties for operators other than punitive monetary sanctions, extend the payment timeline of relevant regulatory levies and fees, prevail on the federal government to sign the executive order declaring telecoms infrastructure as a critical national infrastructure to mitigate cost spent replacing damaged and stolen infrastructures, among others.\n\nIt added that the Mobile (Voice) Termination Rate (MTR) for voice, administrative data floor price and cost of SMS as reflected in extant instruments should also be increased.\n\n\u201cFor large operators, a new interim MTR of N5.46 from N3.90 reflecting 40 per cent increase in the cost of business,\u201d ALTON said.\n\n\u201cFor small operators, the new interim MTR of N6.58 from N4.70 reflects a 40 per cent increase in the cost of business.\u201d",

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nDo you use TikTok? If yes, why do you use it? I agree that it\u2019s just as addictive as Twitter or any other platform, perhaps even more so. But why is nearly every video social networking app attempting to compete with TikTok?\n\nI mean, YouTube launched the YouTube Shorts Fund in 2021 to reward content creators. Also, Instagram heavily promoted short-form videos to creators and users alike, offering cash bonuses to top Reels creators.\n\nStill, Instagram is looking for ways to keep users on its platform. Could it be because TikTok \u2014 launched in 2016 \u2014 was the most downloaded app in the first quarter of 2022, beating out a slew of Meta-owned apps?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI understand that this may be a source of frustration for the Meta team, but wasn\u2019t it just last month that Instagram said it would stop recommending TikTok videos to the users?\n\nYet, yesterday, May 3, 2022, Instagram announced that it\u2019s testing a feature similar to TikTok that will provide a full-screen vertical home feed created to \u201cbring video more front and centre.\u201d\n\nEssentially, Instagram is still coming for TikTok users. Once more, why do you use the app? What sets it apart from YouTube Shorts or Reels? I look forward to hearing from you.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nTwitter is testing Twitter Circle\n\nFacebook to shut down its podcast platform\n\nTwitter is testing Twitter Circle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Claudio Schwarz | @purzlbaum on Unsplash\n\nYesterday, Tuesday, May 3, 2022, Twitter announced a limited test for Twitter Circle.\n\nNote that the feature was revealed as one of several potential product updates in July 2021. Following that, in April 2022, it appeared live on the site due to a bug.\n\nWhat\u2019s Twitter Circle? It is a feature that allows you to control who sees your tweets and who appears in your replies.\n\nThis means that people who are already members of your Circle will be able to see the tweets you post to it, but they will be unable to use the built-in retweet icon to share them automatically.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe feature will allow you to invite up to 150 people to your Circle, including followers and non-followers.\n\nConsequently, when you want to tweet without sharing with the general public, you can pull up the Choose Audience menu while writing a tweet and select Twitter Circle instead of Everyone.\n\nI probably know what you\u2019re thinking. It works in the same way as Twitter Communities. Well, you\u2019re wrong! They are different.\n\nHow? Even though Communities also hide tweets \u2014 an attempt to prevent \u201ccontext collapse\u201d \u2014Twitter Circle differs because Communities are tied to specific discussions. In contrast, Circle is just standard tweets that aren\u2019t visible to everyone.\n\nThe copycat game: It\u2019s a feature similar to Instagram\u2019s Close Friends and Google Plus feature\n\nThe company announced that beginning yesterday, some Twitter users can start creating their own Twitter Circle because the feature is still in its early stages.\n\nFor the time being, the select few who will have access to Twitter Circle can only create one Circle, and only the person who creates the Circle can see the list of people who are members of it.\n\nIf you\u2019re not part of the \u201cchosen ones,\u201d don\u2019t worry about it because I\u2019m not too. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 And even if you can\u2019t create a Twitter Circle, you can see tweets from users who can, as long as you\u2019re in their Circle.\n\nInterestingly, the feature is available on iOS, Android, and the web. Most importantly, if you\u2019re in a Circle, you can\u2019t leave it, but you can mute a discussion if you don\u2019t want to be a part of it.\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Fisayo Fosudo\u2019s escapades in tech and finance to Hillary Omitogun\u2019s journey as a Web3 UX researcher at Nestcoin, we have a star-studded line-up of speakers at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit (TABS 2022).\n\nTickets are selling out fast; save a seat for yourself here.\n\nFacebook to shut down its podcast platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you listen to podcasts on Facebook? I\u2019m guessing you do not. You can prove me wrong, though. Can you? If you can, I have some news for you.\n\nThe word starts with \u201cs\u201d: Social media giant, Facebook, is shutting down its podcast platform. This comes almost a year after its launch in June 2021.\n\nWhat does this signify? According to Bloomberg, creators will be unable to upload new shows to the platform as of this week, and the platform will be completely closed on June 3, 2022.\n\nWhy? Facebook claims the move is part of a larger overhaul of the company\u2019s audio offerings. In addition, Meta\u2019s \u2014 Facebook\u2019s parent company \u2014 spokesperson, Adelaide Coronado, stated that the changes would \u201csimplify\u201d the company\u2019s audio offerings.\n\nHowever, according to a report by 9to5Mac, an Apple news and reviews platform, the company is yielding to other competing podcasting platforms, like Apple Music and Spotify, which dominate the market.\n\nRemember that Facebook launched the podcast feature last year when streaming service giant, Spotify, began to acquire exclusive content creators. This also occurred when Apple\u2019s podcasting service announced the availability of subscriptions for its existing content.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the company is discontinuing its central audio hub and its short-form audio product called Soundbites. Also, it\u2019s incorporating its live-streaming Live Audio Rooms feature \u2013 essentially a clone of the once-popular audio app Clubhouse \u2013 into its larger Facebook Live suite.\n\nI think now it\u2019s a good time to revisit this: First test of Clubhouse-like Facebook audio features begins\n\nAlthough we know Facebook\u2019s podcasting service will be phased out on June 3, 2022, the social media giant has yet to provide a shutdown date for both Soundbites and the audio hub.\n\nMoreso, Facebook is reportedly focusing on other opportunities with podcast partners, like metaverse events and eCommerce.\n\nMeta is also said to be prioritising short-form video projects over other initiatives, most likely due to increased competition from popular short-form video platforms.\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

Looking forward, Mushe hopes to work with video game providers to help metaverse gamers monetize their skills too.\n\nFacilitating transactions\n\nThe DeFi pioneer aims to become the only financial app users need. Mushe wants to help users swap back and forth between cryptocurrencies and fiat with ease, send money transfers and pay for goods and services.\n\nDeveloped by financial experts with years of experience, Mushe plans to cover all bases by offering prepaid cards connected to current accounts and allowing users to spend with merchant partners and send money in fiat or crypto to contacts, without fuss.\n\nKeeping it current\n\nThese current accounts will minimize the time needed to transfer between cryptos and fiat, and give users peace of mind knowing that their accounts are secure, easily accessible, and even able to receive their monthly salaries.\n\nBoth the user ID and the token\u2019s validity will need to be verified before transactions can be made, which will offer an added level of security.\n\nRewarding loyal users\n\nMushe aims to reward peer-to-peer interaction and trading, rewarding users for using its services and for their loyalty, as well as incentivizing ethical initiatives and behavior.\n\nNot only that, but Mushe will also allow business users to utilize Mushe token reward schemes to complement their marketing campaigns, incentivizing consumers to get involved.\n\nAiming to be a positive force for good, Mushe will let the community decide which charitable organizations will receive the one percent of Mushe tokens set aside to contribute to a healthier world.\n\nProviding financial education\n\nIn an exciting world developing at breakneck speed, financial education is necessary to ensure accessibility to the crypto world for all.\n\nMushe will offer tools and share knowledge to help users get up to speed on everything they need to know. It plans to provide market information, explain the jargon, and break down the trickier elements, educating users about the benefits and risks of new opportunities and helping them grow their investments.\n\nA whole new ecosystem\n\nThe MusheVerse is a simple ecosystem that does away with the complexities common in the crypto world. XMU is interoperable across fiat and crypto, the Mushe Wallet is seamlessly integrated, and users can trade and transfer with Mushe Swap.\n\nThe MusheVerse facilitates e-commerce, while Mushe Chat will allow users to connect socially. A more accessible crypto-token, education on digital assets forms a large part of the service, empowering decisions and financial choices with knowledgable reports and without the jargon.\n\nLearn more about Mushe (XMU)\n\n\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.mushe.world/\n\nPresale Registration : https://portal.mushe.world/sign-up\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/MusheWorldXMU\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Mushe_World\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/mushe_world/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

          "text": "This article is a Brand Press post. Brand Press is a paid service for brands that want to reach Techpoint Africa\u2019s audience directly. Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team doesn\u2019t write Brand Press content. To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to data from Coingecko, there are over 16,000 cryptocurrencies in circulation. Only around 10% of these will be around for the long haul. If you are new to cryptocurrency and don\u2019t know where to begin, any of the five coins highlighted in this article could be considered for an investment. The five cryptos are:\n\nEthereum (ETH) XRP (XRP) Gala Games (GALA) Chiliz (CHZ) FIREPIN Token (FRPN)\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at why we think these five cryptos will be good additions to your portfolio.\n\nEthereum\n\nEthereum (ETH) is a layer one, open-source platform for decentralised apps (dApps). The goal is to establish a decentralised global computer upon which anybody may build. Ethereum enables smart contracts, which allow developers to programme digital currency using code, as well as to create NFTs, DeFi and DEX platforms.\n\nWith an ETH 2.0 upgrade scheduled for release in summer 2022, Ethereum is expected to continue its path to cryptocurrency dominance, with many predicting it could hit $10,000 and dethrone Bitcoin (BTC) for the number one slot.\n\nXRP\n\nXRP is the native token of Ripple Labs, a company that is revolutionising the banking and financial sectors by enabling quick and cheap cross border payments between establishments. The current SWIFT system is old, slow and expensive with transactions taking up to 5 days sometimes. With XRP any transaction will be completed in under two seconds to anywhere in the world.\n\nRipple Labs has been locked in a lawsuit with the SEC for over a year now which has negatively affected the price of XRP. Over the coming years and after the lawsuit is settled, the price of XRP is expected to moon to heights not seen before, with financial experts predicting it should be on a similar level to Ethereum in terms of market cap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGala Games\n\nGala Games (GALA) is one of the forefront projects in the world of the Metaverse. With crypto gaming (GameFi) becoming more popular by the day, it shouldn\u2019t be long before global adoption of crypto, from the video gaming industry, is established.\n\nGala Games is an ecosystem similar to Steam in that it will be a platform where multiple games will be available for playing and downloading. Users will be able to earn real-world fiat currency by completing tasks in-game via NFTs and then exchanging their earnings for GALA. As the Metaverse gains traction, expect to see the early adoption tokens such as Gala Games (GALA) see significant price increases.\n\nChiliz\n\nChiliz (CHZ) is another NFT and Metaverse ecosystem that is making waves in the cryptocurrency world. Instead of gaming, CHZ is used primarily for the sports and entertainment sectors. Sports memorabilia and collectables have been popular pastimes for many years now. Chiliz is taking that hobby and bringing it to the digital age.\n\nVia the Chiliz platform and its multitude of fan tokens that have launched, users will be able to collect digital cards, photos and videos in the form of NFTs. These NFTs can then be sold in exchange for CHZ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIREPIN Token\n\nFIREPIN Token (FRPN) is a brand new cryptocurrency that is still in its presale, meaning that you have a fantastic chance of investing in a project in its infancy. FIREPIN Token aims to be a fully integrated Metaverse community platform that has plans to produce the next generation of video games.\n\nAlongside this, FIREPIN Token can be utilised as a multi-chain cryptocurrency. This means that it is easily swappable between five of the most used blockchains. The five networks are:\n\nEthereum\n\nBNB\n\nSolana\n\nAvalanche\n\nPolygon\n\nWhen it comes to NFTs and developing apps, users will now be able to use FRPN to find the cheapest and quickest blockchain to facilitate their respective transactions.\n\nThese are the five cryptocurrencies that we believe have the strongest long term fundamentals and will be around for a long time. Before investing in cryptocurrency you should research any project thoroughly.\n\nFind Out More Here:\n\nJoin Presale: https://presale.firepin.io/register\n\nWebsite: https://firepin.io/\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/FIREPINOFFICIAL\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FIREPIN_io\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

We will link education with street begging and street children.\n\n\u201cIn the next few weeks or months, we will not allow street begging in Edo anymore. We have farm settlements and we need hands and labour to cultivate foods. People arrested from where they are begging will be evacuated to the farm settlements to work and if they don\u2019t want to work, they will be sent back to where they come from.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have just employed 3,062 teachers in the rural communities as they have just finished their training. We will make sure those hard-to-reach areas in the riverine communities will have teachers to teach the children. We are training them now to work in those communities,\u201d he added.\n\nCharging the Muslim faithful on tolerance, Obaseki stated, \u201cWe all must learn to be tolerant to be able to overcome the economic pressure in the land.\n\n\u201cAs a government, we will never deceive our people because the people gave us power through the electoral process to lead them.\n\n\u201cOur administration is working hard to create more jobs and opportunities for the people of the State and ensure life is better for them. We are also creating a peaceful environment, infrastructure and security to make the State safe.\u201d\n\nReassuring that his administration will continue to use resources of the state for the growth and development of Edo, the governor added, \u201cAs a government, we will continue to emphasize that government money is not for few politicians but for the generality of the public and will not be used for politicians but for the people. We will continue to work for the people of Edo State, not for a few politicians.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Chief Imam of Benin Central Mosque, Alhaji Abdulfatai Enabulele commended the governor for his developmental strides across all sectors of the state, hailing him for his efforts at ending street begging in the state.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u2026hail ANPA for free medical outreach in Edo\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki and the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire have called for more private sector involvement in achieving a strong and effective healthcare system that will guarantee delivery of quality and efficient healthcare services to citizens.\n\nThe duo made the call during a dinner organized for members of the Association of Nigeria Physicians in the Americas (ANPA) who are in Edo State on a one-week medical mission, providing specialised healthcare services to the people of Edo State.\n\nDuring the medical mission, over 5,000 Edo residents benefitted from the free surgical intervention and treatments for heart, kidney, eye and other ailments.\n\nHailing the association for the free medical outreach, Obaseki said the mission has provided better healthcare for Edo people.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have received the fundamental benefit of hope to Edo people as you gave renewed life to Edo people. You also engaged in capacity building as you interchanged skills and made your colleagues here locally improve their knowledge. They have learned new ways of doing things. You have brought a new way of commitment and dedication to duty.\n\n\u201cYou have fulfilled your call of service to humanity as the team restored lives during this mission by providing free medical service.\u201d\n\nThe governor noted that the activities of ANPA in Edo State have helped the government rethink the issue of brain drain, adding, \u201cYou are in the position to help us tackle brain drain. This mission has been so helpful as I believe that we can do two missions per year. Your services to Edo people are invaluable to the healthcare regeneration of our state and country at large.\u201d\n\nHe further stated, \u201cTo transform or reform any healthcare system in the world, we must focus on the people. It\u2019s about the quality of human capacity and development. I am grateful to God that we have you. We need to organise ourselves to receive the value you are ready to give us.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Ehanire has commended the collaboration between ANPA and the state government, noting, \u201cNigeria suffers from brain drains as the country\u2019s medical personnel have left to practice abroad. It\u2019s difficult to stop them despite several plans as it affects not only Nigeria but across the globe.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI applaud the plan for telemedicine which has been experimented in America during the COVID-19 era with the help of technology which became very useful over there. Technology allows for virtual consultation between experts in the Diaspora and their patients here in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe would like to institutionalize such a relationship to enable us share knowledge and skills and begin to develop the health sector here in Nigeria. We are waiting for the signature of the president to create the National Health Insurance Commission that will make health insurance mandatory for all Nigerians and increase the physical space for health.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

The design is almost ready. Once they finalize with the design in the next few weeks, we will award the contract.\n\n\u201cThis road will also serve as a by-pass to decongest traffic from Ikpoba-Okha road to Upper Mission; you know how it is, you will just wake and you will see it.\u201d\n\nReassuring the completion of the Labour House, the governor noted, \u201cLet me also remind you that this labour building has some commercial spaces in the property so that they can also use it to sustain and maintain the building. That\u2019s why you see that there are warehouses in the basement.\n\n\u201cThey took advantage of the topography to build warehouses. Hopefully, they will get income from that. It has a multipurpose hall which can be put into commercial use to generate income. Also, there are enough office spaces for the unions and their affiliates; that is the purpose of this building.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur goal was to celebrate this year\u2019s Workers Day in this building, but due to some unforeseen circumstances, particularly the early downpour, the contractor has assured us that by July or August this year, this place will be ready,\u201d Obaseki assured.\n\nIn his contribution, Olaye commended the governor for the massive project, assuring of the support and collaboration of workers in the state to ensure the realization of the Making Edo Great Again (MEGA) Agenda.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

We have option for the Governor and the option is that he should go and borrow at least a sum of 50 billon naira to settle our entitlement,\u201d he said.\n\nHe accused the former governor of the state and current Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola of deducting from their salary and refusing to remit it Describing Aregbesola\u2019s action as criminal and inhumane.\n\nHe, however, appealed to the state government to issue the contributory pensioners, letters of promotions that they were due for, while in the service of the state.\n\n\u201cThese promotions should be equally monetized, to give the beneficiaries, a good sense of belonging, while still serving.\u201d he Said\n\nHe said the pensioners would have no other option than to take the Osun government to court should their demand and appealed not considered.\n\n\u201cTo avoid any legal action, the government should pay the accrued of penal fine of at least 2% on the money deducted from our salaries including the government counterpart fund it failed to remit to our Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs).\n\n\u201cThis is sequel to the state government running foul of the contributory pension law of Osun State as enacted by the parliament in 2008 with reference to sub-section 5b and 7, contained in pages 18 and 19.\u201d he said\n\nHe said it was specified that the state Government, inter alia shall ensure that pensioners who leave or retire from the Public Service of the state receive their terminal benefits as, and when due.\n\nAccording to him the government has continuously depriving them of their entitlements and thereby making life unbearable for the them and there family.\n\nHe was on the opinion that the pension of this relevant law, grossly inadequate and intermittent remittances of Government counterpart funds have deprived the contributory pensioners, covered by the dates.\n\nIt should be noted that fundings were made in 2018 and 2019 for retired contributory pensioners from 2016 to 2022, Six years after retirement.\n\n\u201cWe want the state government and general public to note that the leadership of the entire members of the Joint Forum of Pensioners have been treading on the threshold of psychological and intellectual paths, such that our agitations for our well deserved retirement benefits should not be misconstrued as being used by any political party/group.\n\n\u201cWe wish that the Government should note that for more than Six (6)years, majority of this category of state retirees have not received a dime as human beings, and Nigerians who had served their state and fatherland diligently for thirty five (35)years or 60/65 years of retirement age, we should be entitled to the fruits of our labour.\n\n\u201cThe estimated total amount of the Half Salary Arrears owed by the state government to the contributory pensioners, is in excess of Seven (7) Billion Naira\n\n\u201cWe served with black hair and we should not be begging with gray hair before we get our entitlement.\n\n\u201cOur members are dying because anytime they remember the millions of Naira they contributed while in the service without having access to it they break down. I can count the number of our people that have paralized, the number of people that have been amputated due to diabetes which they could not treat medically because of the fund and I can count the number of our colleagues who have died .\n\n\u201cTo be at home six years without payment, this is very pathetic. Many of our children have been rusticated from Osun State University UNIOSUN because we could not pay their school fees. Until our entitlement is paid we would continue to shout.\u201d he said",

In 2019 the figure stood at 114; 110 in 2020 and; settled at 647 in 2021.\n\nThe report revealed that the development equally traverses the Southwestern states, especially cases of herders/farmers clashes and political issues, leading to kidnapping, rape, arson as well as inert-communal unrest and division.\n\nTo address the prevailing situation, CDD said local, and national stakeholders would need to be willing to try new approaches to curtailing insecurity, stressing that the kinetic approaches favoured by the federal government may remain a mirage.\n\n\u201cPeace building interventions are urgently needed in most if not all geopolitical zones to improve community cohesion in conflict-affected areas,\u201d the report stated. The body also called for further research to strengthen understanding of situation in the country, noting that arms flow throughout Nigeria remains imprecise and would benefit from more refined, local-level analysis and mapping of sources, destinations, and routes.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the relationship between narcotics production, consumption, and trafficking on the one hand and insecurity on the other remains largely subject to speculation. While militants are known to consume drugs (bandits, for example, consume notable quantities of Indian hemp and tramadol) it is worth interrogating whether production centres have also emerged within the country and whether bandits or other militants profit off the trans-shipment of narcotics through the country.\u201d",

We can target 70 percent coverage in ten years.\u201c\n\nOnyekpere also called for advocacy among stakeholders on the right to life and prioritisation of health in the financing and budgeting cycle.\n\n\u201cAdvocacy for ensuring that a Budget Call Circular takes specific cognisance of the right to health is imperative for the formulation of health responsive and transformative estimates.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s not just about government alone, It is about private sector, civil society, religious institution and others knowing that health is one of the building blocks of right to life\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe can begin to change customs that deprive people of the right to health\u201d Onyekpere added.\u201c\n\nOnyekpere stressed that \u201cNigeria is bound by national and international standards on the right to health and these include at the international level, the standard setting Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) , Goal 3 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the regional African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (ACHPR).\u201d\n\n\u2018Others include the Alma-Ata Declaration on Primary Health Care clarified in the Declaration of Asanta. The states and local governments, being parts of the Federal Republic of Nigeria are bound by these standards.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the national level, there is the constitutional obligation under the Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy on adequate medical and health facilities for all persons; National Health Act of 2014, National Primary Health Care Development Agency Act, National Health Insurance Scheme Act, National Health Policy of 2016 and the National Strategic Health Development Plan (NSHDP) 2018-2022,\u201d the right to health is an empowering right that greatly facilitates the realization and enjoyment of other rights.

The coalition of the northern movie practitioners pray that the minister should intervene and address the matter accordingly,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe association said the MOPPAN chairman was also sidelined in organizing the event.\n\nIt said, \u201cSometimes on 16th February 2022, NFC appointed our National President of MOPPAN as chairman, Local Organizing Committee (LOC), Kano and Kaduna axis, with two other members for the objective of mobilising stakeholders from the northern part of the country to effectively participate in the festival.\n\n\u201cThe letter of the appointment directed the committee to forward its detailed proposal on how to execute the task given.\n\n\u201cWithout wasting much time, the committee under Dr. Sarari, humbly honoured the directive given by NFC, and forwarded all necessary information, including other parts of its assignment, but as at the time of sending the petition to the honourable minister, the committee is yet to get a formal response, or any form of correspondences from the organizers, despite series of publications the NFC made on national dailies, informing Nigerians that Kannywood is also part of the organizing team.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, the LOC axis of our brothers from the southern part of the country (Lagos), was carried along with full support.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the statement said, NFC sent a correspondence to one of the Kannywood\u2019s highly respected elders, and legendary actors, Alhaji\n\nIbrahim Mandawari, informing him that he was one of those recipients of this year\u2019s \u2018LifeTime Achievement Award\u2019 but shortly before the opening ceremony, Mandawari was shocked to be informed by the organisers that he is no longer a recipient.\n\nThe associations said he was removed from the list without any genuine reason.\n\n\u201cThey simply informed him that he is no longer part of the previous plan. Others selected from other parts of the country were maintained.\n\n\u201cKannywood is the Northern axis of the Nigerian movie/Music industry, which is based in Kano State. It has, over the years, contributed immensely to job creation, youth empowerment, mobilization and above all creating awareness in line with government activities, social responsibilities, culture reorientation, and entertainment,\u201d the statement added.",

          "text": "Ijebu-Ode born Abidemi Rufai and former aide of Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun state has pleaded guilty to a series of fraud cases against him in federal court in Tacoma, Washington state, prosecutors said.\n\nRufai, 45, who gave his home address as Lekki, Lagos, acknowledged in U.S. District Court that he used stolen identities to receive more than $350,000 in pandemic-related unemployment benefits from Washington state.\n\nAccording to the plea agreement, since 2017, Rufai unlawfully obtained the personal identifying information for more than 20,000 Americans to submit more than $2 million in claims for federally funded benefits under a variety of relief programs.\n\nThe various agencies involved paid out more than $600,000.\n\nThe largest amount of fraud was committed against the Washington State Employment Security Department, which paid out $350,763 in fraudulent pandemic unemployment claims to accounts controlled by Rufai.\n\nRufai also submitted fraudulent pandemic unemployment claims in at least 17 other states.\n\nRufai defrauded the Small Business Administration (SBA) by attempting to obtain Economic Injury Disaster loans (EIDL) tied to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBetween April 8, 2020, and June 26, 2020, he submitted 19 fraudulent EIDL applications. SBA paid out $10,000 based on the applications.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2020, Rufai attempted to obtain more than $1.7 million in IRS tax refunds by submitting 675 false claims. The IRS paid out $90,877 on these claims.\n\nRufai\u2019s efforts to enrich himself with false disaster claims did not start with COVID-19.\n\nIn September and October 2017, he submitted 49 disaster relief claims connected to Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma. He filed $24,500 in false claims and was paid on 13 claims totaling $6,500.\n\nRufai has agreed to pay full restitution to the defrauded agencies, said U.S. Attorney Nick Brown.\n\nWire fraud in relation to a presidentially declared major disaster or emergency is punishable by up to 30 years in prison.\n\nAggravated identity theft is punishable two years in prison to follow any prison term imposed on another charge.\n\nProsecutors have agreed to recommend no more than 71 months in prison.\n\nThe recommendation is not binding on U.S. District Judge Benjamin H. Settle, who will determine the appropriate sentence on August 15, 2022, after considering the sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nThis case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Department of Labor Office of Inspector General, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, and the United States Small Business Administration Office of the Inspector General. The Washington Employment Security Department is cooperating in the investigation.\n\nThe case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Seth Wilkinson and Cindy Chang of the Western District of Washington.\n\nRufai was arrested at New York\u2019s JFK Airport on his way to Nigeria in May 2021. He has been in prison since then.",

But it\u2019s opened already,\u201d a source told SaharaReporters on Tuesday evening.\n\nThis is coming a few days after the minister distributed over 100 exotic cars to ruling All Progressives Congress members ahead of the party\u2019s governorship primary in Kebbi State.\n\nMalami had last Thursday declared interest in the Kebbi State governorship race.\n\nExotic vehicles such as Toyota Prado, Lexus, Toyota Hilux, and Mercedes-Benz vehicles were given to them during the weekend.\n\nMalami, a lawyer from Kebbi State who was hardly known before 2015 when he was appointed into the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, is today one of the richest men in Nigeria.\n\nIn 2020, a series of detailed investigations carried out by SaharaReporters showed that Malami had acquired several properties whose value run into many billions of naira since being appointed into the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari as Nigeria\u2019s chief law officer.\n\nFor example, the AGF has an underground hotel in Sokoto, three houses at Peace Estate, Abuja, a brand new state-of-the-art school in Kebbi, two houses for his sons worth N100m each and a new hotel under construction in the Jabi area of Abuja.\n\nMalami also bought a house this year worth N150million in the Gwarimpa area of Abuja.\n\nThe newly constructed school is located at the back of NITEL in Gesse Phase 1, Birnin Kebbi, while a new house worth N600m on Ahmadu Bello Way, Nasarawa GRA, Kano, are among properties acquired by Malami since he became a minister under President Buhari.\n\nThe houses he built for his sons in Kebbi are 200 metres apart in a posh part of the city.\n\nThat is not all. Malami also built a N3billion multipurpose event centre in Kebbi State named Azbir Arena for his son in Kebbi.\n\nThe facility is said to be an entertainment centre with a plaza and kids playing section and an ongoing hotel all in one place.\n\nThis is apart from Rayhaan Hotel located on Zaria Road, opposite Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, which the AGF massively upgraded using proceeds of corruption.\n\nEver since SaharaReporters published a series of detailed reports exposing these illicit acquisitions, the online news medium has been a target for the AGF\u2019s camp.\n\nApart from falsely claiming to have sued SaharaReporters over the expository reports he said had damaged his reputation before the world, Malami also issued a petition to the former Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, on the issue to arrest the Publisher of the online newspaper, Omoyele Sowore.\n\nDespite these questionable acquisitions, 53-year-old Malami continues to portray a saintly stance in the Buhari government whose fight against corruption has been called into serious question in recent times.",

          "text": "Ondo state Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has called on the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to zone the presidential position to the southern part of the country.\n\nAkeredolu made the call Tuesday in a statement, titled \u201cOur Party, APC, Must Tread the Path of Equity\u201d which was made available to journalists in Akure, the state capital.\n\nThe governor said the party could not afford any internal bickering that might cause distrust and militate against cohesion, harmony and the zeal to achieve set objectives.\n\nAPC National Chairman and former Nasarawa state Governor Senator Abdullahi Adamu, had last week, said the party was yet to zone presidency to any zone, a statement that is eliciting negative reactions from the southern part of Nigeria.\n\nAkeredolu, who said the current democratic dispensation was anchored on the unwritten convention driven by a principle of equity, said the APC must do nothing which is capable of tilting the delicate balance against the established arrangement which guarantees peace and promotes trust.\n\n\u201cOur party just elected officers on the established principle of giving every part of the country an important stake in the political calculus,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that the focus had shifted to the process which would culminate in the participation of the party in the general elections in 2023.\n\n\u201cAll lovers of peace and freedom must do everything to eschew tendencies which may predispose them to taking decisions which promote distrust and lead to a crisis, the end of which nobody may be able to predict.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the party ensured that the principle of rotational representation guided its decision at the just-concluded convention,\u201d he said.\n\nAkeredolu, who said party chairmanship position had gone to the North and all other offices had been filled, said it\u2019s high time leaders of the party took a categorical statement, devoid of equivocation, on the pattern of succession.\n\nHe said the party executive committee had fixed a fee for the purchase of the nomination form for the office.\n\n\u201cIt is expected, fervently, that it would proceed to complete the process by limiting the propensities for disagreement to a region for possible micro-management.\n\n\u201cIt is very expedient that we avoid self-inflicted crises before the general elections. It is the turn of the Southern part of the country to produce the next President.\n\n\u201cThe party leadership should have no difficulty in making pronouncement on this very important issue, just as it has fixed various fees for the purchase of forms.\n\n\u201cThis must be done without delay. The principle of Federal Character is enshrined in the 1999 Constitution, as amended. It will be disingenuous for anyone to argue against rotation at this period.\n\n\u201cWe must not keep our party men and women guessing on the position of the leadership of the party. This is the time to weigh in and take control of the process.\n\n\u201cNo statement must suggest, even remotely, that the party harbours certain sentiments which may predispose it to consider throwing the contest open.\n\n\u201cThis is certainly not the time for equivocation. Equity Dictates That We Take A Stand,\u201d Akeredolu said. (NAN)\n\nBamidele\n\nAlso in a related development, Chairman Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele, said allowing the presidency to return to the South in 2023 presidential elections would douse the raging restiveness and tension in the country.\n\nSenator Bamidele also described the agitation for presidency from politicians of Southern extraction, in the country as a legitimate request backed by the 1999 constitution.\n\nBamidele, who represents the Ekiti Central Senatorial District in the Senate stated this Tuesday while speaking in Ado-Ekiti,the Ekiti state capital during the empowerment programme for his constituents across the five councils in the zone.\n\nMaterials distributed at the event were mini buses, sewing machines, generating sets, ploughing machine, grinding machines, wheel chairs, tricycles, motorbikes, ambulance buses, ventilators, fertilisers, driers, Hilux van, among others.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Senator Bamidele described the rotation of presidency between the Northern and Southern Nigeria as a legal and constitutional agitation recognised by Section 14 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended.\n\nAddressing journalists at the Oluyemi Kayode Stadium, in Ado-Ekiti, venue of the event, Bamidele said: \u201cRotational presidency is legitimate and constitutional.\n\n\u201cLet me state that Section 14 of the constitution and various sections of the 1999 Constitution, as amended, stated that no section of the country should dominate others in terms of positions.\n\n\u201cLet me also state that the primary concept of governance is welfare and good governance. The Section emphasized that Nigeria shall not be governed in such a way that any particular section will have domineering advantage over others.\n\n\u201cThat is the whole essence of equitable distribution of wealth and power. Part of the equitable distribution of power is allowing presidency to rotate between North and South.\n\n\u201cThough the constitution didn\u2019t say specifically about rotation, but logically and through various judicial interpretations, allowing it to rotate is legal and constitutional\u201d.\n\n\u201cSpeaking as a Nigerian, there is social tension in Nigeria today and when you have situations whereby Nigerians are beginning to doubt our togetherness and no longer trust leadership, people should not be thinking about political dominance.\n\n\u201cThere is no part of this nation and zone that cannot produce the best. If you check properly, majority desire in APC is that, there should be free, fair and credible primary to elect our presidential candidate and not by imposition\u201d, he said.\n\nOn the empowerment\n\nBamidele expressed gratitude to his constituency for working hard to support him in the last three years.\n\n\u201cWhat I am doing today is part of how to give back to the society. This is not the first empowerment I have done. I have empowered over 5,000 people in my constituency in agriculture, tying and dying and others.\n\n\u201cThis is a basic and fundamental thing that I think will benefit our people in critical areas like Agriculture, education, security, health and general empowerment\n\n\u201cI have procured 10,000 volume of books for our students while two ambulances and ventilators were donated to Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital\u201d, he stated.\n\nChairman of the occasion and Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Niyi Adebayo, urged the Ekiti voters to vote for the APC governorship candidate, Biodun Oyebanji during the June 18 poll.\n\nThe former governor commended the lawmaker for giving a strong showing through the empowerment programme, saying \u201cthis has further showed that he is a good and worthy representative.\n\n\u201cI know that all of you love Biodun Oyebanji, but he can only become governor if you vote for him. Don\u2019t stay at home and be expecting victory. But if you go out and work, victory shall be ours\u201d, he said.\n\nTactically referring to Bamidele\u2019s re-election bid, Adebayo said: \u201cSenator Bamidele has done well with this empowerment, he has done creditably well and this is kind of him. Please, don\u2019t forget to remember him when the time comes.\u201d\n\nFayemi declares\n\nMeanwhile, Ekiti state Governor and Chairman Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum, Dr Kayode Fayemi, is to formally declare his intention to run for the position of president of the country Wednesday, 4th May 2022, in Abuja.\n\nFayemi would join the race for the Presidency after months of speculations that trailed his nationwide consultations.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Yinka Oyebode, in Ado-Ekiti Tuesday, the declaration is tagged \u201cUnveiling My Nigeria Agenda.\u201d\n\nFayemi, had after discussing his plan to run for the number one office with President Mohammadu Buhari last month, sought counsel, guidance and support from traditional and political leaders across states in the federation.\n\nThe Ekiti state governor said the engagements with the traditional rulers and political leaders provided an avenue to share and listen to their perspectives on the ideal approaches to building a united country based on justice, freedom, equity and the rule of law.\n\nThe aggregate opinion, counsel and goodwill received during the consultation period would form the crux of his declaration Wednesday at Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital city.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "Kaduna state Governor Nasir El-Rufai has said gunmen terrorising the state are being assisted by scores of informants in many communities.\n\nEl-Rufai said the Kaduna state government, however, remains convinced that comprehensive, simultaneous military and security operation in the state and other states would help stop the terrorists.\n\nThe governor said this while speaking at the Hawan Bariki with members of the Zazzau Emirate Council in Zaria, Kaduna state on Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Governor El-Rufai called on the traditional rulers across the state to mobilise residents of the state to expose the terrorists\u2019 informants and support the security forces with local intelligence.\n\nHe added that the state government would continue to do everything it can to mobilise and support the federal security agencies to defeat terrorism in the state.\n\nThe governor said: \u201cYou will recall that my first official action as governor on 29 May 2015 was to summon an emergency meeting of the State Security Council which held on 30 May 2015, with the specific purpose of identifying the security threats across the state and finding answers to address them.\n\n\u201cOne outcome of that meeting was the decision to collaborate with the governors of the other states in the North-west and Niger State to fund a joint military operation to clear the Kamuku-Kuyambana forest swathes in the Birnin Gwari axis of cattle rustlers hibernating in the ranges that cover Niger, Kaduna, Katsina and Zamfara States.\n\n\u201cWhile this action decimated the criminals, it is a matter for regret that the necessary follow up operations were not sustained by the security agencies.\n\n\u201cSeven years later, we remain convinced that comprehensive, simultaneous military and security operation in Kaduna, Katsina, Zamfara, Sokoto, Kebbi, Plateau and Niger states is vital to stopping the terrorists and reasserting the authority of the Nigerian state in the ungoverned spaces.\n\n\u201cWe created a specialised Ministry of Internal Security, and we continue to support the federal security agencies with logistics and other resources.\n\n\u201cWe are engaging the highest echelons of government and the security structure on resolute action to protect the lives, liberty and livelihoods of our people. The criminal elements are being assisted by a network of informants in many of our communities.\n\n\u201cWe call on the traditional institution to mobilise their networks to expose these informants and support the security forces with local intelligence,\u201d El-Rufai stated.\n\n\u201cThis farming season, I wish to appeal to our people to farm massively wherever they can, to feed their families and the society at large.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that in some places, farmers have been attacked, abducted, or even killed while working their fields. While that is being tackled, it is important that we should all get involved in farming. That is a concrete way to reduce hunger and food price inflation.\u201d\n\nEl-Rufai equally called on people of the state to participate in the democratic process to select candidates for the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cYour Highness, the political processes to select candidates for the 2023 general election have started. We call on our people to participate vigorously in this democratic process, and to make it a peaceful exercise in the freedom of choice.\n\n\u201cIt is important to the integrity of the process, and to the safety of citizens that everyone should conduct themselves with respect for law and order.\n\n\u201cWe appeal for responsible behaviour and decent utterances all through the push and pull of political competition.\n\n\u201cWe cannot expect sustained development without a properly educated citizenry. That is why we have introduced free and compulsory education for the first 12 year of schooling.\n\n\u201cDespite removing the financial hurdle to education and imposing a lawful obligation to send all children to school, we are still contending with a significant number of out of school children and the persistence of street begging.\n\n\u201cWe urge the Zazzau Emirate Council to join us in instilling in parents the importance of sending children to school and compliance with the law against street begging. We also need the support of our communities to nudge our youths away from drugs and to expose those dealing in these deadly substances,\u201d the governor further added.\n\nThe governor, then, reiterated his administration\u2019s commitment \u201cto complete the projects of our urban renewal programme and leave physical infrastructure, human capital development, governance reforms, internally generated revenues and investments much better than we met them.\u201d\n\n14 kidnapped victims rescued in Niger\n\nAlso, security forces have successfully rescued no fewer than 14 kidnapped victims at Uregi in Rafi local government area of Niger state.\n\n\n\nDuring the operation said to be carried out by men of the joint security task force, 10 terrorists were also neutralised, while seven motorcycles, some arms and ammunition were recovered from the terrorists.\n\n\n\nA statement by the Commissioner for Local Government and Internal Security, Mr Emmanuel Umar, in Minna, said the operation took place Monday.\n\nAccording to the statement, the bandits wanted to disrupt the peaceful Eid-el-Fitr celebration in the area by launching attacks on Kawo and Uregi villages but men of the joint task force quickly repelled the attack.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn 02/05/2022 at about 1700hrs, armed bandits on motorcycles attempted to attack Kawo, Uregi villages in Rafi LGA to disrupt Sallah celebration in the state.

          "text": "\u2026 As Edo approves N40,000 new minimum wage\n\nBy Onu Okorie\n\nEdo State Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Mr. Odion Olaye has charged the Federal Government to step up efforts to tackle the high rate of insecurity, unemployment and hunger in the country.\n\nHe made the call yesterday during the 2022 Workers\u2019 Day in Benin City, Edo State.\n\nMeanwhile, the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has approved N40,000 as new minimum wage for workers in the state, in commemoration of this year\u2019s Workers\u2019 Day.\n\nThe governor, who made the announcement while delivering his 2022 Workers\u2019 Day speech, said his government would continue to prioritise the welfare of Edo workers, equipping them with capacity and the environment to deliver efficient and quality service to the people.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cAs we all know, the minimum of N30,000 can barely sustain a family. It will be immoral and mindless of us to continue to pretend we do not know our workers are suffering.\n\n\u201cThe government of Edo has now decided to review the minimum wage for Edo workers from N30,000 to N40,000. Undoubtedly, Edo is the first state since the current outbreak of coronavirus to take this initiative.\n\n\u201cEven though we would have loved to pay more, we hope that this little adjustment would enable us to cushion the impact of the inflation that we are faced with. There is no doubt that the financial implications will be heavy and put another burden on the government. But as a government, we are prepared to make the sacrifices so that the workers can live a better life. Your welfare is our number one priority.\u201d\n\nOn pensioners, he said he had approved, effective this month, the agreement reached with the Union of Pensioners that harmonised amount would be paid from this month.\n\n\u201cGovernment is aware of the difficulties faced by pensioners due to non-payment of pension and gratuities to pensioners by previous governments. This responsibility is huge and it will require a substantial part of our resources to settle them.\n\n\u201cHowever, we are not a government that is known for running away from challenges; we will look for a way to tackle these challenges,\u201d the governor added.",

Between April 8, 2020, and June 26, 2020, he submitted 19 fraudulent EIDL applications.

Aggravated identity theft is punishable by two years in prison to follow any prison term imposed on another charge.\n\n\u201cProsecutors have agreed to recommend no more than 71 months in prison. The recommendation is not binding on U.S. District Judge Benjamin H. Settle, who will determine the appropriate sentence on August 15, 2022, after considering the sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors.\u201d\n\nAccording to authorities, the case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Department of Labour Office of Inspector General, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, and the United States Small Business Administration Office of the Inspector General, while the Washington Employment Security Department is cooperating in the investigation.\n\nThe case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Seth Wilkinson and Cindy Chang of the Western District of Washington.",

          "text": "The European Commission proposed a gradual ban on Russian oil imports Wednesday to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine, as Russian forces pounded sites to the east of the country and hit targets in the far west near the EU border.\n\nThe EU also pledged to \u201csignificantly increase\u201d its support for Moldova, Ukraine\u2019s neighbour that has seen a series of attacks in a Moscow-backed separatist region, sparking fears it could be drawn into the conflict.\n\nEuropean Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen announced the bloc would \u201cphase out Russian supply of crude oil within six months, and refined products by the end of the year\u201d.\n\nIf approved, the oil ban would be the EU\u2019s toughest move yet against Russia\u2019s strategic energy sector that helps the Kremlin finance its war, but will still not touch its huge gas exports.\n\nHungary and Slovakia, both hugely dependent on Russian oil, would be given more time to meet the ban under the proposed plan, which will need unanimous approval before going into effect.\n\nThe proposed new sanctions also include moves against Russia\u2019s biggest bank, Sberbank, and the targeting of Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\n\u2013 Solidarity for Moldova \u2013\n\nWestern allies continue to provide Kyiv with cash and weapons in a bid to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to pull back, alongside unprecedented sanctions.\n\nBut more than two months after the February 24 invasion, Russian forces continue to batter the south and east, where 21 civilians were killed and 28 wounded in a series of assaults in Donetsk on Tuesday.\n\nBoth sides on Wednesday also reported Russian strikes on key transport infrastructure around the western city of Lviv, near Poland, and Transcarpathia, a region bordering Hungary.\n\nIn neighbouring Moldova, there are fears the conflict will spill over the border.\n\nVisiting the tiny ex-Soviet republic Wednesday, European Council President Charles Michel offered the EU\u2019s \u201cfull solidarity\u201d and support including in the areas of logistics and cyber defence.\n\n\u201cThis year we plan to significantly increase our support to Moldova by providing its armed forces with additional military equipment,\u201d he told a press conference with President Maia Sandu.\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of wanting to destabilise Moldova\u2019s separatist region of Transnistria to create a pretext for a military intervention.\n\n\u2013 \u2018No storming\u2019 of Azovstal \u2013\n\nThe war in Ukraine has killed thousands of people and displaced more than 13 million, creating the worst refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.\n\nThere was some rare good news on Tuesday with the arrival in the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia of more than 150 civilians evacuated from the devastated southern port city of Mariupol.\n\nFurther evacuations from the city, now almost entirely under Russian control after two months of siege, were to take place Wednesday with the help of the United Nations and the Red Cross, a Mariupol mayoral adviser said.\n\nOsnat Lubrani, UN humanitarian coordinator for Ukraine, had earlier said that 101 of the civilians had been evacuated from the immense underground galleries of the Azovstal steelworks, but more could be trapped.\n\nThe Russian army said Tuesday that its forces and pro-Moscow separatists were attacking \u201cfiring positions\u201d in Azovstal where Ukrainian fighters are making their last stand.\n\nBut Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday denied Ukrainian claims that it had launched a \u201cpowerful assault\u201d, telling reporters: \u201cThere is no storming.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe order was publicly given by the supreme commander-in-chief to cancel the assault,\u201d he said, referring to an order given by Putin last month not to pursue an attack on the area.\n\n\u2013 Bombing every second \u2013\n\nAzovstal evacuees who emerged from a caravan of white buses in Zaporizhzhia were met at a makeshift reception centre by crying loved ones and dozens of journalists.\n\n\u201cWe are so thankful for everyone who helped us. There was a moment we lost hope, we thought everyone forgot about us,\u201d evacuee Anna Zaitseva said, holding her six-month-old baby in her arms.\n\nElyna Tsybulchenko, 54, who worked at the site doing quality control before the war trapped her there, described days and nights of endless barrages.\n\n\u201cThey bombed like every second\u2026 everything was shaking. Dogs barked and children screamed,\u201d she told AFP. \u201cBut the hardest moment was when we were told our bunker would not survive a direct hit.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018No safe place\u2019 \u2013\n\nSince abandoning early attempts to capture Ukraine\u2019s capital Kyiv, Russian forces have shifted to the east, including largely Russian-speaking areas, and the south.\n\nUkraine\u2019s general staff said Wednesday the Russian assault continued with the aim of establishing \u201cfull control\u201d of the regions of Lugansk and Donetsk, and to maintain a land corridor to occupied Crimea.\n\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry said Wednesday that its air- and sea-based weapons had destroyed six electrical substations near railways including around Lviv, near Odessa to the south, and near Dnipropetrovsk to the south-east.\n\nIt said Ukrainian troops in the eastern Donbas region had used the railway stations to transport weapons and ammunition from the EU and United States.\n\nMeanwhile in the eastern Lugansk region, governor Sergiy Gaiday said two people had died in the last 24 hours, and \u201cthe whole region is under fire completely, there is no safe place\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Battle for democracy \u2013\n\nUS President Joe Biden on Tuesday framed the war as a historic battle for democracy in a speech to workers at a factory producing Javelin missiles, which have wreaked havoc on Russian tanks.\n\nReprising one of his presidency\u2019s core themes, Biden said the fight by democratic Ukraine against Putin\u2019s Russia was a front in a wider contest between democracies and autocracies worldwide, including China.\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that democracies can no longer \u201ckeep up,\u201d Biden said.\n\nUkraine is the \u201cfirst\u201d battle \u201cto determine whether that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he said.\n\nElsewhere, diplomats said Russia will boycott a UN Security Council meeting Wednesday with the EU\u2019s Political and Security Committee (PSC), a further sign of deteriorating relations between Moscow and its United Nations partners.",

          "title": "EU Targets Russian Oil, Banks as Moscow\u2019s Ally Belarus Stages Army Drills",
          "text": "The EU proposed its toughest sanctions yet against Russia on Wednesday, including a phased oil embargo, as Ukraine came under further heavy Russian bombardment and nervously monitored large-scale army drills in neighbouring Belarus, a close Moscow ally.\n\nNearly 10 weeks into a war that has killed thousands, uprooted millions and flattened cities and towns in eastern and southern Ukraine, Russia also stepped up attacks on targets in western Ukraine, partly to disrupt Western arms deliveries.\n\nA new convoy of buses began evacuating more civilians from the devastated southeastern port city of Mariupol, which has seen the heaviest fighting of the war so far and where Moscow said remaining Ukrainian forces remained tightly blockaded.\n\nPiling pressure on Russia\u2019s already battered $1.8 trillion economy, the European Commission proposed phasing out supplies of Russian crude oil within six months and refined products by the end of 2022. The price of Brent crude jumped 3% to more than $108 a barrel after the news.\n\nThe plan, if agreed by EU governments, would be a watershed for the world\u2019s largest trading bloc, which remains dependent on Russian energy and must find alternative supplies. Hungary and Slovakia want to be exempted from the ban for now, sources said.\n\n\u201c(President Vladimir) Putin must pay a price, a high price, for his brutal aggression,\u201d Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament in Strasbourg, to applause from lawmakers.\n\nShe also announced sanctions targeting Russia\u2019s largest bank Sberbank, two other lenders, three state broadcasters and army officers and other individuals accused of war crimes.\n\nThe EU has yet to target Russian natural gas, used to heat homes and generate electricity across the bloc.\n\nPutin raised the economic stakes further for Kyiv\u2019s Western backers on Tuesday by announcing plans to block exports of vital raw materials.\n\n\u2018WE ARE READY\u2019\n\nOn the war front, Russia\u2019s Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said his military would consider NATO transport carrying weapons in Ukraine, which is not a member of the alliance, as targets to be destroyed, RIA news agency reported. NATO says individual member states are sending military supplies but not troops.\n\nHis comments came after the ministry said it had disabled six railway stations in Ukraine used to supply Ukrainian forces with Western-made arms in the country\u2019s east. Reuters could not verify the claim and there was no immediate reaction from Kyiv.\n\nThe ministry also said it had hit 40 Ukrainian military targets, including four depots storing ammunition and artillery weapons.\n\nAnnouncing the surprise military drills, Belarus\u2019s defence ministry said they posed no threat to its neighbours, but Ukraine\u2019s border service said it could not exclude the possibility that Belarusian forces might join Russia\u2019s assault.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we are ready,\u201d said spokesman Andriy Demchenko.\n\nSome Russian forces entered Ukraine via Belarus when the invasion began on Feb. 24 but Belarusian troops have not so far been involved in what Moscow calls a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to disarm Ukraine and defend it from fascists.\n\nKyiv and its Western backers say the fascism claim is an absurd pretext for Moscow to wage an unprovoked war of aggression that has driven five million Ukrainians to flee abroad.\n\nThe convoy leaving Mariupol, organised by the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross, was heading for the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said. It was not expected to arrive on Wednesday.\n\nHe did not say how many buses were in the convoy or whether any more civilians had been evacuated from the vast Azovstal steel works, where the city\u2019s last defenders are holding out against Russian forces that have occupied Mariupol.\n\nThe first evacuees from Azovstal arrived by bus in Zaporizhzhia on Tuesday after cowering for weeks in bunkers beneath the sprawling Soviet-era steel works. read more\n\n\u201cWe had said goodbye to life. We didn\u2019t think anyone knew we were there,\u201d said Valentina Sytnykova, 70, who said she sheltered in the plant for two months with her son and 10-year-old granddaughter.\n\nUkraine\u2019s general staff said the Russian assault on Azovstal was continuing.\n\nRussia now controls Mariupol, once a city of 400,000 but now largely reduced to smoking rubble after weeks of siege and shelling. The city is key to Moscow\u2019s efforts to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea \u2013 vital for its grain and metals exports \u2013 and connect Russian-controlled territory in the south and east.\n\n\u2018WE ARE NOT AFRAID\u2019\n\nMoscow has deployed 22 battalion tactical groups near the eastern Ukrainian town of Izium in a possible drive to capture the cities of Kramatorsk and Severodonetsk in Donbas, British intelligence said. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.\n\nThe cities are in the eastern Donbas region \u2013 Russia\u2019s main target. Russian forces turned their heaviest firepower on Ukraine\u2019s east and south after failing to take Kyiv, the capital, in the opening weeks of the war.\n\nBut the mayor of Lviv in western Ukraine said Russian missile strikes late on Tuesday had damaged electricity and water networks in his city near the Polish border, across which flow Western arms supplies for Ukraine\u2019s military.\n\nThe governor of the eastern Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said two civilians had been killed and two wounded in the past 24 hours, adding that Russian forces had shelled residential areas 34 times. Russia denies targeting civilians.\n\n\u201cThere are no safe cities in Luhansk region,\u201d he said on the Telegram messaging service.\n\nUkraine remains defiant despite the unrelenting assault.\n\n\u201cRussia struggles to advance and suffers terrible losses. Thus the desperate missile terror across Ukraine. But we are not afraid and the world should not be afraid either,\u201d Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cMore sanctions on Russia. More heavy weapons for Ukraine. Russia\u2019s missile terrorism must be punished.\u201d",

          "text": "North Korea fired a ballistic missile Wednesday, Seoul said, a week after Kim Jong Un vowed to boost Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear arsenal and just days before the South inaugurates a new, hawkish president.\n\nPyongyang has conducted 14 weapons tests since January, including firing an intercontinental ballistic missile at full range for the first time since 2017.\n\nLast week Kim oversaw a huge military parade, vowed to rapidly expand and improve his nuclear arsenal, and warned of possible \u201cpre-emptive\u201d strikes \u2014 as satellite imagery indicates he may soon resume nuclear testing.\n\nThe Wednesday test comes days before the May 10 inauguration of South Korea\u2019s President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol, who has vowed to take a hard line with North Korea and ramp up security cooperation with the US after years of failed diplomacy.\n\nNorth Korea fired the ballistic missile at 12:03 pm (0303 GMT), Seoul\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said, likely from the Sunan Airfield near Pyongyang, the site of previous recent ICBM tests.\n\nThe missile flew 470 km (300 miles) and reached an altitude of 780 km, the JCS said, adding it was a \u201cblatant violation of UN Security Council resolutions.\u201d\n\nJapan\u2019s state minister of defence Makoto Oniki confirmed the launch and the missile\u2019s trajectory, saying it had landed \u201coutside of Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s \u201crepeated launches of ballistic missiles threaten peace and safety of our nation, the region, and the international community,\u201d he added.\n\nSeoul\u2019s national security council said it \u201cstrongly\u201d condemned the launch, urging the North to \u201ccease actions that pose a serious threat to the Korean Peninsula\u201d and to return to dialogue.\n\nSince high-level diplomacy with then-US president Donald Trump collapsed, North Korea has doubled-down on Kim\u2019s plans for military modernisation, seemingly impervious to threats of more sanctions as it ignores the United States offers of talks.\n\nKim Jong Un said at last week\u2019s military parade that he would take measures to develop \u201cthe nuclear forces of our state at the fastest possible speed\u201d, according to footage of his speech broadcast on state media.\n\nRepeated negotiations aimed at convincing Kim to give up his nuclear weapons have come to nothing.\n\n\u201cThere is a good chance that they test-fired a missile that can be equipped with a nuclear warhead,\u201d Ahn Chan-il, a North Korean studies scholar, told AFP Wednesday.\n\nKim also warned that he could \u201cpre-emptively\u201d use his nuclear force to counter so-called hostile forces at a meeting with top military brass last week.\n\nAnalysts said Kim\u2019s message on his nuclear weapons, plus the recent test, could be seen as a signal to President-elect Yoon, who has threatened a pre-emptive strike on Pyongyang.\n\n\u201cIt could be a warning message to\u2026 Yoon,\u201d said Hong Min of the Korea Institute for National Unification.\n\nYoon has suggested he is only willing to talk about peace if North Korea confirms it is willing to denuclearise \u2014 something Pyongyang will never accept, Hong said.\n\n\u201cIt could also signal Pyongyang\u2019s stance that it has no choice but to further enhance its arsenal if Seoul and Washington decided to deploy strategic military assets to the South,\u201d he added.\n\nFor five years under President Moon Jae-in, Seoul has pursued a policy of engagement with Pyongyang, brokering high-level summits between Kim and Trump while reducing joint US military drills the North sees as provocative.\n\nBut for President-elect Yoon this \u201csubservient\u201d approach has been a manifest failure.\n\nHe said on the campaign trail he would like more US missile defences \u2014 and even tactical nuclear weapons \u2014 deployed in South Korea and has vowed to ramp up joint military exercises, which infuriate Pyongyang.\n\nUS President Joe Biden is due to visit South Korea later this month to meet with Yoon.\n\nOther analysts said that North Korea\u2019s testing blitz could be aimed at taking advantage of gridlock at the United Nations following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIt is \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d for the Security Council to sanction North Korea \u2014 which has supported Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine \u2014 due to Moscow\u2019s veto power, said Cheong Seong-chang of the Center for North Korea Studies at the Sejong Institute.\n\n\u201cThe North therefore will try to test as many missiles as possible that it has not been able to do so far, enabling it to enhance capabilities of its arsenal at a fast pace.\u201d",

And half of them have occurred since 2020. Historical, in times like this, parochial prejudices are heightened and the fabric of cohesion in the society becomes frayed as people retreat into ethnic, religious and other nativist camps.\n\n\u201cAnd those who do not speak our language or subscribe to our faith come under great suspicion and soon they become scapegoats for all our challenges and ethnic, religious and separatist conflicts arise. In all of these, the ideal of an integrated, peaceful and prosperous sub-region remains almost impossible,\u201d he said.\n\nOsinbajo said the concept behind the theme of the conference, \u201cFratelli Tutti: Path to Build Brotherhood and Sustainable Peace in West Africa,\u201d for which Pope Francis had written about, is a concept of the brotherhood of all humanity.\n\nHe said the federal government was committed to collaborating with the Church and all well-meaning actors in promoting peace and security.\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",

          "text": "The few small-scale refineries operating in Nigeria are facing a huge challenge of crude oil supply, as the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited continues to focus on exporting the commodity, THISDAY learnt on Tuesday.\n\nSeveral operators, despite the assurances by the national oil company of support, expressed frustration that despite the huge investments, their facilities have remained dormant as the NNPC has declined to make the raw material available.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nTHISDAY recalls that on several occasions, the Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mr. Mele Kyari, had assured local operators of adequate crude oil supply.\n\nIn fact, recently, at the launch of Waltersmith refinery, Kyari was quoted as promising that the NNPC would collaborate with relevant entities to provide the few modular assets operating in the country with all the necessary support they need to operate and achieve their growth plans.\n\n\u201cWe will work closely with them to ensure that they get enough crude feedstock they need to operate seamlessly,\u201d the NNPC boss had said.\n\nBut it was gathered that the refineries operating mainly in Imo, Delta and Edo have been mostly dormant due to the refusal of the NNPC to supply crude to the local oil facilities, especially as they have been unable to fully source the required commodity from private crude suppliers.\n\nFor instance, it was gathered that the 10,000 barrels OPAC refinery in Kwale which underwent testing under the defunct Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has not been producing due to the NNPC\u2019s inability to supply the raw material to the company while Waltersmith was facing same issues and Edo refinery is being delayed for the same reason.\n\nWhile the companies are currently producing diesel, kerosene , Naphtha and fuel oil which are used in industries, with a projection to procure \u201creformers\u201d which would help in producing petrol, but it was understood that the regulation of petrol has made it commercially inviable.\n\nDespite the companies requesting a swap arrangement with the NNPC, the effort has become fruitless for years as the national oil company prefers to supply foreign firms, some stakeholders who preferred to remain anonymous told THISDAY.\n\nAs it is, it was learnt that the affected local private companies are currently buying crude from private clusters , which are rarely enough for the required demand.\n\n\u201cThe major challenge here is that the NNPC has chosen to sell crude to foreign refineries and export rather than even giving concession to refineries in the country,\u201d a source told THISDAY.\n\nIt was further gathered that the Edo refinery which is due for commissioning will encounter the same problem which is delaying the take-off while Waltersmith refinery in Imo is having the same challenge since it\u2019s only getting crude from Seplat, a private company.\n\nA source told THISDAY that Nigeria is paying more for petrol because since it is purchased abroad, the product would accumulate more logistics costs including, transportation, spot and refining expenses.\n\n\u201cNNPC will tell you that they are doing DSDP (Direct Sales, Direct Purchase), and give traders that don\u2019t even have refineries the needed crude, but they fail to give local refineries the commodity.\n\n\u201cThis is an aberration because all those costs associated with the DSDP , they will pass these costs to the government which will add to the pump price. That\u2019s why you see the cost of products going up in the market.\n\n\u201cToday, diesel is selling for almost N700. This is the same diesel that if refined locally, all these associated costs will be eliminated,\u201d another operator told THISDAY.\n\nFor a product that would be sold locally in naira, an industry source told THISDAY that it was unacceptable that the private companies supplying crude would be demanding payment in dollars.\n\n\u201cWhat they are saying is that we have to generate USD to pay in dollars,\u201d a source stated.\n\nIn addition, it was learnt that the local refineries have been engaging the federal government through the NNPC for years which although has pledged support for local refineries, has done it in the breach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lip service. They just pay lip service. They tell us they are waiting for approval from NNPC board or from NNPC management and this is since 2020, \u201can aggrieved party told this paper, insisting that after several letters that were not replied, the refineries are now frustrated.\n\n\u201cWe are not doing anything with our investment because we do not have crude. We have written the ministry of petroleum, permanent secretary, the midstream and downstream authority. Nothing has come out of it. We have put in so much investments into this thing. And the refineries are just lying fallow,\u2019\u2019 another source added.\n\n\u201cWhat is the justification for supplying foreign refineries when local refineries that require very insignificant quantity are side-lined?\u201d a frustrated operator queried.\n\nWhile the NNPC exports about 1.3 million barrels per day, it was understood that all the refineries operating in Nigeria today would require just a meagre 16,000 barrels per day to operate optimally.\n\nA THISDAY review showed that while WalterSmith refinery is just 5,000 bpd, Edo refinery is 1,000 barrels while OPAC in Delta is just 10,000 barrels per day, less than 0.5 per cent of total national export.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying give us for free. We want to purchase and sell to the local market to ameliorate the local challenges the country is facing with refined products,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cGovernment is not giving us attention. Government is not giving us the kind of support that we need and it\u2019s frustrating. Do we have to wait for approval in our whole lifetime? the source asked.\n\nThe source argued that if products are produced locally, there\u2019s no way they can arrive in a bad form, because they are straight-run products as they come directly out of crude production and not blended like the imported products which cause environmental hazards.\n\nThe local refinery owners are therefore requesting urgent government intervention not to allow the installed facility and investment go to waste.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
