          "text": "Kwara State Government and the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party have disagreed over the takeover of property owned by the state to guarantee loans secured on behalf of Shonga Farms, an agricultural concern established for the state by the former administration led by Dr Bukola Saraki.\n\nThe Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria had last week secured a court injunction to take over two landed property, Plot 135, Kwara House and plot 67, Central Area, Abuja over non-payment of N1.7bn debt taken on behalf of Shonga Farms.\n\nWhile the government alleged that the state was scammed on the loan by previous administrations, the PDP said the present administration was lying on the status of the farm owned by the state.\n\nThe state government on Thursday said the state was fraudulently negotiated into underwriting the debts incurred by the former administrations in the name of Shonga Farm, a venture it said was funded 100% at inception with taxpayers money without any gains accruing to the people of the state.\n\nThe state Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Salman Jawondo, SAN, spoke at a press conference.\n\nJawondo said more than N5bn of public funds and loans secured with the government as guarantor have been sunk into the agricultural project with no dividends to the people of the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cOut of the 13 autonomous farms set up with public funds, nine had been sold out with no kobo paid to the public coffers, even when the government is supposed to hold a paltry 10 per cent equity in each of the farms.\n\n\u201cThe reason AMCON took over Kwara property in Abuja is to recover the bad loans that the farm owes a consortium of banks that invested in it dating back to 2007 because the Shonga Farm Holdings could not pay back on the agreed timeline.\n\n\u201cAMCON had to hold the state responsible because it is listed among the shareholders of Shonga Farms Holdings Ltd, even though its share \u2014 allocated to it only after public noise in the early 2000s \u2014 is not anywhere commensurate with its huge investments in the project.\u201d\n\nBut the state chapter of the PDP wondered why the state governor, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, was troubling himself over Shonga Farms loan in which the state has 20 per cent shares and in which it suffered no loss.\n\nThe PDP, in a statement by its Publicity Secretary, Tunde Ashaolu, noted that the state holds 20 percent equity in the farms, adding, \u201cWe want to state that if the Kwara State Governor and his key aides knew their onions, they would have taken appropriate measures to save the state\u2019s property from any threat.\n\n\u201cIt is not possible for the Kwara State Government to use any property as collateral for any form of loan. Also, Kwara State is just one of the five shareholders in the Shonga Farms and if the company defaults in the payment of any loan, why is AMCON not attaching the property of the four banks that also hold shares in the company? \u201cAMCON\u2019s lawyers in the new unethical practice that we now witness chose Kwara State as a soft target knowing that the people in charge of government are not only ignorant but they are also ever ready to play politics with any issue.\n\n\u201cThe right thing should have been for the government to defend its property by going to court to join issues with AMCON. In any case, the case is still at the court of the first instance, and even then the matter has not been decided at that level. There are still two appellate courts where the matter can be contested.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We have a lot to make bragging right both at the state and also at the national level. We should see that sacrifice of our National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu will certainly not go in vain and that is why I am encouraging everyone that the journey we have started at ensuring that we have Asiwaju (Tinubu) representing us at the center is on the right course.\n\n\u201cAs individuals and community, we all have a role to play. We all have a duty to ensure that the ongoing registration in INEC and the collection of your PVC is important because it is only when you do this that you can exercise your civic responsibility.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that once you have that, nothing will stop us from achieving this agenda.\n\n\u201cI think it is also important at this point to admonish some of our leaders to close ranks and work for the victory of our party, APC and presidential aspiration of our leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.\n\n\u201cAll the leaders in Amuwo-Odofin and Oriade should come together. We must put our house in order and unite without allowing anything to divide us.\n\n\u201cThere are enough benefits if we work together. We are not aspiring to win Lagos alone; we are also working to go to Abuja.\n\n\u201cSo, I want to appeal to all leaders to do all that is required for our party to be stronger. We should not speak with two voices.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu, who urged all traditional leaders to work with government at local and state levels for development in their communities, commended ethnic nationals for the unity, peace and progress that are being enshrined in the community and urged them to do more.\n\n\u201cI want to urge all traditional leaders to work with the government at local and state levels. We should work together for development in our communities. I want to encourage all other ethnic nationals \u2013 the Ndigbo Community, South-South Community and Arewa Community.\n\n\u201cI want to thank all of you for the unity, peace and progress that is enshrined in this community but I want more.\n\n\u201cI want us to continue to live in tolerance, peace and harmony because it is only when we do this that more community development will come to this locality and community.\u201d",

          "text": ".\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo says a nation will be measured ultimately by how it treats its most vulnerable citizens.\n\nOsinbajo expressed this view in his special address at the At-Risk Children \u2013Programme(ARC-P) Summit on Thursday at the State House Banquet Hall, Abuja.\n\nHe said that in 2019, President Muhammadu Buhari made two crucial policy statements \u2014 first was the plan of government to lift a hundred million Nigerians out of poverty within a decade.\n\nThe vice president said that the second was the strict enforcement of the laws on free and compulsory education for all children at the primary level.\n\n\u201cIn 2016 the rule of law advisory team was established in the presidency.\n\n\u201cOne of the team\u2019s main tasks was to ensure that, following the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act, there is effective coordination of responses to cases of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV).\n\n\u201cSince then, the team has supported the establishment of SGBV Response Teams across the country.\u2019\u2019\n\nOsinbajo said that in 2021, on the advice of the Presidential Economic Advisory Council, the president inaugurated the National Poverty Reduction (NPRGS) Committee.\n\nHe said that the omnibus term of reference of the committee was implementing any other effort that would enhance the attainment of the objective of lifting 100 million people out of poverty in 10 years.\n\n\u201cSo the At-Risk-Children Programme ARC-P, domiciled in my office, is one of the independent initiatives of the NPRGS Committee, it is an important component of the variety of government interventions designed to complement and support existing initiatives of our administration in dealing with the problems of vulnerable children and young people.\n\n\u201cThe programme will provide a safe space for the mentoring and training of these children with a specific emphasis on basic literacy and numeracy, health and nutrition, entrepreneurial skills, digital skills, sports and life skills among other skills.\n\n\u201cAt the heart of the At-Risk Children Programme is the idea that every Nigerian child counts.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nNigeria loses N60bn yearly to lack of LID, says CFAN\n\n\u201cA nation will be measured ultimately by how it treats its most vulnerable citizens; we recognise that we cannot make progress as a people while a significant population of our children \u2013 those to whom the future belongs \u2013 are left on the margins of society, deprived of the opportunity to discover and fulfil their potential,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAccording to him, ARC \u2013P is aimed at giving a new lease of life to millions of children, who through no fault of theirs, have found themselves without hope or support.\n\nHe commended state governors who had so far signed up for the ARC-P particularly the governors of the pilot states, Borno, Sokoto, Gombe, Kaduna and Ekiti.\n\nHe said that the Federal Government would continue to provide the leadership, support, finance and logistics needed to ensure that this Programme achieves its goals.\n\nOn his part, Gov. Inuwa Yahaya of Gombe State, shared the state\u2019s experience being the first state in the federation and the pilot carrying the implementation of the programme.\n\nHe congratulated the Office of the Vice President for the ingenious initiative.\n\n\u201cLet me also congratulate all state governments and development partners for the efforts made towards ensuring a successful takeoff of the programme.\n\n\u201cFor us in Gombe state, and I believe, in the North-Eastern sub-region, the ARC-P couldn\u2019t have come at a better time considering the destruction to lives and livelihoods caused by Boko Haram insurgents.\n\n\u201cAs you are all aware, children and young adults, especially, girls, are disproportionately affected by natural and man-made disasters such as the Boko Haram insurgency that we have witnessed in the past decade.\n\n\u201cAs in many conflict situations, thousands of children in the six states of the North-East sub-region have become victims of forced displacement, kidnapping, maiming, child soldier recruitment, sexual molestation, stigma, hunger, forced labour, deplorable health conditions and many more challenges.\n\n\u201cLittle wonder then, the region accounts for nearly 70 per cent of vulnerable children in the country.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said that, though, Gombe state was not the epicentre of the Boko Haram conflict, its geographical location, in the centre of the North-East that shared boundary with all other five states, had made it a nerve-shock absorber.\n\nThe governor said that schools, health and social care facilities had borne the pressure which necessitated efforts to provide for the educational, health and other needs of the large number of vulnerable children and youths.\n\nMrs Mariam Uwais, Special Adviser to the President on Social Investment, said that the ARC-P was aimed at improving the overall well being of young, marginalised Nigerians under the age of 24.\n\nShe said focus would be on Almajiri, out-of-school children, girls at work and adolescent girls in marriage, among other vulnerable children.\n\nGovernors Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, and Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa States, alongside members of the Federal Executive Council, members of National Assembly, members of the diplomatic corps, development partners, among others, also attended the summit.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Gabriel Olawale\n\nDay and night, Chikaima Izuchukwu cries non-stop. Her persistent crying from birth has left her parents in misery.\n\nAt five months of age, her crying became unbearable even as her worried parents noticed that her heartbeat was faster than normal.\n\nHer tongue and lips were blackened, Her internal organs are affected with her growth and development stunted.\n\nAt the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, LASUTH, Chikaima was diagnosed with Ventricular Septal Defect, VSD, also known as a hole in the heart. She requires urgent corrective surgery to close the hole between her left and right ventricles.\n\nIn an appeal, Chikaima\u2019s mother recounted that it all started three weeks after her birth. \u201cI noticed she was always crying, this made me take her to the hospital where I gave birth to her, but the doctor said we should keep observing her. \u201cWhen I could not keep it to myself again, I told a friend who advised me to take her to LASUTH where I was told she had a heart defect and will require surgery.\n\n\u201cShe was admitted for some weeks and that cost us a lot of money because she received oxygen daily. The hospital advised us to let her go for surgery at any centre with facilities for complex heart defects surgery.\n\n\u201cWhen inquired about the cost implication, we were made to understand that the surgery will cost N6 million.\u201d\n\nIn a medical report made available by KIMS Hospitals Limited in India, and signed by the Clinical Coordinator, International Patient Division, Dr Nimisha Pawar, it was revealed that Chikaima is suffering from multiple congenital heart defects, confirmed by echocardiography to consist of Ebstein\u2019s anomaly, hypoplastic-right ventricle, atresia of the pulmonary artery among others.\n\nFurther, Pawar stated: \u201cThe complications of these heart defects, which include chronic hypoxaemia, meaning prolonged poor oxygen supply to the body cells and organs, have affected baby Chikaima\u2019s growth and development.\n\n\u201cChikaima\u2019s requires further cardiovascular evaluation and open-heart surgery to correct her heart defects in order to forestall irreversible and life-threatening complications,\u201d the doctor noted.\n\nIf you are touched and wish to support in correcting Chikaima\u2019s abnormality, kindly send your donations to Access Bank, Izuchukwu Njideka M. 0041455501.

          "text": "Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, has asked Nigerians to embrace the right firefighting attitudes as there are going to be more incidents of man-made fire outbreaks as the dry season sets in.\n\nHe also advised that more rigorous awareness campaigns on fire safety and prevention should be embarked upon by the Federal Fire Service and its counterpart in the states to enhance the right firefighting attitudes in Nigerians.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday at the pulling out parade of the outgone Controller-General, (CG) of the Federal Fire Service, Dr. Ibrahim Liman, in Abuja, the minister said it is very critical for fire services across the nation to intensify advocacy campaign on fire prevention because this is the time of the year that fire accidents occur at a higher rate and most items are combustible due to the hot weather.\n\nHe noted that: \u201cAlthough there are naturally occurring fire accidents, most accidents are man-made, accidentally, negligently or on purpose, (arson), and this can be prevented mostly if there is enough awareness. Nigerians should be made to know the various categories of fire and what the first responders should do before the arrival of the fire officers.\u201d\n\nAregbesola recalled that the federal government has spent N10.4 billion on fire infrastructure upgrade in 2021 and some of the infrastructure includes 44 firefighting engines, 15 water tankers, 15 rapid intervention fire engines and 20 basic life support ambulances which were distributed across the states.\n\nThe minister, while extolling the virtue and legacy of the former CG, said Dr. Liman has brought about unprecedented growth and development as well as a much needed revolution in the service since he took over the mantle of leadership in 2019.\n\nOn Liman\u2019s achievements while he was the CG, he said: \u201cit will be on record that the expansion of the service which began in 2015 from the fitful presence in Lagos and Abuja since its inception in 1901 was brought to a head under his tenure, the FFS is proudly now in all the states of the federation.\n\n\u201cUnder him, the service established six additional training schools totalling eight, one in each geopolitical zone. The FFS has also procured firefighting vehicles and materials at an unprecedented rate under him and commissioned aerial firefighting equipment which was the first of its kind in Nigeria and has also reduced the fire emergency response time to seven minutes.\u201d\n\nIn his farewell speech, Liman said the successes achieved under his tenure were made possible by the support of President Muhammadu Buhari, the minister of interior, personnel of the service and the media.\n\nLiman, who was the pioneer chief of the Federal Capital Territory, FCT) Fire Service, said his growth through the ranks in the fire service has been rewarding and worthwhile and he retires a fulfilled individual and confident that the officers he left behind are able to carry on and build more on his legacy.\n\nHe said: \u201cI spent 17 years with the Niger State Fire Service before I was invited to start what is today known as the FCT Fire Service and I headed FCT Fire Service for 13 years. Then I was invited by the then minister of interior comrade Abba Moro, having heard of my work, to come over to the Federal Fire Service, this is how I found myself in the FFS.\n\n\u201cWhen I came on board, we had 23 trucks but as at the time I was handing over on the 30th of December 2021, I handed over 69 state of the art fire trucks. I took over 17 water tankers of 10,000 litres capacity, I handed over 32 of the same, from two ambulances to 20, 19 utility vehicles to 56 and increased our staff strength to more than 6, 000 among many other achievements such as the production of a national fire policy for the country which we never had, review of the national fire safety code, standard operating procedure and disciplinary code which are some of my last assignments.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the acting CG of the FFS, Samson Karebo, has said that it has been an honour working with the outgoing CG because he has brought to bear his wealth of knowledge on officers of the service and has trained firemen abroad in partnership with other government agencies.\n\nHe said the Federal Fire Service has received 2,845 fire calls in 2021 and has rescued 260 emergencies, saving 587 lives while 136 were lost.\n\nHe added that: \u201cThe estimated property saved is worth N18, 996. 47 trillion and the estimated property lost is N3, 045.27 trillion and the major cause of the fire in 2021 is electrical equipment related.\u201d",

The information was contained in a statement by his Special Adviser (Media), Ola Awoniyi.\n\nLawan, who is also indigenous to Yobe State, said the situation in his state was good until the insurgents struck and caused incalculable damage.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cIn the Northeastern state before the former Borno State and currently Yobe State, we received support from the government for our education.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have to pay anything to be in primary school.

My parents were encouraged to send me to school.\n\n\u201cThat is what we want to achieve by raising N25 billion and the N25 billion is not going to solve all the problems but definitely it will reposition our education sector better.\n\n\u201cIf we are able to deal with our educational challenge in Yobe, we are not the only people to benefit from the educated people in our state.\n\n\u201cToday, you have many people from Yobe working in different parts of the country.

But I believe that Mr. President will do the needful,\u201d Omoworare said.\n\nOrganisers of the event corroborated Omoworare\u2019s claim that Buhari has started consultation with relevant stakeholders. They said the AGF had excused himself from the public conversation because he was in talks with the President on the matter.\n\nThe Executive Director, YIAGA Africa and the proponent of Not-Too-Young-To-Run, Samson Itodo, who joined in the conversation virtually believed that the current document before President Buhari is good and has all the essential ingredients to enhance the integrity of Nigeria\u2019s electoral system.\n\nHe agreed with Omoworare that President Buhari will look favourably at the Electoral bill this time around and deliver it as a legacy to the Nigerian people.\n\nIn their opening remarks, NILDS Director-General Abubakar Sulaiman and Country Representatives, Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD), Adebowale Olorunmola, expressed confidence that the bill when signed into law, will help curb the observed anomalies in the nation\u2019s electoral system.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government is to launch a probe into the importation of adulterated petrol into the country, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva has said.\n\nThis comes as the scarcity of petrol, which became noticeable two days ago, continued in Lagos and Abuja, with long queues characterising the few filling stations that still had products to sell despite assurances from the Nigerian Downstream Midstream Petroleum Authority (NMDPRA) that the trend would ease.\n\nFindings by Daily Sun across filling stations in Lagos and Abuja yesterday revealed that the assurances from NMDPRA failed to yield the expected results as motorists and other consumers complained of not having east access to the product and spending hours at filling stations before being served.\n\nThe development has equally led to a slight increase in the cost of Transportation. A bus ride from Ikeja to Fagba which usually costs N250 has now moved to N300 while from Ikeja under bridge to GRA which hitherto costs N150 has now been jerked up to N200.\n\nSome of the commuters in separate interviews expressed frustration at the sudden hike in transportation cost, urging the Federal Government to as a matter of urgency arrest the situation before it gets out of hand.\n\nAlso, the assurance by the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria(IPMAN) to consumers that fuel would be available from yesterday(Wednesday) proved unrealistic as queues at both independent and major fuel outlets persisted, yesterday.\n\nOil marketers have estimated that about 100 million litres of contaminated petrol were imported into country by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited.\n\nHowever, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, addressing State House Correspondents at the end of the Federal Executive Council meeting in Abuja, said the government would launch a probe to unravel the cause of the crisis.\n\nHe said the decision followed a briefing on the issue to President Muhammadu Buhari Tuesday with the aim of getting to the bottom of the matter.\n\nSpeaking after the meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) presided over by President Buhari at the presidential villa, Abuja, Sylva cautioned against drawing conclusions before the investigation is completed.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cThe issue did not come up in council, but of course, you will recall I was here yesterday to brief Mr. President on the issue. I\u2019m not in a position to disclose the identities of the companies, but there are some issues and we are actively tackling it. Nobody has, before now, checked for methanol in our fuel, it\u2019s not very usual and this is the first time this is happening and NNPC is very much up to the task.\n\n\u201cI will also convey your question to NNPC and maybe the Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority, but we\u2019re actively handling it and I want to assure you that the problem will be a thing of the past very soon.\u201d\n\nSylvia also assured that the government would consider compensating those who may have been adversely affected by the bad fuel.\n\nOn possible sanctions for the erring companies, he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to rush to any conclusions. There\u2019ll be a major investigation to unravel everything and then let\u2019s really get to the bottom of it before we can come back and tell you what is going to happen to the culprits. We know that some people\u2019s vehicles must have also been damaged, that is also going to be taken into consideration in dealing with the situation.\u201d\n\nThe Minister of State had also spoken on the approval granted to his ministry by the council, saying FEC closed out the contract for the construction of the 17 storey local content building in Yenagoa at the cost of N1.817 billion.\n\nMinister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, on his part said the council granted approval made by the Advisory Committee on Nigeria citizenship for 286 foreign nationals out of 600 applications received.\n\nHe said 208 of those approved were granted citizenship by Naturalisation, while 78 others were granted citizenship by registration.\n\nHe said the persons approved by council cut across various countries of the world.\n\nMinister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, said FEC approved a contract for the replacement of Aviation Operations (AvO) at the cost of N12,097,215,800 billion.\n\n\u201cSo, today in Council, a memo was presented by us in aviation. And the amount of the contract to awarded whose purpose is to replace our AVO bridges is N12,097,215,800.09, which is for 12 months and it will include 7.5 per cent VAT. This contract is not only for supplying but it\u2019s also for installation and maintenance, including spare parts and is awarded to a company called Gulf of Africa International Limited.\u201d",

The Conveners of a meeting of 100 leading business, political, civil society, and thought leaders, which held last week in Lagos, yesterday explained that the gathering should not be linked to the 2023 presidential election but a platform to chat a new consensus for national rebirth.\n\nIn a statement jointly signed by the coordinators of the group, Chairman of THISDAY/Arise Media Group, Nduka Obaigbena, and former Presidential Liaison Officer to the Senate, Kashim Imam, the eminent persons noted that the gathering was meant to build consensus towards national rebirth.\n\nThe meeting, which held from February 4 to 6 under the aegis of \u201cThe 2022 Committee\u201d, the conveners pointed out, remained non- partisan.

          "text": "\u2022Explains why inspectors did not detect bad petrol before circulation\n\n\u2022National oil company requests emergency supply\n\n\u2022NMDPRA says nation has 10-day reserve deficit, announces arrival of 300m litres of fuel\n\n\u2022Assures queues to disappear by Friday\n\n\u2022FG orders investigation\n\nDeji Elumoye, Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos with agency report\n\nThe Nigerian National Company Limited (NNPC) yesterday stated that its investigation has revealed the presence of Methanol in four petrol cargoes imported by MRS, Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium, Oando and Duke Oil.\n\nGroup Managing Director of NNPC, Mallam Mele Kyari, who disclosed this during a media briefing yesterday, however said he has since ordered the holding back of all the affected products in transit (both truck & marine).\n\nIt was also gathered yesterday that the NNPC has asked oil trading firms to embark on emergency supply of petrol to replace cargoes that were rejected because of their poor quality, Reuters quoted two sources as having disclosed yesterday.\n\nApparently disturbed by the development, the federal government yesterday ordered investigation into the bad fuel that had damaged the engines of some vehicles.\n\nIn addition to disrupting the country\u2019s fuel supply chain, the product which led to the damage of several cars, the NNPC disclosed, was imported from Antwerp in Belgium.\n\nSpeaking in Abuja, Kyari, argued that petrol brought into Nigeria usually does not include the test for the level of methanol content.\n\nThe NNPC helmsman maintained that cargoes\u2019 quality certificates issued at the loading port in Belgium, by AmSpec Belgium, indicated that the product complied with Nigerian specification.\n\nFurthermore, he said the NNPC quality inspectors including GMO, SGS, GeoChem and G&G conducted tests before discharge, which showed that the cargo also met the country\u2019s standard.\n\n\u201cAs a standard practice for all PMS import to Nigeria, the cargoes were equally certified by inspection agent appointed by the Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) has met Nigerian specification.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that the usual quality inspection protocol employed in both the load port in Belgium and our discharge ports in Nigeria do not include the test for per cent of methanol content and therefore the additive was not detected by our quality inspectors,\u201d he said.\n\nKyari disclosed that the NNPC had ordered the quarantine of all un-evacuated volumes of the contaminated fuel that led to the disruption of the petrol distribution value chain, in order to prevent further distribution.\n\nHe stressed that the NNPC and other stakeholders were making serious efforts to resolve issues generated by the supply and discharge of methanol blended product in some Nigerian depots.\n\nKyari noted that the NNPC first received a report on January 20, 2022, from its quality inspector of the presence of \u201cemulsion particles\u201d in petrol cargoes shipped to Nigeria from the European country.\n\nHe added: \u201cIn order to prevent the distribution of the petrol, we have ordered the quarantine of all un-evacuated volumes and the holding back of all the affected products in transit (both truck & marine).\n\n\u201cAll defaulting suppliers have been put on notice for remedial actions and NNPC will work with the authority to take further necessary actions in line with subsisting regulations.\n\n\u201cNNPC wishes to reassure Nigerians that we are currently sourcing additional cargoes to ensure product sufficiency.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the NNPC has ordered that all the affected products in transit (both truck & marine), should be withheld.\n\nBut the NNPC GMD\u2019s explanation ran contrary to an earlier press statement released by MRS, where the company denied culpability.\n\nIn its statement MRS had stated that it remains a responsible corporate citizen and will not be involved in the purchase, importation, distribution or marketing of substandard petroleum products in the country, coming short of directly accusing the NNPC of complicity.\n\n\u201cDue to current subsidy regime, NNPC is the sole supplier of all PMS in Nigeria. Consequently, the NNPC through their trading arm Duke Oil, supplied a cargo of PMS purchased from international trader Litasco and delivered it with Motor Tanker (MT) Nord Gainer. This vessel discharged in Apapa between the 24th and 30th of January, 2022,\u201d it had alleged.\n\nAs one of the beneficiaries, MRS said it received the product in its depot and distributed the product to only eight of its stations in Lagos.\n\nThe company described the allegation trending at the time as mischievous, false and untrue.\n\nBut the NNPC boss maintained that the methanol blended petrol was imported into the country by the suppliers, including MRS, through its Direct-Sales-Direct-Purchase arrangement.\n\nThe arrangement allows the national oil company to deliver monthly crude oil lifting on Free on Board (FOB) basis to suppliers who in return are supposed to deliver petroleum products of Nigerian standard specification to NNPC.\n\nThe petroleum products delivered are usually equivalent in value to the crude oil received from NNPC subject to the general terms and conditions as advised.\n\nBut according to the NNPC, the companies that supplied the methanol blended petrol included MRS which made the importation through a vessel named MT Bow Pioneer.\n\nHe said while Emadeb/Hyde/AY Maikifi/Brittania-U Consortium brought in the fuel through a vessel identified as MT Tom Hilde, Oando allegedly brought in the product through a vessel named MT Elka Apollon, while Duke Oil came through MT Nord Gainer vessel.\n\nFuel queues had been building in Lagos and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, due to fuel shortages caused by the withdrawal of the contaminated petrol from the market. But NNPC was said to be seeking thousands of tonnes of the product to ameliorate the situation, the report said.\n\nThe Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) had said it found fuel with methanol above national specifications in the supply chain and removed the fuel from circulation. Although methanol, in small amounts, is a regular gasoline additive, the regulator said the supplier of the off-specification gasoline was known but did not name the firm.\n\nNigeria depends almost entirely on imports to meet its domestic fuel needs after many failed attempts to revamp the dilapidated refineries, with daily consumption exceeding 60 million litres.\n\nNNPC handles nearly all the imports through crude-for-fuel contracts, known as Direct Sale, direct Purchase (DSDP), with consortia of local and foreign oil firms.\n\nEach consortium receives 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in exchange for products, making the combined total about 320,000 bpd of Nigeria\u2019s output.\n\nNigerians feel that cheap fuel is one of the few benefits the average Nigerian gets from the government, which sets price caps at the pump through a controversial and patchy subsidy scheme.\n\nMeanwhile, Chief Executive Officer of NMDPRA, Farouk Ahmed, yesterday stated that NNPC had received delivery of 300 million litres of petrol to close the supply gap created in the country by the withdrawal of the off-spec petrol.\n\nSpeaking in Lagos, when he met with marketers in a bid to raise distribution and remove the substandard fuel from supply chain, Ahmed said the 300 million litres arrived through six vessels ordered by NNPC. He noted that with the latest delivery, the fuel queues being witnessed in the country should disappear by Friday.\n\nAhmed said, \u201cToday, I am happy to say that loading has been going on in most of the depots because we have been able to identify, isolate and quarantine the limited amount of gasoline that was affected by the methanol volume that was discovered.\n\n\u201cWe have vessels that have arrived in the country recently. At least six arrived in the last few days, ordered by the NNPC, carrying a total volume of close to 300 million litres, just to close the gap created by those vessels we have withdrawn from the system.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Ahmed disclosed that there was a 9,000-metric tonne vessel that was being discharged at the Apapa Port to major marketers, including OVH, TotalEnergies, 11 Plc, Conoil, and Ardova Plc.\n\nAccording to him, as soon as the vessels complete discharging and start pushing products to oil marketers, the fuel queues in Lagos should fully disappear by Friday.\n\n\u201cSo, once these vessels complete discharging and start pushing the products to marketers, I believe Lagos will be cleared by Friday,\u201d Ahmed stated.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe have got that assurance from the marketers. Also, most of these vessels will be providing volumes to most of the key members of DAPPMAN.\u201d\n\nBut the NMDPRA boss stated that the country currently had petrol that could last for 20 days, 10 days short of the usual 30-day reserve.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur ideal days of sufficiency is 30 but this happened because of the concern that made us withdraw the vessels, which created the gap in our 30 days sufficiency.\n\n\u201cAgain, with aggressive importation by the NNPC, this will be closed in a few days, according to the data we got from the NNPC\u2019s import programme.\n\n\u201cLoading is also on-going in most of the depots that have confirmed spec products; so, there is no need for panic. Hopefully, by tomorrow, Lagos will be cleared.\u201d\n\nThe regulatory agency said it was also working to address the challenge thrown up by the importation of substandard petrol into the country.\n\nOther attendees at the meeting included top officials of NNPC, Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN), and members of the Depots and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPPMAN).\n\nFG Orders Investigation\n\nBriefing newsmen at Abuja, after the weekly virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, said government had initiated moves to investigate the supply and circulation of adulterated petrol in the country. Sylva said the federal government wanted to get to the root of the matter, and warned against hasty conclusions.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to draw any conclusions yet,\u201d the former Bayelsa State governor said. \u201cThere will be a major investigation to unravel everything and then let us really get to the bottom of it before we can come back and tell you what is going to happen to the culprits,\u201d he added.\n\nThe minister assured that the government would consider compensating those who might have been adversely affected by the bad fuel.\n\n\u201cWe know that some people\u2019s vehicles must have also been damaged, that is also going to be taken into consideration in dealing with the situation,\u201d he stated.\n\nAsked whether the issue was discussed at the FEC meeting and whether the suppliers would be punished, Sylva said, \u201cThe issue did not come up in council, but, of course, you will recall I was here yesterday to brief Mr. President on the issue. I\u2019m not in a position to disclose the identities of the companies, but there are some issues and we are actively tackling it.\n\n\u201cNobody has, before now, checked for methanol in our fuel, it\u2019s not very usual and this is the first time this is happening and the NNPC is up to the task.\n\n\u201cI will also convey your question to the NNPC and maybe the Midstream and Downstream Regulatory Authority, but we are actively handling it and I want to assure you that the problem will be a thing of the past very soon.\u201d\n\nMRS had in a newspaper advertorial yesterday said Duke Oil supplied a cargo of the adulterated petrol, which it purchased from an international trader, Litasco, and delivered with Motor Tanker (MT) Nord Gainer. MRS further stated the vessel was discharged in Apapa, Lagos, between January 24 and 30, 2022, explaining that major marketers received the following quantities: OVH \u2013 10,000mt; MRS \u2013 5,000mt; NIPCO \u2013 5,958mt; ARDOVA \u2013 6,000mt; and TOTAL \u2013 10,000mt\n\nSylva also spoke on the approval granted to his ministry by the council, saying FEC okayed the contract for the construction of the 17-storey local content building in Yenagoa at the cost of N1.817 billion.\n\nHe explained, \u201cYou will recall that in 2020, Mr. President already commissioned that project. There were some ancillary works that had to be done to connect some of the buildings and that was now presented to council for the sum of N1.817 billion and this now closes out this contract and we have told the contractor. This is the full and final payment for everything.\n\n\u201cSo, this is the end of this project and we have completely delivered this to Nigerians.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) engaged the services of the Association of Distributors and Transporters of Petroleum Products (ADITOP) to ensure uninterrupted distribution of petroleum products and maintain sanity in the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry.\n\nIPMAN President, Mr. Chinedu Okoronkwo, who disclosed this to journalists yesterday said the strategy would weaken the threat by the National Association of Transport Owners (NARTO), which recently issued a threat to embark on industrial action.\n\nOkoronkwo said IPMAN was not part of any trade association and would not embark on industrial action to further compound the predicament faced by Nigerians. He said members were already heavily indebted to banks and could not afford to stagnate their businesses, adding that already, many have shut down operations as a result of harsh operating environment.\n\nThe president said IPMAN was ready to confront the excesses of the NARTO and Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD), who he alleged illegally fleeced marketers.\n\nOkoronkwo stated, \u201cThey are not registered under oil and gas, but as dry dock. But today they are gradually redefining operations of marketers who have signed bulk purchase arrangement with the NNPC.\n\n\u201cWe have lost over N27 billion over time from illegal fees they collect from marketers. They collect about N45,000 per truck and taking in millions that ought to be part of our margins and are building stations and purchasing trucks at the expense of duly licensed marketers.\u201d\n\nOkoronkwo raised concern about the dwindling margins of marketers and the heavy debts hanging on the necks of IPMAN members.\n\n\u201cThe products we purchased with N1 million in the past is now about N7 million without additional margin to operators,\u201d he said.\n\nNARTO had threatened to stop haulage of petroleum products across the country over the hike in the price of diesel to N430 per litre and other operational challenges. The association had earlier decried the delay in the payment of about N45 billion bridging cost, and demanded an increase in the transportation allowance factored into the pump price of petrol.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "This developer transitioned to blockchain development in order to solve Web2 problems",
          "text": "Akinyemi Akindele, 27, studied computer science at the University of Ibadan, where he trained as a Web2 software developer.\n\nHowever, his journey into the blockchain world did not start until he got an internship in 2015 at Interswitch, one of Africa\u2019s earliest unicorns. At Interswitch, he worked in the research and development team where he got the opportunity to test out interesting emerging technologies like AI and blockchain\u2014technologies that the business was not focusing on at that point.\n\nAkindele was neck-deep into the blockchain and soon realised its power. \u201cPeople were talking about the future of finance and I got to work on it early on,\u201d Akindele said. As a Nigerian experiencing the rapid decline in value of the naira, Akindele resonated with bitcoin\u2019s promise to provide a store of value not tied to the traditional financial system or government\u2019s whims.\n\nHe was a man of varied interest, his final year paper at the university was based on artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014with a focus on artificial neural networks. Upon graduating from university, he returned to work at Interswitch and started learning how to develop blockchain solutions. Eventually, he got to build a blockchain supply chain solution with his team, the first of its kind in the country, he said. The blockchain solution made the loaning and contract awarding process involving Dangote Plc bidding suppliers and banks seamless.\n\nAkindele attended hackathons, and ethereum meetups organised by Consensys in Lagos, where he had to build smart contracts on ethereum. He won some\u2014worth 1 to 3 million naira\u2014and that was pivotal to his career growth. He admitted that he won a lot of those hackathons because he already had a lot of experience in building ethereum solutions at his workplace, Interswitch.\n\nIn one of the hackathons, he met an American founder, Daniel Block, who was building an NFT marketplace for properties, as far back as 2018. He was on a mission to tokenise real estate properties in Africa, had digitised land records in Ghana, and had his sights set on Nigeria.\n\nAkindele joined Block\u2019s company, SESO Global, as its first blockchain engineer, where he helped build an NFT marketplace. There, he spent a year building their enterprise ethereum, and wrote smart contract code to power those NFTs\u2014years before the NFT buzz of 2021.\n\nA rich blockchain development experience\n\nIt was in one of those hackathons, where he had been an outstanding competitor, that Akindele met Yele Bademosi, Nestcoin co-founder, who was then director of Binance Labs, the venture arm of global crypto exchange, Binance. Yele was a judge in those hackathons, and he kept in touch with Akindele because of his outstanding performance. So, when Yele needed a team to start a project internally inside Binance, he reached out to Akindele.\n\nAkindele joined Binance\u2014where he was earning about $48,000 per year\u2014as a blockchain engineer, and with a team of backend, mobile, and blockchain engineers, helped build a cryptocurrency exchange right from the scratch. \u201cIt was interesting because we got to learn a lot of new things. For example, I did a lot of encryption, wallet generation, and signing off; and I got to know a lot of different coins listed on the exchange.\u201d\n\nAkindele recalled that the project commenced when Facebook announced Libra, a cryptocurrency, wallet and an exchange, all in one. \u201cIt looked like the hottest thing ever!\u201d Akindele further explained that Binance was worried Facebook might take over developing countries due to the proposed Libra\u2019s reach, so Binance started a competing project, which gave birth to Bundle Africa.\n\nAt the time, Bundle Africa ran as a startup inside Binance and was also a remote-first company. Within 16 months, Bundle Africa got 650,000 users, majorly by word of mouth, community marketing, and a small marketing budget. The way its adoption skyrocketed made Akindele realise the huge potential crypto products had.\n\nAfter two years at Binance, Akindele joined EMTECH, a US blockchain company that builds digital currency for central banks across the world. At EMTECH\u2014where he was earning about $84, 000 per year\u2014he helped build tokens, did DevOps work and helped in shipping projects. EMTECH had created the world\u2019s first CBDC for the Bahamas and was the go-to fintech company for central banks looking to create digital currencies.\n\nBreaking into blockchain development\n\nAnother idea that endeared Akindele to blockchain engineering was that the blockchain was a melting point for a lot of things. \u201cTo be very good at blockchain you have to know things beyond your engineering skills, like finance, and compliance and regulations. You have to think about these things every time you write a code or develop anything.\u201d\n\nAkindele believes that anyone who wants to transition into becoming a Web3 developer must believe that it is the future. \u201cYou have to convince yourself because no one is coming to convince you that ownership rights on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will be big in the future.\u201d\n\nHe further advised aspiring blockchain developers to learn how to build on a popular blockchain like ethereum, develop ethereum Decentralised applications (Dapps) and write Solidity code. \u201cIt is at this point you will realise that you have new powers because you would be able to write smart contracts, deploy them on a public blockchain and see people interacting with your blockchain.\u201d\n\nSolving problems with Web3\n\nAkindele left EMTECH to found a startup, BetDemand, a decentralised finance (DeFi) sport betting platform where every player who lose their bets still get their initial staking.\n\nThe idea for BetDemand came to him while he studied game theory to understand why and how people play games and the economic models designed as part of those games. He discovered that economic incentives in the traditional sports betting model are harmful: a large number of people were losing money but couldn\u2019t stop playing because they were already addicted to betting.\n\nBetDemand eliminates the major problem people have with betting: losing their money. \u201cImagine telling a punter that even if he loses, he will get his money back after a week. That is an irresistible offer,\u201d Akindele said. Players can only bet on football for now, with naira\u2014for as low as \u20a650\u2014and crypto.\n\nBetDemand gathers all the money staked by players in a single pool, introducing a lock-up period of 1 week, where players do not receive their money back until after a week. During this lock-up period, BetDemand converts this pool of funds to USDT, a stablecoin, which would then be deposited in Venus protocol, a DeFi lending and borrowing platform. The pool of funds then earns 12% to 15% annual percentage yield (APY).\n\n\u201cEverybody gets their money back at the end of the day, whether you win or lose, and the interest we get during the lock-up period is shared with the winners.\u201d\n\nAkindele explained that they could have opted for other coins that would raise their yield to as high as 30% but, right now, they are sticking with USDT because stablecoins are non-volatile. They make less profit but it\u2019s just enough to sustain the business.\n\nIn the last week of October, when BetDemand launched, the size of its pool of funds was $450; now it has increased to $26,000 per week.\n\nBetDemand calculates winnings by multiplying the amount that players bet by total odds\u2014a method not particularly different from how traditional betting companies calculate winnings. The day of the week in which one places a bet also affects winnings; it\u2019s called the \u201cday factor\u201d. The difference with BetDemand, however, is that payouts are based on the interest the pool of funds yields over the week, so players can\u2019t earn as high as they would with traditional betting. \u201cBut what we pay is enough to keep people coming back.\u201d\n\nLike the buzzy play-to-earn gaming Web3 companies, BetDemand is charting its course as a DeFi gaming company. And, although, yet to be announced, it has raised an angel round and is in the process of closing a pre-seed round.\n\nAkindele, speaking about what Web3 will do for Africa, said, \u201cWeb3 will be very big for Africa, because when the internet was being built in Silicon Valley, a lot of Africans did not participate in that. But we have a chance to do so now. Every time new technologies are built, a lot of wealth is created around that period, and people involved in building these technologies, or those that exist at the time, benefit from it.\u201d\n\nHe advised developers hoping to start their blockchain engineering journey to join communities on Discord, connect with people, and ask questions, especially from founders, to see why they make the decisions they make.

          "title": "TechCabal\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Gift Guide",
          "text": "Valentine\u2019s is fast approaching and so is the race to win people\u2019s hearts with gifts. For many, the outcome of February 14 will decide if Christmas this year will be celebrated wearing matching pyjamas, or joining unnamed Zikoko team members blocking and muting words like \u201clove\u201d and \u201cme and mines\u201d later.\n\nFor Christmas, we gave you a guide to help you navigate gifting during the holiday season. Now we\u2019ve created this one to help you navigate Valentine\u2019s.\n\nThere\u2019s tech in everything, even gift-giving. If you\u2019re looking to steer clear of basic gifts like one-time food platters that will be consumed in single sittings, this is the guide for you. For example, James Wardle created a $1 million game\u2014Wordle\u2014for his partner who loved video games. Locket, an app that helps users share their photos to their friends\u2019/lovers\u2019 home screens, was built by Matt Moss as a present for his girlfriend. Even Zoom was the product of a founder who wanted to connect with his girlfriend long distance.\n\nLast year, the African tech ecosystem raised a whopping $4 billion+ so we know things are working. As we invest and build more startups, it\u2019s also important to invest and build relationships. And that\u2019s why you should move away from chocolates and roses to\u2026\n\n1. Professional courses\n\nLevel: Series C\n\nIf you can\u2019t build your partner apps The New York Times will later buy for millions of dollars, at least enrol them in courses where they can learn to build, design, market or manage those apps\u2014for themselves or future lovers. \ud83e\udd2d\n\nThere are a few online schools where you can pay for courses like software engineering, design, product management, marketing, or content creation. Check out AltSchool, Moringa School, Decagon Institute, Coursera, and Pluralsight.\n\nYou should also sign them up for TC Daily, a daily newsletter that can give your lover comprehensive insight into tech.\n\nWe\u2019re always talking about getting more people into tech. Use this Valentine\u2019s and help people kick-start their journey into tech.\n\nPrice range: > $99\n\nWe\u2019ve labelled this a Series C-type gift because it\u2019s a long-term investment beneficial to all involved. It\u2019s expensive but also profitable in the long run. Unless, of course, the giftee gets acquired by another gifter. \ud83d\udc80\n\n2. Music streaming subscriptions\n\nLevel: Seed\n\nImage source: Stuff.tv\n\nThis one is a given.\n\nMusic heals our body, soul, and mind. It\u2019s also one of the greatest ways to connect with people. Over the past 5 years, the growth of streaming services\u2014indigenous and foreign\u2014has doubled.\n\nFor Valentine\u2019s, get your loved ones subscriptions on Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube Music, and Boomplay.\n\nPrice range: $2 \u2013 $4 (for Individual plans)\n\nWe\u2019re labelling this a seed-type gift because, any way you dice it, you\u2019re sowing seeds. You\u2019re either sowing seeds of \u201cThis is how we chose our wedding songs\u201d, or breakfast seeds that will lead to many Adele playlists. Happy planting. \ud83c\udf31\n\n3. Video streaming subscriptions\n\nLevel: Seed\n\nImage source: The Streamable\n\nEver heard of Netflix and Chill? Well, here\u2019s how you can someday build up to that: get them video streaming subscriptions for Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nWith multiple plans to choose from, Iroko TV and Netflix have been giving us really amazing African content in the past few years.\n\nGet a Nollywood lover an Iroko or Netflix subscription for Valentine\u2019s.\n\nPrice range: From $7 (+ Free basic Netflix plans in Kenya)\n\nThis is also a seed-type gift because it\u2019s affordable and useful if things go sideways. Renewing the subscriptions marks the token of your shared love, and not renewing can be a new way to end the relationship, instead of ghosting.\n\n4. Data subscriptions\n\nLevel: Pre-seed\n\nData is life. And the more of it you have, the more you can access information available online. Data on the continent is still relatively expensive, and in some countries, people can pay as much as $7 for 1GB of data.\n\nAll the digital gifts we\u2019ve listed above are data-dependent so make sure you\u2019re getting your loved ones access to the gifts you give.\n\nWith data, people can stream as many movies and videos as they possibly can. Log on to your MTN, Safaricom, Airtel, or Ethio Telecom services and gift your loved one gigabytes of data.\n\nPrice range: From < $1\n\nThis is the only pre-seed gift here because you can decide how much or how little you want to invest here.\n\n5. Home services\n\nLevel: Series C\n\nImage source: Yung Nollywood\n\nWhat\u2019s better than one-time food platters? Daily food packages that trump the time-consuming activity of cooking.\n\nThere\u2019s tech in everything, and that includes automating home services like laundry and cooking.\n\nStartups like Eden Life have created platforms where you can subscribe to monthly packages for laundry, cooking and cleaning services. If you\u2019re going to go with the food option for Valentine\u2019s, then go all the way.\n\nPrice range: From $50\n\nThis is labelled Series C because it\u2019s also a long-term gift. Every time your loved one eats or steps into clean rooms and clothes, they\u2019ll think of you and how much you\u2019ve made their lives easier.\n\n6. Crypto\n\nLevel: Series C\n\nImage source: Corporate Compliance Insights\n\nRoses are red, violets are blue. Crypto is here, and its promise is true.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to talk much about crypto. Like your relationships, it has its ups and downs, \ud83d\udc80 but that\u2019s what makes us love it.\n\nFor Valentine\u2019s, add to your loved one\u2019s crypto stash and help them build their way into digital wealth. There are many cryptocurrencies to choose from, like bitcoin, ethereum, and doge. And if you\u2019re worried about the chances of the coins depreciating, remember that even your relationship is a gamble.\n\nGet on BuyCoins, Yellow Card, Quidax, Nestcoin, or Bitsika to mine your way into people\u2019s hearts.\n\nPrice range: From $1 (invest as required).\n\nThis is a Series C gift because it\u2019s long-term for both of you. If the relationship dips, you can take comfort in knowing that whenever crypto dips, so will your ex\u2019s happiness.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please give TechCabal a gift by sharing it on Twitter, Facebook, Whatsapp or Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Bolt\u2019s plans for Africa after raising mega funding",
          "text": "In January, Bolt, one of the biggest ride-hailing startups in the world, closed a $711 million funding round led by Sequoia Capital and Fidelity and saw its valuation go up from $4.8 billion to about $8.4 billion.\n\nThe company said the new funds will be used to further improve its full suite of mobility and delivery products, and expand into new cities in Europe and Africa.\n\nTo understand Bolt\u2019s overarching plans for Africa, its second-largest market after Europe, TechCabal spoke with its Africa Regional Director, Paddy Partridge.\n\nEven though the company has added 2 new verticals\u2014shared cars and scooters, and quick commerce called Bolt Market\u2014to its product line, ride-hailing and food delivery services are the only products available in Africa. Rather than launch all its verticals in African cities, the company wants to continue ramping up more users for its ride-hailing and food delivery products\u2014at least for this year, as it introduces them to more African cities.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nExpansion while meeting demands\n\nAccording to Partridge, the company is doubling down on its expansion plan in the North Africa region, as it currently only operates in Tunisia. Partridge also mentioned that more West African cities have been earmarked for expansion. However, expansion means more demands, and the company, like other players in the sector, is currently struggling to meet up.\n\nToday, the company boasts of over 40 million customers\u2014that\u2019s about 40% of its total users base\u2014and over 700,000 drivers in about 90 cities across 8 countries on the continent. A rough calculation puts the driver-to-rider ratio at 1:570. This is reported to be the reason for the occasional surge in trip prices, like the one observed in December last year. Prices had to be increased to attract more drivers to sign up and fill up the order.\n\nGoing forward, more drivers will be onboarded, so a surge in price wouldn\u2019t be the solution to meeting high demand. But the problem here is the lack of access to vehicles: thousands of drivers are willing to get on Bolt but don\u2019t own or have access to a vehicle to work with.\n\n\u201cThis is a major challenge, and to solve it, we\u2019re now doing several partnerships on the vehicle financing side,\u201d Partridge told TechCabal.\n\nThe company, which has a standing partnership with Nigeria\u2019s Sterling bank, has added Nigeria\u2019s MAX.ng, a logistics and vehicular asset financing startup, to the list of partners to provide financing for 10,000 affordable vehicles to their drivers. The company is also in partnership with FlexClub, a vehicle financing marketplace, to serve its drivers in South Africa.\n\n\u201cHopefully, it\u2019ll mean less surging, which I know is a challenge in the Nigerian market. And it\u2019ll mean that we can keep up with the growing demand,\u201d Partridge said.\n\nTransitioning to electronic mobility\n\nElectric mobility is the new trend, and every environment-conscious company is embracing the development. In Europe, Bolt says its fleets are filled with electric vehicles (EVs) and, as a result, all trips are carbon-neutral. Bolt\u2019s Green Plan is created to reduce its global ecological footprint. It says its e-scooters are all charged with 100% green energy and made from 100% recyclable materials. The company has begun to replicate that in Africa and is also planning to optimise for green this year.\n\n\u201cLast year, we introduced the green category in Nairobi. We also rolled out EVs for ride-hailing and food delivery in several markets. This year, we really want to start accelerating that,\u201d said Partridge. \u201cThis is important for two reasons: it is better for the environment and more profitable to drivers, particularly as fuel prices go up so rapidly.\u201d\n\nAs sweet as this development sounds, Partridge, unsurprisingly, said there is currently no plan to implement EVs in Nigeria. It\u2019s actually a no-brainer because Nigeria hasn\u2019t done a lot in the EV sector; there is no infrastructure to support EVs and, compared to other markets, they are not a wise economic option. This means MAX.ng, Bolt\u2019s financing partner, won\u2019t be extending EVs in its home country like it has done in other markets it operates in\u2014such as Egypt. \u201cThe main focus areas at this stage are really Kenya and South Africa.\u201d\n\nExtensive driver education and verification\n\nSix years ago in 2016\u2014about 3 years after it was founded in Estonia\u2014Bolt made its first foray into Africa when it launched in South Africa. It quickly expanded into Kenya, Ghana, and Nigeria, and within 4 years, displaced Uber, its biggest competitor, to become the biggest ride-hailing platform in Africa.\n\nBut with huge growth comes equal responsibilities and challenges. Bolt\u2019s success in Africa came with a price. The startup has gone through an odd collection of good, bad, and ugly reviews from its African customers. Riders have reported being harassed by Bolt\u2019s drivers. For instance, during Nigeria\u2019s #ENDSARs protests, some Nigerians took to social media to complain and rant about how Bolt\u2019s drivers were delivering young people to the police. And this is one of many unpleasant experiences with the service.\n\nTo solve the problem, Partridge said the company is investing in building a more efficient verification system that will weed out bad players and shoot up the security rating of the platform. Though the process varies from market to market, depending on regulatory requirements, Bolt currently onboards drivers by checking identification and running criminal background checks.\n\nThe issue of onboarding only qualified well-behaved drivers on the platform may be a hard nut to crack because, when Bolt newly entered the African market, it was reported that the platform relaxed its entry requirement to snag market share from Uber\u2014a strategy that worked at the time but continues to haunt and hurt the brand today.\n\n\u201cSo, we have a new sort of quality management system that basically tracks different metrics and gives drivers more actionable feedback on how to improve their behavior on the platform,\u201d Partridge said. He also mentioned that Bolt is improving on their driver education programme, both online and offline.\n\nA safe space for women\n\nIt\u2019s said that women feel safer with other women than with men. This means that Bolt must onboard more female drivers. According to the African director, Bolt is looking to bring more women drivers onto the platform.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, across Africa, women make up a very small share of our driver base. But we see quite a big opportunity to get more of them into ride-hailing. And in South Africa and Kenya, we\u2019ve now launched women-only categories.\u201d\n\nThe women-only category is a feature that allows women to choose their rider to be a woman. \u201cThis is basically a way to give women a bit more trust on the platform, where they can choose if they want to pair with a woman rider.\u201d Similarly, women drivers, if they want to be paired with a woman rider, can choose that.\n\nOne could have sworn that the women\u2019s category would be rolled out in Nigeria immediately, given the many complaints from Nigerian women about harassment from male Bolt drivers. But that hasn\u2019t happened because, according to Patridge, South Africa and Kenya have the highest share of female drivers\u2014which is an essential metric in rolling out the feature.\n\n\u201cIt was most feasible to get the category off the ground in South Africa. We wanted to test what kind of traction the category could get, and South Africa is the most suitable pilot test. For us to provide women riders with a category that makes sense, we need to have a certain volume of female drivers in the first place.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "As the African Cup of Nation (Afcon) fiesta rages in Cameroon, a young photographer is positioned to make a name for himself. The moment comes but his accreditation doesn\u2019t. What next? The making of a viral photographer.\n\nThis article was contributed to TechCabal by Patrick Nelle (bird story agency)\n\nThe crowd\u2019s roar is taking eardrums in the stadium to the point of bursting. Colourful and exuberant football lovers have packed the 60,000 seat arena and now they are screaming, shouting, singing, dancing and enjoying themselves as legendary Congolese rhumba hit-maker Fally Ipupa belts out a crowd-pleaser.\n\nThe sky is bright over the Olembe stadium in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon\u2019s capital city, where the 33rd Africa Cup of Nations is opening on a memorable and vibrant show. Standing near the pitch, a young man is looking on. In a few minutes, he will be triggering his camera, producing incredible shots that will go viral and bring him fame. This is the power of Afcon, Africa\u2019s biggest regular footballing event.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe 28-year old Cameroonian in the crowd is Didier Lefa, a wedding and event photographer who spent two years in the run-up to Cameroon\u2019s African Cup of Nations event preparing to break into sports and freelance photography. He upgraded his gear with a new lens and other state-of-the-art equipment to ensure quick delivery of his photos. He\u2019s still bemused at how he has found himself in the crowd and worried that he has somehow messed up. He needn\u2019t worry. He\u2019s minutes away from being one of the most-watched photographers on the continent.\n\nOnly a few hours before the beginning of the competition, Didier\u2019s dream was on the verge of collapse. After two years of preparation, a crucial element was missing\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t received my accreditation yet,\u201d he explained. He had not yet been granted accreditation from the CAF, the Confederation of Africa Football. The accreditation document gives journalists and photographers the right to access stadiums and venues where the Afcon takes place.\n\n\u201cWithout it, I couldn\u2019t do anything. I was totally discouraged. My morale was at its lowest, all of my efforts had been in vain\u201d, he said in an interview.\n\nHad his aunt\u2014who is a sports photographer\u2014not woken him up in the early hours of that Sunday morning, he would have stayed home and watched the fiesta on TV.\n\nFootball fans on the street/ Didier Lefa.\n\n\u201cAccreditation or not, be there\u201d, she told him. He argued but finally bowed to her harsh insistence.\n\n\u201cShe took me to the stadium at 7 am\u201d, he said.\n\nHe recalled that he was wondering why she was taking him there so early in the morning. The opening ceremony was set to start only at 2.00 pm. He would soon discover why.\n\n\u201cThe stadium\u2019s gates were still closed, but the place around was already overcrowded, everyone was already in a joyful mood, the Afcon fiesta had already started. Ten hours before the game kick-off, it looked like we were late\u201d, he remembered.\n\nHe pulled his camera out of his bag and started to shoot. He and his aunt were the only photographers on the site, and being there gave him a renewed energy, Lefa said.\n\n\u201cI took pictures frantically. I captured images of football fans undergoing their covid-19 tests and being vaccinated. I posted them on Twitter, and they went viral. Every picture I was posting was going viral, it was amazing.\u201d\n\nAmid the excitement of his work going viral, Lefa was still worried about his accreditation. He still didn\u2019t know if he would finally be able to enter the stadium. Once again, his aunt came to his rescue.\n\nA Cameroonian fan at the Afcon opening ceremony. Image source: Didier Lefa.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how she managed to do that, she just said \u2018don\u2019t worry, follow me\u2019 which I did, and I found myself inside the stadium. It was an awful wait,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than 4 hours into a non-stop filming spree, he was starting to feel tired, but being near the pitch and a few meters from the players provided an energy boost. He excitedly shot joyful fans screaming in the stands, game action and players\u2019 prowess on the field, streaming to social media with a flow of powerful and vivid pictures, all of them going viral, one after another.\n\nAnd at 11 pm, totally exhausted, someone called him on the phone. \u201cYour accreditation is ready, come and collect it\u201d said the voice.\n\nFeedback on his Twitter profile showed how his pictures had struck a chord with an audience.\n\n\u201cThere is real life in his pictures, when I saw them, I really felt like I was there at Olembe enjoying with the other fans,\u201d said Bernadette, on why she became one of Lefa\u2019s more than 130,000 Twitter followers.\n\n\u201cOur country is mired in crisis, and I think his pictures are keeping hope alive and helping us believe that despite the crisis, we still have the potential to achieve big things,\u201d Onana, another Lefa fan, added.\n\nThe opening ceremony of the 33rd Afcon in Olembe stadium, Yaounde on Jan 9 2022. Image source: Didier Lefa.\n\nLefa made photography his profession just 4 years ago, resisting the demands of his father who wanted to veto his career choice. His mother, however, defended her son\u2019s decision and such was his determination that finally won his father over too. The family supported his passion and career orientation to the extent that they financed a $2,000 professional camera.\n\nIt\u2019s that very camera that is now producing memorable pictures of one of the most important moments in his country\u2019s modern history\u2014capturing the raw emotion, the life and beauty of a moment in time.\n\nHis passion for photography came at an early age, he said, when he discovered photography through his aunt.\n\n\u201cI\u2018ve always liked to take pictures\u201d.\n\nHe recalled that one day his aunt took him to an orphanage for a photo report.\n\n\u201cShe gave me a Nikon reflex camera, it was my very first experience with that kind of camera. She told me \u2018just take pictures\u2019 which I did. This is how it all started.\u201d\n\nCameroon team members celebrating their goal against Burkina Faso during the opener of the 33rd Afcon in Olembe stadium, Yaounde on Jan 9 2022. Image source: Didier Lefa\n\nLefa believes that in Cameroon photographers do not receive the social credit they deserve for their job. For example, he explained, many media organisations across Africa \u201cloot\u201d pictures on the internet and use them without the permission of the owner and without respect to copyright principles.\n\nHe had exactly that issue with a local Cameroonian newspaper that took one of his Afcon images directly off Twitter to use for content illustration, without citing him as the author. He denounced the move on his Twitter feed, sparking an online mobilisation against the media, leading the offending organisation to apologize.\n\nLefa didn\u2019t slow down after that first viral photo. Throughout the tournament, he traveled from one town to another, passionately capturing the essence of each Afcon game. He agreed to a bird interview during a short transit in Douala from Yaound\u00e9, on his way to Limbe where he was to cover the game between Ivory Coast and Algeria.\n\nWith a burning desire to embrace new challenges, Lefa was already looking ahead. His current experience has allowed him to build connections with foreign photographers and to enter partnerships with some media like RTI, the Ivory Coast public broadcaster.\n\nHis next \u201cbig thing\u201d will be the football World Cup next November in Qatar, he said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Explainer: Methanol is good in petrol, bad for engine when excess",
          "text": "The \u2018dirty petrol\u2019 currently in Nigeria, which the government has been trying to take out of circulation, has been noted to contain methanol. The Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) had said a methanol quantity above Nigeria\u2019s specification was discovered in the petrol supply chain. This specification and what was found, was not disclosed.\n\nHowever, having methanol in the fuel supply is not unexpected; it only has to be within certain limits, which for Nigeria has not been made public even though different countries also have their methanol limits.\n\n\u201cMethanol is a regular additive in petrol and is usually blended in an acceptable quantity. To ensure vehicular and equipment safety, the limited quantity of the impacted product has been isolated and withdrawn from the market, including the loaded trucks in transit,\u201d NMDPRA said.\n\nAdding alcohols such as ethanol and methanol to petrol allows the fuel to combust more completely due to the presence of oxygen, which increases the combustion efficiency and reduces air pollution, as noted by a Science Direct article. However, when in excess, as noted by another publication the corrosive effects of methanol become a concern.\n\nMore than half of the cylinder blocks for car engines are made from aluminum, which incidentally is very prone to corrosion by methanol, which would also affect other components such as gaskets and rubber hoses. This, however, becomes a problem only as the methanol content in a fuel becomes higher than permitted.\n\nWhen the engines and components get corroded due to substances such as methanol, the outcomes include damage to the engine, which if not detected and rectified where possible, could render it useless.\n\nRead also: Dirty petrol: Government to compensate owners of damaged cars\n\nThe current incidence of methanol in Nigeria\u2019s petrol can be likened to something good being abused, and in the end, giving a bad outcome. It can also be seen as a cheap additive being added in excess to cut costs on petrol that would still be sold at the standard price, hence additional profit-making as an objective.\n\nAccording to the Methanol Institute, methanol is a clean-burning, high octane blending component for gasoline that is made from alternative non-petroleum energy sources such as natural gas, coal, and biomass. Methanol with co-solvents has been commercially blended into gasoline (petrol) at various times and locations since the late 1970s.\n\nIn many regions of the globe, the blending of oxygenates such as alcohols and ethers are controlled by government regulations that specify the limits for the various oxygenates allowed in commercial gasoline. As for methanol blending, the maximum limit in gasoline had generally been established based on the compatibility of the non-metal materials of the older vehicles on the road at the time that the regulation was being established.\n\nAlthough fuel system material compatibility (metals and non-metals) concerns during the commercial introduction of methanol blending during the early 1980s had initially limited methanol content to 5 percent or less in Europe and US markets. The advancement of fuel systems materials and the improvement of corrosion inhibitors to address the growing use of alcohol blends such as ethanol (up to 25% in Brazil) in global markets allows today\u2019s vehicles on the road to use much higher levels of methanol with little risk of incompatibility or performance degradation, according to the Methanol Institute\u2019s publication.",

          "text": "The Financial Times Africa Editor, David Pilling, wrote an article last month where he asked \u201cWhat is Nigeria\u2019s government for?\u201d\n\nOne of the possible answers to that is the government now exists to pay creditors. Not to invest in education, healthcare or infrastructure, as is expected of a developing economy with promising human capital and a huge infrastructure deficit.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) is projecting Nigeria will spend 92 percent of its earnings paying creditors this year. Agusto and Co, a local credit ratings firm, says the figure will be around 90 percent.\n\nIf these projections do happen, it will be by far the most any country pays as a percentage of revenue servicing debt.\n\nNigeria was already spending the highest as a percentage of its revenue of any country repaying creditors back in 2019, according to data from the World Bank.\n\nIn 2019, Nigeria spent N54 of every N100 it earned, more than half, servicing debt. The country closest to Nigeria, Lebanon, was spending 50.8 percent of its revenues.\n\nNigeria being ahead of Lebanon is in itself a big indictment. Lebanon is grappling with a deep economic crisis after successive governments piled up debt following the 1975-1990 civil war with little to show for their spending binge.\n\nRead also: African govt, banks, SMEs to benefit as $10bn AfCFTA Adjustment Fund debuts\n\nLebanese banks, central to the service-oriented economy, are paralysed. Savers have been locked out of dollar accounts or told that funds they can access are now worth a fraction of their original value. The currency has crashed, driving a swathe of the population into poverty.\n\nNigeria is not much different. There\u2019s little to show for the government\u2019s debt binge and the country is now the world\u2019s poverty capital, overtaking India with five times its population, according to the Brookings Institution.\n\nA Lebanese who owns a business in Nigeria told BusinessDay that he fled his country due to the economic hardship but admits Nigeria is increasingly towing his country of origin.\n\n\u201cEverywhere I go something bad happens,\u201d he jokes. \u201cThe Nigerian situation has not yet deteriorated to what is obtainable in Lebanon but there are signs it is only a matter of time before it does as Nigeria is heading the same path; piling debt with nothing to show for it, but then the creditors are at the door,\u201d the Lebanese business owner said.\n\nBut the situation risks being even worse.\n\nIf Nigeria starts spending 92 percent of its revenues on debt servicing, it means the government is nearing crisis levels where there may even be more recourse to further borrowing to repay existing creditors.\n\n\u201cWe will be back to the 80s or perhaps even worse if that happened,\u201d an economist who did not want to be named said. \u201cThen the government used borrowed money to pay for old borrowings and the debt service cost was usually the first line item on the expenditure side of the budget,\u201d the economist said.\n\nThe government seems oblivious to the impending crisis. In its 2022 budget, less than 40 percent of revenues is earmarked for debt servicing. But the trend of lower than planned actual revenues means analysts hold the estimate with a pinch of salt.\n\n\u201cThe worry is that Nigeria\u2019s rapidly growing foreign debt stock does not reflect shrinking oil revenues and we need to be careful not to fall into the 1980s debt trap where a huge chunk of revenues went to debt service,\u201d said Egie Akpata, a director at Lag0s-based investment bank, UCML Capital.\n\nThe government\u2019s resistance to ditch costly petrol subsidies makes it easy to see why the IMF expects Nigeria to eclipse its own record of debt service as a percentage of revenue.",

          "text": "From haulage to consumer goods, retail outlets, and small businesses, all are coming under pressure as the retail cost of diesel at various filling stations jumped by 24 percent to N410 per litre in February, findings by BusinessDay reveals.\n\nThe price of diesel, which is not regulated by the government, has surged by over 24 percent on the back of the soaring price of Brent crude, dollar price, and the forces of demand and supply, sources said.\n\n\u201cUnlike petrol, diesel is deregulated, which means the increase in the international price of crude oil is responsible for what we see across Nigerian filling stations,\u201d Mike Osatuyi, national operations controller of Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), said.\n\nCrude oil price accounts for a large chunk of the final cost of petroleum products such as diesel, kerosene, and such associated products.\n\nRemoval of subsidy on kerosene and diesel by former President Olusegun Obasanjo means that the pump prices of the products will reflect changes in the international oil market.\n\nBrent crude, the benchmark for Nigeria\u2019s crude oil has gained more than 28percennt to $91 on February 09, 2022.\n\n\u201cWe bought diesel at N410 today and this has affected the cost of checking-in to our hotels and short let apartments,\u201d Azeez Raji, Manager of Urban Metro Inn, who runs on diesel to sustain his business.\n\nEsu Olumba-Obu, the Group managing director of Royal Farms Ltd says the high cost of diesel is posing serious threats in sustaining the group business.\n\n\u201cThe high cost of diesel most businesses are now faced with the option of closing down or retrenching staff to survive,\u201d Olumba-Obu told BusinessDay.\n\nData gleaned from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed the average price paid by consumers for diesel increased by 4.15 percent from N277.83 in November to an average of N289.37 in December 2021.\n\nIt said states with the highest average price of diesel were States with the highest price Enugu (N349.29), Borno (N340.00), and Oyo (N326.25).\n\n\u201cStates with the lowest average price of diesel were Kebbi (N232.36), Yobe (N226.61), and Katsina (N225.00),\u201d the NBS noted.\n\nObservers believe that, while businesses are feeling the pinch, the government is powerless because the downstream diesel sector is deregulated.\n\nDiesel is mostly used by businesses, especially manufacturers, to power their generators amid a lack of reliable power supply from the national grid. Many vehicles transporting goods and people across the country also use diesel.\n\nRead also: Despite oil price at $90 barrel, naira may fall to N450 \u2013 RenCap\n\nMore than 70 percent of Nigerian firms rely heavily on diesel-powered generators. The machines guzzle cash and spew pollution, but they are reliable in a nation where nearly 85 million people \u2013 some 40 percent of the population \u2013 have no access to grid power.\n\nWhile many Nigerian households and small business generators are powered by price-capped petrol, the big generators for larger firms, apartment complexes and more substantial homes can run on diesel.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the price of the product keeps increasing and nothing is being done about it. The high inflation rate in the country means that people have less money to buy things, and when prices are going up and the masses have less money to buy those products, we are going to have a lot of joblessness in the country,\u201d the President, Association of Small Business Owners of Nigeria, Femi Egbesola said.\n\nNigeria, Africa\u2019s largest oil producer, relies largely on importation for petrol and other refined products as its refineries have remained in a state of disrepair for many years.",

          "title": "CBN launches RT200 FX Programme to drive export, targets $200bn FX repatriation in 3-5 years",
          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has launched what it called \u201cRT200 FX Programme,\u201d which according to it, stands for the \u201cRace to US$200 billion in FX Repatriation.\u201d\n\nGovernor of the bank, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, who announced the programme at a press briefing on Thursday, said the RT200 FX Programme is a set of policies, plans and programmes for non-oil exports that will enable the country attain lofty yet attainable goal of US$200 billion in FX repatriation, exclusively from non-oil exports, over the next 3-5 years.\n\n\u201cAfter careful consideration of the available options and wide consultation with the Banking Community, the CBN is, effective immediately, announcing the Bankers\u2019 Committee \u201cRT200 FX Programme\u201d, which stands for the \u201cRace to US$200 billion in FX Repatriation,\u201d\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe RT200 FX Programme is a set of policies, plans and programmes for non-oil exports that will enable us attain our lofty yet attainable goal of US$200 billion in FX repatriation, exclusively from non-oil exports, over the next 3-5 years.\u201d\n\nEmefiele explained that the RT200 Programme will have the five key anchors, including, Value-Adding Exports Facility, Non-Oil Commodities Expansion Facility, Non-Oil FX Rebate Scheme, Dedicated Non-Oil Export Terminal and Biannual Non-Oil Export Summit.\n\nDescribing each of the anchors, he said, \u201cThe Value-Adding Export Facility will provide concessionary and long-term funding for businesspeople who are interested in expanding existing plants or building brand new ones for the sole purpose of adding significant value to our non-oil commodities before exporting same.\n\n\u201cThis is important because the export of primary unprocessed commodities does not yield much in foreign exchange. In Nigeria today, we produce about 770,000 metric tonnes of Sesame, Cashew and Cocoa. Of this number, about 12,000 metric tonnes are consumed locally and 758,000 metric tonnes are exported. The unfortunate thing though is that out of the 758,000 metric tonnes that is exported annually, only 16.8 percent is processed. The rest are exported as raw sesame, raw cashew, and raw cocoa, thereby giving Nigerian farmers an infinitesimal part of the value chain in these products. For example, the global chocolate industry is valued at about US$130 billion. Of this amount, Cote D\u2019Ivoire, Ghana and Nigeria account for more than 72 percent of global cocoa exports.\n\n\u201cYet, because we mainly export raw cocoa beans, Cote D\u2019Ivoire gets US$3.6 billion annually, Ghana generates US$1.9 billion annually and Nigeria gets about US$804 million per year from an industry that is worth over US$130 billion. In contrast to West African countries, Belgium accounted for 11 percent of global chocolate exports in 2019, at a value of US$3.16 billion. Similarly, Germany\u2019s chocolate exports were worth US$5.14 billion in the same year. These numbers are the same for other commodities as well.\n\n\u201cTherefore, given these alarming disparities between exporters of raw commodities and exporters of semi-finished or finished products, we believe that the Value-Adding Export Facility is a first step to getting back some of these foreign exchange that we rightly deserve.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we expect that this facility will also accommodate the demand of our youth population who are already adding value in using e-commerce and online methods for the provision and export of software, financial services, financial technology, Nigerian fashion and attires, and the likes. As long as these exports are captured with Form NXP and the FX proceeds are repatriated and verifiable, we will accommodate such businesses under this facility.\u201d\n\nExplaining further, he said, \u201cThe second Facility we announced is the Non-Oil Commodities Expansion Facility. This facility will also be a concessionary facility designed to significantly boost local production of exportable commodities. This facility will be designed to ensure that expanded and new factories that are financed by the Value-Adding Facility are not starved of inputs of raw commodities in their production cycle. A massive boost in the production of such commodities will also help dampen/moderate the prices of these commodities so that the expected increase in demand for them does not become a pressure point for aggregate prices in the market.\n\n\u201cIn order to maximize the potential and impact of this facility, we would replicate what other successful export-based economies have done by first prioritizing and targeting certain commodities. We would create a geographic prioritization of crops across the country to achieve production efficiencies through the development of special areas that will cater to specific commodities. Since sustainable foreign exchange earnings are dependent on national competitive advantage, a prioritization framework based on crops which Nigeria is best suited to produce will be essential.\n\n\u201cToday, we are also announcing the introduction of the Non-Oil FX Rebate Scheme, a special local currency rebate scheme for non-oil exporters of semi finished and finished produce who show verifiable evidence of exports proceeds repatriation sold directly into the I & E window to boost liquidity in the market. Analogous to the Naira4Dollar Scheme, which has helped boost remittances from only $6 million per week to over $100 million per week, we shall establish the modalities for granting a rebate for each dollar that non-oil exports proceeds that an exporter sells into the market, for the benefit of other FX users and not for funding its own operations. Although this rebate programe is with immediate effect, the detailed guideline of this scheme will be communicated next week. Our plan is to graduate the percentage of the rebate depending on the level of value addition into the product being exported.\n\n\u201cIn recognition of the perennial problems of port congestion cited by exporters as a major impediment to improved operations and foreign exchange earnings, we have designed a third anchor of the RT200 Programme, which is the construction/establishment of a Dedicated Non-Oil Export Terminal.\n\n\u201cAccording to the African Centre for Supply Chain Practitioners, Nigeria loses about US$14.2 billion annually due to congestion at our ports. Paraphrasing from an article by the Financial Times in December 2020, the congestion has become so bad that while it costs US$3,500 to ship a 40-feet container from China to Lagos, which is a distance of 22,000 kilometers, it costs US$4,000 to move the same container from the port to mainland Lagos, a distance of only 12 kilometres. During our stakeholder engagements with various segments of exporters, we heard several heartbreaking accounts of how containers spent several months in the ports just waiting to be shipped, resulting in loss of perishable goods or well-established foreign customers.\n\n\u201cIf we are to reach our goal of US$200 billion in non-oil exports, then we can neither ignore nor wish away this problem. We must confront it head-on and provide a solution. That is why we are today throwing a challenge to all State Governments that have existing ports and are willing to partner with the Bankers Committee to establish not only a dedicated export terminal but also the entire ecosystem of world-class infrastructure needed for non-oil exports. Over the next three months, the Bankers Committee will be collecting and analyzing detailed proposals from interested State Governments in order to decide which one we can partner with. The Bankers Committee will be arranging a significant part of the financing that will be needed for this port while the selected State Government will have responsibilities that will be spelt out in due course.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this dedicated port will be capable of creating over 100,000 direct and indirect jobs and would provide a huge boost to our quest for significant improvement in non-oil export earnings in Nigeria. Let me emphasize that under this arrangement, loans to companies wishing to expand or build new plants that will generate verifiable export proceeds for the economy shall remain at 5 percent per annum for 10 years loans inclusive of 2 years moratorium.\n\n\u201cIn recognition of the lessons we have learnt from our rounds of consultation with non-oil exporters, we believe that a more formal, predetermined and regular forum will be necessary to discuss the issues, challenges and opportunities in this segment of the economy. That is why today we are announcing the introduction of a Biannual Non-Oil Export Summit, the first of which would be organized during the first week of April 2022. This Summit will bring together all the relevant stakeholders in the export business including bankers, customs officials, the Nigerian Ports Authority, the Nigerian Export Promotion Council, clearing agents, cargo airlines, shipping lines, logistics companies, insurance practitioners, etc. This gathering will be one where for every complain, problem, issue, challenge or difficulty that is presented or identified, there will be one or several agencies or practitioners that can articulate options for solving that problem. I believe that the ideas harnessed from such summits would be invaluable in helping us reach our ultimate goal of US$200 billion in non-oil exports per annum.\u201d\n\nEmefiele noted that though the goals may appear unattainable to some, he has full confidence that they can be achieved, noting that many countries that are much less endowed than Nigeria are doing it.\n\n\u201cConsider for example that agriculture exports alone from the Netherlands was about US$120 billion last year. Yet, Netherlands has a land mass of about 42,000 square kilometers, which is much smaller that the land mass of Niger State alone, at over 76,000 square kilometers.\u201d\n\nThe CBN governor, however, pointed out that the RT200 Programme is not intended to be a silver bullet to all our problems in the export segment of the economy. Rather it is a first step meant to ensure that the CBN is better able to carry out its mandate in an effective and efficient manner, which guarantees preservation of our scarce commonwealth, and the stability of our national currency, the Naira.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized that It is only by boosting productive and earning capacity of the economy that we can truly preserve the long-term value of our currency, as well as the stability of our exchange rate.",
          "summary": "\u201cAfter careful consideration of the available options and wide consultation with the Banking Community, the CBN is, effective immediately, announcing the Bankers\u2019 Committee \u201cRT200 FX Programme\u201d, which stands for the \u201cRace to US$200 billion in FX Repatriation,\u201d\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe RT200 FX Programme is a set of policies, plans and programmes for non-oil exports that will enable us attain our lofty yet attainable goal of US$200 billion in FX repatriation, exclusively from non-oil exports, over the next 3-5 years.\u201dEmefiele explained that the RT200 Programme will have the five key anchors, including, Value-Adding Exports Facility, Non-Oil Commodities Expansion Facility, Non-Oil FX Rebate Scheme, Dedicated Non-Oil Export Terminal and Biannual Non-Oil Export Summit.\n\u201cThis is important because the export of primary unprocessed commodities does not yield much in foreign exchange.\n\u201cIf we are to reach our goal of US$200 billion in non-oil exports, then we can neither ignore nor wish away this problem.\nThat is why today we are announcing the introduction of a Biannual Non-Oil Export Summit, the first of which would be organized during the first week of April 2022.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), working with Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) and participating financial institutions, granted over N3 trillion in intervention loans to business in the aftermath of Covid-19 pandemic, governor of the apex bank, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, has said.\n\nThe CBN governor who made the disclosure at the Special Press Briefing of the Bankers\u2019 Committee in Abuja on Thursday, noted that the interventions have undoubtedly been one of the critical ingredients for our economic recovery and employment generation.\n\nGiving a breakdown of the intervention, Emefiele said, \u201cSpecifically, under the Anchor Borrowers Programme, we have disbursed N948 billion to 4,478,381 smallholder farmers who cultivated 5.2 million hectares of farmland across the country, thereby creating 12.5 million direct and indirect jobs.\n\n\u201cUnder our Targeted Credit Facility, which was meant to help households and businesses that suffered significant losses during the pandemic, we have disbursed N368.79 billion to 778,000 beneficiaries comprising 648,052 households, and about 130,000 SMEs. We have also disbursed N1.452 trillion to 337 Large real sector projects in agriculture, manufacturing, services, and mining under our Real Sector Support Facility. In healthcare, 122 major healthcare projects have been funded to the tune of N115.36 billion. These healthcare interventions went to 31 pharmaceutical and 91 hospital projects. This intervention helped to support acquisition of 59 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners, 42 Computer Tomography (CT) scanners, and 4 Oncology screening machines.\n\n\u201cFor the AGSMEIS programme, which caters for SMEs in the agribusiness space, a total of N134.63 billion has been released to 37,571 SME projects of which 67 percent were directly in agriculture-related projects, 22.5 percent were in services, while the balance were in fashion, IT, and related sub-sectors.\n\n\u201cUnder the Nigeria Electricity Stabilization Facility, a total of N229 billion has been disbursed to 9 DisCos to help cover their financial obligations to upstream market participants. These interventions have helped to significantly improve liquidity in their ecosystem and increase electricity generation from 4,000 MW in 2020 to over 5,000 MW as of September 2021.\n\n\u201cThe Bank has also released N47.83 billion to 10 DisCos under the National Mass Metering Programme for the procurement of 858,026 electricity meters. Because of these disbursements, the revenue collection for DisCos increased significantly to over N69 billion as of December 2021.\u201d\n\nEmefiele who painted a picture of the devastating effects of Covid-19 in the country\u2019s economy, noted that it was important to go through the numbers painstakingly to, according to him, \u201cshow that the problems we face in this country do have solutions as long as we work objectively to understand them and dispassionately to solve them.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cIt is obvious from the foregoing that the impact of these measures helped the country make the fastest recovery from recession ever recorded and changed the trajectory of inflation to an 8-month downward spiral. These policies and measures also led to a significant improvement in diaspora inflow from an average of US$6 million per week in December 2020 to an average of over US$100 million per week by January 2022.\u201d\n\nEmefiele, however, noted that the apex bank is reviewing the intervention programmes to ensure that they continue to achieve the desired results.\n\nHe said, \u201cthe lessons we have learnt from this crisis have been invaluable in helping us with serious introspection with a view to finding long-lasting and homegrown solutions to these perennial problems.\n\n\u201cAlthough interest rates on our various intervention facilities were expected to revert to 9 percent effective March 1, 2022, we are announcing that the rates would remain at 5 percent for another year in view of the promising trajectory we have established in economic growth and job creation. In effect, the concessionary interest rate of 5 percent on our intervention facilities would now be extended until March 1, 2023.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "The federal government has been advised to urgently review the law prohibiting the lazy practice of bush burning in the country in other to curb both the economic loss and environmental damage caused by the obnoxious practice.\n\nThe Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, who made the call at the pull-out parade of the immediate past Controller-general of Federal Fire Service (FFS), Dr Liman Ibrahim Alhaji, in Abuja on Thursday, said the review should include the mechanism for its enforcement.\n\nAregbesola emphasised that if reviewed, the law should be included in the mandate of forest rangers, stressing the need to put an end to bush burning nationwide as its effects are huge and incalculable.\n\nThe minister, who expressed worry at what he described as unacceptable spate of fire outbreaks recorded in the country, said the biggest challenge of firefighting at this moment was being able to mount an aerial campaign, either for bush fire or industrial fire such as recently witnessed at a popular departmental store in Abuja.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAregbesola emphatically challenged state governments to invest more in firefighting, adding that the FFS was only complementing state government\u2019s efforts.\n\nThe minister added that, \u201cThe FFS should and is only complementing state efforts, not to take over their responsibility. States should have effective presence in all local governments and have a response time of not more than five minutes for any distress call.\n\nHe said, \u201cFor this, the service should accelerate the rapprochement with the Nigerian Airforce on the use of airplane for spreading water to kill fire from the air. I am repeating the call for state governments to invest more in firefighting. It is a critical social service that must not be neglected.\u201d\n\nHe congratulated the outgone CG, Dr Ibrahim for successfully completing his tenure and etching his name in gold in firefighting and service to nation and mankind.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he should just quietly slip into the anonymity of retirement. He should find some ways for his experience, industry and energy to be deployed for service, in a new life,\u201d he added.\n\nEarlier, the acting Controller-general of FFS, Karebo Samson Pere, described Dr Liman Ibrahim as a grassroot fireman, a General not only in administration but also in operations.\n\nPere disclosed that in his effort to ensure a safe haven across the country in fire and other emergency situations, the FFS has launched an awareness and training campaign for children and women including plans to take it to schools, selected markets and other public places.",

Bode Towoju; Special Adviser to the Governor of Political Matters, Lateef Alakawa; Special Adviser to the Governor of Political Communication, Bashir Adigun; and Group Managing Director of Harmony Holdings, Abdullahi AbdulMajeed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe government said out of the 13 autonomous farms set up with public funds, nine had been sold out with no kobo paid to the public coffers, even when the government is supposed to hold a paltry 10% equity in each of the farms.\n\nThe government explained that the reason AMCON took over the Kwara properties in Abuja is to recover the bad loans that the Farm owes a consortium of banks that invested in it dating back to 2007 because the Shonga Farm Holdings could not pay back on the agreed timeline.\n\nIt said AMCON had to hold the state responsible because it is listed among the shareholders of Shonga Farms Holdings Ltd, even though its share is not anywhere commensurate with its huge investments in the project.\n\nAsked why the government has not taken legal action against the perpetrators of the alleged fraud, Jawondo said crimes perpetrated through fronts and companies take years to unravel and that government will take action once it gathers every document necessary to do so, including files and transactions tucked away by previous officials.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cFor instance, the sale of nine farms \u2013 in which the government ought to have 10% equity shares \u2013 was done secretly without any document left for the government to trace how the transaction was done, at what amount they were sold, the billions of naira proceeds of the sale, and who the buyers were, while no board resolution existed to show that shareholders consented to the divestment process in line with the law.\n\n\u201cWhen such mind boggling frauds are committed using companies and fronts, it may take many years to unravel the web of conspiracy. It is not enough to prosecute for the sake of mere prosecution. But rest assured that we will prosecute everyone involved when we get all the evidences,\u201d Jawondo said.",

Under the able leadership of the Deputy Governor and your commissioner, they have done well. You chose to find a way for us to be able to buy these vehicles. I advised that you save up for some time and we arranged for these vehicles to come and you completed payment on instalment. I am glad that you only have one instalment to complete now.\n\n\u201cThese vehicles are not for any individual. We have not bought a vehicle for any individual. We have bought these vehicles for each local government. And for the chairman to use. Use these vehicles very well. You are chairman today, but you may not be tomorrow. Use it very well.

The money you have now, use it to clear the road verges. These vehicles are for you to work and they can go on any terrain,\u201d he noted.\n\nEarlier, the Deputy Governor, Hon.

And those are the issues that we have been talking about: that you cannot have the whole chunk of money generated from our land here and taken to the federal and shared to the states, and in the end you now say Bayelsa State is insolvent.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why we are talking about restructuring, that\u2019s why we are talking about the amendment of our country\u2019s constitution. A constitution that says land surface rights belongs to the people, and what is under that land belongs to Federal Government. There is no justice in it. And anybody who bandies these figures, you are annoying the people of Bayelsa State, and indeed the people of the Niger-Delta.\n\n\u201cSo, for us, we need to rework our constitution; we need to restructure our country, in a way that we can approximate our own resources here and pay tax to the Federal Government. And nobody will be talking about Bayelsa State being insolvent or any other state in the Niger Delta for that matter.\n\n\u201cIf Bayelsa state is insolvent, then it means Nigeria is insolvent. From where you get all your resources, and the resources are not ploughed back here. And you say the state is insolvent?\u201d\n\nCocoa money?\n\nMr Diri also explained that oil wasn\u2019t developed in Nigeria by money made from cocoa farming.\n\n\u201cA lot of people make a mistake and say we used cocoa money to developed oil, that\u2019s not true.\n\n\u201cMultinational, international oil companies came with the capital in oil exploration and exploitation,\u201d Mr Diri said.\n\n\u201cThere was no money from Nigeria, every money that came was monies from those who came to develop oil here. These are the issues Nigeria needs to resolve.\u201d\n\nFocus on farming\n\nThe Governor noted that despite Bayelsa\u2019s oil wealth, his administration is working to re-orientate youths to go into farming.\n\nAccording to him, farming is a priority and everyone in the state is encouraged to key into it.\n\n\u201cAgriculture is a priority for this government, we are working hard to have a change of mindset of our youths to key into Agriculture.\n\n\u201cTomorrow, the Akwa-Ibom Governor is coming into Bayelsa to flag off the farming season. He will also superintend over the made-in-Bayelsa Agriculture show.\n\n\u201cOil is almost going; we cannot continue to live (dependent) on oil. The focus of this government is agriculture.

Beijing disputes the charge, arguing that its loans are designed to alleviate poverty.\n\nFor his part, Senegalese President Macky Sall told reporters on Thursday that he expected the EU-AU summit to produce a \u201crenewed, modernised and more action-oriented partnership.\u201d\n\n\u201cEurope and Africa have an interest in working together\u201d, he said, referencing the geographical proximity of the two continents and common security concerns, among other things.\n\nSall added that he was committed fighting global warming, but stressed the need to finance natural-gas projects in order to boost industry and provide greater access to electricity.\n\nHe has opposed plans announced by a small group of countries at last year\u2019s COP26 climate summit, including the US and France, to end financing for overseas unabated fossil fuels \u2014 those without associated carbon capture technology \u2014 by the end of 2022.\n\nThe final declaration at COP26 also said countries would \u201caccelerate efforts towards phase-out of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.\u201d\n\nSenegal, a poor nation of 17 million people, has high hopes for gas fields off its Atlantic coast.\n\nThe government has said it plans to start production by late next year or in 2024.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "RelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Secretariat and the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), on Wednesday in Cairo, signed an agreement on the management of the AfCFTA Adjustment Fund (ADF) that would require $10 billion over the next five to 10 years.\n\nThe base fund is a facility that would support African countries to cope with the loss of revenues from import tariffs and the private sector to effectively participate in the new trading environment established under the AfCFTA.\n\nAlready, Afreximbank has committed $1 billion towards the ADF, which is made up of a base fund, a general fund and a credit fund.\n\nThe AfCFTA Secretariat and the Afreximbank stated that base fund would consist of contributions from state parties (which is AfCFTA member countries), grants and technical assistance funds to address tariff revenue losses as tariffs are progressively eliminated.\n\nThe base fund, according to the two continental institutions, would also support countries to implement various provisions of the AfCFTA agreement, its protocols and annexes while the general fund would mobilise concessional funding.\n\nThey added that the credit fund, \u201cwill mobilise commercial funding to support both the public and private sectors, enabling them to adjust and take advantage of the opportunities created by the AfCFTA.\u201d\n\nThe agreement was signed yesterday by President/Chairman of the Afreximbank, Prof. Benedict Oramah, and the Secretary General of the AfCFTA Secretariat, Wamkele Mene, in the presence of Minister Plenipotentiary (Trade) of the Arab Republic of Egypt, Mr. Aly Basha, as well as some leading African bankers and captains of industry.\n\nThe two continental institutions said the general fund and credit fund would be launched very soon to address the needs of the private sector including the small and medium enterprises, women and youth.\n\nThe signing of the agreement was in furtherance of the mandate given to the AfCFTA\u2019s Secretariat and the Afreximbank by the African Union Summit of Heads of State and Government and the AfCFTA Council of Ministers responsible for Trade to establish the ADF, \u201cto support AfCFTA state parties to adjust to the new liberalised and integrated trading environment established under the AfCFTA Agreement.\u201d\n\nMene stressed the importance of the Adjustment Fund as one of the instruments designed to support the implementation of the AfCFTA agreement and assist AfCFTA member countries to deal with short term tariff revenue losses as they dismantle tariffs and implement the Agreement.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs we make significant progress in establishing schedules of tariff concessions, the finalisation of the adjustment Ffund will enable us to maintain and even accelerate the momentum. We now have an excellent tool to provide support to our state parties (member countries) and their private sector through financing, technical assistance, grants and compensation funding.\n\n\u201cIt will help them mitigate revenue losses and competitive pressures that may result from reduction in tariffs and liberalisation of markets in order to tap into the opportunities of the AfCFTA. This is another important step towards the successful implementation of the continental free trade agreement.\u201d\n\nOramah, in his remarks said that the funds would be used to support both the public and private sectors to address short term disruptions, while enabling the private sector to retool, reskill, and develop capabilities to produce value added goods and services that could be traded competitively within the continent and catalyse the emergence of AfCFTA-led regional value chains.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis Adjustment Fund, which is taking shape, comes on top of the Pan African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS), which was commercially launched on 13 January 2022 in Accra, and the resoundingly successuful second edition of the Intra-African Trade Fair, which held in November 2021 in Durban.\n\n\u201cThese are some of the initiatives that we are proud to implement in close collaboration with the AfCFTA Secretariat, setting the conditions that will undoubtedly lead to a smooth implementation of the AfCFTA.\n\n\u201cToday we have launched the base fund of the ADF to address urgent needs of State Parties relating to tariff revenue losses and the transposition costs to enable them to implement the AfCFTA agreement. We will be launching the general fund and credit fund very soon to address the needs of the private sector including the small and medium enterprises, women and youth.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working with all development partners, development financial institutions, commercial banks, export credit agencies and other investors and strategic partners to mobilise resources for the Adjustment Fund to enable the continent to implement the AfCFTA.\u201d\n\nDike Onwuamaeze",

          "title": "P&ID: Court Revives Nigeria\u2019s Bid in $10bn Award Feud",
          "text": "RelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe Second Circuit, a United States Court of Appeal has revived Nigeria\u2019s bid for discovery aimed at propping up bribery allegations relating to a nearly $10 billion arbitral award, ruling that a lower court wrongly found that the country seemed to be trying to avoid US Department of Justice scrutiny in the Process and Industrial Developments Limited (P&ID) case.\n\nThe appeals court vacated US District Judge, Paul A. Engelmayer\u2019s late 2020 decision denying Nigeria\u2019s petition to subpoena VR Advisory Services Limited for information the country hopes would bolster criminal proceedings in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to New York-based Law360.com, the panel then remanded the case, saying Judge Engelmayer had improperly analysed whether the country should have gone through its mutual legal assistance treaty with the US before turning to a US foreign discovery statute.\n\nVR Advisory is a Manhattan asset manager that acquired a 25 per cent stake in P&ID in 2018.\n\nNigeria had accused P & ID of paying bribes to secure a lucrative government contract that led to the arbitral award, said to be worth more than $10 billion with interest.\n\nJudge Engelmayer had concluded in his decision that Nigeria\u2019s petition appeared to be an attempt to avoid US DOJ scrutiny of its request. He wrote that Nigeria hadn\u2019t given a good reason why it had opted to use Section 1782 of the US Code, which authorises courts to order discovery for certain foreign proceedings, rather than a mutual legal assistance treaty for criminal matters, under which the DOJ would decide whether to approve the request.\n\nBut the Second Circuit agreed with Nigeria that the judge had, through his opinion, \u201ceffectively erected an impermissible \u2018extra-statutory barrier\u2019 to discovery,\u201d according to the decision.\n\nThe mutual legal assistance treaty in question expands access for Nigeria and the US to criminal evidence within their borders, and it specifically states that the assistance it provides, \u201cshall not prevent or restrict\u201d either of the two countries from granting assistance under other agreements or laws, the panel wrote.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, parts of the United States-Nigeria MLAT do impose limits on the assistance that the Department of Justice or Nigerian attorney general will provide in response to an MLAT request,\u201d according to the decision, which provides as an example a section of the treaty authorizing the relevant authorities to deny certain requests, such as those relating to political offenses.\n\n\u201cBut reading those limiting provisions together with Article [19]\u2019s rule of construction, it is clear that they are intended only as internal limits applicable to MLAT requests, not as restrictions on proof-gathering means external to the treaty,\u201d the panel added.\n\nThe judges later noted that it is, \u201chardly surprising\u201d that there would be greater limits on information available under the treaty since it obligates the DOJ to assist the Nigerian authorities in their search for information.\n\nThe appeals court said neither the US Supreme Court nor any federal appellate court had previously\n\nconsidered whether a foreign sovereign that has a mutual legal assistance treaty with the U.S. circumvents that treaty by filing a Section 1782 application in the district court.\n\nMoving on to Judge Engelmayer\u2019s conclusion that it would be \u201cimproper\u201d for Nigeria to use the materials being sought in a related proceeding in England focusing on the corruption allegations, the panel agreed with Nigeria that this was an error since the English proceedings clearly qualify as a \u201cproceeding in a foreign or international tribunal\u201d within the meaning of Section 1782.\n\nCounsel for VR Advisory declined to comment. Counsel for Nigeria did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn its petition, Nigeria said it was seeking information that would aid its prosecution of former government officials who allegedly accepted the bribes from P & ID in exchange for the contract for a lucrative gas supply and processing agreement, which later led to the massive arbitral award.\n\nThe dispute between the parties has lasted for nearly a decade, arising out of a contract P & ID signed with Nigeria\u2019s Ministry of Petroleum Resources in 2010. Under the pact, Nigeria had agreed to supply the company with natural gas for a gas processing facility that was to be built on Nigerian coastland with the goal of resolving the country\u2019s growing electricity crisis.\n\nBut the project never materialised, falling apart after the government failed to uphold its end of the bargain.\n\nProcess and Industrial Developments took the dispute to arbitration in 2012, and the tribunal concluded that Nigeria was liable for breaching the agreement. It awarded the company $6.6 billion in early 2017, an amount that had ballooned to more than $10 billion with interest as of early 2021.\n\nIn recent years, however, Nigeria has been pushing courts in the United Kingdom to set aside the award on the basis of recently uncovered evidence of alleged fraud. The country argues the facility would not have been built anyway, since P&ID lacked the infrastructure or ability to perform under the deal, and that the contract had been obtained through bribery.\n\nIt has also accused the company of building its case before the arbitral tribunal on fabricated evidence and perjured testimony from its co-founder Michael Quinn, \u201ca notorious music promoter and weapons dealer,\u201d according to Nigeria.\n\nA UK court is expected to hold a trial on these allegations in early 2023.\n\nP&ID, for its part, has strenuously objected to any allegations of wrongdoing, calling criminal investigations and prosecutions in Nigeria \u201cpart of an illegitimate and abusive campaign designed to evade a politically damaging commercial debt.\u201d\n\nSenior Circuit Judge Gerard E. Lynch and Circuit Judges Susan L. Carney and Richard J. Sullivan sat on the panel for the Second Circuit.\n\nVR Advisory was represented by Michael S. Kim, Zachary Rosenbaum, Josef M. Klazen and Darryl Stein of Kobre & Kim. On the other hand, Nigeria was represented by Alexander D. Pencu, Christopher J. Major and Austin D. Kim of Meister Seelig & Fein LLP.",

          "title": "Africa\u2019s GDP Declined by $165bn in 2020, Lowest in 20 Years, Says AfDB Chief Adesina \u2013 Arise News",
          "text": "President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina, has painted a gloomy picture of Africa, saying dwindling economic fortunes in 2020 resulted in $165 billion decline in the continent\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Adesina said in the same year, over 30 million jobs were lost while 26 million persons fell into extreme poverty.\n\nThe former Minister of Agriculture made the assertions in a paper titled, \u201cMobilising Financing for Africa\u2019s Accelerated Economic Recovery, Development and Integration,\u201d which he delivered to African leaders at the 35th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the African Union in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, recently.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt has been a global economic cyclone. Africa witnessed a decline in GDP growth of 2.1 per cent in 2020, its lowest in 20 years. Africa\u2019s GDP fell by $165 billion. Over 30 million jobs were lost and over 26 million people fell into extreme poverty.\u201d\n\nThe AfDB boss, however, praised African leaders for their effort to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI wish to commend the leadership efforts of the African Union, and our Heads of State and Government, for the critical roles you have played in dealing with the pandemic and the socio-economic challenges in its wake. Today, thanks to these efforts, 11 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated, and another 16 per cent has been partially vaccinated.\n\n\u201cHowever, while developed countries have moved to booster shots, Africa is still struggling with basic shots.\u201d\n\nAdesina warned against outsourcing Africa\u2019s security to foreigners, as he stressed the need for Africa to protect African lives by investing in healthcare infrastructure and vaccine manufacturing.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe must learn from this experience. Africa can no longer outsource the security of the lives of its 1.4 billion people to the benevolence of others. We must secure African lives!\n\n\u201cIt is time to build Africa\u2019s healthcare defense system. This must be based on three strategic priorities. First, building Africa\u2019s quality healthcare infrastructure. Second, building Africa\u2019s pharmaceutical industry, and third, building Africa\u2019s vaccine manufacturing capacity.\n\n\u201cAfrica needs $600 million to $1.3 billion to meet its goal of attaining 60 per cent vaccine production by 2040. Investing in health is investing in national security. The African Development Bank plans to invest $3 billion to support pharmaceutical and vaccines manufacturing capacity for Africa.\n\n\u201cTo address the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic and support economic recovery, Africa will need some $484 billion over the next three years. To eliminate extreme poverty by 2030, the continent will need $414 \u2013 $784 billion per year. Africa will need $7-$15 billion a year to deal with climate change. The continent will also need between $68 \u2013 $108 billion per year to fix the infrastructure financing gap.\u201d\n\nAdesina said Africa must drastically increase its resource base, adding that with the help of the continent\u2019s leaders, AfDB\u2019s general capital increased in 2019 by 125 per cent, rising from $93 billion to $208 billion, the highest since its establishment in 1964.\n\nHe said these resources had enabled the bank to scale up support to African economies to tackle the pandemic.\n\nAdesina said, \u201cThe Board of Directors of the Bank approved a Crisis Response Facility of up to $10 Billion. The Bank also launched a $3 Billion Fight COVID-19 Social Bond on the international capital markets, which was the largest ever US-dollar denominated social bond in world history. The Bank provided $ 27 million as grants to the African Centres for Disease Control.\n\n\u201cOver the past six years, the African Development Bank has provided about $39 billion in financing to the continent in support of its High5 priorities to: light up and power Africa; feed Africa; integrate Africa; industrialise Africa; and improve the quality of life of the people of Africa. These High5s are the accelerators for achieving Agenda 2063.\u201d\n\nAdesina assured that with $25 billion in equity, the African Development Fund could leverage up to $33 billion of additional financing for low-income countries.\n\nAccording to him, the bank requires the support of the leaders to change the article in the charter of the African Development Fund that bars it from going to the market to leverage resources, and this is top priority.\n\nHe said the bank was also leveraging private investments into Africa, in innovative ways, stressing, \u201cThe Africa Investment Forum, established by the African Development Bank and its partners, has helped to secure investment interests worth more than $78 billion.\n\n\u201cThis spectacular level of interest includes a $24 billion transaction for the liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique. We are proud that that this project will make Mozambique the third-largest producer of liquefied natural gas in the world.\u201d\n\nAdesina urged African leaders to link security, investment, growth, and development closely together.\n\nHe added, \u201cTo enhance the security of Africa, the African Development Bank is currently developing Security Indexed Investment Bonds. Proceeds from these bonds, when developed, will support countries and regional economic communities to do four things.\n\n\u201cFirst, to upgrade security architecture. Second, to repair damaged infrastructure in conflict-affected zones. Third, to rebuild social infrastructure. And fourth, to protect zones with strategic investments.\n\n\u201cWe must build a better future for our youth. It is time to create youth-based wealth all across Africa. To boost financial support for the businesses of our youth, the African Development Bank Group is exploring with countries the establishment of Youth Entrepreneurship Investment Banks. They will be first rate financial institutions run by the youth for the youth.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja",
