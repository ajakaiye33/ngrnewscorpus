          "text": ".\n\nBy: Kingsley Omonobi \u2013 Abuja.\n\nThe Police Service Commission has said it will conduct it\u2019s own separate investigation into the allegation of bribe leveled against Deputy Commissioner of Police Abba Kyari by convicted fraudster Abbas Ramon, aka Hushpuppi\n\nRecall that on Thursday 29th July 2021, the Inspector General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba ordered a review of the case of bribery brought against Kyari in a $1.1million scam, at a US court and the efforts of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to have Kyari arrested\n\nA source said the PSC\u2019s decision to do a separate probe became necessary following suspicion that some persons within the Police force were not favourably disposed to DCP Kyari\u2019s high profile status as a result of the many fears he has achieve in crime busting investigations and arrests.\n\nA statement on the IGP\u2019s directive titled, \u2018Alleged Indictment of DCP Abba Kyari: Inspector General of Police Orders A Review of the Information\u2019, was signed by CP Frank Mba, Force Public Relations Officer.\n\nIt read, \u201cSequel to the receipt of allegation and indictment processes from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) against one of the personnel of the Nigeria Police Force, DCP Abba Kyari, the Inspector General of Police IGP Usman Alkali Baba has ordered an internal review of the allegations.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Police Force reaffirms its commitment to the pursuit of justice and the strengthening of its professional relationship with the FBI and other international partners.\n\n\u201cFurther developments on this case will be communicated to members of the public accordingly\u201d.\n\nA source said this became necessary following suspicion that some persons within the Police force were not favourably disposed to DCP Kyari\u2019s high profile status as a result of the many fears he has achieve in crime busting investigations and arrests.\n\nAccording to the source the PSC would carry out independent investigations irrespective of findings of the Police authorities on the bribe allegation against Kyari.\n\n\u201cEven though the IGP as the operational authority has the right to investigate any allegations against any of his officer, the final decision on punishment or discipline rests with the Police Service Commission.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, the commission which has its own mechanisms for investigation, would conduct it\u2019s own probe concerning the alleged indictment before any final decision can be taken on the future of the officer.\n\n\u201cYes it is true that we will wait for the full report of the investigation and it will be treated officially by the commission in accordance with the law. The law has specific punishment for such offences if proven and they include dismissal, demotion, reduction in rank and suspension, as the case may be.\n\nUsually, cases of alleged misdemeanor against Police officers or personnel are investigated by the Force Disciplinary Committee headed by the Deputy Inspector General of Police in charge of Administration who is the most senior DIG at Force headquarters.\n\nHowever, after sitting and coming out with the findings of their investigation, the findings are sent to the PSC, whose own investigations department sits and vets, for final decision.\n\nOn many occasions, indicting conclusions reached by the Force Disciplinary Committee on Police officers conduct that recommended dismissal, demotion or suspension, have been over ruled by the Police Service Commission\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Nobody demanded any money from Abbas Hushpuppi and nobody collected any money from him.\u201d\n\nHowever, Kyari admitted to knowing about the money-related dispute between Hushpuppi and his colleague (Vincent), claiming it was on the basis of the call that latter was arrested but later released when they (police) discovered there was no life threat from the suspect.\n\nA careful look at Kyari\u2019s line of thoughts show that he actually had conversation with Hushpuppi and it bothers on money aside the fact he claimed the money was transferred to a third party, but the question is, what has Belial got to do with Christ?\n\nThe Biblical rhetoric above should form a basis for one to properly dissect the dichotomy between the duo. Could it be that Mr. Kyari is just a middleman between the embattled Nigerian socialite (Hushpuppi) and his accomplice? Why would a celebrated police chief highly respected by Nigerians go stoop so low to start up an informal conversation with a suspected fraudster in the first instance though he (Kyari) claimed it\u2019s before his arrest? There\u2019s more to this whole saga than meets the eye.\n\nKyari, in spite of this allegation, must either prove his innocence or otherwise face the consequences for his sins should in case he is declared guilty.\n\nAbba Kyari\u2019s case is one too many. Hope the power that be won\u2019t upturn justice to favour their own just as in the case with Papa P, but truth will always prevail in the long run. As it stands right now, Kyari is just a suspect until found guilty by a competent court.

This decision came like a thunderbolt to a lot of investors, market watchers and pundits. Many Nigerians did not see it coming.\n\n\n\nREAD ALSO:Reps, Customs disagree over alleged killing of 5 in Oyo\n\nWhat the apex bank just did is tantamount to taking the recalcitrant bull by the horn in its noble quest to save the naira from downward spiral of depreciation and preserving depleting foreign reserve, amidst dwindling forex inflows from crude oil sales and increasingly rising debt burden. Nigeria\u2019s economy is hemorrhaging; this is not time to pander to public sentiments and emotions. Most of the times, tough economic decisions do not resonate with populist yearnings.\n\nGodwin Emefiele, like a proverbial leader of a group of surgeons in the intensive care unit, trying hard to save an endangered patient, got to that crescendo and needed to act pragmatically before it was too late. The CBN has managed BDCs like cancerous tumors for decades now, with little or no positive impact on the economy, especially naira. The cancerous cells kept expanding; eating deep into the fabrics of the economy, while the CBN struggled to manage it, at the same time ensured that the economy did not bleed profusely to death.\n\nArriving at a crossroad, the CBN had to wield the big stick\u2014the cancerous tumor had to be surgically exorcised to save the rest of the body because a chain is as strong as its weakest link. The monetary policy watchdog is not oblivious of the temporary pains and fluctuations that this timely decision has heralded in the system\u2014as seen in further depreciation of naira in response to the decision. Every regulatory body that worth its name will always prioritize long term benefits over immediate disruptions.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, under the leadership of Godwin Emefiele has once again lived up to its core mandate of ensuring monetary stability and restoring investors\u2019 confidence in the system. By stopping weekly supply of forex to the BDCs and transferring same to commercial banks, the apex bank has strategically positioned the Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) to lead the new phase of forex regime in the country.\n\nIt has become extremely difficult to regulate the activities of BDCs operators in the last few years. Most of them have become notorious conduit pipes for illicit financial transactions. Money laundering, round tripping, rent-seeking, funding of terrorism and hoarding of forex, are usually associated with some of the BDCs operators because of how difficult it is to painstakingly regulate their daily transactions.\n\nWhen majority of the BDCs hoard forex and round-trips for the selfish purposes of exploiting Nigerians by creating artificial scarcity, the essence of funding the BDCs by the apex bank, has been defeated\u2014it becomes drainpipe used by economic saboteurs to stifle the economy. Some of the \u201cblack market\u201d sellers of forex go beyond their stipulated daily benchmark and to \u2018dollarise\u2019 the system, thereby putting naira under intense pressure.\n\nGeometrical rise in the number of BDCs in the country and increasing amount of prospective operators applying for licenses, should had sounded a note of warning to a vigilant regulator like the CBN. In 2000, Nigeria had only 74 licensed BDCs. Within a decade interval, the number has risen to 2000 BDCs\u2014by year 2000. In another ten-year gap, it got to alarming number of over 5000 BDCs. It is ironical that why Nigeria\u2019s foreign reserve kept dwindling, the number of BDCs putting pressure on it, kept going upward.\n\nThe CBN sells estimated $5.7billion dollars annually to over 5000 BDCs. This figure is not only outrageous but highly unsustainable. Imagine selling most of the forex to BDCs on official rate while manufacturers\u2014the people that really need the forex struggles to access forex needed to import raw materials. It is like starving one\u2019s asset portfolio and funding his liability portfolio; bankruptcy is in the offing. And yet we wonder why naira is depreciating and unemployment rate is skyrocketing. It is not only self-harming but self-defeatist.\n\nIn a World Trade Organization, WTO, report released few months ago tagged: \u201cLeading Exporters and Importers of Commercial services excluding intra-EU Trade 2020\u201d, Nigeria was ranked number one importer in Africa and 25th largest importer in the world. The pathetic aspect of the report is that, when it came to ranking of largest exporters of commercial activities, Nigeria got missing.\n\nEven Egypt and Morocco that trailed Nigeria in the list of importers\u2014second and third, respectively, made it to top 30 largest exporters of commercial services. This reaffirmed the ugly fact that Nigeria is a consumption economy. Outside crude oil we sell in its raw state, we produce literally nothing\u2014yet consume mostly. Why won\u2019t the foreign reserve nosedive while naira depreciates helplessly? It is obvious.\n\nThe external reserves moved from $35.64 billion dollars in January, 2021, to $33.32 billion dollars as at last week of July, 2021. It implied that the reserve was depleted by a whopping amount of $2.3 billion dollars. What else should we expect when some people become billionaires not by building shoe factories, textile factories, cement plants, oil refineries, rice farming, but just selling of raw hard currencies! Robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n\nWith few round-trips, millions of dollars will be created. This description fits into Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s social sin of wealth without work. It is not only economically wrong but morally reprehensible. This action by the CBN will ensure that only legitimate forex demands are met. School fees, Personal Travel Allowance (PTA), Basic Travel Allowance (BTA), forex for genuine importations, etcetera, should not be difficult for commercial banks to meet with the vigor the CBN is going about the new order.\n\nThe CBN just killed many birds with one stone. With BDCs out of the picture, especially as regards weekly supply from the apex bank, regulation will be more impactful and limited foreign reserves \u2018heave a sign of relief\u2019. Money laundering and other related financial crimes will be curtailed. The job of anti-graft agencies like EFCC will be made a lot easier. Some of the shenanigans cum shady deals that happen with BDCs will be extremely difficult with commercial banks.\n\nFunding of terrorism that is connected with black market forex transactions, will be limited to barest minimum. A nation like Nigeria battling hydra-headed monsters of terrorism, internet scams and corruption should be very strict with its foreign exchange market. It should not be an open market where every unknown individual can go and change any amount without necessary checks and balances. I think Godwin Emefiele and his lieutenants at the apex bank should be commended and supported for this real courage.\n\n\u2022Chidiebere Nwobodo wrote in from Abuja via [email protected].",

          "text": "By Alao Abiodun\n\nOver the years, Nigeria\u2019s sprint queen, Blessing Okagbare-Ighoteguonor has distinguished herself as a worthy sportswoman who has brought not only accolades but also honour to Nigeria.\n\nBut sadly, she been \u201cprovisionally\u201d suspended for doping at the ongoing Tokyo Olympics.\n\nWith the suspension, Okagbare will no longer be able to compete at the competition.\n\nThe Athletics Integrity Unit made this known in a press statement on Saturday, saying that the 32-year-old Nigerian athlete tested positive for a banned substance \u2013 human growth hormone.\n\nThe body said Okagbare tested positive for the prohibited substance in an out-of-competition test on July 19 \u2013 four days before the Olympics opened.\n\nHere are few things to know about her:\n\n1. Blessing Okagbare was born on October 9, 1988 in Delta State.\n\n2. She played football as a teenager at her high school and later, in 2004, she took interest in track and field games.\n\n3. On the senior national stage, she was a triple jump bronze medallist at the 2004 Nigerian National Sports Festival.\n\n4. Her first international outing came at the 2006 World Junior Championships in Athletics, where she performed in the qualifying rounds of both the long and triple jump competitions.\n\n5. In May 2007, at the All-Africa Games trials in Lagos, she established a Nigerian record of 14.13 metres in the triple jump.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n6. As a 19-year-old, she won a bronze medal in the women\u2019s long jump event at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\n\n7. She scored a 100 m/long jump double at the NCAA Women\u2019s Outdoor Track and Field Championship for University of Texas at El Paso, completing an undefeated collegiate streak that year.\n\n8. She concluded her 2011 season by winning three medals at the All Africa Games in Maputo, Mozambique. She was part of the Nigerian quartet that won gold in the 4 \u00d7 100 m with a time of 43.34.\n\n9. She made it through to the finals of the 100m and won with a time of 10.85, breaking the games record of 10.91 seconds set by Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie 12 years earlier at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester.\n\n10. On July 27, 2013, at the London Anniversary Games, Okagbare set a new African record of 10.86 s in her 100 m race.\n\n11. The superstar athlete married her heartthrob, Nigerian footballer, Igho Otegheri in September 2014",

          "title": "At 80, I still do exercises, cook, clean the house every day \u2013Taiwo Ajai-Lycett, legendary actress",
          "text": "By Christy Anyanwu\n\nTaiwo Ajai-Lycett is a renowned international actor with over 50 years experience. Born in Lagos on February 3 1941, she made her debut in 1967 at the UK\u2019s avant-garde Royal Court Theatre, Sloane Square, London. She subsequently trained at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama, City Literary Institute, The Dance Centre, and the Actors\u2019 Studio, London. She is a member of the British Actors Equity Union, an experienced communications consultant, an educationist, broadcaster, author, social commentator, columnist and the recipient of several professional and national honours, including an Officer of the Order of the Niger (OON) in 2006; a Fellow of the Society of Nigerian Theatre Artists (SONTA); and a Fellow of the University of the Third Age (FUTA). Full of life and energy, the octogenarian spoke with Saturday Sun about her life and times.\n\nAt 80, what has changed in you?\n\nNothing. I still do my walk. I do my exercises and I clean up my house.\n\nDoes your gene play a role in the way you look?\n\nEvidently, it is the genes. A lot of it is the genes.\n\nYour compound is spacious. Is that why you prefer sitting in the open space?\n\nI like fresh air. I will rather have fresh air than the AC. You noticed that people who are dying mostly of COVID-19 are people who are moving from their AC bedroom to their AC sitting room, AC car to their AC office and back to the AC car. They never see the sun and they think its privilege and wealth and position. But it is death because you are rejecting all the goodness that nature is giving you.\n\nDo you still cook?\n\nYes. I cook. I have always looked after myself. It\u2019s not a question of I cannot afford to get a domestic staff; it\u2019s a question of commonsense because what you don\u2019t use. you lose. I cook, I clean my house. Am I not the one who came to open the gate for you? All that is no mean fit; it is looking after yourself.\n\nLooking at you from afar, you look hard and unfriendly. What would you say to that?\n\nThis is the reason why you should be very careful about what people think of you. What do you think of yourself; who are you? So that you can surprise people when they then move close. You cannot be responsible for what other people think. You can\u2019t know what I\u2019m thinking; I can\u2019t know what you are thinking. So, I can\u2019t take responsibility for your thoughts. They say don\u2019t judge the book by its cover. Never, judge the book by its cover. You might get it wrong. A lot of people get it wrong about me. They don\u2019t know the first thing about me. That is okay.\n\nWhat does it feels like to be 80?\n\nJust another day. Just another period. As you can see, you slow down a bit. You can\u2019t run as fast as you used to. Look at all the things I have gained in 40 years: knowledge, wisdom, patience, perseverance, wisdom, experience. I did not have all these attributes when I was 40. I am not going to exchange that for being able to run around or for being able to have bum bum that is waving about. No. The older you get, you have an idea of the things that really matter in your life. Yes, physically, maybe you are a bit tired, quicker than when you were younger, but I still do the things I was doing when I was 40. I still do my exercises every day. I\u2019m a much disciplined person and that discipline is the secret of everything that people are saying. I do my exercises every day, I don\u2019t need a gym. I don\u2019t need to be pulling weight. There are exercises that I would do \u2013 exercises of the mind, exercises of having sharp memory and alertness. It is the mind that looks after the body. I do all those exercises and I try to help tone the muscles because if you are frail, if your skeletal system is not strong, you can\u2019t move on it. You have to continue to strengthen your muscles. Yes, you don\u2019t have as much tone as you had at 30 or 40 or 50. As long as you are fit, you are eating well, you are sleeping well, you are thinking well, then you know what you have to do. I do my exercises every day. Not because I\u2019m joining the Olympics but for fitness because if your heart is not working properly, if your circulation isn\u2019t going very well, it is a living dead. What is the point of complaining of wrist and knee pains all the time and yet there are antidotes to all that?\n\nSo you don\u2019t feel all that pain?\n\nIf I feel them, I know what to do. Age means that some things will not be working properly but exercises are there for us to cause the circulation to keep going and get blood into where it is aching. I have arthritis like any other old person, but would you know that I have arthritis? These are caused by wear and tear of life, ligaments worn out. You stood on your knees and your feet for so long, and eventually things wear out. But there are ways in which you can keep them going so that they don\u2019t inconvenience you. That is why I bless God for pushing me into my profession, where it pushed me abroad, where you have training. I knew that the training was a lifelong gift, which is what I\u2019m still enjoying. I still train my voice every day; I still train my body every day. I\u2019m an Olympic athlete of the arts. If you don\u2019t do that, it goes into pieces. Nature hates a vacuum. I don\u2019t sit back on my oars. I don\u2019t say that I\u2019m 80; I shouldn\u2019t do exercises. I do it consistently and will continue throughout my life because the other person who is not doing it would have a tightening up joints and flabby muscles.\n\nTalking about your career, what are some of the memorable moments?\n\nI had so many. When I first started and appeared at the Dublin International Film Festival. I was playing the part of Pauline Mulumba, the wife of Patrice Mulumba of the Republic of Congo. In the play, they came to tell me my husband died. I was a young actress and I did a dirge in Yoruba for my husband. I was the talk of town. People didn\u2019t understand what I was saying but that part of the world they know what wake keeping is; it\u2019s a tradition that they understand. So, when I did that, I think I catapulted myself into the limelight. That was very significant. On the last night, there was a party, the playwright who was the Asst. Secretary General of United Nations gave me a massive bouquet flowers. He commended and paid tribute to me for adding colour to the scripts than the writer did for that part. It is significant; it is on record. That was the first pivotal part of my career and it was wonderful. In the whole city, I became a celebrity, going to visit motherless baby\u2019s homes, opening pubs, doing the rounds of a celebrity in town .I started my career on that note and then, I went to Edinburgh International Festival, also some 47 years ago. That was an amazing starting. There are so many peaks in my career because they gave me challenging roles and I supposed I went with it with such passion and naivety, and enthusiasm which I hope I never lose till I die about my work. Every point of my work is significant. So, it\u2019s difficult for me to say this was most memorable. If you are a theatre person in the western world and you haven\u2019t appeared in Edinburgh International Film Festival, you have not arrived. I did that 47 years ago. That was in 1972.\n\nWhat does being in entertainment sector mean to you?\n\nIt means everything. It puts you on the mountaintop where you can see life in all its diversity and it stands you apart as an observer to see the world. Don\u2019t forget my business is to represent what is going on in the world. I\u2019m a keen observer of people and I work with intuition.\n\nWhy did you come back home after staying so long abroad as an actor?\n\nHome is where the heart is. Yoruba say: \u2018Ile la bo simi oko\u2019. Meaning: you go out to the farm and you must come back home. However messy your harvest is in the farm, you are not going to stay in the farm; you come back home. Why did I come home? I came home principally because the husband I married saw how I was doing, and he said, specifically, in answer to that question, your people don\u2019t know what you are doing here; don\u2019t waste this on England. Go home. Go and show your people what you do. Your people must know what you are doing; they must know who you are. Those were my husband\u2019s words. He was an English man. Lycett said: \u2018Go Home.\u2019 He thought my success in Nigeria is more important than my success abroad. \u201cLet your people know who you are, what you are doing, let them know you are representing them very well abroad. Go home and show them who you are; inspire young people.\u201d He was right. He\u2019s been dead now close to 30 years, and you are here having an interview with me. He said fame and success is nothing abroad if you don\u2019t give that success to your people.\n\nWhat would you want to be remembered for?\n\nMy service to the people, that I served my people, that I loved my people, that I loved my country. I think service to one another is the ultimate. I think consideration and tolerance for one another is important. I think love is everything. Do to others as you wish them to do unto you. That is the lifestyle I live. Respect to everybody. Don\u2019t take yourself too seriously. Don\u2019t think that you are better than anybody. Everybody is special. I like to think that when I die, people will miss me but know that I lived, that I made an impact, and those who met me that I made a difference to their lives. If we go according to how the world lives, I would be in Los Angeles or in my house in the UK and think what a big woman I am. But here, this is where I hold responsibility. If there\u2019s no NEPA, let us suffer the NEPA together. No water? Let\u2019s try and do something about it. Let\u2019s agitate to make life better for everybody. I would like to be remembered that I was loyal. I stood by my people; I stood by my Africanness, Nigerianness, and my people. I stood for progress.\n\nWhat has life taught you?\n\nI have learnt that if I want my life to end well I must give to life. And life will give to me. Whatever you do is going to come back to you. There is a law of karma and retribution. Karma plays both ways: you do good you will get good; you do bad, you will get bad undoubtedly. What you send out comes back to you. Be careful how you deal with other people. Respect begets respect; if you don\u2019t give respect you are not going to get respect.\n\nHow did you fare during the COVID-19 lockdown? What were the challenges?\n\nI think COVID-19 period was the biggest blessing we had. It gave us time to think. It enabled us to know that our running around, the noise we make, we don\u2019t have control over anything. It was a period of reflection for me. I\u2019m not a very social person. If you are not used to being by yourself that might be a problem. Significantly, COVID-19 showed me how I am loved by my children. I didn\u2019t have to worry about what I was going to eat. I didn\u2019t have to worry about whether I have money or I don\u2019t have money because my people would come with food for the freezer, come and dump everything at the door. They brought fruits and assorted foods, even soup. Before they announced the lockdown, they had time to shop. They supplied me with fruits, vegetables, ginger, garlic, turmeric, oranges, lime. All the people I mentored are all my family. They all rallied round. They made sure petrol is in the generator. I didn\u2019t have to spend a kobo last year. My children rallied round. That\u2019s how significant COVID-19 was to me. It showed me that people cared about me. The Lagos State Government was supposed to give palliatives to old people; they sent me a note on my phone that palliatives were coming. I\u2019m still waiting. My heart goes to the old people that didn\u2019t have the kind of network that I have and thinking that government would take care of them. The system didn\u2019t work but my children looked after me during the COVID-19 pandemic. I\u2019m very proud of all of them.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "*Threatens sanctions against members scheming parallel meetings\n\n*Buni considers his options\n\n*Party chieftain wants court to stop congresses, National Convention over Buni\u2019s chairmanship\n\nAdedayo Akinwale and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nRattled by last Wednesday\u2019s minority judgement of the Supreme Court on the Ondo State governorship election, which punched holes in the legality of the actions of its National Caretaker Committee\u2019s Chairman, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, members of the All Progressives Congress\u2019 Caretaker Committee yesterday scampered to the Minister of Justice/Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, for advice on whether to go ahead with today\u2019s ward congresses.\n\nOn the same day, a chieftain of the APC from Abia State, Kalu Agu, asked a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) for an order of perpetual injunction restraining the APC from going ahead with its ward congresses today, as well as subsequent local governments, states, zonal congresses, and the party\u2019s National Convention.\n\nAs for Buni, sources said he was also distressed by the Supreme Court indictment, and \u201che is seriously weighing his options about either staying as party Chair or returning to his job as Yobe State governor.\u201d\n\nAnother source said the decision to consult Malami on the issue was in conformity with the directives of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nOf course, Malami, after an elaborate analysis, cleared the Caretaker Committee to proceed with the ward congresses, assuring that Buni\u2019s continued stay as Chair would not portend any crisis for the party.\n\nThe sources said Malami told the caretaker members that the Supreme Court judgement did not render the committee illegal and that it still \u201chas legal capacity to undertake any action on behalf and in the name of the party.\u201d\n\nMalami said further that the judgement did not question the legality of all the actions taken by the Buni-committee since inception.\n\nA member of Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Prof. Mamman Tahir, who confirmed this development, while addressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja, said Malami assured that Buni\u2019s stay was legal, and would not turn the congresses into a nullity.\n\nTahir stated: \u201cI am here this afternoon to reconfirm that our Congresses are on course to hold tomorrow (Saturday) and this Committee is working closely with the Attorney-General of the Federation and he has offered advice that we are on good ground and we are comfortable with that position.\n\n\u201cSo, our programmes will continue to roll on in the normal course of things. We want to assure teeming members of the APC across the country to come out and elect officers at the ward levels. This party believes so much in grassroots politics, grassroots democracy; that is the strength of the party.\n\n\u201cI call on all members to come out tomorrow and elect leaders of their choice at the Ward level before the party moves to the next stage of the democratisation process.\u201d\n\nAsked if Congresses will hold in Zamfara and Anambra, Tahir said: \u201cAnother date is being fixed for those states because we have an election coming up in Anambra. We don\u2019t want to jeopardise our position there. Though in Zamfara, only recently, they are still doing their validation and continuation of membership registration. So that is the position.\u201d\n\nAPC Reads Riot Act, Warns against Parallel Congress\n\nThe National Secretary of APC\u2019s CECPC, John Akpanudoedehe, was also buoyed by Malami\u2019s assurances, issued a statement yesterday, saying today\u2019s ward congresses would go ahead as planned.\n\nAkpanudoedehe warned that any parallel congress, parallel party organ and or parallel party office would not be tolerated by the national leadership of the party ahead of the ward congresses.\n\nIn a notice to party members, he said the APC would deploy the full weight of the law as stipulated in Section 21(D) of the party\u2019s Constitution on any one who engaged in such act.\n\nIn the notice, the party said it was important that the attention of all party faithful be drawn to the resolution of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of 8th December, 2020, which subsists and extends to the conduct of party members during the congresses.\n\nThe APC re-stated that all pending litigations instituted by members against the party should be withdrawn forthwith, \u201cand going forward, no member should institute matters against the party, without exhausting the internal mechanism for conflict resolution, as enshrined in the party\u2019s constitution.\u201d\n\nThe ruling party said as a result of the above, party members should note that all activities that may be carried out by persons to put the party and its officers in bad light, before, during and after the congresses should be jettisoned.\n\nIt added: \u201cAll activities or processes congresses and thereafter which do not have the approval of the CECPC are exercises in futility. This is to say that: any purported; parallel congress, parallel party organ and or parallel party office, is to say the least a nullity. These divisive activities will not be tolerated.\n\nIn its split judgment of four against three by the seven member-panel, which sat on the Ondo governorship election petition, the Supreme Court had contended that the reason it did not sack Governor Akeredolu, was because the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its governorship candidate in the October 10, 2020 election, Eyitayo Jegede, failed to join Buni in the suit, even when the issues revolved around him.\n\nAlthough Justice Mary Odili, in a dissenting minority verdict, upheld Jegede\u2019s appeal that the nomination of Akeredolu, which was signed by Buni, was not valid under Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nAfter the judgement, the Minister of State for Labour, Festus Keyamo, was the first to advise the APC to halt all preparations and conduct of congresses nationwide forthwith, having analysed the implications of the judgment.\n\nSaid Keyamo: \u201cThe planned congresses across the country slated for this weekend must immediately be suspended, because it will be an exercise in futility as analysed above. The competence of Governor Buni to organise the congresses has been called to question by the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nBuni Sues for Peace\n\nMeanwhile, Buni, has enjoined party stakeholders and members to conduct the exercise peacefully.\n\nBuni, in a statement issued yesterday called on officials conducting the Congress to be fair and objective to all candidates contesting the election.\n\nThe chairman warned that the party would not hesitate to take decisive measures against anyone who deliberately sabotage the Congress.\n\nHe noted that adequate arrangements had been made by the party to conduct successful and acceptable congresses across the country.\n\nBuni said: \u201cAs stakeholders of the party, we have great responsibility to make the ward Congress in all the participating states successful. We should endeavour to place the party and members\u2019 interests above personal interests.\n\n\u201cWe have come a long way repositioning the party, we have reconciled many groups and individuals, we must not allow personal interests in this election to divide us and draw us back.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman also charged aggrieved members to channel their grievances to the appropriate quarters at the party secretariat.\n\nCourt Stops Imo Congress\n\nThe APC Ward congresses in Imo State have been stopped by an Abuja federal high court.\n\nJustice Valentine Oriji, in his ruling on the suit filed by Okey Anyikwa, who is the APC Chairman in Ideato South Local Government Area, threatened to invalidate the outcome of congresses if the party disregards the position of the Court.\n\nAnyikwa had approached the court to stop the APC in the state from going ahead with the congresses because of the judgement of the Appeal Court that upheld the tenure of the state\u2019s Exco elected in 2018.\n\nAll action regarding APC congresses in the state are to be placed on hold, pending the hearing of the application slated for August 10.\n\nAPC Chieftain, Kalu Asks Court to Halt Party\u2019s Congresses\n\nA chieftain of the APC from Abia State, Mr Kalu Agu, yesterday asked a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) for an order of perpetual injunction restraining the APC from going ahead with its planned Ward congress scheduled for today as well as subsequent local governments, states, zonal Congresses and the party\u2019s National Convention.\n\nAgu in the suit marked CV/1812/2021, dated July 29 and filed July 30, 2021 is also asking the court to declare as null and void, any of the APC\u2019s congresses and convention held under the current acting National Chairman of the APC\u2019s Caretaker Committee.\n\nThe suit filed by his lawyer, Ukpai Ukairo, has the APC and Buni as first and second defendants respectively.\n\nThe plaintiff by the suit is claiming that the second defendant was never elected at any congress to run the affairs of the APC, adding that the party\u2019s Constitution does not allow any person who holds an executive position to occupy any position in any of its organs.\n\nIn a 38 paragraph affidavit deposed to in support of the suit, the plaintiff, stated that Buni \u201cis being sued solely in his capacity as henchman of the usurpers of the functions of the organs and elected officers of the first defendant and as representing the other usurpers of the functions of the organs and elected officers of the first defendant.\u201d\n\nAgu, who disclosed that he intends to contest for the position of National Legal Adviser of the APC during the party\u2019s next convention said his interest would be affected by \u201ca co\u00f1duct of a congress superintended by the second defendant who is a sitting Governor of Yobe State and also discharging the functions of the elected National Chairman and the National Working Committee of the first defendant\u201d.\n\nWhile claiming that APC does not have an elected ward congress and that Buni is not also elected, the deponent added that \u201csome persons not known to the Constitution of the party are determined to come together and appoint themselves as ward executive committee, thereby excluding him from the process of contesting for the said position.\n\nAmong the issues he wants the court to determine are: whether the APC can conduct a ward congress when there is no elected ward executive committee of the APC.\n\nHe further wants the court to determine whether the APC can lawfully conduct a ward congress, local government congress, state congress, zonal congress, national convention for the election of officers into the various levels of the structure of the APC established by the constitution of the APC for its administration when it has usurpers of the functions of the organs and elected officers of the APC who are not elected in accordance with the 1999 Constitution, the Electoral Act and the APC\u2019s Constitution.\n\nHe sought an order of mandatory injunction setting aside any decision, act, steps, notifications taken or made out for the purpose of holding any ward, Local Government, State, Zonal Congresses or National Convention of the party.\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Case instituted two days before IMN\u2019s leader was freed by court\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nThe Kaduna State Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr. Dari Bayero yesterday confirmed to THISDAY that the government had filed fresh charges bordering on terrorism and treasonable felony against the leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN), Sheikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky.\n\nHe said the new charges were filed on July 26, at the federal High Court, Kaduna, just two days before the IMN\u2019s leader and his wife, Zeenat, were freed by Justice Gideon Kurada on eight count charge of culpable homicide, disruption of public peace, unlawful assembly among others.\n\nBayero said the fresh charges of terrorism and treasonable felony against El-Zakzaky would be jointly prosecuted by the Federal and Kaduna State governments.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe terrorism case was filed based on the utterances of El-Zakzaky, under section 17 (A) of the Terrorism Prevention Act 2013. He will face a nine-count charge at the Federal High Court, Kaduna. We even attempted to serve him while in prison before the ruling, he refused to collect it. There is evidence to that effect. An affidavit will be duly sworn to that effect. We couldn\u2019t move forward quickly because the Federal High Court is on vacation.\n\n\u201cThis case is supposed to be done in conjunction with the federal government. The Federal Ministry of Justice will send a team to come and prosecute with us.\u201d\n\nBayero also said the state government would appeal against the no case ruling of the state High Court in favour of the IMN\u2019s leader.\n\n\u201cOf course we will appeal against the ruling. We have applied for the ruling and as soon as that is made available to us, we will go on appeal. Definitely we will go on appeal. We have informed the court on our decision to appeal against the ruling,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, in his reaction, the spokesman of the IMN, Ibrahim Musa, said he was not aware of any new case filed against El-Zakzaky in any court.\n\n\u201cMy findings indicated that there are no court papers served to our leader. Definitely we are not aware of the charge in another court,\u201d Musa said.\n\nHe, however, admitted that a day before the judgement of the state High Court, there was an attempt to serve El-Zakzaky some court papers.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that a day before the judgment at the state High Court, they tried to make such moves but there was no judge assigned, no court assigned for the case and we were not served with the papers.\n\n\u201cSo it might be an attempt by them. But in reality our Sheikh or his lawyers have not been served any court papers,\u201d the IMN spokesman told THISDAY.\n\nIn the no case submission filed by El-Zakzaky\u2019s counsels, led by Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), Justice Kurada declared that the IMN\u2019s leader and his wife, who had been in detention for over five years, had no case to answer, because the Kaduna government failed to establish a prima facie case against the defendants, and accordingly discharged and acquitted them.\n\nShortly after his victory in court on Wednesday, El-Zakzaky and his wife were immediately discharged from the Kaduna Correctional Centre.\n\nSources said they were taken to a resident of one of his followers in Abuja, \u201cbecause his Zaria residence and properties of the IMN had been demolished by the Kaduna State Government after his arrest in December 2015.\u201d\n\nThe source said El-Zakzaky\u2019s family members, his followers and well-wishers, had been visiting him in his new abode in Abuja since Thursday.\n\nMusa said the IMN leader\u2019s left Kaduna for Abuja on Thursday.\n\n\u201cHe is now in Abuja, I can\u2019t say he has a house in Abuja, but you know as somebody with many followers, he will not lack a place to stay,\u201d Musa said.\n\nDefence Team Celebrates Victory\n\nAfter El-Zakzaky\u2019s victory in court last Wednesday, an elated counsel to the defendants, Marshal Abubakar who represented the lead counsel in the suit, Falana, declared: The trial of Sheikh El-Zakzaky and his wife Zeenat has come to an end as the court found them not guilty of the alleged crime filed against them by the Kaduna State Government.\n\n\u201cThe court found that the charges that were filed in 2018 pursuant to the Penal Law enacted by the state government in 2017 over an alleged offence committed in 2015, were incompetent.\n\n\u201cThe court ruled that the charge was not supposed to be filed in the first place, as the government cannot arraign someone for a said crime that was not an offence at the time.\n\n\u201cThe court ruled that the charge was incompetent, as the court agreed that El-Zakzaky and his wife had committed no offence.\n\n\u201cThe court also holds that the event of December 12, 2015 and December 15, 2015 was not an offence and the court was emphatic that none of the events on December 12, 2015 can be attributed to the defendants for an offence.\u201d\n\nEl-Zakzaky, Wife Arrested in December 2015\n\nEl-Zakzaky and his wife were arrested in December 2015, following a clash between his followers and soldiers in Zaria, Kaduna State.\n\nHis followers, who were observing a religious ritual, allegedly blocked the highway and refused to allow passage of the convoy of the then Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai (now retired), who was in Zaria for the Passing Out Parade of the military school in the area.\n\nThe IMN members allegedly turned down all appeal to allow the convoy of the army chief go pass, leading to confrontation.\n\nThe following day, soldiers allegedly sealed off the headquarters of the IMN in Zaria, and that there was a bloody clash.\n\nNo fewer than 347 members of the IMN were killed and buried in a mass grave in the Mando area of Kaduna metropolis.\n\nWhile in detention, his followers persistently protested in major cities, like Abuja, Kaduna, Kano, and Sokoto, demanding for his release.\n\nSome of their protests often resulted in deaths, following violent clashes with security agencies, especially the police.\n\nIn December 2016, an Abuja Federal High Court under trial Justice Gabriel Kolawole ordered the release of the IMN\u2019s leader and his wife on the grounds that their continuous incarceration was unconstitutional and an infringement on their fundamental human rights.\n\nThe court had also awarded N50 million compensation to the duo and ordered the federal government to provide a new accommodation for them in Zaria or any northern town of their choice. But the federal government refused to free him until the eventual judgement on Wednesday that set him free.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Shallow water and onshore assets to be offloaded\n\n*Sale documents issued, EOIs due September 10\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell has launched a major divestment of its Nigerian assets, especially those in the shallow water and onshore, several sources familiar with the matter said yesterday.\n\nSources close to the company disclosed that the oil giant had already hired Standard Chartered Bank to sell its Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) subsidiary, in deal which could be one of the hugest in the oil and gas industry in Africa ever.\n\nWhen contacted, a Shell spokesman, who confirmed the talks, told THISDAY last night that although consultations were ongoing about the planned sale, they were still at the early stages.\n\n\u201cDiscussions with the Nigerian government are ongoing on the next steps for our onshore business in Nigeria. We are in the early stages of reviewing the commercial options,\u201d the shell official stated.\n\nSources close to the transaction said that sale documents were issued earlier this week and Expressions of Interest (EoI) are due by September 10, with the vendor asking for non-binding offers in the subsequent second phase.\n\nThe source said: \u201cShell is selling the business because it no longer views its activities in the Niger Delta as core to its ongoing strategy, which is driven by the pressure from its investors, as confirmed by its CEO earlier this year.\n\n\u201cAlso, several of the Oil Mining Leases (OMLs) have upcoming development costs, which Shell does not intend to fund, one of the sources added, but noted that the company will still retain its deep water assets in the country.\n\n\u201cThe business will be worth several billions of dollars and Shell will want full-value offers for the deal but is strategically driven in this disposal and will likely prefer low execution risk to waiting for a knockout offer.\n\n\u201cIt is very likely too large for any single acquiror,\u201d another source said, adding that the valuation will ultimately be derived from different views on the separate assets, the shallow-water fields, the onshore fields and the infrastructure, for which there could be separate buyers.\n\nThe source adds: \u201cAlternatively, Shell may sell portions of equity in the whole of SPDC to different consortia of buyers. But either way, buyers will need to have a local Nigerian element, it was understood.\n\n\u201cSeveral options were being weighed, because while private equity would struggle with the associated risk and with the expected necessary investment in the portfolio, public-listed entities would struggle to raise equity to execute the deal, given the ESG-derived sentiment for oil and gas in the public markets.\n\n\u201cLocal sponsors may be interested, but this would constitute a very transformational deal, and would need significant lender support, the source said, noting that an international, private group with operating expertise, for example Perenco, or a Chinese player might make most sense.\u201d\n\nThe SPDC Joint Venture (JV) is co-owned with Eni via its NAOC subsidiary with five per cent, TotalEnergies via its Total E&P Nigeria subsidiary with 10 per cent, and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) with the remaining 55 per cent.\n\nIn May, Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Ben van Beurden, while speaking at the company\u2019s annual general meeting, said that Shell could no longer afford to be exposed to the risk of theft and sabotage.\n\nShell, operator of Nigeria\u2019s onshore oil and gas joint venture SPDC, has struggled for years with spills in the Niger Delta as a result of vandalism, as well as operational issues, leading to costly repair operations and high-profile lawsuits. Many people, however, blame the company for the degradation in the Niger Delta environment.\n\nIn February, a Dutch court held Shell\u2019s Nigerian subsidiary responsible for multiple oil pipeline leaks in the Niger Delta and ordered it to pay damages to farmers, leading van Beurden to call its Nigerian onshore assets a \u201cheadache\u201d.\n\nThe company\u2019s onshore joint venture SPDC has sold about 50 per cent of its oil assets over the past decade, with its stake in SPDC giving it 156,000 barrels per day of oil equivalent in 2020, of which 66,000 barrels were oil.\n\nSPDC operates the company\u2019s shallow-water and onshore asset interests via its 30 per cent interest in the SPDC joint venture, which supplies around 10 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s gas demand.\n\nIt owns 360 producing oil wells, 60 producing gas wells and a network of 4,000 kilometres of oil and gas pipelines and flowlines, according to the Shell website.\n\nOn January 15, this year, SPDC completed the sale of its 30 per cent interest in OML 17 in the Eastern Niger Delta, and associated infrastructure, to TNOG Oil and Gas Ltd, a related company of Heirs Holdings Ltd and Transnational Corporation of Nigeria Plc, for a consideration of $533 million.\n\nIn 2020, output from the SPDC JV, together with Shell\u2019s SNEPCo subsidiary, fell from the record highs of 2019 but, at around 620kbpd of oil equivalent, remained close to the five-year average of 625,000bpd.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "What\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Ghana?\n\nThe Ashanti kingdom? Relaxed and easy-going people? Jollof rice wars with Nigerians?\n\nFor many years the West African nation has been known for its prominent natural resources: Gold and Cocoa. It\u2019s the world\u2019s second-largest producer of cocoa and the only African country among the top ten gold producing countries.\n\nCompared to other continent heavyweights like Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya, Ghana has mostly been in the background in terms of tech in Africa. But Ghana\u2019s budding tech scene has caught the attention of many and appears to be on the way to becoming a major export.\n\nRecent moves by big tech companies \u2014 Twitter setting up its African headquarters in Ghana and the 2019 launch of Google\u2019s AI lab in Accra, the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 are roaring examples of the dawn of Ghanaian Tech.\n\nTechCabal visited Ghana in July to get a first-hand view of Accra by connecting with key players and rising stars.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should know about Ghana\u2019s tech ecosystem, beyond cliches.\n\nThe people and prospects\n\nWith a population of about 31 million people growing at 2.2% annually, Ghana is currently the 13th most populous African country. Approximately 57% of its population is under the age of 25, a sign that Ghana and other African countries will supply a disproportionate percentage of the world\u2019s working-age people in the coming years.\n\nAdult literacy at 79% (as at 2018) has eased the adoption of tech products by its population.\n\nFoster Akugri, the founder of Hacklab Foundation, a not-for-profit organization focused on preparing young people for future jobs, believes the population is becoming more tech-savvy.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing more Ghanaian tech talents being headhunted by global companies. Now there are two ways to look at this, you can call it brain drain or that Ghana is producing the quality talents for global firms to consider hiring. I choose the latter.\u201d Akugri told TechCabal.\n\nGhana has 16 regions but its leading tech regions are Accra and Kumasi, the country\u2019s most urban and commercial centres. Of course, this pattern of concentration happens in other African countries like Nigeria where Lagos is the hub or Kenya where it\u2019s Nairobi.\n\n\u201cIn the past three years,\u201d Jorge Appiah CEO Kumasi Hive said, \u201cother regions like Tamale, Cape-Coast, Takoradi, Volta and Wa have been developing.\u201d\n\nInternet connection and the use of smartphones help to create thriving tech markets. How does Ghana stack up in this regard?\n\nIts internet penetration stands at 46.5%, which is higher than the African average of 39.3% and its neighbouring West African countries. But it lags behind the world\u2019s average of 58.5% and Kenya\u2019s 85%.\n\nFunding: Cash Flow is increasing\n\nTech ecosystems are built with a lot of resources \u2014 time, people, and mostly money.\n\nVenture capital investment in Africa has grown over the past five years, from $400 million in 2015 to $2 billion in 2019, according to Africa-focused VC fund Partech Africa. But Ghana has been behind South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria and Egypt.\n\nBased on Partech\u2019s 2020 report, the top five were Nigeria ($307 million), Kenya ($304 million), Egypt ($269 million), South Africa ($259 million), and Ghana ($111 million) displacing Rwanda which was fifth in Partech\u2019s 2019 list.\n\nThe four markets above Ghana can refer to their population sizes as justification for why they have received more funding. But like other African countries, Ghana can do more to encourage startups to incorporate there and hence attract more venture investment.\n\nA major snag for foreign startups setting up a base in Ghana is the minimum capital requirement. In the case of a joint venture between a Ghanaian and non-Ghanaian, the non-Ghanaian has to contribute at least $200,000. For wholly-owned foreign startups, they need to have a minimum of $500,000 capital.\n\nThe threshold increases to $1,000,000 with a minimum of 20 skilled Ghanaians employed if they commence commercial activities in Ghana. Many startups that are bootstrapping do not have access to large amounts of capital.\n\nThat said, Ghana is beginning to live up to predictions that it is well-positioned to attract more capital.\n\nSo far about nine Ghanaian startups \u2014 mPharma, Jetstream, Zeepay, OZ\u00c9, AgroCenta, Redbird, Complete Farmer, BezoMoney and SFAN \u2014 have raised money this year, which suggests that more are on the way.\n\nBut as funding increases, it\u2019s important for local investors to back the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI look forward to the first wave of founders becoming the next wave of angel investors. That\u2019s the next tipping point I\u2019m interested in seeing.\u201d Will Senyo, CEO Impact Hub Accra and Venture Partner at Ingressive Capital said.\n\nIn terms of local investors, we have the likes of Sangu Delle who runs Golden Palm Investment and Africa Health Holdings, Walter Baddo and Peter Orth of 4DX Ventures, Kwamina Afful of Pave Investments and Ato Bentsi-Enchill of Black Adam Africa Capital Management.\n\nBut beyond money, hubs and accelerators help shape an ecosystem. Who plays these roles in Ghana?\n\nStart-up ecosystem builders\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the country\u2019s leading hubs, accelerators, venture firms, leading entrepreneurs, and other power brokers.\n\nIn 2017, the Ghanaian government established the Accra Digital Centre equipped with two hubs \u2013 the Ghana Innovation Hub and the Ghana TechLab \u2013 to run incubation and accelerator programs for startups.\n\nA product of the Ghana digital centre project, the Accra Digital Centre provides an enabling environment for startups to run their operations. It currently houses 36 startups, which enjoy discounted rent costs (about one-third of the regular rates) with flexible payment plans. David Ofori, Head of Operations at the Accra Digital Centre, says it has become the nerve centre around which most digital innovations are driven in Ghana.\n\nLast year, the Bank of Ghana created an office for Fintech and Innovation, to drive the regulator\u2019s cash-lite, e-payments, and digitisation agenda. An indicator that the government means business. It also launched the Fintech sandbox which gives startups a springboard to try out products without being restricted by license and capital requirements. In September, the Apex bank plans to roll out the first of a three-pilot-phased nation\u2019s digital currency.\n\nIn terms of private endeavours, the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) has supported startups for over a decade. In that time, they\u2019ve had startups move on to internationally acclaimed programs like YC, going on to raise significant funding and claiming some exits along the way. Closely related to this is the Catalyst Fund Inclusive Digital Commerce Accelerator, a program that helps six commerce startups scale by providing them with a $120,000 equity-free grant each along with a six-month venture acceleration support.\n\nEstablished in 2013, Impact Hub Accra is a co-working space that houses over 50 startups yearly and provides a venue for tech events. Beyond supporting startups, it has also inspired the creation of other hubs.\n\n\u201cWhen Impact Hub Accra started, we were pretty much the only Hub in town,\u201d Kelechi Ofoegbu, COO Impact Hub Accra, said. \u201cToday there are nearly 10 other hubs across Accra and easily over 30 hubs across the entire country.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these, the Stanbic Bank Incubator, a corporate social initiative by Stanbic bank Ghana, provides access to training, funding and market for startups. Kosmos Innovation Centre (KIC) is focused on supporting entrepreneurs building agritech solutions.\n\nOutside of Accra, the Kumasi hive which started in 2015, has trained over 1,000 startups so far. A number of established Ghanaian tech companies like Hubtel, Farmerline, Sayetech, Green Afro-Palms began in Kumasi. Notably, Kumasi has also produced a number of Hardware startups like Dext, SolarTaxi, Nastech, Sesi Technologies and Incas Diagnostics.\n\nTo increase the participation of women in tech, organisations like StemBees, Developers in Vogues and Soronko Academy are training young women in programming/software development, and connecting them with job opportunities.\n\nTop players and other power brokers\n\nMobile Money is a big deal in Ghana and telecom giant MTN is the market leader with 17 million registered subscribers and over 200,000 agents across the country. There are other telco players like Vodafone and Airteltigo.\n\nThe ride-hailing and logistics space is dominated by the likes of Bolt, Uber, Yango and new entrant Glovo, while Jumia dominates the eCommerce space.\n\nWhile there\u2019s yet to be a major exit, a few companies like mPharma, ZeePay and Appruv have broken out and achieved continental success. Earlier this year, healthcare startup mPharma entered its eighth market in Sub-Saharan Africa while Zeepay acquired a mobile money company in Zambia.\n\nmPharma CEO Gregory Rockson sees his company\u2019s success as a sign of what other Ghanaian startups can do. \u201cI consider our success as an endorsement of the Ghana ecosystem and the fact that startups from Ghana can expand and build market-leading solutions in other countries,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Future and opportunities\n\nBeyond what Ghana is today, there\u2019s a lot to look forward to.\n\nJorge Appiah, who is also the CEO of SolarTaxi, believes the Ghanaian tech ecosystem is in its early days. \u201cThe prevalence of fintech means that we\u2019re laying the foundation for other types of startups that will address lifestyle and social issues,\u201d he said.\n\nIdris Bello, the founding partner of Lofty Inc, a Pan-African investment firm that has invested in four Ghanaian Startups, is keeping a keen eye on the growing ecosystem.\n\n\u201cGhana has calm founders, maybe not as in hurry like their counterparts in Nigeria. If you\u2019re able to build a strong team you can launch into the rest of the continent from there. That\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m bullish about finding strong founders with great networks like the folks at Yemaachi and Tendo amongst others.\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhoever I\u2019m investing in has to be building for beyond Ghana. There has to be a way to attract diasporans back to build from Ghana for the continent and we\u2019re going to be deliberate about that.\u201d\n\nMiishe Addy, CEO of Jetstream, a cross-border logistic company believes that like Singapore or Switzerland, Ghana\u2019s relatively small domestic market size forces founders to be practical and creative \u2013 very early on \u2013 about reaching beyond political boundaries.\n\n\u201cGhanaians have a reputation for a calm temperament and unusual skill in diplomacy,\u201d Addy said.\n\n\u201cWhether the stereotype bears out or not, it\u2019s a thrill to watch Ghanaian founders build bridges into other African markets and continue our long history of bringing the continent together.\u201d\n\nExcited about the momentum so far, Gregory Rockson, CEO of mPharma, points to \u201ca good education system, stability in governance, and a desire to achieve greatness.\u201d\n\n\u201cGhana can become the Singapore of West Africa where we attract strong tech talent from other countries in the region to continue their career from Ghana,\u201d he said.\n\nSenyo of Impact Hub believes the big opportunities lie in taking tech to the mass market. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot that\u2019s designed for a class that\u2019s tech-savvy. The true win would be taking tech to reach a larger market,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank (CBN) has stopped the sale of foreign exchange (FX) to Bureau De Change (BDC) operators in the country. The registration of new players has also been halted, with immediate effect.\n\nGovernor Godwin Emefiele made the announcement at the end of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nAs with almost every announcement made by the CBN regarding the regulation of foreign currency, the decision has sparked a debate between economists, monetary policy experts, and other Nigerians on social media.\n\nWhy is Nigeria halting the sale of forex?\n\nBDCs were set up to receive a weekly supply of FX from the CBN for onward sale to retail end-users, that is, people who needed $5,000 dollars or less.\n\nHowever, Emefiele said the MPC noted that the money changers had become wholesale dealers and illegally traded FX to the tune of millions of dollars per transaction.\n\nAccording to him, the CBN receives about 5,000 fresh applications monthly for BDC registration as players continued to make huge profits while Nigerians suffered from the \u201cdollarisation\u201d of the Nigerian economy.\n\nThe apex bank also accused BDC operators of speculative, rent-seeking behaviour and involvement in money laundering activities.\n\n\u201cThey have turned themselves away from their objectives,\u201d Emefiele said. \u201cThey are now agents that facilitate graft and corruption in the country. We cannot continue with the bad practices that are happening at the BDC market.\u201d\n\nThe CBN will henceforth channel weekly allocations of dollar sales to commercial banks to meet legitimate FX demands. The banks will be monitored to provide forex for the legitimate use of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe will deal ruthlessly with Nigerian banks that deal with illegal BDCs and we will report foreign organisations patronising them,\u201d Emefiele said, adding that they are mandated to sell forex to every customer.\n\nAssessing the potential impact; Good or bad move?\n\nSome have praised the CBN for ending the \u201cmindless sales\u201d of foreign currency to BDC operators and an end to the reign of traders.\n\nHowever, there are concerns that thousands of Nigerians working at the 3,000+ BDC operators in the country will be thrown into the already large unemployment pool as a result of the ban.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad decision in itself but it\u2019s bad for the times we are in,\u201d said Kelechi Opara, an economist and Market Insights Officer at MMS Nigeria. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to close businesses. We are talking about unemployment and more people are about to be thrown into the same labour market.\u201d\n\nOpara added that instead of an outright ban, the CBN could \u201cgo the extra mile\u201d to properly profile and monitor every BDC operator they license, to ensure a working system void of corruption.\n\n\u201cEven with the move, there\u2019s no assurance that commercial banks will not become a supply chain in the BDCs market. The CBN should assume fulfill its regulatory role and create an enabling environment for legal businesses to thrive.\u201d\n\nAs commercial banks settle to adjust to the CBN directive, the ban is likely to put more pressure on the Nigerian naira in the parallel/black market \u2013 where forex is traded unofficially \u2013 in the immediate term.\n\nDue to the low inflow of U.S. dollars into the Nigerian economy, banks struggle to give foreign currency to their customers on demand.\n\nAlthough the situation should improve with the CBN channelling its weekly allocation to lenders, doubts exist over their capacity to replace BDCs in serving the huge demand for forex in Nigeria\u2019s import-dependent economy.\n\n\u201cGetting dollars could become even more difficult than what we have now,\u201d Opara said, noting that this is likely to push more companies and business people actively in need of dollars to the black market, further adding pressure on the naira.\n\nFollowing the CBN\u2019s announcement, the local unit fell by \u20a61.00 or 0.20% to close at \u20a6505 per $1 on Tuesday, from \u20a6504 on Monday. This is according to data recorded on abokiFX.com, a website that collates the parallel market rates in Lagos.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOver the long term, the central bank\u2019s effectiveness in disbursing foreign currency to retail users through the banks \u2013 if the new system is sustained \u2013 will dictate how the exchange rate at the parallel market will vary from the official rate of \u20a6410/$1.\n\nFor freelancers, remote workers, and remittance recipients that get foreign currencies through banks, the increased quantity of FX in the hands of lenders bodes well for their demands, except for the high fees banks charge on remittances.\n\n\u201cIf banks will be the sole seller of forex to the retail users, then the CBN has to do something about their high remittance charges so as to avoid people rushing to the black market,\u201d Opara added.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ato Bentsi-Enchill is helping African startups raise capital and protecting them from difficult investors",
          "text": "To understand how Ato Bentsi-Enchill started investing in startups, let\u2019s rewind to 2014.\n\nHe was a first-year liberal art major at Hobart and William Smith Colleges who won the school\u2019s flagship business plan competition. The business idea was RevisionPrep, an online educational service that combined exam preparation with gaming programs for students in Ghana.\n\nIt was a sign that he had business acumen \u2013 an ability he nurtured while working for his entrepreneurial parents. His grandfather\u2019s company, Black Adam Distilleries, would inspire his current company\u2019s name: Black Adam Africa Capital Management, a boutique investment firm specialising in private equity, investment advisory and project financing.\n\nBentsi-Enchill also invests in startups personally and through syndicates like Future Africa and Rally Cap. He\u2019s also a Venture Scout for Microtraction.\n\nOur conversation begins with how this current phase of his life started.\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How and why did you get into investing in companies?\n\nAto Bentsi-Enchill: I finished college and moved back to Ghana to work on RevisionPrep. After some time, I realised that it wasn\u2019t going to work. So I shut it down and started thinking about what to do next.\n\nBut while in the US, I had attended many Africa-focused business conferences at business schools at Harvard, MIT, Wharton, Stanford and NYU. I was thrilled to understand the power of private capital to transform businesses in Africa. I made life-long connections with individuals who ended up becoming mentors to me in the space.\n\nOnce in Ghana, I started looking at businesses that I thought were interesting enough to invest in if I had that type of money. I wrote summaries and sent them to my investor friends outside Ghana. My pitch was that I could make introductions and help with due diligence if they chose to proceed with the engagement because I was on the ground.\n\nI didn\u2019t close any deals in the early days. I came close to sealing a deal with a gentleman who ran a shea butter processing factory. In a couple of weeks, I had brought in one of the most prominent family offices in South Sudan to look at the deal. They were interested, but the timing wasn\u2019t ideal. The business owner said he liked the way I sourced investors, and if I took this seriously, I could make something out of this.\n\nDA: So when did your big break happen?\n\nAB: I met some investors who wanted to back a fintech company. I helped them with the due diligence, and they decided to invest about $3 million in the startup.\n\nI realised the founder needed more than $3 million during the process, and we agreed I\u2019d help raise more. Initially, he was hesitant as many folks had approached him with similar propositions, proposing hefty retainers while not doing the work.\n\nI was very convinced that this founder will be successful and told him to forget the retainer; I was ready to work with no payment upfront. Thankfully within a year and a half, we raised $7.5 million (up to $15 million now). Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t announce this deal, so I can\u2019t disclose the name. However, that engagement gave me better insights into analysing companies and making my bets on founders at a very early stage.\n\nInitially, when I started investing in companies, I made some mistakes and lost a lot of money, but I believe these lessons have helped me hone my craft. I\u2019ve also just concluded my first scout investment for Microtraction, a deal I also invested in.\n\nDA: You\u2019ve moved from a liberal arts background to business and investing in startups. How did you learn all these?\n\nAB: In the early days, when people asked me to do valuation reports, I got initial guidance on YouTube, read as many books as I could on the topic and spoke to people in my network. It\u2019s been more of self-education, and I believe that works best for me, although an MBA will be necessary for the future.\n\nSometimes potential clients look at my background and are skeptical but I tell them results don\u2019t lie. I\u2019ve done some solid work with my clients, and they are some of my biggest cheerleaders.\n\nDA: What do you look out for when you want to invest in a company?\n\nAB: For early-stage investing, the first thing is the team; I try to understand their motivation to build this company. Not everybody can run any company. Do they have deep knowledge of the industry? Are they resilient?\n\nThe second thing is the size of the market. Companies in Ghana have a more significant challenge in executing, so I\u2019d try to know what\u2019s unique to this firm and their potential for scaling quickly across their desired markets. If I can see them being a big player between 5 and 7 years, that\u2019s a good sign.\n\nI\u2019m also big on understanding how a company can become a monopoly in their space. And by monopoly, I don\u2019t necessarily mean how they become the next Amazon (although that would be awesome!), but what gives them an unfair advantage against their competitors in the industry. How can they dominate the market despite the presence of competitors/incumbents?\n\nI\u2019d also like to understand their challenges and risks of failure. Of course, they don\u2019t need to have the solutions to all these problems today, but it should be evident that they have given it some thought and come up with a plan.\n\nIf they\u2019re not currently making money, I want to know that they\u2019ll make money at some point. I\u2019m not much of a believer in just looking at valuations. Unit economics are also critical; they have to be positive or on the path to being positive.\n\nI also try to find out why now is the right time for your business to exist. What\u2019s happening within your industry? What are your competitors doing? What do your customers want? Once there\u2019s a convergence of needs, there\u2019s a good chance your company will succeed.\n\nToday, I\u2019m a very new angel investor in a space that\u2019s becoming increasingly competitive. I\u2019m happy to invest between $1-5k in companies at pre-seed and seed levels. These may look like small amounts, but it\u2019s always best to start small and learn; you\u2019re going to lose money along the way.\n\nPlus, if you are able to show how you can be an asset to these companies and have a credible story as to why they should take your money versus all the other monies being thrown at them, you\u2019ll be in a good starting position.\n\nOne other thing I did very early in my journey is to learn to write investment memos. I reviewed memos from Sequoia, a16z and Bessemer Ventures to understand what exactly to highlight when presenting a company to an investor.\n\nDA: How do you conduct due diligence?\n\nAB: Definitely I want to see their audited reports; for me, the numbers tell the whole story. But even when you\u2019re looking at numbers you need to look deeper.\n\nA lot of people say they made x amount of sales, they don\u2019t classify it as gross or net. Depending on their business, was it the amount their clients collected, of which a smaller percentage came to the company itself? It\u2019s important to know all these things.\n\nI\u2019m also curious about how money has been passing through the bank account over time. When you understand the business model and their cash flow situation, you can sniff out pertinent questions that make the story clearer to you.\n\nNow a lot of companies are sending links of articles on TechCabal or TechCrunch of similar companies in China, India or the US, to add credibility to the valuation or the business model. I don\u2019t really buy that. You can\u2019t use the fact that someone raised $100 million series B as a pointer that you\u2019ll get there. We all know the market in Africa is different.\n\nIt is definitely possible, but I won\u2019t lean heavily on the fact that a company with a similar business model has succeeded in a market. If I looked deeper, I\u2019d probably see 99 other companies that failed doing the same thing. What shows that you won\u2019t be part of those 99 in Africa?\n\nOther important due diligence points are talking to customers, running reference checks and spending as much time as possible with the founders to see how they run their business on a day to day basis. It takes me between one to three weeks to sort out due diligence.\n\nDA: How do people find you?\n\nAB: Hmmm. Primarily through my newsletter \u2014 musings of a wannabe African VC, LinkedIn or through referrals from previous clients or people in my network.\n\nI also reach out to people. I\u2019ve reached out to a podcast host before to introduce me to a guest who I thought would need my services and it resulted in an engagement.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s important to mention that I don\u2019t take on everyone, either because my team and I don\u2019t have the capacity to or I\u2019m not too convinced on their business.\n\nDA: Are there some sectors you don\u2019t invest in?\n\nAB: Naah. Once I can understand your business model, I can raise money for you or invest. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to restrict myself for now.\n\nDA: So what\u2019s your value add to businesses outside of just raising money for them?\n\nAB: I first connect people to capital, but beyond that, I help them understand what they should be focusing on and thinking about the different ways they could be building their business.\n\nFor example with InstantRad, outside of helping them engage investors, I do a lot of business development work for them. I also help companies build a path to exit; It\u2019s something a lot of people don\u2019t understand. Anyone who gives you money is also thinking about how to take it out at some point, so having a workable plan (that of course can be changed depending on market conditions) helps keep everyone focused.\n\nI help founders with term sheet analysis. There\u2019s a lot of technical terms that investors can slip in that young founders aren\u2019t aware of.\n\nDA: In layman terms, please give some examples of these technicalities?\n\nAB: There are good and bad investors. I\u2019ve seen some pretty horrible term sheets that don\u2019t have the founders\u2019 best interests at heart. I\u2019m always on the side of getting the deal done, but it has to be fair. I\u2019ll be the first to speak up when something on a term sheet does not look right.\n\nFor example, investors often offer startups convertible debts \u2013 a loan that could be repaid or converted to equity at a later date. Now I\u2019ve seen some term sheets where the investors ask that if the founder opts to pay back the investment, the investor gets some amount of free equity in the company. For quite a high-interest rate and no additional value, the investor wants more equity in the company? Make it make sense.\n\nI walked the entrepreneur through the term sheet and we ended up not taking capital from that investor.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen term sheets where investors are asking for four times (4x) liquidation preference. This means that if for any reason the company has to go through any kind of liquidation, the investors will get four times the amount they invested and the founders could possibly be left with little or nothing. No matter the kind of risk the investor is taking on the founder, I don\u2019t believe someone who\u2019s spent their blood, sweat and tears building a company should possibly be left with nothing. To me, investing in a company means you\u2019re sharing the ups and downs of the company, and it\u2019s a partnership.\n\nThese terms aren\u2019t necessarily unfair. It could make sense in certain scenarios as investors are trying to get as much equity from the company. But beyond affecting founders, these terms also affect future investors who could be discouraged from investing.\n\nDA: What trends are you seeing in Ghana?\n\nAB: Because of its market size, Ghana may not dominate one sector the way Nigeria does in fintech or Kenya in agritech. For the most part, I think we will be in the middle. Maybe number two or three in these sectors.\n\nThat said, the future is exciting.\n\nOne of the biggest success stories out here is mPharma, and it\u2019s unfortunate that most folks may not know that they\u2019re a Ghanaian company. They didn\u2019t just stay in Ghana and call it a day, they expanded to Nigeria and Kenya. Using mPharma as a reference, I believe startups here have to expand to different countries.\n\nZeepay is also doing a good job in respect to expansion, they just raised their $8 million series A. Based on my inside knowledge, I think there are other companies like Zeepay that have a good shot at expanding at a rapid rate. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll see companies like that exit in the next 5 and 7 years as the market grows.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It had also gotten a $100m investment from Mastercard in Airtel Mobile Commerce BV (AMC BV) in April.\n\nAMC BV is a subsidiary of Airtel Africa that functions as the holding company for several of the company\u2019s mobile money operations across 14 African countries.\n\nThe mobile money division is one of the largest financial services providers on the continent. It enables users to make mobile payments, international money transfers, borrow money, and use virtual credit cards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer TechCrunch, the investment will be used to reduce its debt and invest in network and sales infrastructure in the respective operating countries.\n\nThe investment deal will be completed in two tranches, with the first $150m probably in August and $50m at a yet unspecified date.\n\nAirtel Africa says that QIA will hold a minority stake in the company while it retains the majority. However, what\u2019s different in this investment deal is that QIA now has the authority to appoint a director to the board of directors of AMC BV, as well as \u201ccertain customary information and minority protection rights.\u201d\n\nWe reported that the telecommunications company recorded significant growth in revenue between March and December 2020; however, profit after tax dropped.\n\nComparing revenue from Q1 2020 with Q1 2021, Airtel saw a significant increase in revenue at $1.03b, dwarfing Q1 2020\u2019s revenue of $899m by 21.7%.\n\nIn its Q1 financial report, Airtel\u2019s Mobile Money accounted for the least revenue at $110m. However, it surpassed the $83m of Q1 2020 by 38.7%. Its mobile money customer base went from 18.3 million in Q1 2020 to 21.7 million in Q1 2021, an 18.5% increase.\n\nIn February 2021, Airtel Africa made it known that it wanted to sell a minority stake in AMC BV to raise cash and sell off some assets.\n\nIn subsequent months, the telco giant sold off telecommunication towers in Madagascar and Malawi to Helios Towers for $119m and raised $500m from outside investors. And in June, the telco giant announced the sale of its Tanzanian tower portfolio for $175m.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMansoor bin Ebrahim Al-Mahmoud, QIA CEO, believes that Airtel Money is critical for economic activity facilitation, particularly for customers who lack access to traditional financial services.\n\nHe also believes that the Sovereign Wealth Fund\u2019s investment in Airtel Africa will contribute to sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s financial inclusion.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Who puts out your IT fires when you\u2019ve deleted an entire file from the company\u2019s servers?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently, the job of a system administrator \u2014 sometimes called a sysadmin or system admin \u2014 had begun to fascinate me. But before we start, a little back story.\n\nMy first experience with system administrators was with the technical support staff in the ICTU/CRPU unit of the University of Benin. Depending on the mood you catch them in, you could get a good-natured, friendly personality or, a trash-talking grump \u2014 most likely the latter.\n\nFast forward to 2021, my job at Techpoint Africa led me to meet people like Karo, a soft-spoken but highly opinionated sysadmin who takes his job seriously and, quite frankly, knows what he is doing.\n\nThe difference was stark, but I still didn\u2019t know what exactly sysadmins did. And I decided to find out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho are System Administrators?\n\nWhen I first began down the rabbit hole called research, I expected to find a pretty complex maze of confusing terms and techy words. In the end, I did find them \u2014 words like awk, Perl, and shell. I also found semi-familiar words like server, network, and information.\n\nBut I discovered an underlying thread, troubleshooting. At the heart of the job of a system administrator is the ability to find solutions to the IT fires an organisation dependent on technology inevitably needs to put out.\n\nKolade Alonge, a former server administrator at MultiChoice, puts it succinctly, \u201cWe are problem solvers.\u201d\n\nMore than that, System Administrators are responsible for the general management and maintenance of computer systems \u2014 servers, storage, CPU, PC \u2014 including software and hardware.\n\nThey manage user accounts, server configurations, install, configure and update software. Essentially, they keep an organisation from falling apart. System Administrators troubleshoot all day, every day.\n\nFor the average sysadmin, the day is spent attending to tickets \u2014 troubleshooting requests \u2014 from users, checking for errors and making sure the server is running perfectly.\n\nIt is quite demanding, requiring sysadmins to have knowledge of computer architecture \u2014 both hardware and software \u2014 and stay abreast of the latest updates to software; constantly think widely for economical solutions for the organisation while trying to maintain some semblance of calm.\n\nThe path to System Administration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Fatosa Adigun, his journey began in the four walls of the Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro, Ogun State, as a student in the Electrical/Electronics Engineering Department.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI started as an intern after my national diploma. Even though I was studying Electrical/Electronics Engineering, I was privileged to do my industrial training in an IT firm somewhere in Ikeja. I was posted to the Network and IT Department. I knew I\u2019d end up in the IT field.\u201d\n\nHis love for IT led him to go back to school for a degree in Computer Science, a programme which will end next year.\n\nAlonge\u2019s path was a different one. He studied Computer Science as an undergraduate and began his career as an IT Auditor, but eventually wound up as a System Administrator at Multichoice for the better part of a year. An experience he believes every IT professional should have.\n\n\u201cEvery auditor needs to have that experience of providing service before auditing service.\u201d\n\nAlonge and Adigun agree on one thing, going to university barely gives you 10% of the knowledge you need on the job. Many skills they acquired were primarily learnt as they went along or via courses and certifications they have had to take.\n\nAccording to Alonge, in Nigeria, school will teach you what you need to understand about computer architecture. If you are lucky enough, you get a lecturer good at programming who teaches well.\n\nWhile entry requirements for system administrators are relatively low, companies often prefer to hire persons with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in a computer-related course such as computer science, electrical/electronics engineering, or telecommunications and networking.\n\nHowever, according to Olusegun Balogun, an IT Support Specialist, you don\u2019t necessarily have to have those degrees to become a system administrator.\n\n\u201cAt Southgate Technologies, where I did my IT, I had a boss then. He was a subject matter expert in networking, but his first degree was in sociology. It depends first of all on the passion you have for computers, or it could be the first job you landed, and you decided to build a career in IT.\u201d\n\nReal-life experiences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlonge recalls receiving a call from his office informing him that his server room was on fire. Thankfully, this was not the case. The problem was with the cooling equipment. The room was quite hot, and the servers had to be turned off to prevent downtime.\n\nHeat is a sworn nemesis of servers. The ideal temperature for a server room is between 20 and 21 degrees Celsius. You also have to be careful not to keep the server room too cold \u2014 very dicey.\n\nApart from the health of the servers, what concerned him most was the fact that fellow staff members would be unable to work.\n\nHe recalls another incident; the backup solution was not working for the file server \u2014 where organisations store their documents and important information. He would have to update the hard drive, a tricky situation that meant that if he failed, not only would important information be lost, he could lose his job as well.\n\nEventually, everything went off without a hitch, with some prayer backing it along the way. He counts this as both his best and worst experience on the job.\n\nFor System Administrators, a problem solved is a highlight of their day. Adigun\u2019s best experience involved solving a network issue for a very important client, a government parastatal which shall not be named.\n\nHis worst experience was a bad boss at a former workplace. His superior shouted at him for a mistake he had inadvertently committed.\n\nHow important are System Administrators?\n\nAccording to Balogun, as long as an organisation\u2019s system depends on IT infrastructure, sysadmins are important. But he also says it depends on the size of the organisation\n\n\u201cSome organisations have in-house administrators because they can afford to hire them. But there are some organisations that cannot afford to keep those engineers in-house, so they just outsource those roles to big organisations.\n\n\u201cUltimately, all organisations, as long as you have some IT setup, routers, switches, LAN, some servers, definitely you will need a system administrator for maintenance. It now depends on the size of the organisation to know whether you are going to outsource or not,\u201d he concludes\n\nChallenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPer GFI Software \u2014 a business-IT essential software provider \u2014 IT admins rarely have enough time, find it challenging to work without impacting users, keep everything running smoothly, and find users unpredictable.\n\nThat post was made in 2014, and if Adigun\u2019s statements are factual, it remains the norm. For him, the job is quite time-consuming. Sometimes, he has had to leave the office at 10 p.m. He also finds dealing with users in other departments stressful and keeping up with updates to the software.\n\nAlonge identifies scenarios where an organisation wastes money to get gadgets that might not be needed or repair systems that can be repaired with a bit of technical know-how.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not all about the gadgets; it\u2019s about the knowledge,\u201d he says.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nAs is the natural progression of things, technology has evolved over the years. Many jobs now involve a lot more automation than they did in the last 10, 20 years.\n\nCan AI take over the job of a sysadmin? Experts disagree, at the very least not until AI does not need the input or guidance of a human being.\n\nA Medium post by mindsync explains this quite well, \u201cIn order to use the algorithms effectively, you need the talent of a living person (it\u2019s not enough to just teach the algorithm on a sample, you need to understand the business context, data features, and be able to interpret the results correctly).\u201d\n\nBoth Adigun and Alonge agree with this assessment\n\nSystems Administrators Appreciation Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far, you are probably wondering. Why are we talking about sysadmins?\n\nToday, Friday, July 30, 2021, is the 22nd annual System Administrator Appreciation Day. Ted Kekatos created it.\n\nKekatos was inspired by an HP magazine ad in which a system administrator is presented with flowers and fruit-baskets by grateful co-workers as thanks for installing new printers \u2014 the same model he had just installed at his workplace.\n\nIt is a day created specifically to appreciate the tireless and sometimes thankless job that sysadmins do, 24 hours a day, 365 \u2014 or six \u2014 a year.\n\nOn the website, it says: \u201cProper observation of SysAdmin Day includes (but is not limited to): cake & ice cream, pizza, cards, gifts, words of gratitude, custom t-shirts celebrating the epic greatness of your SysAdmin, balloons, confetti, did I say gifts?\u201d\n\nSo, to all sysadmins, up at 3 a.m. trying to work out a server downtime issue, or racking your brains, trying to find the answer to a firewall problem, we say thank you.\n\nAnd most of all, we say a big thank you to Muyiwa Matuluko, Techpoint Africa\u2019s Chief Servant and Ognenekaro Obrutu, former Technical Product Lead, for putting out our IT fires \u2014 which we may or may not cause ourselves.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Source: Supplied\n\nWhat do Reliance HMO, Printivo, and Flutterwave have in common? They are all LoftyInc Capital Management (LCM) portfolio companies, one of the oldest venture capital firms in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom inception to commercialisation, LCM claims to leverage global partnerships and standards to ensure that investments are impact-driven. LCM says it applies technological innovations to Africa\u2019s most pressing problems with skilled indigenous and returning world-class African teams.\n\nFounded in 2010 by Wole Odetayo, Idris Ayodeji Bello, Dami Agboola, and Michael Oluwagbemi, the firm partnered with the Africa Leadership Forum to launch Wennovation hub to provide technology support to Africa\u2019s social impact sectors.\n\nHow does LoftyInc get deals? Bello revealed that there are five major sources of deals for the firm. With a strong network at home and in the diaspora, the firm gets access to startups building amazing startups.\n\nHe also disclosed that founders who have been funded frequently refer other founders to them.\n\nTechpoint Africa spoke to Idris Ayodeji Bello, a Managing Partner at the firm to get an insight into the firm\u2019s activities. Our reporter, Chimgozirim Nwokoma has more on this story here.\n\nHe also disclosed that founders who have been funded frequently refer other founders to them.\n\nTechpoint Africa spoke to Idris Ayodeji Bello, a Managing Partner at the firm to get an insight into the firm\u2019s activities.

Although dyslexia may co-occur with eye and vision conditions, these conditions are unrelated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat then is dyslexia? Dyslexia is a learning disability. Per the International Dyslexia Association, it is a \u201clanguage problem that refers to a cluster of symptoms that result in people having difficulties with specific language skills, particularly reading.\u201d\n\nWhat does this mean? Caused by a deficiency in the brain\u2019s ability to convert visual or auditory input into comprehensible language, dyslexia impacts reading comprehension and fluency, writing, memory, listening, and executive functioning in the workplace or school.\n\nBesides, dyslexics may struggle with spoken language, even after being exposed to positive language models at home and receiving appropriate language training in school.\n\nThey may have difficulty expressing themselves clearly or fully comprehending what others say. While such language difficulties are difficult to identify, they can cause significant difficulties in education, the workplace, and interpersonal relationships.\n\nHence, the need to adopt tech tools to help them perform better. Last month, we discussed how assistive technology helps people with learning disabilities to unleash their potential.\n\nThis is an excellent time to revisit it: The unique case of Africans with learning disabilities and assistive technology.\n\nMany assistive technologies exist to aid dyslexics with reading, writing, and organising their work or events, but we highlighted four tools that help them succeed academically and professionally. Read it here.\n\nGoogle\u2019s new policy update\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? Google has announced a new policy update on the Android Play Store to support user control, privacy, and security, beginning September 1, 2021.\n\nThe new update prohibits apps focused on \u201ccompensated sexual relationships.\u201d \u201cSugar dating\u201d apps will no longer be allowed on the Android Play Store as part of a series of platform policy changes.\n\nIs the old policy similar? Before announcing the update, Google\u2019s Play Store policies already prohibited apps promoting \u201cservices that could be interpreted as providing sexual acts for a fee.\u201d\n\nHowever, the updated policy includes \u201ccompensated dating or sexual arrangements in which one participant is expected or implied to provide money, gifts, or financial support to another participant.\u201d\n\nWhile Google didn\u2019t announce why the apps are being prohibited on its Store, there has been a significant rise in efforts to prevent sex work in the United States.\n\nSince implementing the FOSTA-SESTA legislation in 2018, the protections granted to online content for the promotion or facilitation of prostitution have been revoked.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, with the new update, Google is providing a Developer Preview of app set ID for critical use cases like analytics and fraud prevention. Also, the search giant is adding new restrictions to its Family Policy which is aimed at children.\n\nIt is also adding a new section to its Enforcement Policy that will allow it to close inactive or abandoned developer accounts after one year of inactivity, among other things.\n\nGoogle claims that with its User Data Policy update, it will be illegal to link persistent device identifiers to personal and sensitive user data or resettable device identifiers unless for pre-approved use cases.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nFacebook Gave Investors 10.4 Billion Reasons To Be Happy\u2014But Its Stock Sank Anyways.

          "text": "The happenings of 2020 in Nigeria were pretty unprecedented, especially with the global pandemic and Endsars protest shaking everyone to dark corners. Although 2021 is starting to go smoothly for most people, others are still trying to grasp at the remains of what we have left, as they remain shaken by their own personal experiences. In cases where words fail, fashion has always been a way of telling inspiring, hopeful and expressive stories.\n\nLike every other collection, the SS/21 collection of Ejiro Amos Tafiri, The Protestant, delves into storytelling that reflects hope, celebration and reconciled diversity. \u201cI will always play my part in using my art to tell stories. This collection is a total documentation of the times we live in,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThe collection displays our thoughts and feelings of uncertainty. It is a celebration of our past,\u201d she goes on to add.\n\nEjiro Amos Tafiri, popularly called E.A.T, is an eponymous womenswear label founded by the very talented Ejiro Amos Tafiri. Her story is an all-time familiar one, especially to folks looking to be a part of the Nigerian fashion industry. From gaining a degree in fashion designing at the prestigious Yaba College of Technology, Lagos, Nigeria, interning with some of Nigeria\u2019s biggest womenswear brands like Tiffany Amber and Zizi Cardow, to attending fashion shows and masterclasses put together by the organizers of Fashion Weeks, E.A.T has set up a really powerful fashion house animated from storytelling and lived experiences. \u201cIt may seem as though fashion isn\u2019t deliberate about documenting our times,\u201d she says.\n\nRead also: KenMoore Fashion to own 15 brand varieties by end of 2021\n\nFor the SS/21 collection, the brand takes us on a journey to the unprecedented experiences of Nigerians in the year 2020, stemming from the corona virus pandemic, to the time young Nigerians took a stand against police brutality in the country, making the #ENDSARS protest a trendy one. This collection, overwhelmed with prints and well-draped breezy fabrics, is an ode to life and survival. The designs were a careful emblem of thoughtfulness and documentation. Unlike the brands\u2019 regular aesthetics filled with colours and lush, this new collection took a deliberate turn at colour selection and grading. \u201cWe were very deliberate with this collection,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to use something too flashy because we understood that people weren\u2019t going out at the time. We also didn\u2019t want to do something too segregated with the times. Hence, we opted for richness, opulence and interests.\u201d\n\nWhat most people wouldn\u2019t know about this collection is that it was meant to mark the celebration of the brands\u2019 10th year anniversary in 2020. However, the pandemic struck and there became a purposeful lockdown in Lagos, Nigeria, which started during the mid-times of March, that year. The collection was also to celebrate powerful women across the world, placing in focus, clients in its three retail hubs in Lagos, Abuja and Portharcourt.\n\nAccording to the official PR statement of the brand;\n\nThe Ejiro Amos Tafiri SS/21 is inspired by the course of the year as the pandemic hits. It reflects hope, celebration, and reconciled diversity.\n\nThe year has been one full of changes, one that forced us to adapt, and one of stimulated growth. It\u2019s one where we look for the future and know that it will only be what we make it.\n\nI was inspired to create a common ground for all by using intimate moments with each outfit, as they highlight the intricate nature of life while representing the tiniest detail of every event.\n\nThe idea was based on nostalgic feelings stemming from the variations of designs. Each outfit takes one on a trip down memory lane, as it hints at details from previous collections.\n\nThe collection is therefore celebrating the milestones and adapting to the ever-changing scope of our world today.\n\nArt Direction: @ms.e.a.t\n\nPhotography: @Emmanueloyeleke & @eopstudios\n\nVideography: @Eddie_maven for EOPstudios.\n\nModels: @Lizz.usen & @Darchie_1\n\nSet Production: Abolore Shobayo of @Jelosimiartcenter\n\nMake-up Artist: @Casskoncept1",

          "title": "The prosumer as a new market force",
          "text": "The prosumer is a consequence of technology. The advancement of technology, especially high-speed internet, has changed the way our world operates.\n\nBankers now keep records in computers rather than keep physical account books; students are learning with the help of the internet and sometimes, without teachers; and with artificial intelligence, production work is done with the least involvement of humans.\n\nRead also: Shoprite\u2019s exit and lessons about Nigerian consumers\n\nThe internet has influenced almost every field of human endeavour. It wiped out many jobs and at the same time, it gave birth to many new ones, including new terms such as influencers, YouTubers, DIY, internet banking and prosumers. These terms have no relevance without the internet.\n\nThe fast-changing technology and dynamism of real-time platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and YouTube have changed how products and services are promoted, viewed and received. It is not out of place to say that it is inevitable for businesses to understand this shift and adapt to it, in order to stay profitable.\n\nTherefore, they need to understand the shifting in power and influence, from consumers to prosumers.\n\nWho is a prosumer?\n\nThe term, prosumer, is an amalgamation of the terms \u2015 producer and consumer. A prosumer can be described as a person who consumes as well as produces a product. The term, prosumer is not a new term.\n\nIt was introduced by futurist Alvin Toffle in 1980. But it has never been relevant as it is today. It has become so important that businesses and marketers cannot ignore it if they want to stay profitable.\n\nEarlier, this term was used for a person who consumes products, as well as produces a product. For example, people who produced electricity by installing solar panels on the roofs of their houses were called prosumers.\n\nBut in the present times, the term, prosumer, has got a completely different meaning. Nowadays, prosumers can also be referred to as \u2018professional consumers\u2019. That means these people not only consume products but also talk about the products on various internet platforms. Their voices play significant roles in the failure or success of a product or business.\n\nIn this digital era, the trend of influencers is very popular and strategic. Influencers are those people who have significant numbers of followers on social media platforms. They share different content such as educational, inspirational, DIY methods, reviews of different products, entertainment-related content on their social media platforms to entertain their followers.\n\nPeople trust these social media figures, as they can relate to them. Therefore, this gives them the power to influence the image of a brand or a product, positively or negatively. These influencers can be artists, sports personalities, bloggers, microbloggers and YouTubers, amongst others.\n\nTherefore, it is necessary for a business not only to learn the importance of these prosumers but also to identify them and build a relationship with them. Today, these prosumers can influence the demand for a product or brand, just as, if not more than, any other traditional method of marketing and advertising.\n\nImpact of prosumers\n\nProsumers not only buy and consume a product but also talk about it to other people. What they speak matters, as a result of which it puts a significant impact on the business of an organization. Therefore, it is crucial for brands to build positive relationships with them.\n\nDifference between consumers and prosumers\n\nThe consumers and prosumers are two entirely different terms. The term prosumer was created by modifying the term consumer. A consumer buys a product and consumes it, and does not have significant power to influence other people.\n\nOn the other hand, a prosumer buys and uses a product and also talk about it to educate others. There are other differences between a consumer and a prosumer.\n\nThe followings are the key differences between a consumer and a prosumer:\n\nA consumer is a person who buys a product and uses it. A prosumer is a person who buys a product, uses it, and spreads the word about it.\n\nA single consumer cannot influence the image of a brand. A single prosumer can influence the image of a brand.\n\nA consumer might have or might not have a considerable number of followers on social media or other internet platforms. A prosumer has an enormous number of followers on social media and other internet platforms.\n\nA consumer only uses a product and makes an opinion about the product, which matters only to him or her A prosumer uses a product and spreads the word about it on social media platforms where a large number of people listen to him or her.\n\nWhether a product will fail or not is not in the hand of one consumer. The future of a product can be affected by a prosumer.\n\nCompanies don\u2019t approach a consumer to talk about their products. Companies approach and even pay prosumers to spread the positive word about their products.\n\nLast line: The face and trend of marketing are constantly changing and today and the future belong to brands that are cutting-edge dynamic to leverage opportunities.",

You recall that I said I am going to probe that contract, but wanted to convince myself that it was not a case of witch-hunt.\n\n\u201cBut just coming here today to see the extent of work done, it\u2019s clear that the contract under the Benin Stormwater Master Plan is not what it is and Edo people need to know how their money was spent: the project has not been completed 10 years after.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing to note is that the job cannot be completed without taking care of the drainage, as water destroys roads.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to subject this to thorough analysis and investigation, to enable us to recover taxpayers\u2019 money wrongfully taken out of our treasury,\u201d he added.\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cAt Evbareke Market, there is supposed to be a road and drainage. But 10 years after, nothing has happened. I promised the people in the area, during my electioneering campaign, that I am going to build the road, but I wanted to make sure that we are not spending money on projects that they have claimed to have completed.\n\n\u201cI am pleased with the pace of work by the contractor. You are standing on very huge underground drainage and it has been covered, as you will not know that there is an extensive drainage under it. They would have gone faster, but for the rain.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Infrastructure, Ferguson Enabulele, said the government plans to achieve about an 8km stretch of the entire length of Ekehuan Road before the end of the year.\n\n...",

          "text": "The Valentine Ozigbo Campaign Organisation has hailed the ruling of the Court of Appeal Abuja Division delivered a few minutes ago in the case of PDP vs Samuel Anyakorah & ORS.\n\nThe appeal was against the judgment of Justice Adeniyi of FCT High Court delivered on the June 9, 2021 wherein the court, against the earlier and subsisting judgment of Honourable Justice Musa of the same FCT High Court, recognised Samuel Anyakorah and his group as the valid executive committee of the party in Anambra state.\n\nThe three man panel of Justices led by Honourable Justice Ada upturned the decision of Justice Adeniyi, for, among other reasons, the lack of territorial jurisdiction to hear and determine a matter which cause of action arose in Anambra State, that is beyond the territorial boundaries of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.\n\n\u201cThis ruling gives us comfort that our party, the PDP is on the side of justice and that justice will prevail in the other matters before the courts with regards to the candidacy of Valentine Ozigbo and the primary conducted by the National Working Committee of our party,\u201d the brief statement signed by Aziza Uko, the Media Advisor of the VCO Campaign Organisation, read.\n\n\u201cValentine Ozigbo is grateful for all the support and encouragement, and goodwill he has received since he won the primary, especially from people of Anambra State, PDP Governors, and the leadership of the party at ward, local government, state and national levels.\n\n\u201cWe are resolute in our resolve to actualise our grand vision to rescue Ndi Anambra from the abysmal All Grand Progressives Alliance (APGA) government come November.\n\n\u201cPDP remains the only platform positioned to take power from APGA and we are confident that soon all litigations will be left in the past and we will march in our quest to deliver positive transformation to the people of Anambra,\u201d the statement ended.\n\nThe PDP in an earlier statement signed by Kola Ologbondiyan, the National Publicity Secretary of the party revealed that this judgement that has just been set aside is the \u201csuperstructure\u201d on which the Justice O. A. Nwabunike judgement pending before the Court of Appeal in Awka Division is based on.\n\nIn the judgement delivered on July 19, 2021, Nwabunike had ruled that Ugochukwu Uba was the governorship candidate of the PDP and had ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to publish the former senator\u2019s name.",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThe Osun State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Sunday Bisi has hailed the ruling of the Osun State High Court, Osogbo which suspended its judgment on the party\u2019s chairmanship tussle till after the Appeal Court in Akure concludes its own ruling, saying that it is a reinforcement of the hope and aspiration of the party to rescue Osun State from its ruinous path.\n\nMr. Bisi stated this in a press briefing shortly after the judgment on Thursday at the party\u2019s secretariat in Osogbo.\n\nHe observed that his acceptance as the bonafide leader of the party in the state can be seen in the tremendous joy expressed by members of the State Working Committee and key leaders who, without any prompting or formal invitation, opted to show unprecedented solidarity in the face of a deliberate attempt by some disgruntled elements in the party to draw it backward\n\nWhile noting that the status quo in the party still stands, Bisi condemned the supporters of the ousted chairman, Olasoji Adagunodo for making themselves pawns in the hands of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state in order to bring about distractions ahead of the coming governorship election in 2022.\n\nHe disclosed that the issue was no more hidden as, according to him, Adagunodo\u2019s supporters have surrendered themselves to the desperate antics of APC in a bid to infiltrate the PDP as the last tread of survival for their collapsing house of fraud.\n\n\u201cThe intended distraction of dragging us to court in the first place is not an option for us. We will not be distracted, we refuse to be distracted,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur practice since I took charge as chairman of this PDP is all about our people and the overriding interest of Osun State. We have so far been able to reshape our party and restore hope.\n\n\u201cWe have traversed the length and breadth of the state to reawake and reenergize structures and another support base for our party. These we will continue to do as the only party next in line to assume the mantle of governance in our state.\n\n\u201cLike I said, the motive behind the present gang up against the party is clear. Their aim is to ambush us and jeopardize our chances at the poll next year. This we want to assure them will not see the light of the day. We will work assiduously in line with our objectives and goals as a people, to strengthen the party and confine Apc to the dustbin of history in our dear state.\n\n\u201cTo our party members and supporters, I want to assure you all, on behalf of my colleagues at the level of the State Working Committee, that nothing has changed. And nothing will change. If there is going to be any change at all, it is our candidate becoming the next governor of Osun come next year.\n\n\u201cThis party under our watch will not succumb to evil machinations of whatever guise, no matter where it is hatched.\u201d\n\nJustice Sikiru Oke of the Osun State High Court, Osogbo had suspended and postponed judgment on the matter till after the Appeal Court in Akure concludes its ruling on the case.",

          "text": "Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Sen. Godswill Akpabio, has appealed to indigenes of host communities at the Eleme and Onne axis of the East-West road in Rivers State, to support ongoing efforts of the government aimed at completing the road project as scheduled.\n\nThe minister made this call during his meeting with Stakeholders and Management of Reynold Construction Company, RCC in his office, on Thursday in Abuja.\n\nAkpabio noted that the Federal Government has not abandoned the road as being insinuated in some quarters, explaining that the ministry has been working with the construction company in charge of the road project and has gotten an assurance that the 338KM project will be delivered by 2022.\n\n\u201cThe road, particularly the Eleme Junction and the Onne Port junction area is in a deplorable state, noting that the road when it was first awarded in 2006, was still in very good shape and was therefore excluded from the original contract, however, 15 years after that section has gone bad.\n\n\u201cWe have had some apotheosis that has come up within the road corridor, which was not in the original plan, for instance, the Ministry of Power has built a major power Sub-Station by the Eleme junction, and a lot of other structures have also come on board while a section of the bridge at Aleto also collapsed due to erosion at the embayment of the bridge and due to these unforeseen circumstances a section of the road was to be redesigned to preserve the sub-station which is germane to the sustenance of economic activities within the region,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe added that the government has released N2.5bn to RCC as part of outstanding payment and also made available N1.17bn to enable the payment of compensation to property owners affected in the road construction.\n\nThe minister further disclosed that due to the volume of traffic on the road, it has become imperative that the road be expanded to six lanes, with additional flyovers. These, according to him, were not captured in the initial contract and design.\n\nIn the aspect of funding, Akpabio hinted that the ministry had to suspend funding over 300 projects to enable it to cater for the East-West road, adding that the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, has also budgeted N35bn towards the completion of the road, while the Ministry of Finance has also earmarked funds to be committed to the same project.\n\nEarlier, the Managing Director of RCC, Engr. Nader Yusuf noted that the main issue in the Eleme Junction is in the delay of compensation to the indigenes that have properties on that axis of the road. He advised that once relevant funds are made available, payment of compensation would commence immediately.",

Wilson Ayakpo Dauyegha, the host community congratulated the new owners of the OML 46 and urged them to, as a matter of urgency commence operation to assuage the anger of the people occasioned by the long years of deprivation and injustice meted by the former operator.\n\nThe community noted that the people of Ekeremor constituency 2 and other host communities have been short-changed since the discovery of the Atala Oil Field, and yet did not resort to hostility because they were hopeful of better things to come.\n\nThe group said the unproductiveness of the Atala Oil field since its discovery in 1982 and its subsequent award of exploration license in 2003 has been a thing of dwindling hope as it has been decades of hopeful waiting, owing to the fact that the BOCL failed to deliver on her responsibilities and as such we have lost trust in her.\n\nThey warned that the operating company should no longer delay in the commencement of operation because the patience of the people of Ekeremor constituency 2 is running out as time wasted is resultant of wasted opportunities and further deprivation for them.\n\nThey noted that the recent calls for cancellation of the license to a new oil exploration company by the Bayelsa State Government and the IYC is not only insensitive, unnecessary, irresponsible but will only incite unrest amongst the host communities who have been patient for so long.\n\nThis they said will ultimately lead to further delay and more unproductive years which will ultimately succeed in further short-changing us of the long anticipated dividends.\n\nThey posited that the Bayelsa State Government should as a matter of urgency congratulate the newly licensed exploration company and avail them the enabling environment to thrive, as her current position is also misleading.\n\nThe host communities further advised the Ijaw Youth Council, IYC to remain apolitical in matters of such, as it negatively affects its reputation and motive as a pressure group for development.\n\nRather it depicts the Youth Body as a tool of government, as all through the years of its unproductiveness, the youth body never thought it necessary to urge the previous owners to do the needful as the host communities were at the losing end of it.\n\nThe group however applauded the Federal Government for doing the needful by awarding the Atala Oil Field to indigenous oil Exploration Company, the group said any other decision would have been perceived as utter neglect towards the interest of the host communities.",

To this end, we will continue to epitomize best human resource management practices to promote our operational effectiveness,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, the Air Secretary, Air Vice Marshal Mahmud Madi said the timing for the conference was apt, considering the strategic importance of the human resource in achieving organizational goals and objectives.\n\nHe added that the NAF has invested hugely in human capacity development and personnel welfare in recent years which has translated to tangible gains in NAF operational conducts.\n\nThe Chief of Medical Services, Air Commodore Olabode Babalola revealed the desire of the CAS to ensure that the NAF Medical Services measure up to the global best practice.\n\nHe said the CAS approval of the Medical Conference is a further attestation of his willingness to improve healthcare delivery in the NAF.",

          "title": "\u2018War Has Changed\u2019: US Calls for New Response to Delta Variant",
          "text": "The war against COVID-19 has changed because of the highly contagious Delta variant, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said, proposing a clearer message, mandatory vaccines for health workers and a return to universal masking.\n\nAn internal CDC document said the variant, first detected in India and now dominant across the globe, is as contagious as chickenpox and far more contagious than the common cold or flu. It can be passed on even by vaccinated people, and may cause more serious disease than earlier coronavirus strains. The document, entitled \u201cImproving communications around vaccine breakthrough and vaccine effectiveness\u201d, said the variant required a new approach to help the public understand the danger \u2013 including making clear that unvaccinated people were more than 10 times more likely than those who are vaccinated to become seriously ill or die. \u201cAcknowledge the war has changed,\u201d it said. \u201cImprove communications around individual risk among vaccinated.\u201d Recommended preventative measures included making vaccines mandatory for health care professionals to protect the vulnerable and a return to universal wearing of face masks.\n\nThe CDC confirmed the authenticity of the document, which was first reported by the Washington Post. While vaccinated people were less likely to become infected, once they contracted such \u201cbreakthrough infections\u201d from Delta \u2013 unlike the case with earlier variants \u2013 they might now be just as likely as the unvaccinated to pass the disease on to others. \u201cHigh viral loads suggest an increased risk of transmission and raised concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with Delta can transmit the virus,\u201d CDC head Rochelle Walensky said in a statement.\n\nOn Friday the CDC released data from a study of an outbreak in Massachusetts in which it said three quarters of those infected had been fully vaccinated. That study played a pivotal roll in a CDC decision this week to again recommend that vaccinated people wear masks in some situations, Walensky said.\n\nThe CDC has said that as of July 26, 6,587 people have experienced breakthrough COVID-19 infections after being fully vaccinated and were hospitalized or have died. It stopped reporting on mild infections this spring but in the report, it estimated that there were about 35,000 symptomatic infections each week in the United States. In parts of the world where large numbers of people have yet to be vaccinated, the Delta variant has led once again to surging death rates and hospitalisations. The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said health systems in many countries were now being overwhelmed: \u201cHard-won gains are in jeopardy or being lost,\u201d he told a news conference. The global health body\u2019s top emergency expert Mike Ryan told reporters that vaccines were nevertheless still effective at preventing serious illness and death: \u201cWe are fighting the same virus but a virus that has become fitter.\u201d Even in rich countries that were among the first to roll out vaccination campaigns, cases have surged. While vaccines have so far kept death rates lower, large populations remain vulnerable, especially those who refuse vaccines, a particular problem in parts of the United States where voters supported former President Donald Trump. Trump is the only living president not to have participated in public service campaigns encouraging people to take the vaccine. Nearly a third of U.S. adults have yet to get a first shot. Areas where vaccination rates are low have seen sharp rises in cases in recent weeks, and authorities fear hospitalisations and deaths are not far behind. The top U.S. infectious diseases specialist, Dr Anthony Fauci, told Reuters he expected that vaccines, which so far have received only emergency approval, could begin getting full regulatory approval in August, and that this could help persuade more people to get vaccinated. In Britain, where the Delta variant caused a sharp surge in infections in recent months despite one of the world\u2019s fastest inoculation campaigns, a panel advising the government said protection from vaccines was likely to wane over time, meaning vaccination campaigns would probably last for years. On Tuesday, the CDC, which had advised vaccinated Americans months ago that they no longer needed to wear masks, reversed course, saying even the fully vaccinated should wear face coverings in situations where the virus was likely to spread. On Thursday, U.S. President Joe Biden urged local governments to pay people to get vaccinated and set new rules requiring federal workers to provide proof of vaccination or face regular testing, mask mandates and travel restrictions. \u201cThe main thing that does change (because of Delta) is that masks will still be used and that in countries where this requirement has been lifted, it will have to be re-introduced,\u201d said Carlo Federico Perno, head of microbiology and immunology diagnostics at Rome\u2019s Bambino Ges\u00f9 Hospital. ASIAN COUNTRIES TIGHTEN RESTRICTIONS Countries in Asia, many of which avoided the worst outcomes that hit Western nations in 2020, have been particularly hard hit in recent weeks. Several announced new restrictions on Friday. From Monday, army personnel will help police Australia\u2019s biggest city Sydney, checking that people who have tested positive are isolating.",

It said no other injuries had been reported.\n\nThe company added that the vessel was now \u201csailing under the control of her crew\u201d and heading to a safe location with a US naval escort.\n\nAnalysis box by Frank Gardner, security correspondent\n\nThe undeclared \u201cshadow war\u201d between Israel and Iran appears to be hotting up.\n\nThere have been several attacks in recent months on both Israeli and Iranian-operated vessels, with both countries trading accusations and denials.\n\nBut this attack marks a significant escalation with its human casualties.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapad called for a tough response and said he was in consultation with his British counterpart Dominic Raab, and that the issue would be taken to the UN.\n\nAn Iranian Arabic-language television station quoted unnamed sources saying the attack was revenge for an alleged Israeli attack on an airport in Syria, an ally of Iran\u2019s.\n\nAn unnamed Israeli official said it would be hard for Israel to turn a blind eye to the attack.\n\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) naval authority said it was investigating the incident, which occurred near the Omani island of Masirah, and confirmed that \u201ccoalition forces\u201d were assisting the vessel.\n\nThe US state department said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d by the reports and was \u201cmonitoring the situation closely\u201d.\n\nThe tanker had been travelling in the northern Indian Ocean to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.\n\nAccording to Zodiac Maritime, it had no cargo on board at the time of the incident.\n\nA number of previous incidents have been reported on both Israeli and Iranian-owned ships in the area. Vessels have been damaged in these incidents, but casualties are rare.",

          "text": "Rattled by last Wednesday\u2019s minority judgement of the Supreme Court on the Ondo State governorship election, which punched holes in the legality of the actions of its National Caretaker Committee\u2019s Chairman, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, members of the All Progressives Congress\u2019 Caretaker Committee yesterday scampered to the Minister of Justice/Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, for advice on whether to go ahead with today\u2019s ward congresses.\n\nOn the same day, a chieftain of the APC from Abia State, Kalu Agu, asked a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) for an order of perpetual injunction restraining the APC from going ahead with its ward congresses today, as well as subsequent local governments, states, zonal congresses, and the party\u2019s National Convention.\n\nAs for Buni, sources said he was also distressed by the Supreme Court indictment, and \u201che is seriously weighing his options about either staying as party Chair or returning to his job as Yobe State governor.\u201d\n\nAnother source said the decision to consult Malami on the issue was in conformity with the directives of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nOf course, Malami, after an elaborate analysis, cleared the Caretaker Committee to proceed with the ward congresses, assuring that Buni\u2019s continued stay as Chair would not portend any crisis for the party.\n\nThe sources said Malami told the caretaker members that the Supreme Court judgement did not render the committee illegal and that it still \u201chas legal capacity to undertake any action on behalf and in the name of the party.\u201d\n\nMalami said further that the judgement did not question the legality of all the actions taken by the Buni-committee since inception.\n\nA member of Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Prof. Mamman Tahir, who confirmed this development, while addressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja, said Malami assured that Buni\u2019s stay was legal, and would not turn the congresses into a nullity.\n\nTahir stated: \u201cI am here this afternoon to reconfirm that our Congresses are on course to hold tomorrow (Saturday) and this Committee is working closely with the Attorney-General of the Federation and he has offered advice that we are on good ground and we are comfortable with that position.\n\n\u201cSo, our programmes will continue to roll on in the normal course of things. We want to assure teeming members of the APC across the country to come out and elect officers at the ward levels. This party believes so much in grassroots politics, grassroots democracy; that is the strength of the party.\n\n\u201cI call on all members to come out tomorrow and elect leaders of their choice at the Ward level before the party moves to the next stage of the democratisation process.\u201d\n\nAsked if Congresses will hold in Zamfara and Anambra, Tahir said: \u201cAnother date is being fixed for those states because we have an election coming up in Anambra. We don\u2019t want to jeopardise our position there. Though in Zamfara, only recently, they are still doing their validation and continuation of membership registration. So that is the position.\u201d\n\nThe National Secretary of APC\u2019s CECPC, John Akpanudoedehe, also buoyed by Malami\u2019s assurances, issued a statement Firday, saying Saturday\u2019s ward congresses would go ahead as planned.\n\nAkpanudoedehe warned that any parallel congress, parallel party organ and or parallel party office would not be tolerated by the national leadership of the party ahead of the ward congresses.\n\nIn a notice to party members, he said the APC would deploy the full weight of the law as stipulated in Section 21(D) of the party\u2019s Constitution on any one who engaged in such act.\n\nIn the notice, the party said it was important that the attention of all party faithful be drawn to the resolution of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of 8th December, 2020, which subsists and extends to the conduct of party members during the congresses.\n\nThe APC re-stated that all pending litigations instituted by members against the party should be withdrawn forthwith, \u201cand going forward, no member should institute matters against the party, without exhausting the internal mechanism for conflict resolution, as enshrined in the party\u2019s constitution.\u201d\n\nThe ruling party said as a result of the above, party members should note that all activities that may be carried out by persons to put the party and its officers in bad light, before, during and after the congresses should be jettisoned.\n\nIt added: \u201cAll activities or processes congresses and thereafter which do not have the approval of the CECPC are exercises in futility. This is to say that: any purported; parallel congress, parallel party organ and or parallel party office, is to say the least a nullity. These divisive activities will not be tolerated.\n\nIn its split judgment of four against three by the seven member-panel, which sat on the Ondo governorship election petition, the Supreme Court had contended that the reason it did not sack Governor Akeredolu, was because the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its governorship candidate in the October 10, 2020 election, Eyitayo Jegede, failed to join Buni in the suit, even when the issues revolved around him.\n\nAlthough Justice Mary Odili, in a dissenting minority verdict, upheld Jegede\u2019s appeal that the nomination of Akeredolu, which was signed by Buni, was not valid under Section 183 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nAfter the judgement, the Minister of State for Labour, Festus Keyamo, was the first to advise the APC to halt all preparations and conduct of congresses nationwide forthwith, having analysed the implications of the judgment.\n\nSaid Keyamo: \u201cThe planned congresses across the country slated for this weekend must immediately be suspended, because it will be an exercise in futility as analysed above. The competence of Governor Buni to organise the congresses has been called to question by the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Buni, has enjoined party stakeholders and members to conduct the exercise peacefully.\n\nBuni, in a statement issued yesterday called on officials conducting the Congress to be fair and objective to all candidates contesting the election.\n\nThe chairman warned that the party would not hesitate to take decisive measures against anyone who deliberately sabotage the Congress.\n\nHe noted that adequate arrangements had been made by the party to conduct successful and acceptable congresses across the country.\n\nBuni said: \u201cAs stakeholders of the party, we have great responsibility to make the ward Congress in all the participating states successful. We should endeavour to place the party and members\u2019 interests above personal interests.\n\n\u201cWe have come a long way repositioning the party, we have reconciled many groups and individuals, we must not allow personal interests in this election to divide us and draw us back.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman also charged aggrieved members to channel their grievances to the appropriate quarters at the party secretariat.\n\nAdedayo Akinwale and Alex Enumah in Abuja",
