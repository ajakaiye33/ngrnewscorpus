          "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nABUJA\u2014IN a bid to find a lasting solution to the incessant clashes between farmers and herders, the joint climate change bill review committee and the legal working group yesterday met to fast track the passage of the Bill on Climate Change aimed at ending the clashes.\n\nThe joint team was from the National Assembly and the Ministries of Justice and Environment.\n\n\n\nREAD ALSO: $3m bribery: Court sentences ex-Rep Farouk Lawan to 7 years imprisonment\n\nSpeaking to journalists, Chairman of the House of Representatives ad-hoc committee on Climate Change, Rep Samuel Onuigbo, said climate change has significantly contributed to the raging problem of insecurity faced in the country.\n\nOnuigbo, who represents Ikwuano/Umuahia North and South Federal Constituency of Abia State, was Chairman of the House Committee on Climate Change in the 8th Assembly and had sponsored the bill on Climate Change in 2016 but it was not assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari after it was passed into law.\n\nThe lawmaker noted that climate change was responsible for farmers/herders clashes, banditry, kidnappings and insurgency among others.\n\nHe said climate change has devastated a lot of areas where people used to graze their cattle up north across the Sahel region and as a result, a lot of these herders are now pushing down south, where they can find vegetation for grazing.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cConsequently as they moved down from the northern part of the country, they now come to areas where people farm in their farmland and they start clashing with those people because it is a confrontation arising from those who want their cattle to graze and then this is somebody\u2019s farm that he has spent time and money to really prepare and within a minute the whole thing is gone.\n\n\u201cSo the farmer would react. And we want a situation where we still have the grazing areas up north, where the herders can graze their cattle and do their farming.\n\n\u201cDo not forget that even Lake Chad that previously provided means of livelihood for over 30 million people has almost dried up. From what used to be over 25, 000 square miles to just about 2500 square miles.\n\n\u201cSo those who were doing farming there are no longer having areas to farm. Those who were doing animal husbandry around there no longer have areas to do that. And these who were doing fishing they don\u2019t have somewhere to fish. So these individuals have poured into the cities and the outcome that you have is serious crisis insurgency and even the serious problem of Boko Haram.\u201d\n\nHe said a law on climate change will help the government to focus efforts and resources in a coordinated manner to address these challenges.\n\nHe said, \u201cThat is why this bill is important. We have called this meeting to be able to work together and look at the bill which I sponsored which by the special grace of God is almost moving to the committee of the whole.\n\n\u201cWe have taken in ideas from different critical segments of the society and the meeting we are having here today was authorized by the Speaker of the House of Representatives who appointed me the chairman to coordinate the review of the climate change bill.\n\n\u201cWe have worked on this bill extensively and like I said it has gone through first and second reading and about to be committed to the committee of the whole. But what we have done is to review the bill and make sure that the areas that were raised as challenges or gray areas are adequately addressed so that when the bill is finally passed by the House and the Senate and eventually transmitted to the President for his assent, those gray areas would no longer constitute a problem.\n\n\u201cWe want the bill to get easy assent. This bill is important as we all know. We know the impact of climate change on Nigeria in particular and its contribution to some of the challenges we are having security wise like clashes of farmers and herders.\n\n\u201cMore than that we have seen the pollution around the country, particularly in areas where oil is being produced. We also experience issues with coastal erosion, gully erosion, desertification and flood.\n\n\u201cThese are issues that we are sure that by the end of the day once this bill is assented to, there would be addressed adequately because right now we are not addressing them in the most coordinated manner,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "NPC, NBC amendment bills draconian, anti-free press \u2014 Guild of Editors",
          "text": "\n\n\n\nBy Soni Daniel\n\nThe Nigerian Guild of Editors, NGE, has rejected the bid by a member of the House of Representatives, Odebunmi Olusegun, to amend the law establishing the Nigerian Press Council, NPC, and the National Broadcasting Commission, NBC, saying the envisaged amendments would kill free press in Nigeria and render journalists captives in the land.\n\n\n\nThe Guild in a statement signed by the President, Mr. Mustapha Isah and General Secretary, Iyobosa Uwugiaren, yesterday, described both the NPO and NBC amendment bills as draconian, given the provisions inserted into them by the sponsor of the bills Odebunmi Olusegun, a member of the House of Representatives from Oyo State, who is neither a journalist nor a social scientist.\n\n\n\nThe Guild argued that while the sponsors of the bills claim that the amendments were geared towards moderating the \u2018recklessness of the media, the bills are actually criminalising journalism practice in Nigeria.\n\nThe body of editors argued that the media, which serve as the \u2018oxygen of democracy\u2019 would be strangulated if the bills are passed into law.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019At a time there is a popular ongoing global conversation about the need for a #NewDealForJournalism\u201d \u2013 for immediate and sustained action from, and collaboration between governments and other influential actors to improve the policy, funding, and enabling environment for independent professional journalism, we see the proposed laws as unhelpful.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019While we are not opposed to an Act that will promote media stakeholders-driven regulatory council, the many draconian provisions in the Odebunmi Olusegun\u2019s sponsored bills are actually aimed at criminalising media practice in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nWhile the intention of the sponsor of the bills is suspicious, the bills negate all known features of media regulatory bodies in the world,\u2019\u2019 the Guild said.\n\n\n\nIt contended that while the NPC Act. CAP N128, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 1992, created by the military dictatorship gave the Council board full responsibility to administer the council, the proposed Act restricts the council board to \u2018\u2019advisory capacity on a part-time basis without direct interference in the day to day administration of the council\u201d, and gives the Executive Secretary all the powers.\n\n\n\nThe Guild stated further: \u2018\u2019While the proposed NPC Act says the Board shall consist of one representative each from the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ); Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE); Newspapers Proprietors Association of Nigeria (NPAN); Broadcasting Organisation of Nigeria (BON); Ministry of Information; two representative of the general public, one of whom shall be a legal practitioner and a woman and Executive Secretary of the council, who shall serve as the secretary to the Board, the board is a mere advisory body.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019The Bill also says that the Chairman of the Board shall be appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Minister in charge of Information. And that all other members of the Board shall be appointed by the President on the recommendation by the Minister of Information. The intention of this kind of Council is suspicious.\u2019\u2019\n\n\n\nThe body of editors is of the view that the professional body doesn\u2019t need the approval of the Minister of Information to establish and disseminate a National Press Code and standards to guide the conduct of print media, related media houses and media practitioners and approves penalties and fines against violation of the press code, as provided for in the bill.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019The Guild is not aware of any media regulatory council in the world, which says media regulatory council shall establish a National Press and Ethical Code of Conduct for media houses and media practitioners, which shall come into effect and be disseminated after approval by the Minister of Information, and that the code shall be binding on every media houses and journalists.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019Again, apart from the fines for journalists or media houses that violate the Act, the bill also says that in an extreme case, the council shall order the striking out of the name of the journalist from the register; and suspend the person from practice by ordering him not to engage in practice as a journalist for a period not exceeding six months; as may be specified in the directive.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019This kind of media regulatory council will neither serve the interest of the media industry, strengthen its constitutional role \u2013 of holding public officers accountable to the people nor serve the general interest of the public-who are the original trustees of the media,\u201d the Guild explained.\n\n\n\nThe NGE noted that in the proposed NPC legislation, the sponsor mischievously smuggled in the controversial \u2018\u2019fake news\u201d provision, stating that any person who carried news established to be fake thereafter, committed an offence and was liable on conviction to a fine of N5million or a term of two-year imprisonment or both, as well as a compensation of N2million payable to the person(s), group(s), corporate bodies, government or any of its agencies whom the news was carried against.\n\n\n\nAccording to the NGE, the bill also states that any print media house whose medium is used to carry such news is liable on conviction to a fine of N10million or closure of such media house for a period of one year or both and compensation of N20million to the person, group, corporate body, government or any of its agencies, whom the news was carried against.\n\n\n\nOn the proposed NBC amendment legislation, the Guild said Section 23 of the bill which gave the Minister of information powers to participate in the making of regulations, was unhelpful, saying the participation of the minister will turn NBC into a tool for political interference.\n\n\n\nThe Guild noted that the provisions of the two bills gave the impression that the Federal Government was out to crush its enemy, insisting that the media was not an enemy of the state.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\n\n\u2014Inaugurates steering committee\n\nBy Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nPRESIDENT Muhammadu Buhari Tuesday approved the setting up of a private equity fund known as the Nigeria Investment and Growth Fund (NIG-Fund), to lead in resource mobilization drive and management for the poverty reduction initiative of his administration in a sustainable manner.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Steering Committee (NSC) of the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy (NPRGS) was inaugurated at the presidential villa, Abuja.\n\nWhile inaugurating the committee to be chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, the President reiterated his commitment to lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in ten years, with a well-researched framework for implementation and funding.\n\nHe said that the NPRGS had already proposed the establishment of a private equity fund, the NIG-Fund, to lead resource mobilization drive and also manage the resources in a sustainable manner.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThis journey began in January, 2021 when I directed the Chairman of the Presidential Economic Advisory Council and Secretary to the Government of the Federation to collaboratively work together to articulate what that will lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in ten (10) years.\n\n\u201cI am happy to note that the process of designing this inclusive poverty reduction strategy recognized and addressed past mistakes as well as laying the foundation for a sustainable poverty reduction through the wide range consultations held at all levels of government, development partners, the private sector as well as the civil society,.\u201d\n\nThe President added that the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy would address the underlying causes of poverty on the basis of which it developed programmes that would deal with the multi-dimensional nature of poverty within the practical context of comparative advantage of human and natural resources in the various geo-political zones.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe major challenge before this National Steering Committee is to translate our good intention into positive impact of the average Nigerian so that we create an appreciative impact on the poverty situation in our country.\n\n\u201cIf India can lift 271 million people out of poverty between 2006 and 2016, Nigeria can surely lift 100million out of poverty in 10 years. Fortunately, we have already started but we need to unlock the challenges of slow implementation, inappropriate targeting and absence of adequate resources.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari listed the responsibilities of the steering committee to include: anchor collaborative efforts; provide oversight for the implementation of the strategy; provide guidance to Technical Working Group and Federal Ministries, Extra Ministerial Departments and Agencies, subnational governments and other stakeholders on meeting the objectives of the programme as well as monitoring progress and any other effort that would enhance attainment of the objective of lifting 100 million people out of poverty in 10 years.\n\n\u201cThe performance of our economy despite COVID-19 gives me comfort that we can achieve our goal but we need to seriously scale up and work more with state and local governments.\n\n\u201cThis call becomes more pertinent in the face of recent forecasts by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and our own Nigerian Economic Summit Group which all agreed that Nigeria needs to frontally tackle her poverty situation if our economic gains are to be sustained,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Buhari said the National Steering Committee of Nigeria\u2019s NPRGS also include Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Chief of Staff to Mr. President, Governor of Ekiti State (South West), Governor of Delta State (South South), Governor of Sokoto State (North West), Governor of Borno State (North East), Governor of Nasarawa State (North Central) and Governor of Ebonyi State (South East).\n\nOther members of the committee are: Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Minister of Industry, Trade and Investments, Minister of Labour and Employment, Minister of Education and Minister of Health.\n\nBuhari charged the committee to commence work immediately so that the Technical Working Group would also begin putting the nuts and bolts together.\n\nHe added: \u201cYou may, therefore, wish to consider providing immediate guidance to the TWG on the following, establishment of the NIG-Fund leveraging on the Development Finance Assessment Report, public and private sector funding; harmonise existing human capital development; scale up existing Poverty Reduction Initiatives such as the Social Investment Programmes, various agricultural support initiatives as well as support to Micro-Small and Medium Enterprises; and leverage on existing development partner support programmes and projects with potentials for quick-wins e.g the Nigeria COVID-19 Action Recovery and Economic Stimulus.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President said the responsibilities were onerous, but expressed confidence that the committee will be able to lay the foundation and demonstrate, within the next two years, the practicality of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in or under 10 years.\n\n\u201cAs you all know funding will always be a challenge especially in these times when resources are limited. The NPRGS has, thus, proposed the establishment of a private equity fund, the Nigeria Investment and Growth Fund (NIG-Fund), to lead our resource mobilization drive and also manage the resources in a sustainable manner,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nIn his remarks, the Chairman of the committee, Vice President Osinbajo said the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy would consolidate other efforts of the government to reduce poverty which include N-Power, school feeding and conditional cash transfer.\n\nThe Vice President noted that the President\u2019s position that local governments, states and the federal government should work jointly to alleviate poverty in the country will be properly reflected in the framework and implementation, stressing the need for access and inclusivity.\n\nThe SGF said the poverty situation in the country assumed an enormous proportion, with an increasing population, adding that the situation was compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe said the administration responded to the COVID-19 poverty fallout swiftly and was able to ameliorate the situation, and also ensured a quick exit from recession.\n\nOn hand to witness the inauguration were Governors Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti), Abdulahi Sule (Nasarawa) as well as representatives of the governors of Ebonyi and Borno states.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has assured that his administration would continue to give priority to security and welfare.\n\nHe also promised to bequeath a citizens-led policing system to the nation.\n\nSpeaking at the passing out ceremony of the third regular cadet course of the Nigeria Police Academy, Wudil, Kano, the president said security was paramount for the nation to move forward.\n\nA statement by Femi Adesina quoted Buhari as saying the police reform initiative embarked upon by his administration had focused on improving the welfare of the force, recruitment of 10,000 junior police officers annually, investing in the upgrade of facilities at the Nigeria Police Academy and other police training institutions in the country, among others.\n\n\u201cIn addition, a Nigeria Police Academy (Establishment) Bill is currently receiving legislative attention at the National Assembly. On passage, the Bill will give full legal backing to the existence and academic programmes of the Nigeria Police Academy and fully legitimise its status as a Police University.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, as part of our police reform initiatives, the Police Public Complaint Committee (PPCC), which is domiciled in the Ministry of Police Affairs, has been resuscitated with the mandate to receive complaints from the public on cases of abuse and maltreatment by police officers.\n\n\u201cThe PPCC has a membership made up of officials from relevant Minitries; Departments; Agencies and security agencies.\n\n\u201cA public private partnership arrangement undertaken by the Ministry of Police Affairs to rejuvenate the National Public Security Communication System Network has been approved by the federal executive council.\n\n\u201cThis is with a view to ensuring that when fully reactivated the police and other security agencies will be able to fully utilise this vital facility,\u201d he said.\n\nHe highlighted well thought-out reform programmes by his administration to modernise and reposition the Nigeria Police to meet the aspirations of the citizens, as well as to manage current and evolving threats in the most efficient and professional manner.\n\n\u201cWe re-established the Ministry of Police Affairs out of the former Ministry of Interior in 2019. This is with the intention to drive the police reform process by initiating, formulating, and implementing policies and programmes relating to policing and internal security.\n\n\u201cThis initiative was also intended to provide supervision and administrative support to the force, particularly, in the area of training and capacity development as well as the enhancement of the budgetary profile of the Nigeria Police.\n\n\u201cIn order to address the funding challenges of the force, I also assented to the Nigeria Police Trust Fund Bill on June 24, 2019 and followed up with the inauguration of the Board of Trustees to ensure immediate take off of the fund.\n\n\u201cI am being constantly briefed by the Minister of Police Affairs on the activities of the Trust Fund and I am delighted to note that already, critical operational items including purpose-built operational vehicles and other policing assets are currently being delivered through the intervention of the Trust Fund.\n\n\u201cI am confident that with the sustained intervention of the Trust Fund, the operational efficiency and human capacity development goals of the Nigeria Police will be attained on a sustainable basis and by extension, our internal security order will be enhanced in due course,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president recounted that on September 15, 2020, he assented to the Nigeria Police Bill which had been under legislative actions since 2014.\n\n\u201cThe Act replaces the repealed Nigeria Police Act that had been in existence for over 77 years, and which had become an archaic legal instrument and a fundamental clog in the wheels of modern policing.\n\n\u201cThe new Nigeria Police Act contains fundamental provisions which are positively altering the policing narrative in Nigeria as it has given legal backing to the principle of community policing and addressed vital issues that have historically been inhibiting seamless police administration.\n\n\u201cWith the Nigeria Police Act, 2020, the nation has been given a unique legal instrument that will modernise police operations and position the Nigeria Police towards the attainment of its 21st Century Policing Mandate.\u201d\n\nThe president also urged the newly commissioned 418 Cadet Officers, who are now Assistant Superintendents of Police, to be guided by the fact that their conduct on the field will be constantly scrutinised and they would be held personally accountable for their actions.\n\n\u201cYou should remain good ambassadors of the Nigeria Police and demonstrate respect to civil society in discharging your duties, while also maintaining zero tolerance for corruption.\u201d",

Attacks by political elite on the media, which may have prompted the NPC amendment Bill and the NBC amendment Bill, are habitually not envisioned to win an argument on the values of journalism, but designed to intimidate media organisations,\u201d the Guild said.\n\nIn a statement signed by Mustapha Isah (President) and Iyobosa Uwugiaren (General Secretary) on Tuesday, the NGE said the federal government is trying to remove the \u2018\u2019oxygen of democracy\u2019\u2019 by attempting to strangulate the media with laws which are against the tenets of democracy.\n\nAccording to the Guild, the \u2018\u2019draconian provisions\u2019\u2019 in the NPC amendment Bill and the NBC Act amendment put a lie to the sponsors\u2019 claim that they are aimed at moderating the \u2018\u2019recklessness\u2019\u2019 of the media, insisting that it was \u201ca clear move to criminalise journalism practice in the country.\n\nThe Guild said: \u201cAt a time there is a popular ongoing global conversation about the need for a #NewDealForJournalism \u2013 for immediate and sustained action from, and collaboration between government and other influential actors to improve policy, funding and enabling environment for independent professional journalism, the proposed legislations will be unhelpful.\u201d\n\nThe umbrella body of Nigerian editors said while it is not opposed to any law that will promote media stakeholders\u2019 driven regulatory council, the many harsh and anti- democracy provisions in the Hon. Odebunmi Olusegun sponsored NPC amendment Bill are actually aimed at criminalising media practice in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSaying that the NPC Act amendment Bill and NBC Act amendment Bill negate all known features of media regulatory bodies in the world, the Guild said \u201cwhile the NPC Act. CAP N128, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 1992, created by the military dictatorship, gives the Council Board full responsibility to administer the council, the proposed amendment Bill reduced the council board to \u2018advisory capacity\u2019 on a part-time basis and gives the Executive Secretary all the powers.\u201d\n\nOutlining the faults in the NPC Act amemdment Bill, the Guild said although the Bill provides for a Board consisting of one representative each from the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), Newspapers Proprietors Association of Nigeria (NPAN), Broadcasting Organisation of Nigeria (BON), Ministry of Information; two representatives of the general public, one of whom shall be a legal practitioner and a woman and Executive Secretary of the council, who shall serve as the secretary to the Board, it still makes the board a mere advisory body.\u201d\n\nIt described as suspicious the provision in the Bill for the Chairman of the Board to be appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Minister in charge of Information as well as all other members of the Board being appointed by the President on the recommendation by the Minister of Information, saying such set up makes the board an organ of government.\n\nThe Guild said: \u201cThe professional body doen\u2019t need the approval of the Minister of Information to establish and disseminate a National Press Code and standards to guide the conduct of print media, related media houses and media practitioners and approves penalties and fines against violation of the press code, as provided for in the Bill.\n\n\u201cWe are not aware of any media regulatory council in the world, which says that media regulatory council shall establish a National Press and Ethical Code of Conduct for media houses and media practitioners, which shall come into effect and be inaugurated after approval by the Minister of Information, and that the code shall be binding on every media houses and journalists.\n\n\u201cWe reject the provisions that apart from the fines for journalists or media houses that violate the Act, the council shall order the striking out of the name of the journalist from the register; and suspend the person from practice by ordering him not to engage in practice as a journalist for a period not exceeding six months.\n\n\u201cThis kind of media regulatory council will neither serve the interest of the media industry, strengthen its constitutional role \u2013 of holding public officers accountable nor serves the general interest of the public \u2013 the original trustees of the media.\u201d\n\nThe NGE noted that in the proposed NPC Act amendment Bill the \u201csponsor mischievously smuggled in the controversial \u2018fake news\u2019 provision by stating that any person who carries news established to be fake thereafter, commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine of N5 million or a term of two-year imprisonment or both, and a compensation of N2million payable to the person(s), group(s), corporate bodies, government or any of its agencies who the news was carried against. Who determines what is fake news?\u201d\n\nIt described as absured the provision that any print media house whose medium was used to carry such news is liable on conviction to a fine of N10million or closure of such media house for a period of one year or both and compensation of N20 million to the person, group, corporate body, government or any of its agencies, whom the news was carried against, saying \u201cthis is a ticket for the government to stifles the media and close those they perceive as critical.\u201d",
          "summary": "Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE) has rejected the proposed National Press Council (NPC) Act Amendment Bill before the House of Representatives and the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) Act amendment Bill, describing them as draconian and an orchestrated move to stifle the press.\n\u201cThe media is not an enemy of the Federal Government and should not be seen as such by agents of government.\nAttacks by political elite on the media, which may have prompted the NPC amendment Bill and the NBC amendment Bill, are habitually not envisioned to win an argument on the values of journalism, but designed to intimidate media organisations,\u201d the Guild said.\nOdebunmi Olusegun sponsored NPC amendment Bill are actually aimed at criminalising media practice in Nigeria.\u201dSaying that the NPC Act amendment Bill and NBC Act amendment Bill negate all known features of media regulatory bodies in the world, the Guild said \u201cwhile the NPC Act.\n\u201cWe are not aware of any media regulatory council in the world, which says that media regulatory council shall establish a National Press and Ethical Code of Conduct for media houses and media practitioners, which shall come into effect and be inaugurated after approval by the Minister of Information, and that the code shall be binding on every media houses and journalists.",

          "text": "\u201cPeople order drugs on Jumia?\u201d\n\nThat was the reaction from the most ardent online shopper I know. She buys running shoes, mom jeans and hair products but doesn\u2019t understand why anyone would buy drugs online. It just doesn\u2019t feel right for her to buy ingestible medicines on the same website she shops for underwear.\n\nBut a search under Jumia\u2019s \u2018medications & treatments\u2019 tab reveals syrups, nasal sprays, and pain relief capsules. At the bottom of their healthcare page, a blurb assures visitors that products listed on the website are from \u201cvarious trusted brands that will meet your health needs.\u201d\n\nIndeed, African e-commerce marketplaces are venturing into the delivery of health care products as part of a strategy to broaden their value to customers.\n\nThese platforms are part of a broader crop of innovators at an interesting intersection of healthcare and logistics on the continent. Going by recent data, this sub-sector has grown over two years.\n\nAt least 61 companies are using tech for health distribution across sub-saharan Africa, a growth of over 100% in the number of active players (28) captured in 2018. That\u2019s according to a report by Salient Advisory, an Africa-focused healthcare consultancy.\n\nThese health logistics companies include e-commerce players like Jumia, Copia and Konga, and also core health startups like mPharma, Lifestores Pharmacy, Chekkit and Sproxil. Salient\u2019s report focuses on companies delivering over-the-counter products, hence it does not include LifeBank which specializes in blood and oxygen products.\n\nMost of these companies are in Nigeria, Ghana and Uganda, with only 6 spotted in the francophone region. 31% of the companies surveyed were founded within the last two years and 62% operate in a single African country.\n\nSnapshot of innovators in the health products distribution space in Africa. Source: Salient Advisory.\n\nSalient categorizes the landscape of companies into three groups by the type of service they deliver: consumer-facing companies, producer-facing companies and product data companies.\n\nThe first group of companies (like Drugstore.ng) deliver over-the-counter and prescription drugs as well as virtual patient care to individuals. Provider-facing ones serve healthcare businesses either by delivering to them, hosting an online marketplace, providing inventory management tools (an example here is Lifestores Pharmacy) and/or offering financing.\n\nThe third group offers data related services like product analytics and drug authenticity verification. An example in this category is Chekkit, a verification technology startup that was recently accepted into Google for Startups accelerator programme for 2021.\n\nTraditional e-commerce platforms like Jumia, Copia and Konga are able to play in the consumer and provider-facing buckets. Because of their presence in multiple African countries, all three companies surpass the combined reach of other direct-to-consumer startups in the health product distribution space.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing can accelerate access to medicines and have an incredible impact on public health,\u201d says Yomi Kazeem, one of the authors of Salient Advisory\u2019s report.\n\nAccording to Konga\u2019s co-CEO Nick Imudia, the e-commerce company\u2019s plan to deliver health products started shortly after they were acquired by the Zinox Group three years ago.\n\n\u201cWe started building warehouses and logistics assets to enable us to reach every local government area in the country,\u201d Imudia says to TechCabal.\n\nKonga.com is a marketplace where pharmaceutical companies can list health products like medicines. Konga delivers orders from those pharmacies to individual consumers.\n\nBut beyond fulfilling orders to individuals, Konga plans to go bigger by working on bulk orders between pharmacies and businesses or government agencies, Imudia says. That will require some investments on infrastructure for cold distribution and ensuring warehouses are of the right temperature.\n\nSalient Advisory\u2019s report notes that \u201cclear and harmonised regulations\u201d could boost this entry of e-commerce players into the health products distribution space.\n\nKonga has two licenses to directly distribute products for drug manufacturers and import drugs from the Pharmaceutical Council of Nigeria, Imudia says. But he clarifies that Konga will not act as a pharmacy by selling drugs directly to consumers \u2013 but will rely on its marketplace platform that allows merchants to sell on Konga.com\n\nHow big can this new business line be for Konga? Imudia declines to share what health products logistics currently contributes to Konga\u2019s overall business. But he believes it will be \u201ca major part\u201d of Konga\u2019s business in the future.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In Hero Mode, all Troy wants is to work at Playfield, his mom\u2019s 12-year-old gaming company. But she insists he focus on a dull computer science course at school. The real reason, however, is that she wants him to have a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood away from video games.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Playfield is sinking. Their only potential angel investor bailed because their latest game sucked. A cheap buy offer from a rival is on the table.\n\nBut Troy convinces his mom to let him rebuild the game. He adds a rainbow that talks and a Barack Obama feature. And the rest is\u2026 actually, go watch the rest.\n\nReal life Troy stories are rare in Nigeria but an active gaming community is growing. Platforms like Twitch and Discord are spurring a global gaming economy and a means for financial independence for young Nigerians \u2013 like Olaide and Ying-Yi Akanji.\n\nThey met in 2012 at a GCE exam hall. When they started dating, Olaide introduced Ying-Yi (who is half-Nigerian, half-Taiwanese) to online gaming. Now married, they are an ardent gaming couple.\n\nWhile speaking with them on Tech Republic \u2013 a weekly radio show produced by 88.5 UFM Lagos in collaboration with TechCabal \u2013 I felt nudged to pick a controller and earn some recharge card money, at least. But how does a rusty Millennial get started?\n\nBelow is an excerpt of the chat with the Akanji\u2019s, edited for clarity. Most questions are from Tech Republic hosts Jay and Didi.\n\nJay: What\u2019s the situation with gaming in Nigeria?\n\nOlaide: I have been playing video games since I was a kid. My first Playstation 2 was from my dad. I became very good at gaming but I felt it couldn\u2019t take me anywhere because our 300kbps internet was so bad. Playing online was just impossible.\n\nThen I moved to the UK to study software engineering and everything was better. I dived into e-sports and built a following on Twitch. But I was not comfortable with a foreign audience. Gaming was more fun when I moved back. I could chat and banter on my streams in Pidgin and Yoruba.\n\nBut then came the issues \u2013 internet and electricity. It was demotivating to the point where I almost quit. The main problem was ping \u2013 a measure of how fast you get responses when you click to pass or shoot or any other action.\n\nOur problem here is that when you click on a button for any of those actions, it needs to travel to a server in Europe before it returns to Nigeria. And if you are playing against someone in Europe, their ping is much faster. I may shoot him first but it may not get to him when I do; then he shoots a second later and wins. That\u2019s why you have not seen Nigerians breakthrough internationally.\n\nDidi: Okay, how do I get into gaming? Can I start now even if I didn\u2019t play as a kid?\n\nOlaide: Yes you can! That\u2019s what I love about gaming. When people tell me they don\u2019t like video games, I say you haven\u2019t tried it out. There are so many games out there, it\u2019s impossible for you to hate them all.\n\nA 16-year-old kid won $3million playing Fortnite in 2019 and I actually played in that tournament. I made it into the top 1,000 from the initial 80 million people. The top 100 played in the finals in the US.\n\nBut that prize money shows how this sport has grown. I think the biggest prize money ever won in Nigeria was around \u20a65million.\n\nJay: This is really an untapped market in Nigeria\n\nOlaide: Oh my God, there\u2019s so much potential. I\u2019ve had many conversations with companies that want to get into online gaming but they fear the risks. And it\u2019s understandable because you need 24/7 electricity.\n\nI\u2019ve heard stories about NEPA taking power in the middle of a tournament. It\u2019s painful. When we compete against South Africans, they win because their internet is better.\n\nStill, the Nigerian gaming community is growing.\n\nDidi: How many female gamers are in Nigeria?\n\nYing-Yi: We have quite a few, but the gaming scene is saturated with guys. Girls in Nigeria have less time to play video games because they are more likely to do house chores, while guys can keep playing. Women gamers have to put in more effort. That means we are not a lot but we are getting there.\n\nParents also need to understand that gaming helps to improve cognitive reasoning of both boys and girls. Yes it can be sedentary but parents can set the balance between gaming and other activities.\n\nAlexander: So how do you pitch online gaming to people in government, as something good for the digital economy?\n\nOlaide: People are investing in electronic sports (esports) because every competition provides a level playing field for amateur and expert gamers. No connections needed.\n\nAnybody can buy a console, start playing and competing. Gamers like TimTheTatman are terrible at gaming but make millions because they make entertaining gaming videos. That opportunity should be open to all Nigerian youth looking for jobs and alternative income streams.\n\n\u2014\n\nListen to Tech Republic every Thursday at 2pm WAT on 88.5 UFM Lagos.

          "text": "\u201cDo you want to double your money in 10 days?\u201d\n\nInvestment scams tend to start off the same way.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a social media advert or a video of a celebrity telling you that an \u2018investment platform\u2019 made them millionaires overnight.\n\nThey all echo an alarming promise: \u201cgive us your money and we will give you more returns than you\u2019ve ever seen in the market \u2013 oh and did we mention your money is sure to come back to you?\u201d\n\nThese offers always seem too good to be true. And they usually are.\n\nOver the past few weeks, two different scams have been uncovered in Nigeria. Insha-Allahu Investment is the latest of them.\n\nWith a business name that roughly translates to \u2018If God Wills\u2019, the company\u2019s CEO is currently on the run after promising investors up to 20% Return on Investment (ROI) in two months. Many of the investors put in their life savings and in one case, their inheritance in a bid to multiply their money.\n\nInvestment is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It requires work. The work on your part as the investor is to perform due diligence and ensure your money is going to the right place.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that many more investment scams will continue to spring up. Days after Brisk Capital\u2019s CEO was arrested for fraud, a tweet featuring a popular celebrity made the rounds.\n\nThe power to become a millionaire is in your hands. Start your journey to become a millionaire today by Joining the great @mcivip known as Millionaire Club where you can invest and earn big.\n\n\n\nOfficial website: https://t.co/HMfsRY9aCspic.twitter.com/i0gqGXYzjJ \u2014 Instablog9ja (@instablog9ja) May 28, 2021\n\nIn it, the actor claimed that the company, Millionaires Club Investment, would give you 50% ROI (Return on Investment) in 3 days.\n\n\u201cOkay, but how?\u201d\n\nThis is a question that should follow every claim of returns. If a company tells you they plan to give you 30% of your money back in say, a month as Brisk Capital did, it\u2019s important to ask for details of how exactly they plan on making those returns.\n\nI spoke to Adedayo Bakare, COO of Money Africa and Oluwatomi Solanke, CEO of Trove Finance to get an idea of how to gauge if a deal is too good to be true.\n\nThey both agree that there is a relative benchmark to employ when discussing investments in the country \u2013 it\u2019s called the MPR (Monetary Policy Rate) \u2013 it\u2019s usually around the price of most of the government\u2019s debt instruments \u2013 like bonds and treasury bills.\n\nAs of March 2021, the MPR for Nigeria was 11.5% per year. To find out how much that is monthly, we just need to divide by 12 and we have roughly 0.96% per month.\n\nSo as a rule of thumb, if you have any \u2018investment platform\u2019 offering you significantly more than 0.96% ROI per month then you should proceed with caution. If they\u2019re offering less, then you shouldn\u2019t bother with them at all because you could get more by buying debt instruments directly from the government.\n\nInvestment is, by nature, risky. Legitimate investment platforms are usually keen to inform you of the risks involved when you\u2019re putting your money with them. If a person is promising you 30% monthly and telling you it is low-risk then they are already lying to you and you should not bother doing business with them.\n\nThis is the first step in finding out if an \u2018investment opportunity\u2019 is a scam \u2013 investigate their ROI claims and how they intend to turn them into a reality.\n\nIf a company tells you they are investing in the stock market \u2013 which admittedly can give you high returns \u2013 you must be aware of the risks. The market is volatile and can move up or down very quickly.\n\nIf they say they are investing in real estate then, as an investor, the onus is on you to ask questions about the real estate offerings. Are they selling land? Renting out buildings? How exactly are they able to make that much money from renting or selling land within a short time frame.\n\nIf you find that a company\u2019s explanation for the \u2018how?\u2019 is satisfactory, then you should go on to the next item on our checklist: Regulation.\n\n\u201cAnd you are licensed by\u2026?\u201d\n\nThis is probably one of the most essential checks you must perform before you hand over funds to an investment company.\n\nIt is not enough that a company is \u2018registered\u2019 as a business. Any street-smart hustler can register a business.\n\nAn investment platform you are considering must be either: registered with the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), or be affiliated with a company that is licensed by the SEC or the CBN.\n\nA company claiming to be a financial services company of any kind that has no connection to the SEC or CBN is one to approach with extreme caution.\n\nTo be extra sure, when a company tells you they are licensed with the SEC or gives you their affiliate company (or trustee), you can click here to confirm their eligibility.\n\n\u201cWho did you say you were again?\u201d\n\nContinue your due diligence by looking into the company\u2019s track record.\n\nIt is important to find out what credentials the owners or managers of these companies have. In the case of Dominic Joshua, a quick search would have raised some doubt about the veracity of a 21-year-old investment wunderkind with no real track record.\n\nThis step is especially important when you speak with referees or the company\u2019s brand ambassadors. You shouldn\u2019t put your money into a company just because a friend or family member told you it was great.\n\nYou should also check the company\u2019s track record and find out if fraud allegations have been levelled against its founders, senior leaders, or board members.\n\nPlatforms like ours, Nairaland and even Facebook have been around long enough to have picked up news on all kinds of scams and their perpetrators. It would be good to search for the names of those people and companies and see what comes up.\n\nFinally, making wise and well-informed investment decisions is a great idea but the journey to financial freedom is no walk in the park and requires careful research.\n\nSo the next time you or a loved one are faced with a new \u2018investment opportunity,\u2019 we recommend you share this article with them.\n\n*This is not investment advice\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Two unhealthy decades later\n\nOnly Rwanda, Botswana and Zambia have budgeted over 15% to health in the last two decades. In Nigeria, budget allocation for healthcare was 4.15% and 3.91% in 2017 and 2018 respectively, as data by TechCabal Insights shows.\n\n\n\nWith governments\u2019 poor performance, the burden of funding African healthcare has largely fallen on the shoulders of the private sector, which accounts for nearly 60% of financing. The continent relies on private providers for nearly 50% of its healthcare needs.\n\nEast and Southern Africa remain the regions most affected by HIV in the world. But as other diseases like Ebola and COVID-19 have shown, Africa\u2019s healthcare concerns are systemic, broad and in need of huge capital injection.\n\nAfrica has an estimated $66 billion-a-year health financing gap and in the absence of serious government efforts, donors and the private sector have come through.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the value of PE and VC investments in African healthcare increased from 3% to 16% of total investments in the continent, according to the African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (AVCA).\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, 97 private equity and venture capital fund investments worth $1.3bn were made in health care in Africa. Most healthcare deals in that period happened in Nigeria (15%), Morocco (11%), Egypt (10%), South Africa (8%) and Ghana (8%). Boluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nHealth care, as an investment sector, can be narrowed down to a number of segments, according to the GICS classification system: Equipment & Supplies, Providers & Services, Technology, Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals, and Life Sciences Tools & Services.\n\nAnd health technology (healthtech) has received the most attention recently in Africa.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, AVCA estimates that healthtech accounted for 35% of health care investments in Africa. In 2020 alone, healthtech was the bright star too \u2013 gulping 45% of health care investments.\n\nOne of the more eye-catching healthcare companies is mPharma. The Ghana-based startup is now present in 7 other countries and has raised over $40 million. It became a crucial partner in the Ghanaian government\u2019s vaccine distribution strategy this year and is tipped as one of Africa\u2019s next big companies..\n\nOther breakout healthcare startups in Africa include LifeBank, Helium Health and 54Gene in Nigeria, Ilara Health in Kenya, and Healthlane in Cameroon. These startups are filling critical gaps in blood products logistics, genetics data and hospital management technology to improve service delivery. More are coming on board.\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nAs with mPharma, new innovative health startups are relying on VC funding to rise to popular consciousness. To close the $66bn-a-year gap, the PE and VC community will be expected to invest larger checks at a faster rate in more startups. COVID-19, while an unfortunate pandemic, has spurred a welcome boost in visibility for healthcare startups.\n\nBut tough questions will have to be asked of governments as well. Are they doing their bit, at least keeping to what they agreed to 20 years ago? The first quarter of the 21st Century has only four years before it ends.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "The ECOWAS Court sitting in Abuja has given an order restraining the Nigerian government from imposing sanctions or harassing, intimidating, arresting, or prosecuting Twitter or its users in the country.\n\nThis injunction also prevents the government from carrying out those actions against other social media platforms, media houses, radio, and television broadcast stations. This order stands pending the determination of the case.\n\nThe Court gave the order in the suit filed by the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and 176 concerned Nigerians against the federal government over the suspension of Twitter in the country.\n\nAfter hearing arguments for and against the matter, the Court decided that it was cloaked with jurisdiction. As a suit bordering on the infringement of human rights, the Court determined that it had the right to hear the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe microblogging site was suspended after it deleted a tweet by the Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari, which mentioned the Nigerian-Biafran war.\n\nSubsequently, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami ordered the prosecution of anyone found using the platform.\n\nThis was met with varying levels of criticism which eventually led to the suit filed by SERAP. Currently, SERAP has also filed a claim against the government in the Federal High Court on the same matter.\n\nSERAP\u2019s suit is one in the string of cases filed or threatened to be filed against the Nigerian government on this issue.\n\nAlthough this appears to be good news, the Nigerian government is not known to obey orders or judgments given by the ECOWAS Court. A good example is another case, SERAP v. Federal Republic of Nigeria & Anor, filed by the organisation in the sub-regional court. Judgment was given in 2010 but has not been implemented to date.\n\nOther suits include Sambo Dasuki v. Federal Republic of Nigeria and SERAP v Federal Republic of Nigeria and Universal Basic Education Commission\n\nWhile recent history is not kind to all the parties involved, the suit has not been heard in its entirety yet.\n\nInterestingly, the Nigerian government today approved a team of ministers to manage the negotiation process with Twitter. Perhaps, events might unfold differently in the coming days.",
          "summary": "The ECOWAS Court sitting in Abuja has given an order restraining the Nigerian government from imposing sanctions or harassing, intimidating, arresting, or prosecuting Twitter or its users in the country.\nThis was met with varying levels of criticism which eventually led to the suit filed by SERAP.\nCurrently, SERAP has also filed a claim against the government in the Federal High Court on the same matter.\nAlthough this appears to be good news, the Nigerian government is not known to obey orders or judgments given by the ECOWAS Court.\nA good example is another case, SERAP v. Federal Republic of Nigeria & Anor, filed by the organisation in the sub-regional court.",

          "text": "Today, June 22, 2021, Africa-focused renewable energy finance platform, Nithio FI announced that it has secured $4.5 million in funding to offer sustainable and renewable off-grid energy solutions for homes and small businesses in Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda.\n\nThis round was led by FSD Africa Investments (FSDAi), the investment tier of FSD Africa, a financial sector development and catalyst programme based in Nairobi and funded by the UK Aid.\n\nThis funding, which complements Nithio FI\u2019s total raise of $23 million, will support access to renewable energy for households, smallholder farmers and micro-entrepreneurs who otherwise will not be able to meet the costs. It wants to do the same for energy providers in Africa.\n\nNithio FI plans to continue its innovative approach, integrating repayment data and geospatial population mapping into its AI model to produce a standardised credit risk assessment and forecast of cash flows.\n\nIt is also looking to achieve its five-year goal of providing financing to more than 224,000 energy access products, like productive use appliances and solar home systems(SHS), across Africa.\n\nNithio Holdings \u2014 the parent company \u2014 is an AI-enabled energy financing platform whose mission is to standardise credit risk assessment by investing directly and efficiently in off-grid solar companies. Currently, Nithio FI provides receivables-backed financing in Nigeria, Uganda, and Kenya, with plans to foray into other African countries in 2022.\n\nOver the years, the problem of inadequate power supply in most African countries has stifled economic growth. And the need to look out for alternatives like petrol and diesel-powered generators is normal for most households and businesses.\n\nAlso, there have been recent projections that by 2030, an estimated 650 million people will not have access to adequate electricity supply, with 9 out of 10 of them living in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nNithio FI aims to intensify the reach and access of electrification to more African homes and businesses, banking on its pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) financing model and catalytic capital solution.\n\nCommenting on this investment, Nithio FI Co-founder and CEO, Hela Cheikhrouhou believes that \u201cin order to achieve universal energy access by 2030, last-mile financing must scale to the billions. Nithio has developed an innovative approach powered by its Risk Analytics Engine to lend to small, medium, and large off-grid energy operators to drive scalable connectivity.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, African Development Bank(AfDB) approved a $25 million cheque for renewable energy projects in sub-Saharan Africa. Subsequently, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) approved credit facilities of up to approximately $1.3 million for players in the renewable energy sector in 2020, creating easy access to renewable energy might be Africa\u2019s fast-speed solution to defeating the problem of epileptic power supply.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 A total of five non-governmental organizations and four journalists have filed a suit against the Federal Government at the ECOWAS Community Court of Justice in Abuja asking it to declare the indefinite suspension of Twitter in Nigeria a violation of their human rights under international law, order the Government to immediately rescind the suspension order, and compensate them for the violation of their rights.\n\nThe NGO applicants in the suit are Media Rights Agenda (MRA), Paradigm Initiative (PIN), Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism (PTCIJ), the International Press Centre (IPC), and Tap Initiative for Citizens Development (TICD) while the journalists are Mr. David Hundeyin, Mr. Samuel Ogundipe, Ms Blessing Oladunjoye, and Mr. Nwakamri Zakari Apollo.\n\nThe suit, lodged with number ECW/CCJ/APP/29/21 ECW/CCJ/APP/29/21, in a 73-page documentation, was filed on their behalf by Abuja-based human rights and free expression lawyer, Mrs. Mojirayo Ogunlana Nkanga, under the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights (ACHPR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Revised ECOWAS Treaty, and the Nigerian Constitution, among others.\n\nThey are claiming that Nigeria\u2019s ongoing suspension of Twitter, which came into effect on or around June 4, 2021, violated their right to freedom of expression and interfered with the ability of the journalists to do their work.\n\nThe NGOs and journalists are also alleging that the general situation in Nigeria with respect to human rights, has created an environment where freedom of expression is stifled, which has contributed to creating a chilling effect on press and media freedom and which the ongoing suspension of Twitter is a continuation of.\n\nAccording to them, Nigeria has consented to be bound by the obligation to respect and protect the right to freedom of expression under the ICCPR and the ACHPR and therefore, any limitation imposed by the government on the right to freedom of expression can only be justifiable where the restriction is provided by law, serves a legitimate aim, and is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society.\n\nContending that these three conditions must all be met before any restriction on the right to freedom of expression can be considered legitimate, they noted that the suspension of Twitter is not provided by law, that there is no justification for it under Nigeria\u2019s domestic laws, and that it was done by the government in an arbitrary manner in circumstances where there was no public or judicial oversight, transparency or accountability.\n\nThe NGOs and journalists are asking the Court to declare the indefinite suspension of Twitter a continuous violation of their human rights under international law, particularly the right to seek and receive information as well as the right to express and disseminate opinions under Article 9(1) and (2) of the African Charter; Article 19(2) of the ICCPR and the rights of journalists under Article 66(2)(c) of the Revised ECOWAS Treaty.\n\nThey are also seeking a declaration that the Government\u2019s directive, through the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), for the deactivation of Twitter accounts in Nigeria violates their human rights under international law and that the threat by the Attorney-General of the Federation to criminally prosecute anybody found to be using Twitter in Nigeria following the suspension of the platform also violates their human rights under international law.\n\nThe NGOs and the journalists are therefore urging the court to issue orders mandating the Government to immediately take all necessary measures to rescind the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria; to take all necessary measures to guarantee non-recurrence in order to prevent the same violation occurring again in future; compelling the Government to issue adequate reparations, including restitution, compensation and measures of satisfaction to them to be specified and submitted to the court; as well as to issue an order of injunction restraining the Government, its servants and agents from imposing criminal sanctions on individuals, including the applicants, who use Twitter or any other social media service provider.\n\nNo date has been fixed for the hearing of the suit.\n\nThe suit is being litigated with the support of Media Defence, a London-based NGO, which provides legal assistance to journalists, citizen journalists and independent media.\n\n...",

We also know that some brought their private jets under a temporary import certificate, which has expired and not renewed. These are infractions.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the verification, some of the things we want to expose will come to light. We will make our findings known on July 6 after the expiration of the 30-day grace window. Those in default risk detention of their aircraft as nobody is above the law.\u201d\n\nAttah added that the Customs management believes that owners of private aircraft are highly placed individuals who would be willing to comply with extant laws governing the importation of the aircraft they own; including payments of all appropriate duties and taxes.\n\n\u201cAs an agency of government responsible for enforcement of laws governing imports and exports in Nigeria, NCS will not hesitate to invoke appropriate sanctions on any defaulting private aircraft owner immediately after the expiration of the verification period on Tuesday 6th July, 2021.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, private aircrafts owners or their representatives are to report to room 305, Tariff & Trade Departments, Nigeria Customs Service headquarters, Abuja, from 10am to 5pm. Between Monday 7th June to Tuesday 6th July, 2021\u201d, Attah explained.\n\nHe added that the required documents for verification are; Aircraft Certificate of Registration; NCAA\u2019S Flight Operations Compliance Certificate; NCAA\u2019S Maintenance Compliance Certificate; NCAA\u2019S Permit for non- Commercial Flights; and Temporary Import Permit where applicable.\n\nThe Customs Spokesman emphasized that the ongoing verification was not intended to inconvenience any owner of a private aircraft, as such individuals or representatives can come with the documents for verification.\n\n...",

          "title": "ANALYSIS: Constitution Review: More opposition, criticism trail process",
          "text": "Again, the National Assembly has begun the process of amending the 1999 Constitution.\n\nBetween May and June, both the Senate and the House of Representatives Committees on Constitution Review held public hearings across the country\u2019s six geopolitical zones.\n\nThe committees, statutorily chaired by the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege; and the Deputy Speaker, Idris Wase, invited the general public, executive and judicial bodies, traditional institutions, political parties, civil society organisations, professional bodies and others to attend and make submissions at the hearings.\n\nDuring the hearings, some of the issues canvassed by Nigerians are the creation of more states, state police, devolution of powers, restructuring of the federation, electoral reforms, abrogation of immunity clause, tenure of office, financial autonomy for the judiciary and local governments and drafting of a brand new constitution.\n\nOthers are independent candidacy, age limit for political office contestants, separation of the office of the attorney general from the office of the justice minister, Land Use Act, women inclusiveness, referendum, increased in derivation, impeachment clause, etc.\n\nAt the beginning of the current exercise, the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, assured that the public hearings were a platform for Nigerians to make their contributions to the process.\n\n\u201cWe believe that we must do whatever is necessary to provide a platform for Nigerians to air their views, give their positions and canvass whatever they feel would make our country better, and make governance more efficient and successful,\u201d Mr Lawan said.\n\n\u201cLike I said before, we have no preconceived positions on anything and, therefore, this is the time for our citizens to take the opportunity.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time the lawmakers are embarking on the review of the constitution, which came into effect in 1999 with the return to democratic rule.\n\nThe legislature has been embarking on constitution review since the 5th National Assembly.\n\nAlthough some amendments have been successful in the past, many others suffered serial failures but kept appearing in new proposals.\n\nProminent individuals, groups kick\n\nProminent groups and individuals have, however, expressed opposition to the ongoing review. While some said the process is a waste of time, others argued it is a waste of money. Consequently, they did not participate in the public hearings nor submit memoranda to the federal legislature.\n\nSome of the them are:\n\nNorthern Elders Forum\n\nThe Northern Elders Forum said it was opposed to the review because it is not only a waste of time but also a waste of resources.\n\nThe group\u2019s spokesperson, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, advised the Senate to scrap \u201cthe wasteful idea of giving Nigerians the impression that it is involved in a serious review of our Constitution.\u201d\n\nIt suggested that leaders of thought, elders, groups and professional organisations and representatives of government should come together \u201cto freely discuss every element of our co-existence as a country under principles of voluntarism, genuine representation, mutual respect and integrity of the process.\u201d\n\nThe outcome of this conference, it further said, should then be submitted to the National Assembly, which will then provide for a referendum in the constitution so that Nigerians could directly decide how they want the country to be structured and function.\n\nAfenifere, Ohanaeze, PANDEF, Middle Belt Forum\n\nThe SMBLF, which comprises the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), Afenifere, Ohanaeze Ndigbo and the Middle-Belt Forum, said the National Assembly is wasting its time amending the document, contending that what the country needs is a new constitution written by the people.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe group urged the federal government to heed the genuine and reasonable nationwide calls for a transparent National Dialogue, and take urgent steps towards restructuring and birthing a new constitution; to bring back equitable harmony to the country.\n\nGov Makinde of Oyo State\n\nGovernor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, while explaining why the state did not participate in the public hearings, also said the exercise is a complete waste of time.\n\n\u201cWhat is constitutional review? It is just a complete waste of time really. In 2014, they took people to Abuja, they stayed there and they produced a document. Yes, President Jonathan did not sign it because he thought he was going to be re-elected and wanted to sign it after coming back,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Makinde had earlier called for restructuring and devolution of power but doubted that the review committee would perfect that.\n\nGov Okowa of Delta\n\nLike his Oyo counterpart, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State also kicked against the review. For the governor, who is a former senator, Nigeria needs a new constitution rather than a review.\n\nGov Akeredolu of Ondo\n\nOn his part, Ondo Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, called for the return to the 1963 Constitution, which gave powers to the regions to develop at their own pace.\n\n\u201cThe 1963 Constitution, which reflected the republican status of the country, remained the best document for a country as heterogeneous as Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nEx-Gov Segun Osoba of Ogun\n\nA former governor of Ogun State, Olusegun Osoba, also advocated the return of the country to the 1963 Republican Constitution.\n\n\u201cI wish we can go back to the 1963 constitution because, at that time, each of the regions developed at its own pace. So it would have been very beautiful if we went back to the 1963 constitution which was negotiated over and over with so many conferences. the return of the country to the 1963 Republican Constitution,\u201d he said.\n\nMao Ohuabunwa\n\nA former senator, Mao Ohuabunwa , said the 1999 constitution is too flawed and that what Nigeria needs is a brand new constitution.\n\nHe said the 1999 Constitution was forced down on the throats of Nigerians by the military.\n\nAfe Babalola\n\nAfe Babalola, a legal icon, argued that there is no way the National Assembly could amend the constitution to cure the inherent defects.\n\nHe said rather than constitutional review, the National Assembly could have called for a National Conference where issues bedevilling the nation could be identified, discussed and resolved through a roundtable.\n\nMike Ozekhome\n\nAnother legal luminary, Mike Ozekhome, said the 1999 constitution is a \u201cbad document\u201d which cannot be amended.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly members are afraid; they want to amend. Can you amend a bad document? Even if you give it one million amendments, it cannot solve our problems,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Ozekhome said Nigeria currently operates under a \u201csuffocative system\u201d, due to the constitution which he branded a \u201cfalse document from the pit of hell.\u201d\n\nHamza Mustapha\n\nFor Hamza Mustapha, a retired major and former Chief Security Officer (CSO) to late military head of state, Sani Abacha, the current effort to amend the 1999 Constitution might not work, as it is being done in a rush.\n\n\u201cConstitutional amendments are done to carry everybody along, but I can see a Constitutional amendment carrying a few elites in a hurry.\n\n\u201cConstitutional amendments should be given time and should not be seen carrying the opinions of a few elites abandoning the majority.\n\n\u201cMost Nigerians especially the downtrodden in rural communities are not even aware of what is going on, they don\u2019t even have the money to travel to the urban centres for public hearing.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, you end up listening to the views of a few elites in trying to amend the constitution,\u201d he said.\n\nLawmakers rebuff opposition\n\nThe spokesperson of the House of Representatives, Benjamin Kalu, argued that the calls in some quarters to revert to the 1963 Constitution were unnecessary.\n\nHe, however, advocated the adoption of salient points 1963 and 1999 constitution to achieve a better result of the ongoing constitution review exercise.",

          "text": "Tunde Opalana, Abuja\n\nThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\n\nThis is as the upper chamber mandated full implementation of the policy on usage of locally manufactured syringes and needles by federal government owned hospitals and health institutions across the country.\n\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\nThese mandatory recommendations followed the consideration and approval of the reports of the Senate Committee on Health presented by chairman, Sen. Yahaya Oloriegbe (Kwara Central).\n\nAccording to the chairman, the committee discovered that majority of the imported syringes and needles are substandard, unsterile (used and rewashed syringes from Asian continent) hence endangering the lives, health and safety of Nigerians.\n\nHe said \u201cdespite several policies of the Federal Government especially the introduction of 75% import duties on imported Syringes and Needles to deter importation, the Nigeria Customs Services has not been able to enforce this effectively, thereby leading to mass importation of cheap, substandard and\n\nunsterile syringes and needles.\n\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\n\n\u201cNAFDAC regulates seven (7) products including Syringes and Needles. NAFDAC has a 5+5 policy which means at the end of 5 years the importer must migrate from importation to manufacturing. This policy is just 2 years in operation hence it has not been applied to this sector.\n\n\u201d The Federal Ministry of Health lacks policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government-owned Hospitals and agencies. This has led to government-owned hospitals to sometimes procure and use substandard Syringes and Needles in their hospitals and medical centres.\n\n\u201cCompulsory requirement for manufacturers to register to pre-qualify for the World Health Organisation\u2019s certification costs about $1.5bn. This has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\nThe committee therefore recommended that \u201cthe Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment should finalise the process of approval of the Backward Integration Policy(BIP) (for the sector) by the Federal Executive Council and commence the implementation of the Policy by 1#t August 2021.\n\nThat \u201cas a matter of urgency, the Federal Government should fully implement 75% import duties on the Importation of syringes and needles and put stringent measures to the defaulters thereby encouraging local manufacturers and ensuring employment opportunities. Towards this end, the Nigeria Customs Services should enforce this policy.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop a policy on the procurement and utilization of Syringes and Needles by government hospitals and offices by 1st July 2021. That is within six (6) weeks all Federal Government owned hospitals are to use locally manufactured Syringes and Needles in order to strengthen local manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Ministry of Health should develop and implement a Policy Guideline that will ensure that all hospitals projects and programmes funded with the government of Nigeria\u2019s funds to procure and use Syringes and Needles approved by relevant Nigerian Regulatory Bodies without a requirement for World Health Organisation\u2019s pre-qualification.\n\nThe Senate also asked syringes and needles manufacturers to take the advantage of the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s Special Intervention Fund for the Health sector to improve and extend their capacities.\n\nRecalled that the Medical Device Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MDMAN), producers of syringes and needles sought the intervention of both the Senate Committee on Health and of Industry Trade and Investment on the implementation of exiting policies meant to protect local manufacturers.\n\nThe association in its petition, had alleged that government at all tiers were not patronizing local manufacturers but instead patronize foreign syringes and needles.\n\nPresident of the Medical Devices Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MEDMAN), Mr Akin Oyediran had during interface with the Senate committees and the Health minister, Dr. Osagie Ehanire and NAFDAC Director General, Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye said the implementation of the policy would stop importation of low quality medical devices that may expose patients to health dangers.\n\nOyediran explained that the Backward Integration Policy (BIP) entails Nigerian manufacturers\u2019 right to produce syringes for local market and can import same to meet local demands if their factories could not produce enough quantity to satisfy local needs .\n\nREAD ALSO: Igala Will Not Be Part Of Biafra \u2013 Group Tells Nnamdi Kanu\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have the capacity to produce the required syringes and needles that we need in the country.\n\n\u201cOne of the manufacturers in Nigeria, the Jubilee Syringe of which I am the MD is the largest manufacturers of Syringes in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals. There is no point in why government hospitals should use imported syringes when we have locally manufactured ones.",
          "summary": "Tunde Opalana, AbujaThe Senate has ordered a hike in importation duties on syringes and needles into the country and therefore recommended 75 percent port duties.\nThe two directives were meant to protect local manufacturers, give them enabling environment to contribute to the revenue base of the nation and to reduce unemployment.\n\u201cImportation of syringes and needles is killing local manufacturers making them to lay off staff and preventing them from contributing effectively to the economy.\nThis has been an impediment to local manufacturers attaining this status and preventing their being patronized by organisations using donor funds\u201d.\n\u201cThe local manufacturers are actually the highest supplies of syringes and needles for hospitals.",

          "text": "By Edith Ike-Eboh/Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said the cost of a litre of petrol has hit N256 and it is absorbing between N140-N150 billion in monthly subsidy to sell to consumers at N162.\n\nBut the octopus corporation blamed fuel smugglers for worsening the situation, as daily consumption jumped to to 103 million litres per day in May, as against the usual 50-60 million litres.\n\nThe Group Managing Director (GMD), NNPC, Mele Kyari, made this known on Tuesday at stakeholders meeting organised by the corporation to discuss how best to stop smuggling in the country.\n\nKyari said the current situation had kept the country in a state of bleeding, as it could not sustain the payment of subsidy that accompanies the volume.\n\nHe said that the introduction of Operation White and involvement of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had helped the situation.\n\n\u201cFrom the truck out report from the PPPRA data base , we have seen collapse of load out average move from 70 million litres to 60 million litres just in one month, that means we can do with less than 70 million. The balance, I don\u2019t know where it goes to but we know for sure that it is not consumed in this country .\n\n\u201cIn very recent data, we see what we really want in the beginning of May and June, there was a day we load out about 103 million litres of PMS within one day across the depots.\n\n\u201c We know it is not required, we know it is inappropriate and we also know that something wrong is happening that somebody is chasing something.\n\n\u201cBut we in NNPC, we are not in control of that, we are not in every depot, we don\u2019t keep products in all the depot but when the volume goes down, it comes down to us, when there is tight in supply, it comes back to the NNPC and we solve the problem,\u2019\u2019 he said\n\nHe said that President Muhammadu Buhari had directed that smuggling must stop adding that it was the reason for inviting all stakeholders to chart the way forward.\n\nHe said that the corporation had incorporated the EFCC, the Department of Security Services (DSS), the Nigeria Customs services (NCS), the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), on a platform to achieve this.\n\n\u201cMr President has directed us that we must stop smuggling or round tripping if there is anything like that, and so we must stop it by every means necessary, and we must do anything to stop it, that means we have to work outside the box.\n\n\u201c We know that there are layers of controls that have been there that is not working and that is why we must work outside the box.\n\n\u201cThat is why we are happy to drag in the EFCC, DSS, NSCDC, and even the NCS on a different platforms that will enable us to control this volume and we have seen it work,\u2019\u2019 he added\n\nCommenting on the current PMS and subsidy payment, Kyari explained that with the current exchange rate, the pump price of petrol should be N256 per litre.\n\n\u201cIf we are to sell at the market today at current exchange rate, we will be selling the product at about N256 to a litre. What we sell today is N162, so the difference is at a cost to the nation,\u2019\u2019 he said\n\nAccording to him, with the high volume of daily consumption, the country cannot sustain subsidy payment.\n\n\u201cAs long as we don\u2019t regulate volume, until we are able to exit this current level, which I know so much work is going on, then we have to manage the volume that we are exposed to between this price of N162 and N256.\n\n\u201cThe difference comes back to as much as N140 billion to N150 billion cost to the country monthly.\n\n\u201c As long as the volume goes up, that money continues to increase and we have two sets of stress to face, stress of supply and stress of foreign exchange for the NNPC. We may not see foreign exchange cheque taking place for importation,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nMinister of State for Petroleum Resource, Chief Timipre Sylva, said smuggling was not a business and would never be a business.\n\n\u201cI will like to put it on record that whatever we are trying to do in the area of deregulation will not make sense without us exactly knowing the actual consumption of PMS.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came in as minister, I was informed that the daily consumption in the country was around 60 to 62 million litres a day, which to me sounded a little bit outrageous considering the number of cars we have on the road .\n\n\u201cBut somehow, the figures, I understand today have come down to around 52 million litres, may be the number of vehicles have suddenly reduced, but you will agree with me that something is wrong that is why the tracking of trucks loading products is essential for us to move forward on this issue of subsidy removal,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nEFCC TO THE RESCUE\n\nHe added that illegal export of products through the borders whether the land or sea must be stopped, adding that Operation White that was commissioned in 2020 had not worked effectively until the EFCC came into the picture.\n\n\u201cI believe that with the EFCC in the picture, I think that the system will work better and know that Petroleum Equalisation Fund, is also working on product tracking arrangement.\n\n\u201cFor me, I am happy to see that the EFCC is working with us and if we can get this right, I think our movement toward deregulation will be better assured,\u2019\u2019 he said\n\nEFCC Chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, said the commission was happy to be part of Operation White since part of its duty was to ensure closure of financial crimes in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is quite disheartening to see what is happening. In 2012, we were faced with petroleum subsidy fraud, we at the EFCC were able to unravel a lot of fraud going on there.\n\n\u201cFrom volume falsification to alteration of bill of laden, to the non-payment of over recovery and to what I call single importation and double subsidy payment.\n\n\u201cWe are still trying to recover about N50 billion we have identified in the fraud but now it is a different ball game. NNPC has taken responsibility of importation of products but the issue of smuggling is there.\n\n\u201cWe are assuring Nigerians that anything we have to do to stop smuggling, we will do to ensure that perpetrators are brought to book and justice is met for the benefits of Nigerians,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nOil marketers and industry players present at the meeting pledged to support government to curb smuggling.",

          "text": "Justice Taiwo O. Taiwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered the Buhari Government to pay Rivers and Akwa Ibom states $3,372,963,196.\n\nRivers will get $1,114,551,610.00 and Akwa-Ibom $2,258,411,586.\n\nThe money is the entitlement of Rivers and Akwa-Ibom States, based on the subsisting decision of the Supreme Court over production sharing contracts arising from the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin oil Production Sharing Contracts.\n\nJustice Taiwo, delivered the judgment on Tuesday in Suit No. FHC/ABJ/CS/174/2021 filed by the Attorney General of Rivers State and Attorney General of Akwa Ibom against the Attorney General of the Federation.\n\nIn 2016 Rivers, Bayelsa and Akwa Ibom States through their Attorneys-General sued the Federal Government, represented by the Attorney General of the Federation at the Supreme Court in Suit No: SC.964/2016.\n\nThe three states sought a declaration that there is a statutory obligation imposed on the Defendant (the Federal Government) pursuant to Section 16(1) of the Deep Offshore Inland Basin Production Sharing Act, Cap.D3 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004, to adjust the share of the Federation in the additional revenue accruing under the Production Sharing Contracts if the price of crude oil at any time exceeds twenty dollars ( $20.00USD) per barrel.\n\nThe States asked the court to declare that the failure of the Defendant to accordingly adjust the share of the Government of the Federation in the additional revenue in the Production Sharing Contracts (variously approved by the Defendant) following the increase of price of crude oil in excess of twenty dollars (20.00USD) per barrel in real terms, constitute a breach of the said Section 16(1) of the Deep Offshore and Inland Basin Production Sharing Contracts Act and has therefore affected the total revenue accruing to the Federation.\n\nThey argued that following the rules, the court should issue a consequential order compelling the Defendant to adjust the share of the Government of the Federation in the additional revenue under all the Production Sharing Contracts in Nigeria\u2019s Oil Industry within the Inland Water Basin Deep Offshore areas as approved by the Defendant from the respective times the price of crude oil exceeded twenty dollars ($20.00USD) per barrel in real terms and to calculate in arrears with effect from August 2003 and recover and pay immediately all outstanding statutory allocations due and payable to the Plaintiffs arising from the said adjustments.\n\nAt the Supreme Court, the Attorney- General of the Federation opted for an out of Court settlement and consequently, terms of settlement were duly drawn up by the parties and entered as the judgment of the Court.\n\nThe judgment specifically stated that the reliefs in the amended originating summons relating to the larger interest of the Federal Government of Nigeria and the entire citizenry of the Federal Republic of Nigeria shall be diligently implemented.\n\nIt was also agreed that the Attorney General of the Federation, working jointly with the Plaintiffs should undertake to immediately set up a body and the necessary mechanism for recovery of all lost revenue accruing to the Federation Account in the past and up till the date of full recovery and accruing in future or an acceptable instalmental payments thereof within ninety (90) days next from the date of execution of these presents or its being made judgement of the Court.\n\nFollowing the judgement of the Supreme Court and in compliance therewith the Attorney General of the Federation, the Defendant, constituted a body to determine the respective liabilities including the amount due to oil mineral producing States as derivation proceeds.\n\nThe Report of that body stated among others that Rivers is entitled to $1,114,551,610.00 and Akwa Ibom $2,258,411,586 as Derivation proceeds.\n\nHowever, Attorney General of the Federation without recourse to the Governments of Rivers and Akwa Ibom States unilaterally claimed to have settled with International Oil Companies (IOCs).\n\nAnd it was this unilateral action on the part of the Attorney General of the Federation, the Defendant in the judgment of the Supreme Court that led to the Plaintiffs, that is, Rivers and Akwa Ibom States, to file the Suit at the Federal High Court in Abuja.\n\nBased on the suit filed by the State, the Federal High Court presided over by Justice Taiwo Taiwo declared that Rivers and Akwa Ibom States were entitled to the claims.\n\nThe court also awarded a post judgment interest of 10% in favour of the Plaintiffs until the final liquidation of the judgement.\n\nBAYELSA STATE\n\nOn Monday Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, ordered the Federal Government to pay $951 million to the Bayelsa State Government.\n\nEkwo held that the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), the sole defendant in the case, failed to enter his defence in the suit.\n\nJustice Ekwo ruled that the development made the court to declare the plaintiff\u2019s case \u201cunchanged.\u201d\n\nKen Njemanze filed the suit on behalf of the Bayelsa government. The plaintiff, in the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/175/2012 and filed on February 12, urged the court to compel the AGF to pay five per cent of $50 billion recovered as additional revenue that accrued to the Federal Government.\n\nBayelsa State Attorney General in an affidavit upon which the plaintiff\u2019s claims were based urged the court to make the following orders:\n\n\u201cAn order directing the defendant (AGF) to pay the sum of $951,190, 840.00, being the 13 per cent derivative sum due as arrears of revenue and payable to Bayelsa as assessed, completed and calculated by the body set up by the AGF pursuant to paragraph b (iii) (b) of the terms of settlement made by the (consent) judgment of the court by the Supreme Court in suit No: SC 964/2016 Attorney General of Rivers State and Others Vs Attorney General of the Federation on October 17, 2018. This is in addition to 10 per cent post-judgment interest at the court rate on the said sum of $951, 190, 840.00, until final liquidation thereof.\u201d\n\nThe judge noted that where a person issues a letter of demand on another person upon outstanding facts, the person for whom the demand notice was issued must take steps to react to same.\n\n\u201cWhere the person to whom such demand notice is issued takes no steps, he is deemed to have admitted the claims thereby giving the other person the option of enforcing the claims by the available procedures for enforcement of undisputed claims. That is what has happened in this case,\u201d the judge held.",

They are not known to us. They are not registered, but we hope we will be able to engage them\u201d, as he lamented that the organisation had no investment in Nigeria, but in Ghana, while the target market was Nigeria.\n\nThe minister also denied the widely held opinion that the move was intended to stifle free speech and press freedom.\n\n\u201cThere was no intention of the federal government to stifle free speech in the country. The only reason we suspended Twitter is that it was promoting disunity. Its activities are inimical to the unity of the country,\u201d Mohammed insisted.\n\nHe added that if other social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Google Hangout, and others are found to be encouraging posts or utterances that could destabilize the country, the government will not hesitate to suspend them.\n\nWhen the Convener of the Coalition in Defense of Nigerian Democracy, Ariyo Dare Atoye, who was present at the hearing, raised his hand to speak, the Chairman of the Committee, Olusegun Odebunmi, ruled him out of order and shut him down.\n\nOnly the minister would be authorized to make a presentation, according to Odebunmi.\n\nAriyo stated that he was a Nigerian and a Twitter user, and that the committee chairman was incorrect in ruling him out of order.\n\nThe activist went on to say that the National Assembly is for all Nigerians, and that he was there to see the investigation and ask questions as a Nigerian.\n\nHe claimed that the minister\u2019s presentation was incorrect, and that when he was in opposition, he defended the necessity for Nigeria to have independent media.\n\nHe was perplexed as to how the same person could transform overnight into a proponent of social media regulation.\n\nMeanwhile, several committee members raised alarm over the executive\u2019s move to ban Twitter, claiming that the country was on the verge of dictatorship.",

The owners of these structures are supposed to build according to the building plan approvals given to them.\n\nThere are adequate setbacks that they should leave but unfortunately, the setbacks have been encroached upon. This is the basic fact and everyone knows that the setbacks are no go areas for any form of construction. This is why we are here today.\u201d\n\nOki warned that at the expiration of the 3-day ultimatum without the removal of the illegal encroachments, the state government will take necessary actions against the owners of the structures.\n\nThe LASBCA boss said that the setback areas with interlocking tiles were supposed to be green areas, stressing that the enforcement is aimed at regulating physical planning development in the state.\n\nHe added that green land setbacks are specifically reserved to help preserve the ecosystem as part of efforts to achieve the development plans in the state and make the environment organised and livable.\n\nRecall that the Lagos State Government has in recent times, embarked on the demolition and sealing off of residential and commercial properties across the state for violating the state\u2019s physical planning laws, lack of building approval from the relevant authorities and building on unauthorized areas.\n\nThe exercise has been carried out in various parts of the state such as Ikoyi, Lekki, Ikeja GRA, Magodo GRA, Surulere, Ogudu GRA, Amuwo Odofin and so on.\n\nThe enforcement of the state\u2019s physical planning laws is to help reduce the incidences of building collapse; as General Manager of LASBCA said the enforcement exercise which would be continuous, is part of efforts to rid the state of illegal and unapproved building constructions.",

The Nigerian Extractive Industries and Transparency Initiative (NEITI) reported that there are approximately 40 different kinds of solid minerals and precious metals buried in N igerian soil waiting to be exploited.\n\n\u201cThe sector offers a viable alternative to petroleum for foreign exchange earnings.\n\n\u201cGlobally, the mining industry has been a close rival to the petroleum industry, while Nigeria only earns a paltry $89 million per annum from it. The commercial value of Nigeria\u2019s solid minerals has been estimated to run into hundreds of billions of dollars,\u201d the lawmaker stressed.\n\nContributing, Senator Smart Adeyemi (APC Kogi West) said the importance of the commission cannot be overemphasized, noting it would enable government to regulate mining activities and save government trillions of naira being lost to illegal activities in the country.\n\nIn his remarks, the Senate President Dr. Ahmad Lawan, charged the Committee on Solid Minerals to conclude legislative work on the bill and report back within four weeks.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has inaugurated the National Steering Committee (NSC) of the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy (NPRGS) to be chaired by the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nIn his remarks at the event on Tuesday in Abuja, the President reiterated his commitment to lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years, with a well-researched framework for implementation and funding.\n\n\u201cThis journey began in January 2021 when I directed the Chairman of the Presidential Economic Advisory Council and Secretary to the Government of the Federation to collaboratively work together to articulate what will lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years.\n\n\u201cI am happy to note that the process of designing this inclusive poverty reduction strategy recognised and addressed past mistakes, as well as laid the foundation for a sustainable poverty reduction through the wide range consultations held at all levels of government, development partners, the private sector as well as the civil society,\u201d he was quoted as saying by his media aide, Femi Adesina.\n\nPresident Buhari was confident that the NPRGS would address the underlying causes of poverty on the basis of which it developed programmes that would deal with the multi-dimensional nature of poverty within the practical context of comparative advantage of human and natural resources in the various geo-political zones.\n\nAccording to him, the major challenge before the committee is to translate the good intention of the government into a positive impact on the average Nigerian in order to create an appreciative impact on the poverty situation in the country.\n\n\u201cIf India can lift 271 million people out of poverty between 2006 and 2016, Nigeria can surely lift 100 million out of poverty in 10 years. Fortunately, we have already started but we need to unlock the challenges of slow implementation, inappropriate targeting, and absence of adequate resources,\u201d the President said.\n\nThe responsibilities of the committee, he noted, include anchoring collaborative efforts; provide oversight for the implementation of the strategy; provide guidance to Technical Working Group and federal ministries, extra ministerial departments and agencies, subnational governments and other stakeholders on meeting the objectives of the programme; as well as monitor progress and any other effort that would enhance the attainment of the objective of lifting 100 million people out of poverty in 10 years.\n\n\u201cThe performance of our economy despite COVID-19 gives me comfort that we can achieve our goal, but we need to seriously scale up and work more with state and local governments.\n\n\u201cThis call becomes more pertinent in the face of recent forecasts by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and our own Nigerian Economic Summit Group which all agreed that Nigeria needs to frontally tackle her poverty situation if our economic gains are to be sustained,\u201d he told the gathering at the event.\n\nPresident Buhari asked the committee to commence work immediately to enable the Technical Working Group to begin to put the nuts and bolts together.\n\nHe said the responsibilities were onerous but expressed confidence that the committee would be able to lay the foundation and demonstrate, within the next two years, the practicality of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in or under 10 years.\n\nIn his remarks, Vice President Osinbajo said the NPRGS would consolidate other efforts of the government to reduce poverty in the land.\n\nHe noted that the President\u2019s position that local governments, states, and the federal government should work jointly to alleviate poverty in the country would be properly reflected in the framework and implementation, stressing the need for access and inclusivity.\n\nThe SGF, Boss Mustapha, who is a member of the committee said the poverty situation in the country assumed an enormous proportion with an increasing population, adding that the situation was compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe, however, said the administration responded to the COVID-19 poverty fallout swiftly and was able to ameliorate the situation and ensured a quick exit from recession.\n\nThe committee also has as members Chief of Staff to the President, Governors of Ekiti (South West), Delta (South South), Sokoto (North West), Borno (North East), Nasarawa (North Central), and Ebonyi States (South East).\n\nOthers are Ministers of Finance, Budget and National Planning; State for Budget and National Planning; Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development; Agriculture and Rural Development; Industry, Trade and Investments; Labour and Employment, Education and Health.",

People have been using this as a blackmail weapon that we rode to power using social media. That is blackmail because we need to set specific examples where we use social media to undermine the territorial integrity and peace and unity of Nigeria,\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody is saying that people should not use social media platforms, nobody is saying that we should not call government officials to question. Nobody is saying that you should not even abuse us but is it right for you to go to social media and promote false stories that are capable of turning one part of the country against another?\u201d he added.\n\nRead Also: ECOWAS Court Restrains Nigerian Govt From Imposing Sanctions On Twitter, Others\n\nThe Federal Government has since come under fire for its decision to ban the social media platform in the country both from citizens and the international community.\n\nBeyond the ban, the Minister for Justice, Abubakar Malami, had also announced that anyone found still using the app would be prosecuted.\n\nBut on Tuesday, the ECOWAS Court of Justice joined the call to condemn the decisions.\n\nThe court restrained the Federal Government from imposing sanctions or harassing, intimidating, arresting, or prosecuting Twitter.\n\nIt also restricted the government from carrying out such actions against any other social media service provider, as well as media houses, pending the hearing and determination of a suit challenging the government\u2019s suspension of Twitter operations in the country.\n\nHowever, reacting to this, Mr Keyamo said \u201cI have not seen anywhere where they said the ECOWAS court is the moral thermometer or barometer to decide whether Nigeria\u2019s image is bad or not\u201d.",

However, neither agency has confirmed the validity of the claim.\n\nAsked about the websites\u2019 seizures during a news conference on Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price did not confirm or deny US responsibility for the takedowns, referring journalists instead to the Department of Justice, which oversees the FBI.\n\nThe DOJ did not respond however respond to the request for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarzieh Hashemi, a prominent anchor for Press TV, told The Associated Press that the channel was aware of the seizure but had no further information.\n\n\u201cWe are just trying to figure out what this means,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever In a post to Twitter, the news agency shared a screenshot of the message that appeared in place of its website on Tuesday, saying it \u201cseems to be a coordinated action\u201d as a similar message has also appeared on websites of other \u201cIranian and regional television networks\u201d. PressTV did not confirm US involvement in the seizure, saying only that the actor \u201cclaims\u201d to be with the US government.\n\nIn what seems to be a coordinated action, a similar message appears on the websites of Iranian and regional television networks that claims the domains of the websites have been \u201cseized by the United States Government.\u201d\n\nLaunched in July 2007, Press TV is the international English-language news channel that runs under the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), Tehran\u2019s state media agency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIRIB has been sanctioned by the US since 2013 \u2013 and remained so even after the Obama-era nuclear deal \u2013 under a US law that gives the US Treasury Department the authority to designate those in Iran who restrict or deny the free flow of information to or from the Iranian people but Press TV has remained operational despite all the sanctions.\n\nThe Houthi movement\u2019s alternative domain for its al-Masirah news website, which remained operational, released a statement accusing the US of seizing its site \u201cwithout any justification or prior notice\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis seizure of the almasirah.net and other allied websites reveals once again the deceit of the free speech slogans that America promotes,\u201d the agency said. \u201cWe condemn this American piracy.\u201d\n\nLast year the US Treasury Department blocked and seized the official domain name of Iranian state-run newspaper \u201cIran\u201d.\n\nThe website, once registered under the domain \u201ciran-newspaper.com\u201d, is still offline but can now be found instead under \u201cirannewspaper.ir\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2012, Nicole Navas, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman, told Wired that the US government has the authority to seize any website ending in .com, .net or .org because the companies that have the contracts to administer the sites are based on US soil.",

          "title": "ECOWAS Court Stops Nigeria Government From Sanctioning, Prosecuting Twitter Users",
          "text": "The ECOWAS Court of Justice has \u201crestrained the government of President Muhammadu Buhari and its agents from unlawfully imposing sanctions or doing anything whatsoever to harass, intimidate, arrest or prosecute Twitter and/or any other social media service provider(s), media houses, radio and television broadcast stations, the Plaintiffs and other Nigerians who are Twitter users, pending the hearing and determination of this suit.\u201d\n\nThe ruling by the regional court in Abuja followed the suit filed against the government by the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and 176 concerned Nigerians arguing that \u201cthe unlawful suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, criminalization of Nigerians and other people using Twitter have escalated repression of human rights and unlawfully restricted the rights of Nigerians and other people to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom in the country.\u201d\n\nThe court gave the order after hearing arguments from Solicitor to SERAP, Femi Falana, and lawyer to the government Maimuna Shiru.\n\nThe court said: \u201cThe court has listened very well to the objection by Nigeria. The court has this to say. Any interference with Twitter is viewed as inference with human rights, and that will violate human rights. Therefore, this court has jurisdiction to hear the case. The court also hereby orders that the application be heard expeditiously. The Nigerian government must take immediate steps to implement the order.\u201d\n\nThis development was disclosed today by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare.\n\nReacting to the ruling, Femi Falana said: \u201cThe intervention of the ECOWAS Court is a timely relief for millions of Nigerians using Twitter who have been threatened with prosecution under the provision of the Penal Code relating to sedition.\u201d\n\n\u201cContrary to the assurance credited to the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN that violators of the Twitter would not be prosecuted, the Federal Government filed processes in the ECOWAS Court threatening to prosecute Nigerians using Twitter for violating the suspension under the provisions of the Penal Code relating to sedition.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is extremely embarrassing that the Federal Government could threaten to jail Nigerians for sedition, which was annulled by the Court of Appeal in 1983, in the case of Arthur Nwankwo vs The State.\u201d\n\nThe suit and the ruling followed the suspension of Twitter by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed after the social media giant was banned in the country for deleting President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s tweet. The National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) also ordered TV and radio stations to \u201csuspend the patronage of Twitter immediately\u201d, and told them to delete \u2018unpatriotic\u2019 Twitter.\n\nThe substantive suit has been adjourned to July 6 for hearing of the substantive suit.\n\nIt would be recalled that SERAP and the concerned Nigerians had in the suit No ECW/CCJ/APP/23/21 sought \u201cAn order of interim injunction restraining the Federal Government from implementing its suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, and subjecting anyone including media houses, broadcast stations using Twitter in Nigeria, to harassment, intimidation, arrest and criminal prosecution, pending the hearing and determination of the substantive suit.\u201d\n\nThe suit, read in part \u201cif this application is not urgently granted, the Federal Government will continue to arbitrarily suspend Twitter and threaten to impose criminal and other sanctions on Nigerians, telecommunication companies, media houses, broadcast stations and other people using Twitter in Nigeria, the perpetual order sought in this suit might be rendered nugatory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter is aimed at intimidating and stopping Nigerians from using Twitter and other social media platforms to assess government policies, expose corruption, and criticize acts of official impunity by the agents of the Federal Government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe free communication of information and ideas about public and political issues between citizens and elected representatives is essential. This implies a free press and other media able to comment on public issues without censor or restraints, and to inform public opinion. The public also has a corresponding right to receive media output.\u201d\n\n\u201cFreedom of expression is a fundamental human right and the full enjoyment of this right is central to achieving individual freedom and to developing democracy. It is not only the cornerstone of democracy, but indispensable to a thriving civil society.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe arbitrary action by the Federal Government and its agents have negatively impacted millions of Nigerians who carry on their daily businesses and operational activities on Twitter. The suspension has also impeded the freedom of expression of millions of Nigerians, who criticize and influence government policies through the microblogging app.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension of Twitter is arbitrary, and there is no law in Nigeria today permitting the prosecution of people simply for peacefully exercising their human rights through Twitter and other social media platforms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension and threat of prosecution by the Federal Government constitute a fundamental breach of the country\u2019s international human rights obligations including under Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Article 19 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Nigeria is a state party.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe suspension has seriously undermined the ability of Nigerians and other people in the country to freely express themselves in a democracy, and undermined the ability of journalists, media houses, broadcast stations, and other people to freely carry out their professional duties.\u201d",
