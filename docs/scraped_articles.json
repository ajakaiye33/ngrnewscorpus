          "title": "NCC warns Nigerians on new ways hackers attack phones through SMS, power outage messages",
          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), again, has been informed of a new high-risk, critical and Short Messaging Service-based malware, TangleBot, infecting Android mobile devices.\n\nTangleBot employs more or less similar tactics as the recently-announced notorious FlutBot SMS Android malware that targets mobile devices. TangleBot equally gains control of the device but in far more invasive manner than the FlutBot malware.\n\nThe disclosure on TangleBot was made in a recent security advisory made available to the Commission\u2019s New Media and Information Security Department by the Nigerian Computer Emergency Response Team (ngCERT).\n\nTangleBot Android malware is installed when an unsuspecting user clicks on a malicious link disguised as COVID-19 vaccination appointment-related information in an SMS message or information about fake local power outages that are due to occur.\n\nThe aim behind both or either of the messages (on COVID-19 or impending power outages) is to encourage potential victims to follow a link that supposedly offers detailed information. Once at the page, users are asked to update applications such as Adobe Flash Player to view the page\u2019s content by going through nine (9) dialogue boxes to give acceptance to different permissions that will allow the malware operators initiate the malware configuration process.\n\nThe immediate consequence to this, is that TangleBot gains access to several different permissions when installed on a device, allowing it to eavesdrop on user communications. The malware then steals sensitive data stored on the device and monitors almost every user activity, including camera use, audio conversations, and location, among other things.\n\nFurthermore, the malware takes complete control of the targeted device, including access to banking data, and can reach the deepest recesses of the Android operating system.\n\nThe NCC, therefore, wishes to, once again, urge millions of telecom consumers in Nigeria to be wary of such wiles of cyber criminals, whose intent is to defraud unsuspecting Internet users.\n\nIn order to ensure maximum protection for Internet users in the country, the ngCERT has offered a number of preventive measures to be taken by the consumers.\n\nThese measures include an advisory to telecom consumers and other Internet users to refrain from opening Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) from unknown sources while using your mobile devices.\n\nAdditionally, telecom consumers should never respond or send replies to messages or call back a phone number that is associated with the text that they are unaware of. Should any telecom consumer or Internet user become curious and wish to ascertain the authenticity of any call or messages and wish to probe the incident, such persons may do a web search of both the number and the message content.\n\nThe NCC hereby reiterates that mobile users are under obligation to practice safe messaging practices and avoid clicking on any links in texts, even if they appear to come from a legitimate contact. Indeed, it is important to be judicious when downloading apps by reading install prompts closely, looking out for information regarding rights and privileges that the app may request.\n\nOther risk-mitigating measures advised by ngCERT is for users to be cautious of procuring any software from outside a certified app store. Advisedly, it is safer to call the company directly rather than using the phone number on the message received, especially if the message is spoofing a company. Finally, telecom consumers and other Internet users should report any incident of system compromise to ngCERT via [email protected] for necessary support and technical assistance.\n\nThe Commission expresses its commitment to continuously inform and educate mobile telephony subscribers and Internet users in Nigeria, on cyber risks, however, they may manifest. This is to insulate them from the dangers and losses arising from cybercrimes of any kind.",

          "text": "Benue State Commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism, Hon Michael Inelagwu, has said all Nigerians regret voting General Muhammadu Buhari as the nation\u2019s president.\n\nHe spoke on Friday, during a world press conference he addressed in reaction to a press statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media, Mallam Garba Shehu.\n\nAccording to the Commissioner, only Nigerians who are deaf and can not hear the cry of citizens who are lamenting the security and economic crisis in the country, are still supporting President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt will interest Shehu to know that it is not only the Governor that regrets voting Buhari as President in 2015. Majority of Nigerians, including his die-hard supporters in 2015 and 2019 do and it is only those who are deaf, probably like Shehu, that cannot hear the loud cry by Nigerians to be rescued by the PDP from APC\u2019s mismanagement of Nigeria\u2019s political leadership since 2015.\u201d\n\nThe information commissioner said Garba Shehu was right to have said \u201cNigeria has had enough of failed politicians\u201d and will be too glad to see one of them, President Muhammadu Buhari leave office next year.\n\nThe Commissioner noted that Governor Ortom, who has championed the course of ranching in the country is a politician that proffers solutions to challenges that confront Nigeria, unlike President Buhari who is bent on reviving cattle routes in the 21st century.\n\nInalegwu said it is surprising that the president\u2019s media aide in his reaction to Governor Ortom\u2019s interview on Arise TV, failed to make reference to the grave security challenges confronting the country in spite of the facts and figures reeled out by the Governor to prove the despicable deterioration of the security situation nationally and in Benue State under President Buhari.\n\nHe added that it\u2019s shameful for Garba Shehu to refer to President Buhari\u2019s recommendation for the return of the century-old animal husbandry, which is not implementable in this age.",

          "text": "Former Governor of old Anambra State, Senator Jim Nwobodo has said that he stopped his children from seeking elective offices in Enugu State for other families to have a taste of elective public offices.\n\nNwobodo also called on the Enugu people to maintain the existing zoning formula for the governorship position in the State ahead of the 2023 elections.\n\nThe former Governor, who spoke to newsmen in his Amechi Awkunanaw country home, Enugu South LGA, on the needs for the governorship to be micro-zoned to Nkanu East local government area, said rotation system allows others to have a taste of what is generally owned.\n\nHe stated that because of the need to have other people occupy public offices, he stopped his children to stop seeking for elective offices.\n\n\u201cI have children who wanted to be local government chairman here(Enugu South LGA), but I chased them away and stopped them.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cIt should be enough for them that their father had governed the state. So, people from other families should be allowed to run too. And they stopped and listened to me.\n\n\u201cI think we should imbibe that. If as a person you enjoyed something, please allow others to enjoy. If you take it alone, God will be angry with you,\u201d Nwobodo said.\n\nHe insisted that the State had always had zoning arrangements from which all previous Governors emerged.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWe have a zoning formula about governorship position in Enugu State. The first governor of old Anambra State is me. Enugu was just a Senatorial Zone. Anambra and Ebonyi were also Senatorial zones.\n\n\u201cWe were only two Governors in the whole of Southeast then: myself and Sam Mbakwe. We tried zoning. I remember when we were dealing with Nkalagu(Cement Factory), Imo people came and said: you have Nkalagu, you have this, you have that, what are you giving us?\n\n\u201cI told them that if there was anything that belonged to both of us that was situated in Imo, take it. Today, Enugu has no say in Nkalagu. Nkalagu has been zoned to Ebonyi State.\n\n\u201cSo, I want to tell you that the zoning system has been there. Do you know that Britain has no written constitution? But they do everything on the basis of trust and practice. So, we have been zoning.\n\n\u201cWhen we wanted to produce the Governor in 1999, we felt that if we threw it open, people would start spending money foolishly.\n\n\u201cYou will see people coming to tell you (aspirants) that you have been chosen and you will pay and the people will collect the money and go to tell another aspirant the same thing.\n\n\u201cThis money is what they should have used to prepare for an election. So, we decided that the best thing to do was to zone this thing.\n\n\u201cAfter Enugu East, Enugu West will take over, and after Enugu West, it will go to Enugu North. So, after Enugu North, it goes back to Enugu East. So, it was zoned.\n\n\u201cBut there was no paper written. But it was in practice. I just gave you an instance with Britain where people live their normal, truthful and honorable life without a written constitution.\n\n\u201cPeople believe in what is fair and good. So, we should learn the same thing. I\u2019m saying that if I have enjoyed something, it is not right for me to deny another person the right to enjoy the same thing.\n\n\u201cEnugu people should remember the story of the rich foolish man in the Bible. He had believed that he had made so much money from his harvest. He had so much in his barn. So, he said: my soul go to bed and enjoy what you have. He did not mention God in all those things. So, God now said to him: you foolish man, today I want your soul. The man died.\n\n\u201cI want the press to help me with this idea. There\u2019s an unwritten zoning system in Enugu State and that zoning system should be maintained. Let us work as brothers\u201d.\n\nThe elder statesman who used the opportunity to debunk reports that he had endorsed an aspirant from his local government area, said he had no such powers to endorse anyone.\n\nAccording to him, it is only the sitting governor who should decide his successor.\n\n\u201cNo Governor wants to leave without having a say on who will replace him. If you are a governor of a state, you should have a say. In fact, you should decide on your successor. It is very important,\u201d he said adding \u201cBut, giving Nkanu East the position will help develop the place a bit. Try to go to Nkanu East, you will shudder. It has always been a painful trip.\n\n\u201cYou will be shocked to see that there\u2019s no road, no water there. And they are part of Nkanu. It doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\n*My conscience tells me that they should have the first option to produce a governor unless they don\u2019t have anybody. But I think they have\u201d.",

For example, he has shifted from his earlier objection to the use of some musical instruments in the church.\n\nPopular foreign gospel singer, Bob Fitts, was invited to join him at his next global crusade scheduled to hold this weekend in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital.\n\nThe pastor had commenced a series of global crusades with many people saying his intention is to bring some changes he desire in his ministry to bear on the Deeper Life church and its members.\n\nAmidst surprise and even open resentment by some of his followers, Kumuyi has been using the global crusades to unveil a number of changes into his ministrations, notably the introduction of music and musicians.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn furtherance of his new position, the Deeper Life founder had invited some music ministers, hitherto prohibited by the church to minister along with him to the amazement of many.\n\nSuch music ministers included Don Moen in Enugu, Nathaniel Bassey to minister along with him in songs during the Showers of Blessing Through Christ crusade in Port-Harcourt and Pastor William McDowell in the Wonders of the Cross crusade which held Uyo.\n\nBut the opposition to Kumuyi\u2019s new ways from within his church intensified during the week ahead of the Ibadan crusade with some of his \u2018children in the Lord\u2019 rising in protests against the invitation of Fitts and other musicians.\n\nThey argue that unconventional music has never been part of Deeper Life\u2019s mode of worship, and should not be introduced now; not even by the sagely Kumuyi.\n\nProminent human rights activist, Prince Dele Banjo, who is also a member of the church, alongside a host of others, staged a peaceful protest at church\u2019s headquarters at Gbagada, Lagos, during the week.\n\nBanjo, who vowed to continue his protest until he gets result, noted that Kumuyi who is like a father to them, did not raise members of his church with such music.

          "text": "By Chukwudi Nweje, Lagos and Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nPan Yoruba socio- political organisation, Afenifere, pan Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide, Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Yoruba Council of Elders and the Pan Niger Delta Forum, (PANDEF) have lashed out at Yobe State governor, Mai Bala Buni over a statement credited to him that the All Progressives Congress (APC), had yet to zone its political offices for 2023.\n\nBuni, who is Chairman APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) was quoted in a statement signed by his Director General, Press and Media Affairs, Mamman Mohammed in Damaturu, on Wednesday, as saying that reports that the presidential slot was zoned to the South were \u201cfalse, baseless and unfounded.\u201d\n\nThe APC was reported to also pooh-poohed the list on the zoning of party offices in circulation ahead of its national convention, and described it as fake news.\n\nHowever, Afenifere, Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide, YCE, MBF and Pan Niger Delta Forum, (PANDEF) have insisted that all the political parties should zone their presidential ticket to the south in 2023.\n\nThe groups insisted that parties that fail to present Southerners as presidential candidates would jettison votes from the South.\n\nAfenifere National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, said: \u201cOur position is that the presidency should go to the South in 2023. In fact, we have said that all political parties should zone their presidential ticket to the South. That remains our position.\u201d\n\nHowever, Publicity Secretary of Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide, Alex Ogbonnia, said the political parties should specifically zone their presidential ticket to the South East for equity, justice and fair play.\n\nOgbonnia further said that Nigeria currently sits in \u201ca precarious balance\u201d and that Gov Buni\u2019s assertion that the presidential ticket has not been zoned further threatened the peace and continued corporate existence of Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cEvery Nigerian knows it is the turn of the South East to produce the President of Nigeria in 2023. It was done in 1999 when both political parties zoned their presidential ticket to the South West. In 2007, President Olusegun Obasanjo ensured that the presidency went back to the North and the major political parties zoned their presidential tickets to the North.\u201d\n\nThe Ohaneze Publicity Secretary further said that 2023 is a moral burden on the entire country, which can only be assuaged if the presidency is given to the South East.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are two kinds of people in this country \u2013 those who want Nigeria to remain one and those who want it to disintegrate. President Muhammadu Buhari must take the bull by the horns, he is the leader of the APC and he should ensure that the party\u2019s presidential ticket is zoned to the South East. The President should replicate what President Obasanjo did in 2007 and ensure that power returns to the South East.\n\nAccording to Ogbonnia, \u201cFor peace, justice and equity to reign and for the continued peaceful corporate existence of Nigeria, the political parties should zone their presidential ticket to the South East because we didn\u2019t know for how long we can continue to hold back these young boys.\u201d\n\nThe Yoruba Council of Elders (YCE) also insisted that the Southern part of Nigeria must be allowed to produce the president of the country in 2023, irrespective of political affiliations, in a bid to ensure peace, stability, progress and development for the nation.\n\nSecretary-General of the council, Dr. Kunle Olajide, who made the disclosure in a brief telephone interview with Saturday Sun on Friday, noted that though the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria does not recognise zoning, \u201cmorally, Nigerians have accepted the zoning because so many Nigerians want stability, progress, and development of the country.\n\n\u201cThis also goes with the fact that Nigerians did not take part in the making of the 1999 Constitution. The 1999 Constitution was written by a few people, during the military regime of Gen Abdulsalami Abubakar, to give us the so-called constitution. In Nigeria, we don\u2019t have our constitution yet. The 1999 Constitution does not accommodate zoning.\n\n\u201cBut it is only by zoning that the progress and peace of Nigeria can be guaranteed. The geographical south must be recognised and rotating political power among the two zones \u2013 North and South, will guarantee stability, progress and development for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSo, a new constitution will be a panacea to peace and stability in Nigeria. We need people\u2019s constitution in Nigeria that we would all sit and write, and as well agree how we want to live together. We are different people. This must be recognised and that is the reality of Nigeria.

Though I am not desperate about the 2023 presidency and YCE is not a political party, the South must produce the president in 2023 for peace and stability of this nation. Then, the three zones in the South will sort it out among themselves who they will present.\n\nSouthern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum (SMBLF), had at a meeting on Thursday, January 13, in Abuja, also called on all political parties in Nigeria to zone their presidential tickets to the south.the southern and Middle Belt leaders also warned that any political party that does not zone its presidential ticket to the South should not expect support from the four regions that constitute the body. The meeting, held under the chairmanship of Dr Edwin Clark and attended by Afenifere acting leader, Ayo Adebanjo, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide President General, Prof George Obiozor, Dr. Pogu Bitrus, President of the Middle Belt Forum and Senator Emmanuel Ibok Essien, National Chairman of Pan Niger Delta Forum, (PANDEF) noted that the basis of any viable democracy, especially in a diverse and complex country such as Nigeria, is fair and even sharing of power.\n\nIt noted: \u201cThe northern part of the country would have fully enjoyed the Office of the Presidency of the country for the full statutory period of eight years by 2023, hence, the presidency should rotate to the South.\u201d They noted that the extant 1999 Constitution and structure of Nigeria are grossly flawed and lopsided, and demanded the fundamental restructuring of the country by enacting a new Constitution that would enthrone equity, fairness and justice.",

          "title": "Political negotiations to free Kanu on course -Mbazulike Amechi",
          "text": "First Republic Aviation Minister and foremost nationalist, Chief Mbazulike Amechi has said that his appeal to President Muhammadu Buhari concerning the release of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu and the Igbo question, was still attainable.\n\nIn an interview with DAVID ONWUCHEKWA, the respected statesman expressed the abundant hope that Kanu would be released through political discussions and negotiations. He also spoke on other national issues.\n\nYou have been making spirited efforts to see that Nnamdi Kanu is released and you are also not happy about the actions and utterances of members of IPOB. What do you say about these issues sir?\n\nMy concern is not only about Nnamdi. When I went to see President Muhammadu Buhari, I went for two items: the position of Ndigbo in Nigeria and the case of Nnamdi Kanu. And of course, I held and still hold the view that if Nnamdi Kanu is released today, it will douse the tension in the South East. It will bring down the ill feelings of the people of the South East.\n\nSo, the case of Nnamdi Kanu is as important as the case of Ndigbo or the South East, generally. That was the matter I took to the President and the President listened very attentively and he gave me the assurance that something would be done. And so far, I\u2019m happy to say that I\u2019m aware that something is being done. Things are being done of which somehow in some parts. There are other parts being played by other organs of government, by other institutions and they\u2019re all doing something positively. What made me feel bad was when I saw in the newspapers that IPOB ordered a sit- at- home from Monday to Thursday last week, that Nnamdi was having a case of accelerated hearing fixed for consecutive days. I feel that already it is affecting the economy of the Igbo to stay at home on Monday alone, how much more asking people to stay at home from Sunday to Thursday, that is five days in a week of seven days, leaving only one day, Friday that is a working day in the whole of the week.\n\nI don\u2019t know who ordered that. I don\u2019t know who the leaders of the IPOB are. So, I sent a message to the lawyer of Nnamdi asking him to warn these people. They have to stop this thing. These sit -at-home orders are too much and I can understand that it was initially being observed when Kanu was appearing in court. That\u2019s okay, but asking people to sit-at-home every week in a case that may last a year or even more unless something is done by the government and the court, unless for any reason the case is determined within a shorter period\u2026 Even making people to sit-at-home for one day in a week for a whole year or six months is bad, how much more making them to lose five days in seven days of the week. They have to stop these alleged actions here and there.\n\nBut I was relieved when the lawyer told me that it is not the true IPOB that has been doing all those things, that IPOB said only Monday (which they have even cancelled) but a group or renegade groups or whatever within the organization is doing this because they seem to be making some money out of it. And I was relieved when I saw in The Sun Newspaper front page where the IPOB denied it. They officially denied ever asking people to stay at home on Monday and exceed it for one day so, I was relieved.\n\nWould you discontinue your effort if the agitators do not listen to your advice to stop certain actions?\n\nI have never discontinued at all. I have just told you earlier on that arrangements are on that the discussions and negotiations, and meetings are being held at various levels and you know what that means. So, there is hope, abundant hope in the words and promise of the President. It is being arranged in such a way that the President can do that without interfering with a court process. We want to see how we can get this matter out of court process and get the problem solved.\n\nIt was reported that President Buhari said he would not release Nnamdi Kanu. How do you look at that?\n\nHe cannot order the court to release Nnamdi Kanu, neither has he the power to do so. People are asking the President to exercise his prerogative of mercy. It is inappropriate to exercise the prerogative of mercy. I\u2019m not a lawyer but from a layman\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s inappropriate for the President to declare prerogative of mercy now because Nnamdi is being tried and in our jurisprudence in Nigeria, one who is being tried is presumed innocent until he is proved guilty. So, Nnamdi has not been proved guilty. And the prerogative of mercy does not apply in his case. But the President can solve the problem politically. That\u2019s what I mean. It can be solved politically.\n\nSolving it politically means discussing. Once in the Delta area, a problem was solved politically. The then President negotiated, discussed with meetings and so forth and then at a point, it got to a level where people were granted amnesty, that is the Niger Delta militants. Even in the protracted case of Boko Haram, there have been attempts to negotiate and when the Boko Haram insurgents stop shooting, there will be peace in that area. That is political solution.\n\nIn the case of Nnamdi Kanu and his people, it can be solved politically. We are not saying it will be solved through the judicial process because that will take a long time. So far, he is presumed innocent but the extent the court can say he is innocent or guilty is far away. But what we are saying is if it is allowed to extend to such a way, there will be bad feelings all over the place and we don\u2019t want that. We want the Federal Government to take political action to solve the problem and the Igbo question now that I\u2019m still around. If I leave, people may not know what I know. People may not have experienced what I experienced, people may not have all the respect I have both in Igbo land and outside Igbo land.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nAnd so, I want to see to it. If God continues to spare my life, I want the government to help me; I want Ndigbo to use me and allow me to help find the solution. God may have continued to spare my life to continue to solve a problem and a situation like this.\n\nAre you confident that a Nigeria President of Igbo extraction is going to be possible this time?\n\nYou see, we are approaching the year of presidential election. The South East are saying and rightly too that if it is not a conspiracy against the South East, then they should, in good conscience, be allowed to present, nominate and win the next presidential election. And of course, I have always told them that to win election, you have to work, you have to organise, you have to strategize and you have to finance it. There are so many issues involved in winning an election.\n\nNothing is impossible. With God, nothing is impossible. If God says peace to Nigeria, to Igbo presidency you may be surprised; you may find an unknown horse coming out from Igbo nation to be a President of Nigeria. It may not be any of the old controversial Igbo leaders or something. He may just bring up an unknown person. And I recommend it to government because that is the easiest way to send the country back to what we created when we inherited Nigeria and created Nigeria from Britain, what we desired to hand over to our children unborn until unpatriotic military people came in and took over the government and continued ruling the country for a whole 38 years.\n\nSomeone like Bola Tinubu from South West and others from other zones are preparing strongly for the 2023 presidential election against the thinking that the next president should come from Igbo land. How do you look at that?\n\nIf it is the popular wish that the Igbo should produce the next president of the country, let the political parties prove it at the convention. Tinubu is contesting from one state of Yoruba land. There are other 35 States. Let the other 35 states say no. It is left for the other 35 states to say no, that it must be an Igbo man.\n\nWith the presidential election coming up early next year, do you think that Igbo aspirants for the election are preparing the way they should?\n\nHow much are we reaching out? But we are already paving the way to lose the presidency. The Igbo are too far now, paving the way to lose the chance to produce the next President next year by the number of the Igbo declaring that they want to contest. If five or six Igbo contest, they will split the votes. They will split the Igbo votes. That is creating chances for other people. They will be splitting their votes and maybe give Tinubu the chance. They are already paving the way to lose the election.\n\nAs far back as May last year, I called a joint meeting of the PDP and APC from the South East in my house here. APC came in a good number. PDP sent only one person or two persons. But look at the multitude that is coming out from the PDP. How do they think they can get the party nomination? So, they have to start all over again. They can listen to other Igbo leaders, if they don\u2019t want me, that\u2019s okay. But Ohanaeze should be strong enough, other Igbo organizations should be really strong enough to bring together all the aspirants and tell them you, you, you step aside. Let one person go and contest.\n\nI\u2019m aware that other states in the North, South West and even in the Delta are interested to give Igbo the chance to produce the next President, to give them a sense of belonging. Because, right now, they are made to feel that they are not fully part of Nigeria. But I know that there are many states in the North, in the West, in the Delta area who are now prepared to give the Igbo a chance. But if the Igbo are given the chance and they don\u2019t want the chance to be properly used, who will they blame? Will they blame the people who gave them the opportunity to produce the next president? So, they should come together and listen to the voice of reason or get prepared to accept the responsibility that they have failed the Igbo race and destroyed the chances of their children unborn.\n\nWhat should be the barometer to choose the right candidate to run the presidential race for the Igbo?\n\nIn a party I belonged to before, when I was in politics, we did it. There were so many aspirants like that and I presided over a meeting that brought the number from 13 to three. It can be done now.",

          "title": "Osinbajo: Only Leaders Not Inspired by Personal Profit Can Bring about National Transformation",
          "text": "* Asserts Nigeria will overcome its challenges and rise again\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\n\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo yesterday took a deep look at the countless problems bedeviling Nigeria and declared that only people not inspired by personal profit could bring about the desired national transformation in the country.\n\nOsinbajo, who was speaking in Abuja at the 1st Annual General Assembly of Catholics in Politics and Catholic Business Leaders, also highlighted the imperative of servant leadership and transformational leadership at different levels in society as a force for the common good.\n\nHe said: \u201cHistory teaches us that everywhere there has been a national transformation, it has been brought about by public-spirited men and women of goodwill who, inspired by their belief in a higher purpose other than their own profit, have entered the public square to champion the common good.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo said transformational leadership, particularly in a multi-ethnic and multi-faceted country like Nigeria, \u201cis needed\u201d across all levels of government and spheres of society, as its primary focus is the pursuit of the common good to ensure fairness, justice, unity and development in a nation.\n\nAccording to the VP, \u201cbuilding credible institutions of justice, the rule of law and orderly society are crucial expressions of the pursuit of the common good.\u201d\n\nRecalling the words of His Holiness Pope John Paul II during his visit to Nigeria in February 1982 in an address at the State House in Lagos, the VP stated, \u201conly the harnessing of all the forces for the common good, in true respect of the supreme values of the spirit, will make a nation great and a happy dwelling place for its people.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President stated that the common good as an imperative of public policy and governance was articulated by the second chapter of the Nigerian Constitution, adding, \u201cThe challenge of actualising the common good is coterminous with our quest to actualise the Directive Principles and Objectives of State Policy. Achieving both requires transformational leadership across all levels and spheres of our society.\u201d\n\nHighlighting why transformational leadership is critical to national life, the VP noted that it would spur positive changes across all sectors and spheres of society.\n\nHe added that as a model of leadership, transformational leadership operates by serving and uplifting others because it is servant leadership.\n\nThe VP noted: \u201cThe purpose of power is service, not domination; it is to uplift and empower others rather than to control or oppress. This is a model of leadership that is inseparable from our conception of the common good.\n\n\u201cTransformational leadership is, therefore, the pursuit of the common good. But the pursuit of the common good itself is not as easy as it sounds. This is especially so where the wounds and enmities of ethnic and religious conflicts are deep.\n\n\u201cThe common type of leadership will seek the path of relevance and popularity within their own ethnic or religious camps by seeking only the good of their own. The servant-leader will serve his people by emphasising the letter and spirit of the gospel that even our worst enemies were still made in the image of God.\n\n\u201cAnd the pursuit of the common good is the pursuit of the good of those who hate us and have hurt us even in the recent past.\n\n\u201cTransformational leadership means that we do not mourn and condemn the killing of those who belong to our own tribe or faith alone, or seek justice for ours alone, because all men are equal before God, and that the pain and anguish of a mother\u2019s loss of a child, is not different from one faith or tongue to the other.\u201d\n\nOne of the ways to cultivate the values that promote the common good (that seeks out the good of others) is in the delivery of justice and cementing the foundations of integrity in society, the Vice President noted.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe most progressive expressions of faith are concerned with justice and justice is impossible without taking the institutions that govern public life into account. In this sense, the purpose of governance and public policy is to establish a paradigm of justice that is measured by how well society deals with its most vulnerable members, settle disputes fairly and speedily, meting out punishment to violators of law without bias or fear.\n\n\u201cOur courts of law must be courts of justice. It means that we must pay attention to the quality and caliber of the men and women who are appointed judges. We must be concerned with their remuneration, and welfare. We must be unrelenting on insisting on their integrity.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo also described corruption as a \u201ccancer\u201d noting that \u201cthe cancer in governments anywhere is corruption: \u201cWhen public officials, (be they high or low in the executive, legislature or judiciary) are toll gates for the extortion of the populace while seeking government dispensations, the common good, happy and prosperous lives for the people is impossible.\u201d\n\nHe added that the pursuit of the common good must \u201cinvolve a relentless pursuit of integrity and transparency of public officers: \u201cWe must think through the systems that will reduce human discretion in public-facing institutions. So we must, as a collective, condemn and call out corruption and corrupt practices.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President also encouraged Nigerians not to despair, despite some of the challenges, but have hope and belief in the promise of a great nation while urging that Nigerians must be willing to pay the price to achieve national greatness by actively pursuing the common good of all, regardless of tribal and religious differences.\n\n\u201cFulfilling the immense promise of our nation requires men and women of goodwill from various communities and faiths to collaborate in advancing the common good. This is all the more important because it is such coalitions that can heal society of the wounds inflicted by the crude identity politics of religion and ethnicity.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur future will be shaped by how well we make common cause with other citizens of progressive persuasions to transform our communities,\u201d said the Vice President.\n\nHe emphasised the importance of forging collaborative partnerships, \u201cnot only within ourselves but with other forces which are committed to the common good to positively impact society.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo adds: \u201cOur greatest adversary in our task of national renewal is a feeling of hopelessness \u2013 a sense of futility that seems almost overwhelming. However, we cannot afford to even indulge in such despondency and despair. There is hope and there is much work to be done.\n\n\u201cNigeria will overcome its challenges and rise again. Contrary to opinion in some quarters, this house will not fall. It is being built and needs yet many more people to commit to building the sort of nation that we want. The throes and pangs of birth must not be interpreted as the pains of impending death. We are by the grace of God, more than able to overcome our present difficulties and we will overcome them.\u201d\n\nThe summit, otherwise known as the AGORA Conference, had as theme: \u201cThe Advancement of the Common Good towards Justice, Unity, Structure and Development of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Buhari also addressed the security challenges confronting the country and said his administration was committed to ensuring that peace reigned in every nook and cranny of the country.\n\nThe president spoke in Sokoto, at the inauguration of an ultra-modern three million metric tonnes per annum BUA Cement Sokoto line four factory. He expressed delight in his administration\u2019s policies on economic diversification, job creation, and creating an enabling environment for businesses to thrive, saying they are working.\n\nGovernor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, in his address at the ceremony, urged manufacturers in the country to urgently control the rising prices of cement and other building materials.\n\nIn his remarks, Founder and Chairman of BUA Group, Alhaji Abdul Samad Rabiu, disclosed that his company was targeting to ramp up its total production capacity to 17 million metric tonnes of cement per annum next year.\n\nBuhari pledged that his administration would continue to support serious investors to set up businesses that would take advantage of the huge reservoir of resources in different parts of the country.\n\nThe president said, \u201cAs you all know, one of the key economic pillars of our administration has been to create an enabling environment for businesses to thrive. This is necessary for job creation and, indeed, for our economy and national security.\n\n\u201cIn the past few weeks, I visited Ogun and Kaduna states, where I observed many private sector investments in action. And today, I am here in Sokoto to commission this multi-billion Naira project.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, very clear for all to see that our policies are working. Progress is gradually being made in all parts of the country.\u201d\n\nHe emphasised his commitment to peace and stability in all parts of Nigeria, listing a raft of measures undertaken by this administration to ensure that normalcy returned to troubled areas.\n\nAccording to Buhari, \u201cWe continue to recruit and equip security personnel while expanding our social investment programmes to support the youth and some of the most vulnerable members of our communities.\n\n\u201cYou should all be reassured that we will win this battle against the criminal elements looking to destabilise our nation by hindering the progress of our economy.\u201d\n\nBuhari thanked Rabiu and the entire team for the great work they were doing in supporting the government\u2019s economic diversification and job creation agenda. He noted that the company, which had completed four new cement plants of similar capacity in the last five years in different parts of the country and was set to complete two more plants soon, had shown through these investments that they believed in Nigeria and its potential.\n\nCommending BUA and other entrepreneurs for making Nigeria self-sufficient in cement and a net exporter of the strategic product, the president said, \u201cI am pleased that through these investments, BUA Cement has created employment opportunities for our citizens. Today, BUA is the largest employer of labour in the North-west region.\n\n\u201cI always remind Nigerians that every region, indeed, every state, in Nigeria sits on huge reserves of resources. For example, in this area, Kebbi, Sokoto and Zamfara can boast of rice production, gold and other precious metals development and, of course, heavy industries like cement manufacturing.\n\n\u201cAs a government, we introduced policies and mechanisms to support such investments in a legal, ethical and inclusive manner. For example, we have the National Food Security Council on Food Security Matters and the Presidential Artisanal Gold Mining Development Initiative to develop local artisanal gold mining and ensure health and safety of mining workers and protect the environment.\n\n\u201cWe remain prepared to support serious investors to set up businesses that will take advantage of these opportunities through value addition so as to take advantage of the huge market here, as well as in the greater African region and the world at large.\u201d\n\nHighlighting other efforts to bring even development to all parts of the country, Buhari expressed confidence that the Ajaokuta\u2013Kaduna\u2013Kano (AKK) gas project, when completed, will bring gas for domestic and industrial purposes from the South-south to the South-east, North-central, and North-west geopolitical zones. He said the AKK project would significantly reduce the cost of operation for industries in the regions.\n\nThe president also reassured Nigerians that his government would continue to invest heavily in roads and rails to ease movement of people, goods and services, with a view to facilitating trade, while lowering logistics costs associated with the inefficiencies of bad roads and bridges.\n\nHe stated, \u201cI want to now call on all entrepreneurs and businesses to emulate what is being done here. The task of nation building requires all hands to be on deck. The public and private sectors must collaborate if we are to achieve our aim of collective peace and prosperity across the entire nation.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier, Emefiele urged manufacturers to urgently address the rising prices of building materials, including cement.\n\nNigerians have continued to lament the soaring price of cement in recent times and urge the government to intervene.\n\nEmefiele stressed that manufacturers must first strive to satisfy the local market to help make cement affordable before exporting the product to external markets.\n\nHe said, \u201cIndeed, there has recently been calls by construction companies urging our steel and cement manufacturers to do something about the sky-rocketing of these two essential items in the construction industry.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said the cement industry remained key to solving the country\u2019s unemployment challenges as well as boosting growth.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe are aware that some of our cement manufacturers are producing for both the domestic and export markets, but we urge them to pay more attention to satisfying the domestic needs so as to bring down prices.\u201d\n\nEmefiele reiterated the apex bank\u2019s commitment to providing needed support for importation of spares, plants and equipment needed to increase the production capacities of cement plants in the country. While calling on prospective investors to take advantage of the current incentives provided by government to boost the sector, he said the CBN was ready to provide the needed financing for both current and new investors in the industrial sector for the importation of requisite machinery.\n\nHe pointed out that as part of the efforts by the current administration to drive productivity in the industrial sector and conserve foreign exchange, a decision was taken by the government in 2015 to restrict access to foreign exchange for imports of 43 items, which could be produced in Nigeria, but for which billions of US Dollars were being expended annually on imports.\n\nThe CBN governor said cement was one of the restricted items, adding that in making the decision, government was aware that the key raw material required for the production of cement is limestone, which is readily available across the country. He said the decision of the apex bank to ban cement importation had yielded great results, pointing out that the country\u2019s cement production capacity has since more than doubled from 30 MTPA in 2014 to 60 MTPA in 2021.\n\nThe CBN governor said no dollar had been spent from the country\u2019s reserves on cement importation in the past seven years following the restriction placed on the importation of the commodity.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur nation has been able to conserve billions of dollars, as no dollar from our external reserves has been spent on imports of cement into the country in the last seven years.\u201d\n\nHe said the investments had saved and created several thousands of jobs across multiple sectors.\n\nEmefiele pointed out that the achievements so far recorded in the cement sector were not a coincidence but a reflection of the success of the backward integration policy of the Buhari administration.\n\nThe CBN governor said with significant opportunities in housing, construction and related industries, there were still sufficient room for additional investments in the sector. He urged potential investors to take advantage of these opportunities.\n\nHe also assured current and prospective investors in the industrial sector that the apex bank was ready to collaborate with stakeholders to facilitate the development of a viable manufacturing sector in Nigeria.\n\nEmefiele said, \u201cFor those who are willing to invest in new Greenfields or existing Brownfield projects, the CBN will provide all the support needed both in naira and dollars to import plant and equipment to actualise your dreams.\u201d\n\nHe said the CBN\u2019s stance was in harmony with the apex bank\u2019s resolve to create a professional and people-oriented central bank to act as financial catalyst for job creation and inclusive growth in Nigeria.\n\nEmefiele said, \u201cI am particularly delighted to see that the painstaking efforts and ingenuity of Nigeria\u2019s private sector are yielding bountiful fruits in broad daylight.\n\n\u201cThese efforts, such as the one being displayed here today by the BUA Group, are critical complementary ingredients to reducing unemployment and boosting production activities in our country.\n\n\u201cNot least, also, these investments help to support the CBN\u2019s mandate of promoting stable macro-economic growth in the country.\n\n\u201cI would, therefore, like to congratulate the BUA Group led by its inspirational and imitable Group CEO, Alhaji Adbul Samad Rabiu, for this investment.\u201d\n\nEmefiele stated further, \u201cThe BUA Group\u2019s investment in Sokoto and in other parts of Nigeria reflects their belief in our country, and in the immense opportunities available in the industrial sector, given the abundance of human and natural resources in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am aware that this facility, which cost millions of US Dollars, was fully funded by equity contributions of the BUA Group without resorting to any source of external finance\u2026\n\n\u201cFollowing implementation of this new directive, I am pleased to note that the production capacity of the cement industry in Nigeria has doubled from 30 million tonnes in 2014 to about 60m tonnes in 2021.\u201d\n\nIn his welcome address, Rabiu recalled that Buhari inaugurated the second line of the cement company\u2019s plant in 1985 when he was Head of State.\n\nThe industrialist pointed out that in the past six years, \u201cWe have completed four plants \u2013 two in Obu, Edo State and two in Sokoto (of which this Sokoto line 4 is the fourth) with BUA\u2019s total production capacity now standing at 11 million tonnes with the completion of this plant.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that next year, BUA Group intended to complete the construction of two new plants of three million metric tonnes each, saying construction is already on-going \u2013 one in Edo and the other in Sokoto.\n\n\u201cWe expect these plants to be completed next year, which will bring our total production capacity to 17million metric tonnes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look forward to Your Excellency coming to commission them by the first quarter of 2023,\u201d he added.\n\nRabiu pledged that BUA would continue to invest in the cement industry until Nigeria became self-sufficient and cement was made available, accessible, and affordable for all Nigerians.\n\nHe stated, \u201cMr. President, there are many reasons one can attribute to the important nature of this plant. The attendant effect of these investments in new factories goes beyond the community and the state. It extends to the region and the entire country.\n\n\u201cFrom a job creation and economic standpoint, the Sokoto plant continues to be the largest private sector employer of labour in the North-western part of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAlso, by adding value to resources mined in Nigeria, Nigeria is being saved billions of US dollars in foreign exchange that would have been spent on importation, whilst also ensuring product availability.\n\n\u201cIn fact, 95 per cent of all the raw materials used in our cement manufacturing process are sourced locally. In addition to this, and our investment in social impact and CSR programmes for the community and Sokoto State at all levels, we are also committed to environmental sustainability.\n\n\u201cWe have diversified our energy sources by introducing greener alternatives \u2013 in this case, LNG \u2013 to power the kiln and 48 megawatts power plant. Our power plants are now running on 100 per cent LNG, leading to reduced carbon emissions. This is the first of its kind at any cement factory in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nRabiu said this meant also that as soon as the AKK gas project came on stream, BUA would be ready to be one of the first off-takers.\n\nThis would also encourage further industrialisation within the region, open new industries and ensure greater development and prosperity for this region and the country in general.\n\n\u201cMr President, Sir, all of this will not have been possible without your support and commitment to the development of the Nigerian economy,\u201d Rabiu told Buhari.\n\nHe added, \u201cAs a proudly Nigerian company, we will do our best to continue to support those efforts. The support of the CBN and its governor in setting up this gigantic project is also worthy of mention.\n\n\u201cSo far, we have invested over a billion dollars in the past four years and we urge the CBN to continue to support industries like ours that use locally sourced raw materials to add value because, as mentioned earlier, these industries potentially save the country billions of dollars yearly and also ensure products are readily available across the length and breadth of the country.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Shortage of dead bodies hindering anatomy study in Nigeria, says UNILORIN prof",
          "text": "Moyosore Ajao, an anatomy professor at the University of Ilorin (UNILORIN), has further spoken on his comments about how a shortage of cadavers across Nigerian medical schools is hindering learning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAjao, in an inaugural lecture at the varsity, spoke of issues bordering on the dissection of bodies for medical studies.\n\nInaugural lectures happen once in the lifetime of most senior academics and often showcase their work in the field.\n\nAjao addressed a topic that gained media attention in what became the 214th inaugural lecture at the university.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was titled: \u201cThe belly, brain, and environmental toxins: Balancing the conflicts between necessity and cost\u201d.\n\nAjao said the non-availability of cadavers for practical classes impedes the study of anatomy, especially in Nigeria.\n\nThe comment had many Nigerians raising their brows and, as Ajao argued, rethinking the matter \u201cout of context\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAcross the globe, medical schools have had to address a shortage of dead bodies while others remain unaffected.\n\n\u201cIf they purchase the book, they would\u2019ve read what I said. What people pick on social media is their problem. A lot of these people don\u2019t understand what we do in anatomy. They need to research and educate themselves,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHow many Nigerians donate bodies to anatomy departments for use in medical research when they die? The recommendation is that you must have eight students to one dead body for use during dissection classes.\n\n\u201cBut you have a situation where one body is used by 50. Does that make for good learning? If you have multiple medical schools coming up across Nigeria and you don\u2019t have the facilities to train, what are we talking about?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople just take things out of context, talking as though we would go and pick dead bodies from the streets. Go back in history and see what they did to arrest the situation when there were shortages of cadavers in Britain.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s legal backing for cadavers in anatomical research\n\nThe sources of human tissue used for medical research depend on local legislation, the awareness and willingness of the population to contribute to anatomy education, cultural and religious customs, and socioeconomic factors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, the most common sources are body donation programs and \u201cunclaimed\u201d dead bodies \u2014 that is, bodies of individuals who die without relatives or friends to claim them for burial or without the means to afford a burial.\n\nIn some countries with a shortage of available bodies, anatomists end up importing cadavers from other countries.\n\nIn Nigeria, the Anatomy Act regulates, permits medical practitioners, superintendents of schools of anatomy, teachers in such schools, or any student attending such school to anatomically examine or dissect received bodies.\n\nIt came into force in 1933 and remains the main regulatory instrument covering its sphere of operation in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNew developments have taken place over time, hence, there have been several calls to ensure the law is updated.\n\nThe act permits certain persons to take and examine a body anatomically as long as they are permitted by a person who had, at the time, lawful possession of the body and who had the powers pursuant to the provisions of the act.\n\nIt also accounts for offences contravening its provisions but doesn\u2019t capture an actual procedure for body donation.\n\nAjao calls for repeal, re-enactment of Anatomy Act\n\nAjao touched on how laws can be proposed to guide programmes covering body donations and unclaimed corpses.\n\n\u201cOne solution is that the government should look into the repeal and reenactment of the Anatomical Act. If we look into the proposed act, we may be able to find some way around the strategies of cadavers,\u201d the professor added.\n\n\u201cIn the training of medical doctors and health-related disciplines, people need to dissect human bodies. It\u2019s not just about looking at 3D pictures or computer simulations. No. You need an actual human body to dissect.\n\n\u201cIf they are not there, what do we do? What the lecture spoke of is that we have a shortage. It\u2019s not the first time. This has been a challenge all over the world. In advanced countries, you solve this by having a system in place\n\n\u201cPeople get to donate to medical schools and colleges. If they die, they\u2019re taken there. FG should identify laws that will allow dead prisoners, destitute, and unclaimed bodies to be given to schools. That solves a lot of problems.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable. All rights reserved.

In 2020 when the world was literally coming down to its knees, the world shut down on us. I couldn\u2019t go with him to the US and we couldn\u2019t go back to Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t go to England to be with his cousins. It gave me the impetus to think outside the box about what to do. We were stuck in Paris for six months of lockdown. I didn\u2019t know what to do with my life.\n\n\u201cMy plan was, during my short stay after \u2018Bad Comments\u2019 in 2022, I\u2019ll go do a course in Havard University. I decided that was when I\u2019d write. But in six months doing nothing, I grew unsettled. I decided to write \u2018The Gift of the Odds\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fifteen series book. There\u2019s a subtitle for everyone and it\u2019s different volumes. This volume is called \u2018Walking Through Walls\u2019 and teaches you how to walk to challenges and making time your ally.\u201d\n\nDuring the virtual pre-launch, which hosted several hundreds of attendees, the actor touched on having been broke and how he had learned some of the life principles he abides by today at the feet of mentors and brilliant minds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNo matter what you\u2019re going through in life, that too will pass. The let-it-pass ideology has become the userguide and a roadmap with which I deal with situations I\u2019ve faced. We have a volume that dealt with grief,\u201d Iyke added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to lose a child in my life. These are the things I cater to in this book. I spoke about love, companionship, raising kids, finding your path in life alone, building startups, career development, tiers of friendship.\n\n\u201cI spoke about how I made things happen even in times of great uncertainty.

          "title": "What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?",
          "text": "Do you need a guide for all the big tech terms people are throwing about on the internet? What do blockchain, NFT, DAO and crypto mean?\n\nOver the past couple of years, there\u2019s been an influx of words that explain certain tech concepts. Some of them like crypto, or even NFTs, have been around for a while. In fact, NFT\u2014as a word\u2014was first used in 2014 and now, 7 years later, it\u2019s still a concept that escapes a lot of us. Others like DeFi or DAOs are fairly new, but they\u2019re still getting thrown around a lot.\n\nWhether you\u2019re new or old to tech, reading about concepts can feel like learning a new language. So TechCabal is creating a guide\u2014short explainers\u2014for common tech terms. In this, you\u2019re sure to find simple short explanations that can help you understand NiFTy concepts.\n\n1. Blockchain\n\nA few of the concepts we\u2019ll explain here are based on blockchain so it\u2019s important this goes first.\n\nBlockchain is a record-keeping tech that\u2019s designed to make it impossible to hack the system or forge the data stored on it.\n\nHow it works: Standard databases store data in rows, columns and files, but blockchain stores data in blocks that are chained together. The data on the blocks are continuously updated, encrypted, and stored on several computers so there\u2019s no single computer to hack or control the data from.\n\nIn explaining blockchain, Buchi Okoro\u2014CEO and co-founder of African cryptocurrency exchange Quidax\u2014said: \u201cImagine a book where you write down everything you spend money on each day. Each page is similar to a block, and the entire book, a group of pages, is a blockchain. With a blockchain, everyone who uses a cryptocurrency has their own copy of this book to create a unified transaction record. The software logs each new transaction as it happens, and every copy of the blockchain is updated simultaneously with the new information, keeping all records identical and accurate.\u201d\n\n2. Cryptocurrency\n\nImage source: Aceris Law\n\nWe all know what currencies are\u2014dollars, pounds, shillings. Well, cryptocurrencies are digital currencies. You can\u2019t hold it the way you\u2019d hold fiat currencies like CFA coins or naira notes, but you can still spend it on things you love.\n\nHow it works: Cryptos are digital currencies created on blockchain technology. If you got a sense of what blockchains are, then you\u2019ll understand what we mean when we say that cryptocurrencies are decentralised; no one person or government controls them. They are created by algorithms and used to award engineers\u2014called miners\u2014who carry out maintenance on the blockchain.\n\nUnlike fiat currencies which derive their value and validity from states, cryptocurrencies derive their value and validity from the blockchain.\n\n3. Non-fungible token (NFT)\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by its mushroom-sounding title, NFTs are in fact inedible, even the NFT flavours. NFTs are unique digital assets created on a blockchain.\n\nHow it works: To put it simply, NFTs are digital works that exist on blockchain. They can be images, sounds, game skins, or even clothes for your digital avatars. These digital works are impossible to duplicate or forge; they\u2019re one of a kind and that makes them valuable. If you\u2019re asking yourself why a screenshot of an NFT isn\u2019t as valuable, it\u2019s because NFTs have been embedded with code which is what makes them exist on the blockchain.\n\nThink of it this way, when you go to a museum and take photos of artefacts, what you have is just a photo which isn\u2019t quite valuable. The museum still has the original valuable artefact.\n\nIt\u2019s similar with NFTs. We can take screenshots of Niyi Okeowo\u2019s $2,800 Indigo Child (below) but it doesn\u2019t mean we own the asset. The original copy\u2014the property rights and certificate of authenticity\u2014belong to the buyer.\n\nNiyi Okeowo\u2019s \u201cIndigo Child\u201d\n\n4. Web3\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen tech bros throw the word \u201cWeb3\u201d around a lot. It\u2019s the answer experts give to questions from \u201cWhat is the future of the internet?\u201d to \u201cWhat does Spiderman navigate the internet with?\u201d\n\nBut what exactly is Web3? To put it simply, Web3 is taking democracy to the internet.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at Web3\u2019s ancestors, Web1 and Web2, so we can understand what it\u2019s all about.\n\nWeb1 was the earliest version of the internet, which existed between the 1900s and the early 2000s. In this version, content was delivered via texts and graphics to users who could only consume the content but not interact with it.\n\nWeb2 is what we have now, an interactive and social web where companies can build revolutionary apps that allow users to become creators. It\u2019s centralised, i.e. controlled by companies or governments who can decide when websites, apps or content can be taken down with little input from users.\n\nOn Web2, apps are only available for as long as the company that owns them decides. Streaming sites can shut down, online games can upload patches users don\u2019t like (yes, I\u2019m looking at you Riot Games), and traditional banks can freeze bank accounts when the government demands it.\n\nHow Web3 works: Web3 will be built on the blockchain working independently from different parts of the world.\n\nOn Web3, decisions regarding the design and operation of products and funds\u2014including crypto\u2014will be made by communities of people called Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), and not governments or companies. So if you find an app or product you like, you can join the DAO of that product, buy shares and vote on which changes should be made.\n\nFor example, if you joined TechCabal\u2019s DAO, you\u2019ll get to decide how we upgrade or downgrade depending on how much shares you have in the DAO.\n\n5. Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)\n\nDAOs or Decentralised Autonomous Organisations are social communities that will create rules and regulations which will be embedded in programming codes.\n\nHow it works: Unlike conventional organisations like TechCabal, which have managers and boards of directors that govern it, DAOs are governed by communities\u2014who don\u2019t have to be developers of the product. DAOs are created by developers who decide on a set of rules and embed it in\u2014digital contracts on blockchain that are executed when certain conditions are met.\n\nThe communities decide what happens to the products attached to that DAO, what upgrades to make and when to make it. Each DAO will have its own token which will be sold to its community members, and the more tokens you have, the heavier your stake and voting rights.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigerian musician Buju wanted to reward his fans, so he created an NFT project",
          "text": "Towards the end of 2020, project lead of \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201d, Iyobosa Rehoboth, a creative director of Global Creative Operations (GCO), started brushing up on his knowledge of crypto. After learning extensively about ethereum and NFTs, he started selling the idea of an NFT project to several Nigerian music artistes.\n\nThe award-winning music director, popularly known as Prodigeezy, had initially created a design for a joint NFT project for the trio of Nigerian music superstars, Davido, Wizkid, and Burna Boy, but when he realised that getting the three of them to collaborate on something would be difficult, he abandoned the project.\n\nRehoboth presented his design to some other artistes, who rejected it, until he got it to a Nigerian musician, Daniel Benson, popularly known as Buju. \u201cBuju was open-minded. Having made tremendous progress with his career that year, he was keen on making his brand a global one,\u201d Prodigeezy said. Buju was also, at the time, working on a comic book idea, so it was fairly easy to convince him.\n\nBuju released the remix of \u201cItaly\u201d, featuring Blaq Diamond, with a colourful artwork of his head as the song\u2019s cover. He didn\u2019t want to release a full song, so he uploaded \u201cItaly\u201d to multiple streaming platforms. Before he knew it, it was making waves and, unknown to his many fans jamming to the song, the colourful art cover is in fact an unreleased NFT project.\n\nBuju had seen the NFT project as an opportunity to build a community around his fans, reward and connect with them like never before. \u201cI feel like it is something that people are going to enjoy. I\u2019m always working on a lot of recordings. I feel like it is the best way I could reward people that enjoy my music,\u201d Buju said.\n\nThis Sunday, on a Twitter Space, Buju and the team behind the project offered more details about his NFT project \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201c, a collection of 10,001 unique NFTs of his face. Holders of these NFTs would get perks like access to physical and virtual concerts hosted by Buju, merch items, and a part of the revenue the musician makes from specific music projects.\n\nBuju explained that he would drop more songs, mixtapes, and refixes, and that the project would motivate him to drop some of the songs he has been recording for years now. Buju said that he is always dropping snippets and imagines that holders of \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201d will be able to claim ownership of some of the snippets he drops.\n\nHe said that while he hasn\u2019t decided the arrangement for the sharing revenue with holders, holders will have a fraction of ownership of some of his songs, which will allow them to earn part of his streaming revenue.\n\nThe roadmap for the project, whose Discord channel has close to 4,500 members, is divided into 3 quarters for this year. More plans will be provided in quarter 1of 2023.\n\nfloats, an extended reality company under GCO, which is building the project, will start and intensify an educational campaign to teach people the fundamentals of blockchain, onboard people into crypto, help them set up a wallet, and educate them about the polygon network.\n\nIn this quarter, the \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201d project will be minted publicly and pre-sale will start. It is then holders will begin to get some of the perks of the project. This includes access to PlaySpace, an AR filter for Snapchat and Instagram that takes users through Buju\u2019s career and also offers access to special events and interaction with Buju. Some of the other perks are an airdrop and a life membership mic that unlocks more possibilities in the metaverse and in real life.\n\nIn the second quarter, when Buju announces the release of his debut album, another limited collection of NFTs will be released, which will help holders unlock special access to Buju\u2019s concerts, events, and studio sessions. Merch items with virtual and physical utility will also be released, and some of the virtual merch will contain unlockable NFT content.\n\nThe HeadsByBuju project will dedicate 10% of its primary sales to a creator fund, and the entire community of holders will vote to decide what kind of creative project it would be. This creator fund will also be used to purchase some land in metaverses like Decentraland and Cryptovoxels.\n\nTo ensure that holders reap real-world benefits, the project is collaborating with restaurants, clubs, hotels, and health centres to provide discounts for holders.\n\nThe \u201cHeadsByBuju\u201d team wants to build the project on the polygon network, instead of the ethereum network\u2014which NFT projects are usually based on\u2014because they want to get as many people as possible onboarded to the blockchain. While developing the project, the team spoke with prospective users and discovered that the biggest problem to getting onboarded into the space was ethereum\u2019s high gas fees\u2014the amount of money you pay to execute any command on the ethereum network. So, to make onboarding easier for their audience, some of whom are interacting with NFTs for the first time, they said they want a popular and efficient marketplace and less expensive protocol, and polygon ticked all the boxes.\n\nThis is perhaps the first time any African musician has tried to use crypto technology to establish a connection with fans and reward them.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Employers use the platform by uploading their employees and setting a budget. Employees can choose from over 100 Health Plans from top HMOs in Nigeria\u201d Olude told Techpoint at the event.\n\n\u201d roHealth is on a mission to increase access to healthcare in Nigerians by providing free health Insurance for a limited period. A lot of companies do not trust HMOs and believe that it does not provide value to their employees. We are here to give them the opportunity to get their employees to try it out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlalekan Olude, roHealth CEO\n\nPaycentre is one of the biggest Agent Banking Networks in the Country with over 80,000 Agents nationwide while Connect Nigeria is an online database with more than 300,000 companies offering information about businesses, real estate, technology, entertainment, and more.\n\nConnect Nigeria houses close to 300,000 companies and for us it is a synergy having a healthcare platform and another platform that wants to preach the message of delivering healthcare to its customers.\n\nWith access to roHealth\u2019s APIs, their partners can achieve their goals of bringing Healthcare closer to their customers and staff. These partnerships would help roHealth reach millions of Nigerians faster.\n\n\u201cNigerians have different health needs and budgets, but what we\u2019ve realised from our partners is that partnering with one HMO excludes them from working with another. But working with roHealth as a partner creates that opportunity to be able to connect as many HMOs as possible by connecting to the roHealth APIs as a service\u201d.\n\nBusinesses with a minimum of 5 Staff can access this offering on the roHealth website \u2013 https://www.rohealth.ng/free-trial and benefits covering Laboratory, Accidents, Surgery and other medical expenses.\n\nLaunching in Nigeria\n\nOlalekan believes that the future of healthcare Insurance would largely be a function of coverage funded by someone.\n\n\u201cIn most countries, Healthcare is usually paid for by the government, through taxes or by the employer in part or in full, but a lot of Nigerians are exposed to zero healthcare coverage and this is because the channels through which they consume services haven\u2019t thought about giving them healthcare to them or covering them as part of their customers or workers.\u201d\n\nThe goal is to deliver the opportunity for all Nigerians to have healthcare coverage wherever they may be through an employer, the informal sector, or services \u2014 buying data, airtime, food, etc \u2014 that people use.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis launch is a pilot for expansion across Africa where it can deploy its solution which allows employees choose healthcare plans that fit them within a set budget by their employer.\n\nAt the event, Olude said there are plans to work with banks, retail shops and businesses, among others, to enable customers to get healthcare coverage after spending a certain amount within a month.\n\n\u201cSay for example, you buy stuff at Shoprite, based on some of the partnerships we are working on, once you buy produce up to a certain amount, Shoprite automatically covers your healthcare for that month.\u201d\n\nA customer who meets the requirements is automatically covered for that month, without having to change their lifestyle or their spend.\n\nSince its inception 4 months ago, over 7000 lives and 500 businesses actively use roHealth for making their health coverage decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent Coverage by Techpoint Africa Looking to promote your industry event?

          "title": "Using its credit analytics solution, Periculum wants to improve financial inclusion for Nigerians",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Amirah graduated from the Obafemi Awolowo University, she found it difficult to get a job despite her second class upper grade in economics. Six months into her search, she was getting frustrated. While hanging out with friends, one suggested that she start a tailoring business. As a student, she had made most of her dresses and even made some for her friends.\n\nThey were confident she could build a business out of her skill. But there was a problem. She needed to get a sewing machine but had burnt through her savings during her job search. She could ask her friends for a loan, but like her, they were also broke.\n\nWhile this is a fictional story, it paints a picture of numerous people in emerging markets like Nigeria. For Amirah, she could take out a loan, but only a few financial institutions would offer her one.\n\nAccess to credit is crucial for the growth of an economy. It gives access to consumers who would otherwise have been unable to afford certain products. However, no one gives out loans for fun. Financial institutions need to get these loans back with interest after a certain period and without a good enough guarantee of that, they will desist from granting these loans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat has been the case in Nigeria, where commercial banks have shied away from granting loans to most people but instead focused on a few high net worth individuals. In the past few years, fintech startups like Carbon and FairMoney have sprung up looking to solve this problem using proprietary technology.\n\nWhile some focus on lending, others embed it as a part of their service offerings. Still, one similarity is their use of technology to determine the creditworthiness of customers before granting loans.\n\nImproving access to credit for underserved markets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot all organisations have this capability, and this is where Periculum believes it has found its sweet spot. Like many Nigerians have done in the past few years, Michael Temitope Collins moved to Canada for his university education, where he studied business administration and management at Thompson Rivers University.\n\nAfter graduation, he worked at a couple of Canadian banks and started a few businesses himself. While working at these banks, he researched and discovered many underserved customers, even in Canada.\n\n\u201cI started out working in the bank and discovered that we have many underserved customers, so I decided to do some research.\n\n\u201cI realised that even in Canada, there\u2019s a pretty significant number of people that are underserved by the financial system. When you scale that out to emerging markets like Africa, Latin America, and South-east Asia, that number of underserved individuals is a lot higher.\u201d\n\nHis research also showed that one reason for the problem was the inability of financial institutions to assess individuals and their creditworthiness accurately. With this knowledge, he built a solution \u2014 Periculum \u2014 using existing financial and non-financial datasets.\n\nThe startup, launched in 2019, has seen some traction, getting into Techstars Toronto in 2021 and raising a pre-seed round of $620,000 from investors such as Loyal VC, First Fund, and White Hibiscus Capital, which Collins says exceeded their initial goal of $500k. Although the startup has clients across three continents \u2014 Africa, South America, and North America \u2014 it plans to focus on Nigeria in the interim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe plan now is to build out a separate entity in Nigeria and focus strictly on the Nigerian market. The Nigerian market is unique; it\u2019s not a market where you can operate remotely.\u201d\n\nIn pursuing this plan, the startup has hired Damilola Aluede as managing director to head its Nigerian division.\n\nAccess to credit facilities provides businesses and individuals with numerous benefits. Businesses can scale and unlock demand using credit like M-KOPA and Daystar Power do. On the part of the customers, they can access products and services that were previously out of reach.\n\nHowever, getting credit is difficult for both individuals and businesses in Nigeria. According to Business Day, seven in ten bank customers in Nigeria lack access to credit. In the same vein, only 4% of micro, small, and medium enterprises in the country have access to credit. Therefore, providing a way for banks and lending institutions to assess creditworthiness will increase access.\n\nThe startup has also signed up a few customers in Nigeria, including Lendaba, Sycamore, Golden Ox Partners, Vola Africa, Venero, and Fundii. It also has a working arrangement with API fintech, Mono.\n\nChallenges with data collection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing technology to predict the creditworthiness of a customer is great in theory. However, doing this requires data that is notoriously hard to collect in Nigeria. Unsurprisingly, Collins points out that this is their biggest challenge.\n\n\u201cThe ability to get good data sources is a big challenge in Nigeria. A lot of our data partners have specific customers, so their customers are just a small group of customers compared to the whole. So the challenge now is for us to try and find different ways to get data or the ability to assess the creditworthiness of the large majority that are not involved in the economy.\u201d\n\nTo solve this problem, Collins discloses that Periculum will be making use of existing data such as the NIN and BVN for customers who are already involved in the economy. For those who are not, the plan is to draw on data from mobile transactions.\n\nBusiness model and key differentiator\n\nPericulum can make money in two major ways \u2014 a credit analytics and data analytics service to businesses. Consequently, the startup can charge its customers for API calls or a subscription fee.\n\nPericulum is not the only African startup trying to solve this problem. In addition to the lending startups mentioned above, there is also Toju and CARMA. However, Collins believes that their data analytics solution gives them the edge over their competitors.\n\n\u201cA lot of our competitors do one thing, maybe a couple of things, but we do multiple things. We don\u2019t just provide a credit scoring system; we do a lot of data analytics as well. In fact, our core business proposition is data analysis.\u201d\n\nAs the government and private sector work to improve the economy, increasing access to credit facilities for individuals and businesses will be key. However, challenges such as a lack of uniformity in data collection remain, and startups that can work around them could be successful while unlocking pathways to wealth for more Nigerians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn November 2021, Bitcoin was at an all-time high (ATH) of $68,000; it was definitely a great time to be in crypto. At times like that, crypto traders and evangelists seize every opportunity to remind everyone who isn\u2019t into crypto trading what they are missing.\n\nHowever, it is a different story on the crypto streets as Bitcoin is bleeding out. The flagship crypto has lost almost half of what it gained during the ATH of 2021, and the charts remain crimson red.\n\nThe continuous nosedive has wiped out $1 trillion from the total market cap of cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor those who are not new to the extreme volatility that comes with trading or hodling crypto, the current decline is just one of those things. For Ruth Iselema, Founder and CEO of crypto exchange, Bitmama, the current dip in crypto prices isn\u2019t so much of a bother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIselema revealed this at Techpoint Build 2021 while speaking on the topic, Crypto beyond trading. She touched on other use cases of cryptocurrencies besides trading and how they could be very important to finance in Africa.\n\nThere\u2019s more to crypto than trading\n\nCryptocurrencies are used primarily for speculative purposes, buying low and selling high, but they weren\u2019t originally created for speculation. According to the white paper by Bitcoin\u2019s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, the essence of Bitcoin is to provide a \u201csystem for electronic transactions without relying on trust.\u201d\n\nToday, Bitcoin trading is more or less a career path for some, an edge against inflation and the light at the end of the poverty tunnel. According to Iselema, cryptocurrencies are viewed this way, especially in Africa, because of the high poverty rate.\n\nAround 40% of Africa\u2019s population \u2014 1.3 billion \u2014 lives in extreme poverty, making crypto trading a very attractive venture. Iselema also pointed out that crypto trading is more popular among other use cases because of the complexities of using cryptocurrencies.\n\nBringing crypto into regular finance\n\nFrom lending, insurance, and exchange of value, cryptocurrencies have other use cases beyond trading. All these are classified under decentralised finance (DeFi), financial activities performed on decentralised networks.\n\nWhen it comes to alternative use of cryptocurrencies, DeFi paints a very vivid picture. It allows crypto to perform the same function as traditional financial institutions with fiat currencies, but, of course, without the need for those institutions.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nThe goal of DeFi is to create a financial system without third parties. It does this through decentralised peer-to-peer networks. This means anyone without an Internet connection can lend, trade, and borrow without the usual documentation in centralised finance.\n\nThere are several DeFi protocols such as Compound that provide crypto lending and borrowing services. People who have crypto will make it available to those who want to borrow. Collateral can be provided in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or other crypto assets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmart contracts are an essential part of DeFi as they ensure that every party holds up its end of the bargain. As opposed to lending apps that hassle borrowers after they default on payment, smart contracts immediately carry out the action that was agreed upon if the borrower defaults on payment.\n\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) are also another interesting use case for crypto. From buying valuable art or music to creating one, NFTs have been a life-changer for Africans and many across the globe.\n\nThere\u2019s still a high barrier\n\nWhile these use cases seem simple enough on the surface, there is a high educational barrier to using them. According to blockchain research tool, Dune Analytics, there are 4 million unique DeFi addresses as of January 2022.\n\nIt is important to note that one person can have up to 10 addresses, and the actual users of DeFi protocols could be less than half of the number of existing addresses. This means that not even a fraction of the global population uses DeFi protocols.\n\nWhile Africa might be the home of peer-to-peer Bitcoin transactions, it\u2019s still behind in alternative crypto usage such as DeFi. In Statista\u2018s ranking of 20 countries with the most DeFi interactions, only one African country \u2014 Togo \u2014 made the list, ranking 20th.\n\nThis can be owed to the fact that many DeFi platforms are complicated and expensive to use. Blockchain expert Oluchi Enebeli believes that the blockchain space is still largely composed of engineers and developers who do not pay much attention to design and simplicity.\n\nAlthough they\u2019ve been touted as the path to financial freedom, crypto usage can be very costly, thus creating a financial barrier. Transactions on the Ethereum network, the most popular network for alternative crypto usage, cost a lot. For context, transaction costs could be higher than the value of the transaction.\n\nWhile there are new networks, Solana and Polygon, for instance, springing up and reducing the cost of crypto usage, only time will tell if alternative crypto usage will catch on in Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Yam tuber, maize, beans, and plantain are some of the food items that gulped the most incomes of Nigerians in 2021 as they recorded the highest increase in prices, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nYam tubers rose the most with a 59.9 percent increase on the average last year while white maize, brown maize, mudfish, white beans, and unripe plantain jumped 57.7 percent, 55.5 percent, 40.9 percent, 39 percent and 30.6 percent respectively.\n\nThe rising food prices only put more burden on Nigeria\u2019s poor population already struggling with stagnant income and deteriorating standard of living, according to experts.\n\nAccording to the 2019 survey NBS, the total household expenditure in Nigeria is N40 trillion out of which N22.7 trillion is spent on food alone.\n\nA 2021 report by the Institute of Development Studies has revealed that food consumes about 101 percent of the average wages of Nigerians and the country ranks second globally where citizens spend almost all their income on food.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s middle-class is increasingly disappearing. If you juxtapose the sustained drive in the prices of food and other commodities with stagnant income or most cases disappearance in income, you will see that the standard of living of many Nigerians has deteriorated,\u201d said Ayorinde Akinloye, a research analyst at United Capital Plc.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, 40 percent of Nigeria\u2019s total population, or almost 83 million people, live below the country\u2019s poverty line of N137,430 ($381.75) per year.\n\nRead Also: Christmas meal rises most in 10yrs on surging food prices\n\nThe pandemic also has pushed an additional 11 million Nigerians into poverty, according to the World Bank.\n\nThe Bank also revealed that inflation has pushed 8 million more Nigerians into poverty between 2020 and 2021.\n\nNigeria\u2019s headline inflation which has been on the decline for eight months saw a sudden spike in December 2021 to 15.63 percent from 15.40 in November 2021 on the back of increased demand during the festive period.\n\n\u201cThe rise in food inflation came on the back of huge demand during the festive season and insecurity in the food-producing areas as 15 states recorded higher food inflation rates in December 2021,\u201d said Ayodeji Ebo, Head, Retail Investment, Chapel Hill Denham.\n\nPlateau, Nasarawa and Benue are some of the worst-hit states by the herder-farmer crisis.\n\nFemi Oke, chairman of the All Farmers Association of Nigerian (AFAN) Lagos State chapter, explained that the major reason for the increase in the price of food is insecurity.\n\nHe explained that most of the farmers hardly go to the farm anymore because of these herdsmen and bandits\u2019 issues.\n\nIn the first monetary policy committee meeting of the year, the Governor of the CBN, Godwin Emefiele stated the surge in food prices is as a result of logistics problems particularly transport as there is a wide disparity between the low prices at the Farmgate and high prices at the marketplace.\n\nIn December 2021 specifically, white beans, brown beans, yam tuber, palm oil and vegetable oil were also the food items that accounted for the highest increase in food inflation, the same items when the average for the year was taken.\n\nMuda Yusuf, the immediate past director-general of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) said although the Government has been doing a lot especially around CBN financing for agriculture, the rise in food prices signals that more has to be done.\n\n\u201cWe need to deal with the entire value chain, the issues of insecurity and transportation are crucial issues which need to be urgently addressed,\u201d Yusuf pointed out.\n\nThe Global Hunger Index report ranks Nigeria 103rd of 116 countries with the hungriest people, indicating that hunger is severe in the country and may become alarming if nothing is done about this urgently.",

          "title": "How economy, security, zoning will dominate debate ahead 2023",
          "text": "As aspirants for the position of the president are moving from one part of the country to the other, making wide consultations, analysts say the three key areas that will play a key role in the decision by the electorate would be what the aspirants would say on the economy and security issues.\n\nAccording to them, the zoning issue is also expected to come into play as many Nigerians are looking forward to seeing how the knotty issue would be resolved.\n\nNigeria\u2019s economy has been in the doldrums and the quality of life in the country has trended so low that the country is now being described as the poverty headquarters of the world.\n\nSecurity issue has also become one of the serious challenges of the current administration and Nigerians would want to know how the aspirants would combat that.\n\nAs usual, the politicians will be in their element to woo the electorate for their votes.\n\nBut considering the failure to fulfill election promises in the past, and especially, the maladministration of the present administration, many wonder what else politicians will promise for 2023.\n\nThe scenario is worsened by the fact that no government since the return to civil rule in 1999 has achieved up to 40 percent of the promises in its manifesto, according Transparency International.\n\nAs expected, the 2023 election is likely going to be a bit different from the past elections as the electorate who have suffered several disappointments from politicians and are daily weighed down by the burden of economic hardship, especially in recent times, are waiting to hear the content of manifestos across the parties for the 2023 election.\n\nFor Sam Ajanaku Onikoyi, a Nigerian historian and Commonwealth researcher based in Brussels, Belgium, Nigerians should be the ones setting the agenda for politicians and determining the content of the manifestos, and not the usual way that has not yielded fruits since 1999.\n\nHe argued that the people are the ones suffering, they are ones who know where it is paining them most and should tell politicians what they want and not otherwise.\n\n\u201cThe politicians always woo us with sweet stories during campaigns, but even deny saying so months after. Now, the people should present what they want as legal documents and hand them over to the politicians during their campaign and hold them accountable. That is what is obtainable in Europe and also the way to go in 2023 if Nigerians wants change,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Commonwealth researcher warned that no matter the content of the manifesto, who presented it, or who is promising it, success can only come when the electorates pressurise politicians to fulfill their promises, hold them accountable, and take action when they failed after warning them.\n\n\u201cDemocracy allows for the passing of \u2018vote of confidence\u2019 and lastly, recalling of elected political office holders who are not doing well. Why are Nigerians not doing so, yet they complain. A governor can be impeached, president impeached and others can be sacked by the electorates, but those accused of not performing are still in the office. That should stop in 2023 by making sure any of those non-performing politicians do not even smell party primaries\u201d, he suggested.\n\nChijioke .J. Umelahi, an Abuja-based lawyer and former Abia State lawmaker, shared the same views with Onikoyi but added that power is in the hands of the electorate to determine the content of the manifesto for 2023.\n\n\u201cThe electorate should understand that political power is taken and not given. So, if their votes will determine who gets what, they should see themselves as kingmakers and insist on conditions for making kings among which is the manifesto that favours them and assurance of their fulfillment from the politicians and penalty as well,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, the former lawmaker, who hopes to seek an elective position in 2023, disclosed that he would want to probe security chiefs as top of the manifesto for 2023 because the country has been wasting money in fighting insecurity without result.\n\n\u201cIf you probe security chiefs, you will discover how the security funds were shared because if they were used for the reason they were allocated, Boko Haram or bandits would have been a thing of the past\u201d, he said.\n\nSpeaking further, he noted that if the government through reformed security apparatus can secure Nigeria, the economy will pick up and the masses will smile after a long time of being in despair.\n\nLooking at the growing hardship in the land, Anike Daramola, a dentist at the Federal Dental Centre, Marina, Lagos, said that government should spell out how it is going to revive the economy, the step by step approach, time limit, and updates on the project in order to give people opportunity to hold them accountable.\n\n\u201cHave you heard of how expensive things are in the market, do you know how many people that are dying every hour in Nigerian hospitals because the relations cannot afford exorbitant medical bills, people are not scared of covid-19 because the situation is worse than the pandemic? Truly, the situation out there is worse and the masses are suffering it. So, reviving the economy should top the manifesto content\u201d, she said.\n\nPart of the economic revival content of the manifesto for 2023, according to the dentist, is encouraging SMEs, which are the engine of economic growth across the world.\n\n\u201cThere are no soft loans, bank interest rates are over 25 percent, the government is introducing new taxes on the many existing ones, inflation is not helping and SMEs staff are intimidated, especially in Lagos by the taskforce, all these stifle their growth and the economy as well\u201d, she said.\n\nWith these challenges, she noted that reviving the economy would only be possible if the government put incentives for SMEs as part of its manifestos for 2023.\n\nBut Luke Onwuka, an Ahuda, River State-based, mechanical engineer and oil worker, said that government should put \u2018no more foreign loans\u2019 as part of the 2023 manifesto.\n\n\u201cWe have borrowed more than foreign lenders can loan out and that is mortgaging the future of the country. Let\u2019s look inwards in 2023 because all the loans are not used for the projects government claimed they are meant for, the growing infrastructure gap says it all\u201d, he said.\n\nHe further argued that with all the money in River State, Delta and Bayelsa, the Federal Government still claim to e financing projects there, what happens to the allocations, NDDC, Niger Delta Commission, and others he described as a conduit pipe for stealing public funds.\n\nHe also said that there should be no mention of fighting corruption in the 2023 manifesto as such will be making further mockery on the intelligence of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFighting corruption should have been top in the manifesto for 2023, but the present administration said it would tackle corruption in both the 2015 and 2019 campaign manifesto, but it failed. I don\u2019t see any APC candidate fighting corruption. We should suspend the fight until we get serious with the fight,\u201d he said.\n\nRead also: State of economy seen driving voter turnout in 2023\n\nAdanna Olekanma, a mother of three and school proprietress, decried the falling standard of education and wants quality education as top among the contents of the manifesto. But she feared that the federal government, which she accused of killing education in the country, would not look the way of education.\n\n\u201cGovernment should give education priority by raising JAMB cut-off mark to where it was before. We cannot all be intelligent at the same level and will not sacrifice the future because we want some to catch up. So, education should be top on manifestos for 2023,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Bulus Jonah, a retired banker from Plateau State, thinks that the manifesto cannot make sense if the parties are not going to institute equity and fairness in the selection of their presidential candidates.\n\nHe argues that a rotational presidency should be key in the manifesto for 2023.\n\n\u201cI know that power is taken and not given, but the political class should listen to cries for the rotational presidency to ensure equity, fairness and sense of belonging for every Nigerian. As it stands, no Tiv man, Birom, Idoma, Kanuri, Southern Kaduna, Isoko, Urhobo, among other minorities will become Nigerian president because they will not pull enough influence or votes to become president. Look at what is happening to the Igbos after helping to build the country and you don\u2019t want them to be president,\u201d he lamented.\n\nThinking the same line, Umelahi disclosed that many people who think their region is disfranchised will not vote for the 2023 election, hence making nonsense of the manifesto.\n\n\u201cIf you can be voted for and I cannot be voted for, that is unfair and you don\u2019t expect me to queue to vote for you when my interest is not covered. So, no matter what you are promising to a disenfranchised person, what he wants to hear is it is your turn and I will support you,\u201d the former lawmaker said.\n\nWell, many think that addressing insecurity, state police, erratic electricity power supply, multiple taxations, restructuring, devaluation of naira, diversification of the economy, poor quality of healthcare and education, corruption, curbing nepotism which is at its height now, among others should be the content of the manifesto for 2023 general election.",

          "title": "MTN Nigeria grows full year profit by 45.5% to N298.7bn",
          "text": "MTN Nigeria Communications Plc (MTN Nigeria) on Friday January 28 announced its audited results for the financial year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nThe leading telecommunications company\u2019s Mobile subscribers decreased by 8 million to 68.5 million but returned to positive net additions in fourth quarter (Q4) 2021. Active data users increased by 1.7 million to 34.3 million. Active fintech subscribers rose by 4.8 million to 9.4 million. Service revenue increased by 23.3% to N1.7 trillion.\n\nKey metrics:\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 27.9percent to N877.1 billion. EBITDA margin increased by 2.1 percentage points (pp) to 53 percent.\n\nProfit after tax (PAT) grew by 45.5percent to N298.7 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) rose by 45.5percent to N14.67 kobo. It proposed final dividend of N8.57 kobo per share. MTN Nigeria also reported enhanced guidance for service revenue growth of \u201cat least 20percent\u201d over the medium term.\n\nMTN Nigeria is one of Africa\u2019s largest providers of communications services, connecting approximately 68 million people in communities across the country with each other and the world.\n\nGuided by a belief that everybody deserves the benefits of a modern connected life, MTN Nigeria\u2019s leadership position in coverage, capacity and innovation has remained constant since its launch in 2001.\n\nMTN Nigeria is part of the MTN Group \u2013 a multinational telecommunications group, which operates in 20 countries in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nKarl Toriola, MTN Nigeria CEO, said: \u201c2021 was a significant year for our Company. We commemorated our 20th anniversary with a celebration of our customers and all the stakeholder relationships that enabled our journey. In addition, we made good progress towards our Ambition 2025 objectives, demonstrating the strength and resilience of the business. This reflects the firm foundations on which our business is built, the tenacity and commitment of our people, and the support of our stakeholders.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe continue to deepen our contributions to society in line with our priority to enhance shared value. During the year, our total contribution to the Government through direct and indirect taxes was N669.2 billion, up 83.4percent, representing approximately 40percent of our total revenue. We extended our interventions, in response to the challenges to our nation arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a further N1.5 billion to the Coalition Against Covid-19 (CACOVID) in support of efforts aimed at curbing the spread of the virus. This is supplementary to other interventions to protect the health and well-being of our people, customers and stakeholders. We also worked hard across our business to embed new ways of working while harnessing the opportunities presented by the trends in digital adoption,\u201d the CEO said.\n\n\u201cIn line with our objective to share our Company\u2019s success with our various stakeholders, the first phase of a series of transactions to increase Nigerian ownership in MTN Nigeria was conducted during 2021 by way of bookbuild to institutional investors and fixed price offer to retail investors (the Offer). The outcome of the Offer will be announced once regulatory approvals have been obtained.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we committed to participating in the Road Infrastructure Tax Credit scheme to rehabilitate the Enugu-Onitsha expressway, with ongoing engagement to kick off the project. We signed a five-year deal to support the Nigerian Football Federation as the official communications partner and actively supported the Super Eagles\u2019 participation in the African Cup of Nations competition. We are also committed to designing and constructing a new, world-class corporate headquarters,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nOperationally, our mobile subscriber base declined by 10.6percent and was impacted by the regulatory restrictions on new SIM sales and activations. However, we are pleased to have returned to positive growth in Q4 2021, adding approximately 1 million subscribers as we continued to ramp up the alignment of our SIM registration and activation centres with the regulations.\n\n\u201cActive data subscribers rose by 5.3percent YoY to 34.3 million as we continued to drive data conversion from our existing subscriber base. To enable this, we significantly enhanced our connectivity infrastructure with the acquisition of an additional 800MHz spectrum and the accelerated rollout of our 4G network, which now covers more than 70percent of the population.\n\nFurthermore, we were successful in our bid to acquire a 100MHz spectrum licence in the 3.5GHz band, on which we will roll out 5G services, at the auction held in December 2021. 5G provides the foundation on which future network performance will be built. Our successful bid presents an exciting opportunity to be at the forefront of delivering technological advancements to as many Nigerians as possible,\u201d noted further.\n\n\u201cOur fintech business continued to gain traction with approximately 770,000 registered mobile money (MoMo) agents and active users more than doubling to 9.4 million. This provides a solid foundation on which to launch the MoMo Payment Service Bank (PSB), for which we have received an Approval in Principle. The MoMo PSB will provide a powerful platform to drive digital and financial inclusion in Nigeria. In recognition of our progress in the fintech space, we received a $500,000 grant from the African Development Bank to fund research on financial inclusion for women.\n\n\u201cDriven by the strong operational performance, we delivered growth across all revenue lines, demonstrating the underlying strength and momentum of the business. Service revenue grew by 23.3percent, exceeding our mid-teen target, driven mainly by growth in voice, data and fintech service revenue lines.\n\n\u201cEBITDA rose by 27.9percent, while our EBITDA margin expanded by 2.1pps to 53percent, in line with our Ambition 2025 objective. This was driven by solid revenue growth on the back of accelerated investments in our network, supported by cost management initiatives through our expense efficiency programme. Overall, these efficiencies translated into an increase of 46.1percent in Profit Before Tax and 45.5percent in Profit After Tax.\n\nIn line with our dividend policy, the board has proposed a final dividend of N8.57 kobo per share to be paid out of distributable net income. This brings the total dividend for the year to N13.12 kobo per share, representing an increase of 39.6percent.\u201d\n\nKey financial highlights\n\nVoice revenue includes interconnect and outbound roaming voice; Data revenue includes roaming data; Digital revenue excludes bulk SMS and USSD services; Fintech revenue includes MTN Xtratime and mobile financial services; Other service revenue includes SMS, USSD, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) & infrastructure and devices; while Free cash flow (EBITDA minus capital expenditure) excluding IFRS 16 impact was N430.7 billion, up 31.1 percent.\n\nOperational review\n\nService revenue grew by 23.3percent despite the 10.6percent decline in our subscriber base. Data continued to lead service revenue growth, supported by voice, fintech and digital service.\n\nVoice revenue grew by 8.4percent due to higher usage in MTNN active SIM base, resulting in a 7.9percent growth in minutes of use. This was supported by the success of customer value management (CVM) initiatives, reducing the impact of SIM registration and activation restrictions in H1 and network restrictions in some locations towards the end of 2021. In addition, MTNN continues to ramp up gross connections through its rural telephony initiatives while expanding its customer acquisition points, further supporting growth in voice revenue.\n\nData revenue rose by 55.3percent, maintaining an accelerated growth trajectory in Q4 as MTNN continues to accelerate the expansion of our 4G coverage, enhance the quality and capacity of its network to support increasing data traffic, and grow active data users. Average MB per user rose by 62.7percent, enabling overall data traffic growth of 85.3percent. Also, smartphone penetration on the network grew by 4.0pp to 50percent. MTNN 4G network now covers 70.3percent of the population, up from 60.1percent in December 2020.\n\nFintech revenue rose by 57.3percent due to sustained growth in the use of its Xtratime product and broader fintech services by our customers. MTNN expanded its MoMo agent network, through its one distribution strategy, with the addition of over 374,000 registered agents bringing the total number to approximately 770,000, up 94.8percent. As a result, transaction volume rose by 167percent to 137.5 million from an active user base of 9.4 million, up 102percent. Additionally, the Approval in Principle we recently obtained in relation to our MoMo PSB licence application is an important step towards final approval, which will allow MTNN to expand its service offerings and scale its fintech business, thereby achieving more meaningful financial inclusion in the country.\n\nDigital adoption continues to accelerate as customers use more digital products and services, a trend accelerated by COVID-19. As a result, digital revenue grew by 61.2percent as the active user base grew and penetration of MTNN digital products deepened. The active user base rose by 162.1percent to 7.5 million, led by Ayoba \u2013 its instant messaging platform \u2013 with approximately 3.8 million active users, up 172.9percent.\n\n\u201cEnterprise business performance was underpinned by the onboarding of new customers across our key segments and the uptake of our enhanced services. As a result, service revenue from enterprise business was up by 12percent. We are pleased with the implementation of the new pricing framework for USSD services which will pave the way for full recovery of the outstanding debts.\n\nOn the costs side, we made good progress with our expense efficiency programme through which we realised N25.1 billion in cost savings, representing a 1.5pp margin impact. However, the continued effects of Naira depreciation on lease rental costs, acceleration in our site rollout, and the ongoing COVID-19 related expenditure resulted in operating expenses increasing by 21.9percent.\n\nRead also: MTNN public offer: Subscribers allotment likely in February\n\nDespite this, our ability to drive operating leverage has enabled EBITDA growth of 27.9percent and the expansion of our EBITDA margin by 2.1pp to 53percent.\n\n\u201cWe recorded sustained increase in the demand for data, which extended beyond the usage spikes seen during COVID lockdowns. This drove our acceleration of capex investment. As a result, capex in the period was up by 36.7percent to N408.3 billion, as we ramped up investment in our network to capture growth through service quality leadership and aggressive coverage expansion, focusing on the 4G network. We deployed 9,336 4G sites representing approximately 75percent of the total sites deployed during the period, reflecting solid data revenue growth.\n\n\u201cWe recorded healthy free cash flow of N468.8 billion, up by 21.1percent, substantiating the quality of our ramped-up investment. Core capex excluding the right of use assets rose by 26.8percent to N304.4 billion, while capex intensity remained within target levels at 18.4percent. Depreciation and amortisation rose by 12.9 percent because of the impact of increased site rollout.\n\nAlthough net finance costs increased by 15.8percent due to higher borrowing, the average cost of borrowing declined by 2.1pp. As part of our strategy to optimise our capital structure, we tapped into the debt capital market and raised N200 billion in bonds across two oversubscribed issuances. The bonds issued enabled us to diversify funding sources, extend the maturity profile of the Company\u2019s debt portfolio and optimise funding costs.\n\nUpdate on New SIM Registration Directive\n\nMTNN continues to actively support the Federal Government\u2019s National Identity Number (NIN) enrolment programme, having deployed more than 2,300 points of enrolment across the country.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, we continued to work with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) to accelerate the bulk verification of NINs collected. As of 31 December 2021, approximately 44 million subscribers have submitted their NINs, representing around 64percent of our subscriber base and 74percent of service revenue.\n\n\u201cThe current deadline for NIN verification is 31 March 2022. While an extension is solely in the hands of the authorities, we are working constructively with them and the industry, supporting the NIN enrolment drive, to ensure that customers are not unduly inconvenienced and service revenue for 2022 is not impacted\u201d.\n\nOutlook\n\nMTNN is focused on building on the platform of success laid in 2021.\n\n\u201cOur return to positive subscriber net additions in Q4 2021 establishes a solid basis for growth in 2022 as we ramp up gross connections through our rural connectivity drive and CVM initiatives. As part of our rural connectivity programme, we plan to connect approximately 2,000 new communities in 2022.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing structurally sustained data growth. As a result, we are investing in network and information technology infrastructure, and have secured the relevant frequencies to meet the higher demand. This involves accelerating the expansion of our 4G coverage and providing home broadband to capture a significant share of market growth. We will commence the initial rollout of 5G services once the acquisition process is completed to further deepen broadband penetration in Nigeria, enhance customer experience and unlock new revenue streams.\n\n\u201cWe have made significant progress with our super-agent licence, expanding the agent network across the country.\n\nHowever, as the business transits to MoMo PSB once the final approval is obtained, we remain focused on developing the range of additional services we can offer customers to drive digital and financial inclusion.\n\n\u201cWe will sustain our drive for cost management across the business through our expense efficiency programme and strengthen our operations and financial position to unlock efficiency and support margins.

The event commemorated a civilian-led peace agreement made between the Islam and Catholic communities in Mindanao 8 years ago.\n\nBack in 2014, Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL), an international NGO mediated the conflict in Mindanao by proposing a peace agreement by local representatives. Witnessed by Chairman Man Hee Lee of HWPL, the peace agreement was signed by Hon. Esmael G. Mangudadatu, the then Governor of Maguindanao, and Archbishop-Emeritus Fernando Capalla of the Archdiocese of Davao representing local leadership. Since then, the province of Maguindanao and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) declared January 24 as \u201cHWPL Peace Day\u201d and have commemorated it as annual event to reaffirm international cooperation and local partnership for peacebuilding in Mindanao.\n\nMoreover, peace monuments were built honoring the peace agreement in Mindanao. The 1st and 2nd Peace Monuments were erected in 2015 and 2016 respectively. In 2021, the third peace monument was unveiled in Cotabato City. Being the first in Luzon, a peace monument in Dingras, Ilocos Norte was unveiled last January 24 as part of the 8th Anniversary event of the HWPL Peace Day celebration. Also, another monument located in Siniloan Integrated National High School is set to unveil on February.\n\nThe event, under the theme of \u201cLaw of Peace in Heaven and on Earth\u201d, aimed to promote interfaith harmony between religions and raise public support to establish international law for peace.\n\nKey figures gave congratulatory messages including Senate President Vicente Sotto III, Senator Panfilo Lacson, Senator Cynthia Villar, Senator Ronald \u2018Bato\u2019 Dela Rosa, Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo, and TV News Anchor Mariz Umali from the Philippines. Keynote speakers from various fields also presented commitment messages declaring their plans on promoting peace in their respective sectors including law, education, youth, women, private business and media.\n\nPrabhu Mahendra Das, Temple President of Sri Sri Radha Madhava Mandir, said that he decided to participate in the World Alliance of Religions\u2019 Peace (WARP) Office organized by HWPL as \u201ca global platform for religious leaders to talk, share, discuss, learn, and grow together harmoniously and peacefully.\u201d For the contribution to peace in the field of religion, he added, \u201cI firmly believe that all religions should enter into a partnership through the form of a Memorandum of Understanding.\u201d\n\nJustice Raoul Victorino (ret), Chairman of Philippine National Prayer Breakfast (PNPB) and Dean of the College of Law of Philippine Christian University (PCU), shared how he was inspired by the \u201crevolutionary movement\u201d that HWPL initiated to endorse global peacebuilding through the draft the \u201cDeclaration of Peace and Cessation of War (DPCW)\u201d by global experts in international law to advocate peace as a global culture and norm. He declared, \u201cI will strive to get the support of the President of the Philippines for the National Solidarity Support of DPCW. At the same time, I will integrate DPCW [education] in the college of law by collaborating with the Philippine Association of Law Schools.\u201d\n\nAlso, representing the Philippines education sector, Commissioner Ronald Adamat of the Commissioner on Higher Education (CHED) shared, \u201cThe CHED Commission en Banc has issued an endorsement to President Duterte, urging him to declare January 24 as \u2018National Peace Day\u2019, that will provide for simultaneous celebration and observance of peace through peace activities, events, and ceremonies by all instrumentalities and agencies of government, including the private sector. This shall also be celebrated and observed in the education sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur purpose is to bring all people in the world together to create a world of peace and leave it as a lasting legacy for future generations. To make this world a peaceful place without wars, let us become messengers of peace. Let us remind people around the world of that emotion\u2014a longing for peace\u2014and the Peace Day so they can remember all of this forever,\u201d said Chairman Lee during the closing remarks.\n\n[8th Anniversary of the January 24 HWPL Peace Day] \u201cLaw of Peace in Heaven and Earth\u201d\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PtBogiRkfFo\n\n...",

Tony Iju Nwabunike stated this in Lagos recently during a press briefing to celebrate the four years of his executives on the leadership of the foremost freight forwarding association in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cPursuing bigger revenue and failing to strengthen trade results in greater losses to the economy as investments are either threatened, reduced or made non existent.\u201d\n\nHe also said that totality of customs efforts deployed into revenue pursuit reduces the service\u2019s productivity in many ways\u201d, Nwabunike stated.\n\nWhile appealing President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of Finance not to sign the proposed $3.1 billion the customs modernisation contract, Nwabunike said that it would tie down the NCS to a 20 year debt repayment programme that is not necessary for the country which is already contending with huge foreign and domistic debts that are gulping over 85 per cent of the nation\u2019s annual revenue.\n\nNwabunike said: \u201cWe want to also advise the Federal Government to be careful before signing into the $3.1 billion Customs Modernisation Project which we heard, will run for 20 years.\n\nWe urge President Muhammadu Buhari and the Finance Minister to avoid assenting to the deal, saying \u201cNigeria is already in serious debts and customs being a strategic non-oil revenue earner for government shouldn\u2019t be tied to another long term debt repayment for two decades.\n\n\u201cOn this, we call on the National Assembly to take a closer look at the details and ensure that the Federal Ministry of Finance, Nigeria Customs Service and all parties involved observe due diligence that won\u2019t entrap the country in another long term debt repayment for 20 years and maybe for lesser value,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commended the Federal Government for its recent inauguration of an expanded partnership committee on blue economy chaired by the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, saying its a very bold step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cFor us, this shows more commitment by the Buhari administration to maritime matters.

Therefore, on this divine mission and today Governor Bello will be known and called Yahaya Adoza \u201cDavid\u201d Bello henceforth. It has been prophesied and by the grace of God, through this prayerful intercessions, Yahaya Adoza David Bello is the anointed son who will lead Nigeria from May 2023 to great battles and God will give him victory over all adversaries.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is our prayers in solemn invocation of the invincible powers of God Almighty that as King David was taken from the sheepfolds and crowned King, so also will Yahaya Adoza \u201cDavid\u201d Bello emerge President of Nigeria in May 2023,\u201d Bishop Moses declared.\n\nHe added that \u201cThrough spiritual lenses, we are told to tell Nigerians that Governor Bello is armed to effectively battle insurgents, corrupt politicians, bandits, kidnappers and every other affliction in the land, that\u2019s the sacred declaration of the Lord in the year 2022.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we make this solemn proclamation that the over 1,000 clergymen and faithful who have converged on Abuja from every walks of life in this special inter-denominational and inter-religious conference of prayers are asking God Almighty to guide and protect Governor Bello as he steps out on this divine mission, I therefore, invite everyone of us to activate his spiritual weapons to protect this worthy cause until the divine mission is accomplished.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOffering Islamic prayers for the Kogi State governor, Sheik Mahmoud Abubakar said, \u201cMy brethren, Yahaya Bello is before us, he has displayed good conduct and we can vouch for his strength of character, we can also vouch for his sincerity of heart and purpose, hence our prayers and supplications to God for His mercies to shine and be with him and guide him as he journeys towards becoming the president of our great country in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe trust Governor Yahaya Bello to lead Nigeria in the right direction.

We cannot keep importing everything,\u201d Adagadzu stressed.\n\nHinting on the Board\u2019s willingness to work with the PSN and other groups, the chairman said \u201cOur main plan is to see how we can get the local industry to increase production beyond 30 per cent, so that the country will become sufficient in drug production.

          "text": "Three teenage guys were detained in Ogun State early Saturday for reportedly beheading a female who was said to be in a relationship with one of them for a money ritual.\n\nThe perpetrators were apprehended by members of the community while burning the girl\u2019s head, according to the New Telegraph.\n\nThe incident occurred in Abeokuta\u2019s Oke Aregba neighborhood, the state capital of Ogun.\n\nWariz Oladehinde (17), Abdul Gafar Lukman (19), and Mustakeem Balogun are the suspects (20).\n\nMr Segun Adewusi, a community security guard, was said to have seen four teenagers burning something that appeared to be a human head in a local pot.\n\nThe security guard quickly notified the police at Adatan Station, who dispatched officers to the site to apprehend three of the youngsters, one of whom had left before the officers arrived.\n\nThe slain girl, identified as Rofiat, was a resident of Idi-Ape, according to a source who confirmed the incident to our correspondent. She was a girlfriend of one Soliu, who is now in police custody.\n\nSoliu allegedly enticed the girl into his apartment, held her down, and requested one of his buddies to slay her with a knife.\n\n\u201cThe arrested suspects were identified as 17-year-old Wariz Oladeinde from Kugba, 19-year-old Abdulgafar Lukman from Kugba and Mustakeem Balogun from Bode Olude, all in Abeokuta. Soliu was the boyfriend of the girl, he ran away, but was later arrested.\n\n\u201cThey killed Rofiat, cut off her head, packed the headless body in a sack and started burning the head in a pot. They told the police in the presence of a mammoth crowd that they wanted to use it for money ritual.\n\n\u201cThe police have taken the body away to a mortuary,\u201d a source told our correspondent on Saturday.\n\nIn a video made available to our correspondent, Mustakeem Balogun, said: \u201cWe wanted to use just her head alone for money ritual. Soliu strangled her and he told me to assist him and we cut off her head.\u201d\n\nConfirming the incident to journalists, the Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Abimbola Oyeyemi, the suspects led policemen to the building, where the dismembered body was recovered and deposited at the general hospital mortuary for autopsy.\n\nOyeyemi added that, a short cutlass and a knife used in cutting off the deceased head were also recovered from the suspects.",

          "text": "Akwa Ibom State Governor, Mr Udom Emmanuel has urged contestants in the just concluded gubernatorial primaries of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekiti State to bury the hatchet and work together for the victory of the party in the state. Governor Emmanuel who was leader of the 5-man PDP primary election committee in Ekiti State gave the admonition while fielding questions with Government House correspondents at the Victor Attah International Airport, Uyo, upon his return from the assignment.\n\nHe thanked the National Chairman and the National working Committee of PDP for an opportunity to serve the party, describing it as a privilege he cannot take for granted, expressing satisfaction with the integrity and conduct of the primary election.\n\nThe Governor who described the exercise as transparent, fair and credible, called on all participants in the contest to acknowledge the supremacy of the party and pull forces together to grab victory in the consequent general election as one party.\n\nHear him, \u201cI think personally I\u2019m satisfied that the process was credible and I also believe almost 100% of the people that watched it will give us credit that it was a very credible, transparent, free and fair election. My advice is, let all of them go back and work together. We have only one seat and only one person can occupy that seat. If after all what the party did at the NWC to accommodate all aspirants, the people then spoke and said this is the person we want to bear the flag of the party, I think all others should just join hands and work together. Party is supreme, let the party win then they can all sit down and talk\u201d.\n\nHe described as false and speculative, insinuations of unfair treatment and disenfranchisement of some aspirants, maintaining that the process was void of malpractices and created no room for expression of ill behaviours that would have given grounds to discredit the exercise.\n\nAccording to him, such insinuations were indications of pre-perceived defeat. He maintained that the committee had an authentic list from the National Working Committee which followed religiously, stressing that no single person voted that was not accredited and that there was none accredited that was not allowed to vote.\n\nIn his words, \u201cTalking about Ekiti gubernatorial primaries, I\u2019ve heard a whole lot; how some aspirants even before the process started, went to the press. \u2026I think they felt they knew the outcome even before we went into the election. \u2026Some of them came to make trouble but by the time they saw that there was no room for such trouble they knew there\u2019s no way they could have made it\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll the aspirants gave us a very excellent mark for all the processes: from accreditation to voting, to sorting, to counting, even to declaration of result. Even after that we gave them opportunity to speak of they were satisfied. We also had to make sure one of the international TV stations beamed it live so everybody could see the processes\u201d he added.\n\nThe Governor cationed the public to be wary of politician who promote violence as means to grab power and sued for peaceful politicking towards the 2023 polls.\n\nHear him, \u201cAs we go into 2023, people will give peace a chance. If you want to serve the people, you can\u2019t serve the people with a gun. Whoever carries a gun to serve is not going to serve the people but himself. If you want to serve the people and you don\u2019t want peace, there is an undertone we don\u2019t know. I think we need to unravel that and question your real intensions.\u201d\n\nThe Ekiti PDP Guber primaries which was keenly contested by twelve apirants had Hon. Bisi Kolawale emerging as winner with 671, edging out his immediate runner up, Segun Oni, who scored 330. Bisi Kolawale is a former member of the National Assembly 2007-2011, served as Environment Commissioner in Fayose\u2019s administration among other political offices held.\n\nSignificantly, all the aspirants who participated in the primaries have all congratulated the winner and pledged to work for the success of the PDP in the forthcoming Ekiti Governorship election.",

          "title": "Nigerians thumb down planned tax on carbonated beverages",
          "text": "\u2026Consider impact on citizens \u2013 Adefolarin \u2026Levies\u2019ll further hike prices of goods \u2013 Businessman \u2026It\u2019ll provoke industrial crisis, lead to job loss \u2013 NLC, LCCI \u2026It\u2019s not silver bullet, MAN declares \u2026FG needs to rebuild trust \u2013 Expert\n\nAs Nigerians were yet to properly digest the news by the minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, on the petrol subsidy, she threw another bombshell \u2013 the government will place taxes on carbonated drinks. In this report, BENJAMIN UMUTEME looks at the pros and cons of the proposed policy.\n\nIn August when the National Assembly declared that they would amend the Finance Act, following the argument by the Comptroller General of the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), Hameed Ali, that all beverage companies should be made to pay levies, not many gave it a thought. On that fateful day, Ali explained that non-alcoholic drinks were as harmful as alcoholic beverages, noting that there is a 30 per cent excise levy on alcoholic drinks.\n\n\u201cI have sung this song for many years now, Coca-Cola is produced in this country and it is not being taxed. There is nowhere in the world that Coca-Cola is not paying tax to its host country, but Coca-Cola in this country is not paying anything because of the government\u2019s unwillingness to re-excise those companies. For us, we have been battling for it, and I hope that one day, we will start collecting,\u201d he said.\n\nFast forward to January, 2022 and it is obvious the Customs boss has finally won.\n\nAt the public presentation of the 2022 Appropriation Act in Abuja, the finance minister disclosed that the federal government had introduced an excise duty of N10 per litre on all non-alcoholic, carbonated and sweetened beverages.\n\nExcise duty is a form of tax imposed on the production, licensing and sale of goods. According to her, the new policy introduced is in the Finance Act signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari on December 31, 2021.\n\nShe said the purpose of the additional tax was to discourage the consumption of excessive sugar among Nigerians, which, according to her, contributes to diabetes and obesity.\n\nThe minister further said the new measure was in line with the 2022 Budget priorities which enabled the government to introduce a new sugar tax to raise revenue for health-related and other critical expenditures. About four million Nigerians suffer from diabetes linked to excess sugar consumption.\n\nNigeria ranks the 4th highest soft drink consuming country globally, with over 40 million litres sold yearly.\n\nShe said, \u201cThere\u2019s now an excise duty of N10 per litre imposed on all non-alcoholic and sweetened beverages. And this is to discourage excessive consumption of sugar in beverages which contributes to a number of health conditions including diabetes and obesity. But it is also used to raise excise duties and revenues for health-related and other critical expenditures. This is in line also with the 2022 budget priorities.\u201d\n\nReactions\n\nThe minister had barely left the venue of the event when Nigerians started reacting to the government\u2019s move to implement a new tax regime. For many, the government was insensitive considering the difficult state Nigerians and businesses were in. For various business concerns, another tax would only increase the crushing burden they have been operating under for so long.\n\nThe impact many say is potential job loss and further increase in the prices of carbonated drinks many Nigerians lament is already on the high side.\n\n\u2018Long-awaited\u2019\n\nAs Nigerians were condemning the government\u2019s pronouncement, many more were excited about the decision. Reacting to the news, in an email to Blueprint, a non-governmental organisation, the Amaka Chiwuike-Uba Foundation (ACUF), described the introduction of a N10 per liter excise duty on soft drinks as \u201ca welcome development and legislation that has been long awaited.\u201d\n\nAccording to the ACUF Board chair, Dr. Chiwuike Uba, the partial introduction of Sin Tax will not only lead to a drastic decline in the consumption of potentially harmful goods (especially Sugar Sweetened Beverages (SSBs) ), but an increase in the government revenue as well as improvements in the population health.\n\n\u201cAccording to Statista, in 2019, Nigeria was the seventh largest country with the highest consumption of soft drinks in the world, with more than 49 servings of eight ounces per capita per year. By the way, the market is projected to grow by 17.12% per year between 2021 and 2026.\n\n\u201cMany studies have found that the recent rapid increase in early-onset colorectal cancer in adolescence and adulthood are largely attributed to the consumption of soft drinks. Consumption of two or more of these drinks per day exposes the consumer to double the risk of colorectal cancer and other cancers before the age of 50 years. In 2020, there were more than 124,815 new cancer cases in Nigeria, including more than 78,899 related deaths,\u201d Dr. Uba said.\n\nHe said further that, \u201cAccording to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), treating diabetes per person has gone from an average cost of N60, 000 in 2011 to N300, 000 in 2021. This figure is also expected to exceed N500, 000 in 2030 and N1.0 million in 2045.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, the financial burden of diabetic foot problem in terms of direct costs of treatment is above N2 million. The government must make every effort to deter the high consumption of these sugary and products harmful to health.\n\n\u201cAccording to IDF, diabetes-related healthcare expenditures in Nigeria in 2021 were about N745 billion. This will increase to more than N1.07 trillion by 2030 and N1.59 trillion by 2045. The average treatment cost for a cancer patient is N30 million.\u201d\n\nNigerians\u2019 angst\n\nDespite the grim figures churned out by ACUF, analysts opine that the issue is more than raising tax to increase revenue.\n\nSpeaking with this reporter, a political economist and development researcher, Adefolarin Olamilekan, said the government has to answer the critical question of whether the government\u2019s revenue challenge is a fiscal issue or leakage issue.\n\nOlamilekan said until the government addresses that question, it would continue to further burden businesses and Nigerians with new taxes. \u201cUntil appropriate and concrete answers are provided, the Nigerian state would have no other business than to impose unfriendly taxes on the people and businesses,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the government\u2019s position for the tax on carbonated drinks is justified, the political economist urged fiscal authorities to carefully weigh the impact it would have on the economy before implementation.\n\n\u201cIn this case, the N10-litre tax on carbonated drinks even though it has its justification in terms of curtailing the negative effect of carbonated drinks on the personal health and wellbeing of citizens, the consequence of this type of tax on the economy should be weighed before being implemented.\u201d\n\nThe news of the policy did not go down well with Silas Njoku who manages a provision shop in Jikwoyi in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nAccording to him, the news of another tax to the ones he is already paying is not funny at all. He lamented to this reporter that the rise in the prices of goods was already affecting his sales/profit.\n\n\u201cI am yet to find a way of balancing between keeping my customers and selling goods to them at a price that I will be able to make profit and now this new tax on coke and others. How do they want us to survive? Is the government only interested in themselves without thinking of other Nigerians,\u201d he asked this reporter rhetorically.\n\nFor PR expert and lead consultant, Leap Communications, Muyiwa Akintunde, businesses would be forced to absolve the additional costs, but it would ultimately affect their other commitments.\n\nAccording to him, business owners themselves will say that considering all the projects they engage in, in their CSR programs \u2013 they fix roads, construct bore-holes for communities and the like after which they still pay taxes, will this decision not further stretch them?\n\n\u201cFor me, the whole thing is like putting the cart before the horse. Paying taxes is good, however people want to know that their taxes count and that the government is actually using the resources from taxes to their collective advantage and when we have that, it will be easy for people to respond to tax payment without being forced to it.\n\nLabour, others protest\n\nIn a swift reaction, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) rejected the policy, warning that the move could precipitate an industrial crisis in the sector.\n\nAccording to the NLC, Nigeria cannot afford what led to the relocation of two tyre manufacturing firms, Dunlop and Michelin to Ghana following a similar complaint of harsh policy.\n\nA statement by its president, Ayuba Wabba, read in part, \u201cCongress was also alerted by the complaint of manufacturers of soft drinks in Nigeria that the re-introduction of excise duties on their products would lead to very sharp decline in sales, forced reduction in production, and a sure rollback in investments with the certainty of job losses and possibly shutdown of their manufacturing plants.\u201d\n\nThe Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) also kicked, arguing that the newly-imposed excise duty on carbonated drinks would have a ripple effect on the prices and demand of the commodity, resulting in the loss of jobs due to reduced production activities.\n\nIts director-general, Chinyere Almona, noted that the policy \u201cexposes domestic producers of carbonated drinks to unfair competition.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe federal government has announced it will charge an excise levy of N10 per litre on all non-alcoholic carbonated sweetened beverages to discourage excessive sugar consumption and boost revenue.\n\n\u201cThe immediate concerns are the likely increase in prices which may lead to a decrease in demand and, consequently, loss of jobs due to a reduction in production activities.\n\n\u201cThe prohibition on imported drinks should be better enforced to protect domestic production from unfair competition in the face of the high cost of production in Nigeria,\u201d she said.\n\nMAN\u2019s take\n\nThe Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) in its reaction, stressed it would make Nigeria to lose investments to other countries.\n\nMAN\u2019s director-general, Segun Ajayi-Kadir, in a statement said despite the debilitating impact of naira devaluation, inadequacy of forex and the Covid-19 pandemic, the affected sub-sectors contributed significantly to the economy and taxes.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria is the sixth-highest consumer of soft drinks, but per capita consumption is low.\n\n\u201cIt would appear that the goose that lays the golden eggs is being led to perdition. The food and beverage subsector contributed the highest (38 per cent) of the total manufacturing sector to the GDP. It comprises 22.5 per cent of manufacturing jobs and generates more than 1.5 million jobs. So, this levy would certainly cast a sunset to this performance,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, recent studies have shown that introducing excise on non-alcoholic beverages is likely to cause a 0.43 per cent contraction in output and about 40 per cent drop in total industry revenues in the next five years.\n\nAjayi-Kadir said the policy would lead to high production costs which would adversely affect production levels and ultimately result in dwindling profits.\n\n\u201cIntroducing excise will easily reduce production capacity causing manufacturers to struggle to meet investor commitments as well as cause investors to take investments to other countries.\u201d\n\nNLC\u2019s interest\n\nHowever, some Nigerians do not share the NLC sentiment, saying Labour was more about protecting their interest.\n\nFor a Jikwoyi resident who would not want his name in print, everything that the government wants to do is greeted with disapproval.\n\nHe said: \u201cNigerians and reject. The government cannot raise fuel prices even when babies in gestations can tell prices are going up around the world. The government can\u2019t raise taxes. Nigerians run over bloated civil services yet can\u2019t trim it because of fear of civil unrests, etc. No one wants to make a sacrifice yet you all are expecting the best from your govt. You all want a good life. How in hell is that even gonna happen?\n\nAnother said: \u201cThis NLC is in the dark; when will they learn to pick their fight? Maybe they are defending some companies.\u201d\n\nNo cause for alarm\n\nExperts say there is no cause for alarm, noting that it would not affect the retail price of carbonated drinks as the cost can be easily absolved by the big-time manufacturers.\n\nDavey Ugwuadu, an accountant and tax expert, said the implication of the policy ought to be more on the manufacturers. According to him, the big-time manufacturers should be able to absorb the extra cost without tampering with the retail price of their products because doing that may boomerang.\n\n\u201cNote that the products we are talking about here are highly elastic in demand; it is not something we cannot do without. The manufacturers will look at the middle ground to see what they can do to maintain their sales volume. This is what profit is all about.\n\n\u201cFor me, I expect the big players like Nigerian Bottling Company and 7up Bottling Company to absolve the cost and not bother to tamper with their retail price. We know that the government is looking for money, hence the new excise duty.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt, the new policy is an additional pain for the manufacturers, the question is what the government will gain from the additional cost, will the consumer gain them, and will the money reflect in governance? Or will the extra revenue go the usual way where money raised from taxes go?\u201d\n\nRe-building trust\n\nFor Olamilekan, the government needs to address the trust deficit that currently exists between it and the citizens. According to the political economist, there is huge gap of mistrust in the country which cuts across the three tiers of the government.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the Nigerian state must communicate effectively with the people on its policy direction. Over the years lack of sound top-bottom communication in indigenous language is the bane of citizens supporting government policy. That is why most government policy is regarded as anti people and pro elite policy.\n\n\u201cThirdly, a reduction from N10 to N3 would be suitable and effective. Lastly, the government and labour must see reasons to dialogue on this especially as the foods and beverages workers may be at lost if business owners tend to act otherwise.\u201d",
          "summary": "Excise duty is a form of tax imposed on the production, licensing and sale of goods.\nShe said the purpose of the additional tax was to discourage the consumption of excessive sugar among Nigerians, which, according to her, contributes to diabetes and obesity.\nThe impact many say is potential job loss and further increase in the prices of carbonated drinks many Nigerians lament is already on the high side.\nOlamilekan said until the government addresses that question, it would continue to further burden businesses and Nigerians with new taxes.\nWhile acknowledging that the government\u2019s position for the tax on carbonated drinks is justified, the political economist urged fiscal authorities to carefully weigh the impact it would have on the economy before implementation.",

          "title": "Russian Buildup at Ukraine Border Includes Blood for Wounded Soldiers, US Officials Say",
          "text": "A Russian troop buildup along its border with Ukraine includes supplies of blood for the wounded, three U.S. officials told Reuters, a detail reinforcing U.S. comments that Russia \u201cclearly\u201d now has the capability to move on its neighbour. The disclosure by the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, adds to growing U.S. concern that Russia could be preparing for a new invasion of Ukraine as it has amassed more than 100,000 troops near its borders. The Russian Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a written request for comment.\n\nPutin offered his first reaction to the U.S. and NATO responses to Russia\u2019s demands in a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron after weeks of personal public silence. The Kremlin quoted Putin as telling Macron he would study the responses provided by Washington and NATO this week before deciding on further action. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the West has not addressed Moscow\u2019s main security demands in the crisis over the former Soviet state \u2013 but he said that it was ready to keep talking, offering some hope that an attack is not imminent. Current and former U.S. officials said indicators like the blood supplies were critical in determining whether Moscow would be prepared to carry out an invasion, if Putin decided to do so.\n\nA French presidency official said Putin, in his call with Macron, had underlined that he did not want the situation to intensify, echoing conciliatory comments by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who said Moscow did not want war. \u201cAttention was drawn to the fact that the U.S. and NATO replies did not take into account Russia\u2019s principal concerns,\u201d the Kremlin said of Putin\u2019s conversation with Macron. It listed those concerns as avoiding NATO expansion, not deploying offensive weapons near Russia\u2019s borders and returning NATO \u201cmilitary capabilities and infrastructure\u201d to how they were before former Warsaw Pact states in eastern Europe joined. \u201cThe key question was ignored \u2013 how the United States and its allies intend to follow the principle of security integrity \u2026 that no one should strengthen their security at the expense of another country\u2019s security,\u201d it said. The United States and NATO have said some of Russia\u2019s demands are non-starters but have also left the door open to dialogue. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the Western military alliance was watching closely as Russia moves troops and arms into Belarus for drills. He said NATO was ready to increase its troop presence in eastern Europe if Russia took further aggressive actions against Ukraine, and cautioned that a Russian attack could take many forms including a cyber attack, attempted coup or sabotage. \u201cFrom the NATO side we are ready to engage in political dialogue. But we\u2019re also ready to respond if Russia chooses an armed conflict confrontation,\u201d Stoltenberg said in Brussels.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the United States remained focused on countering Russian disinformation, including anything that could be used as a pretext for attacks on Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t believe that President Putin has made a final decision to use these forces against Ukraine, he clearly now has that capability,\u201d Austin told reporters. He said \u201cthere are multiple options available to (Putin) including the seizure of cities and significant territories, but also coercive acts and provocative political acts like the recognition of breakaway territories.\u201d\n\nU.S. General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Russia\u2019s deployment was larger than anything in scale and scope since the Cold War and said the United States strongly recommended that Russia stand down. If Russia invades, the outcome would be \u201chorrific\u201d and result in significant casualties, Milley said. ENERGY SUPPLIES Lavrov said he expected to meet U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken again in the next couple of weeks. Their last meeting, in Geneva on Jan. 21, produced no breakthrough.\n\nHe said, without giving details, that the U.S. counter-proposals were better than NATO\u2019s. A senior U.S. administration official said the United States welcomed Lavrov\u2019s comment on Russia not wanting war, but \u201cwe need to see it backed up by swift action\u201d. \u201cIf it depends on Russia, then there will be no war. We don\u2019t want wars. But we also won\u2019t allow our interests to be rudely trampled, to be ignored,\u201d Lavrov told Russian radio stations. A U.N. Security Council meeting on Monday on the build-up of Russian forces on the border with Ukraine will be \u201can opportunity for Russia to explain what it is doing\u201d, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe United States and the European Union have warned Russia that it will face economic sanctions if it attacks Ukraine. These would build on sanctions imposed on Russia since it annexed Crimea and backed separatists in east Ukraine in 2014, though there are divisions among Western countries over how to respond as Europe is dependent on Russia for energy supplies. U.S. President Joe Biden and Ursula von der Leyen, who heads the EU executive, the European Commission, said they had agreed to cooperate on guaranteeing Europe\u2019s energy security but gave no details. Washington has been in talks with energy-producing countries and companies around the world over a potential diversion of supplies to Europe if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior Biden administration official told reporters this week. EU officials have repeatedly called for unity in the bloc over Ukraine, with some concerned that Germany \u2013 worried about energy supplies \u2013 has not taken a tougher stance. Russia has dismissed calls to withdraw its troops, saying it can deploy them as it sees fit on its own territory. It has cited the Western response as evidence that Russia is the target, not the instigator, of aggression. Ukraine has suggested a Russian attack is not imminent though an economically damaging war is possible. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy criticised a \u201cfeeling abroad\u201d that a war had already started. \u201cWe don\u2019t need this panic,\u201d Zelenskiy told reporters in Kyiv.\n\nReuters",
          "summary": "A Russian troop buildup along its border with Ukraine includes supplies of blood for the wounded, three U.S. officials told Reuters, a detail reinforcing U.S. comments that Russia \u201cclearly\u201d now has the capability to move on its neighbour.\nThe United States and NATO have said some of Russia\u2019s demands are non-starters but have also left the door open to dialogue.\nU.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the United States remained focused on countering Russian disinformation, including anything that could be used as a pretext for attacks on Ukraine.\nThe United States and the European Union have warned Russia that it will face economic sanctions if it attacks Ukraine.\nUkraine has suggested a Russian attack is not imminent though an economically damaging war is possible.",

          "title": "First Arabic Netflix Film Tackles Taboos, Sparks Controversy",
          "text": "Titled \u201cAshab Wala A\u2019azz,\u201d which means \u201cNo Dearer Friends,\u201d the movie is an Arabic version of the Italian hit \u201cPerfect Strangers,\u201d which has inspired many other international remakes. It tells the story of seven friends at a dinner party gone wrong after the hostess suggests that, as a game, they agree to share any calls, text and voice messages. As smart phones buzz, secrets are revealed, infidelities are exposed and relationships are tested.\n\nOthers have rallied to the film\u2019s defense, saying detractors are in denial about what happens behind closed doors in real life. Those who don\u2019t like the movie, they argue, are free to not subscribe to Netflix or simply skip the film.\n\nThe scenes in the first Arabic Netflix movie have sparked a public drama as intense as the one that plays out onscreen. On social media and TV talk shows and among friends in Egypt and other Middle East countries, a torrent of critics have denounced the film as a threat to family and religious values, encouraging homosexuality and unfit for Arab societies.\n\nAnd in a dramatic moment, a man reveals that he is gay, a secret he has kept from his longtime friends who are shocked \u2014 but seem mostly accepting.\n\nAn Egyptian wife discreetly slips off her black, lacy underwear from under her clothes before heading out for dinner, and it\u2019s not her husband she\u2019s trying to tantalize.\n\nA Lebanese father tells his teenage daughter she is free to choose whether to have sex with her boyfriend despite his reservations.\n\nThe controversy has re-ignited debates in the region over artistic freedom versus social and religious sensitivities; censorship; what constitutes a taboo in different societies and portrayal of gay characters.\n\nOne irony is that Netflix in the Middle East shows many non-Arabic movies and series that feature gay characters in a positive light, premarital and extramarital sex and even nudity \u2014 which is typically banned in cinemas in the region \u2014 with little outcry.\n\nBut to see those themes broached in an Arabic-language movie with Arab actors went too far for some. (The movie has no nudity; it\u2019s largely an hour and half of people talking around a dinner table.)\n\n\u201cI think if it\u2019s a normal foreign movie, I will be ok. But because it\u2019s an Arabic movie, I didn\u2019t accept it,\u201d said 37-year-old Elham, an Egyptian who asked for her last name to be withheld due to the sensitivity of the topic. \u201cWe don\u2019t accept the idea of homosexuality or intimate relations before marriage in our society, so what happened was a cultural shock.\u201d\n\nHomosexuality is a particularly strong taboo in Egypt: A 2013 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 95% in the country say it should be rejected by society; in Lebanon, that number stood at 80% at the time.\n\nThe movie\u2019s cast are mostly prominent Lebanese stars and its events are set in Lebanon. There, it has garnered many positive reviews. Fans said it discussed relatable topics away from stereotypes that are usually attached to gay characters or cheating spouses on screen.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like the Arab world\u2019s hatred of the truth,\u201d Rabih Farran, a Lebanese journalist, said in a tweet, referring to the backlash.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time that an Arabic-language movie has featured gay characters.\n\nMost famously, the 2006 movie \u201cThe Yacoubian Building\u201d with a cast of A-list Egyptian actors caused a stir for, among other things, including a gay main character. But the character was ultimately killed by his lover in what many saw as punishment.\n\nIn contrast, the gay character in \u201cAshab Wala A\u2019azz\u201d is not depicted negatively. Another character encourages him to expose his former employers who let him go for his sexual identity.\n\nFatima Kamal, a 43-year-old Egyptian, said she didn\u2019t find it to be promoting same-sex relationships. She argued that some Egyptian movies in the past were more daring.\n\n\u201cThe movie touched on issues that the society refuses to confront but they do happen,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all have a dark side and hidden stories.\u201d\n\nKamal, who has a 12-year-old son, also dismissed the idea the film would corrupt Arab youth.\n\n\u201cTechnology has changed society. Restricting movies is not the answer,\u201d she said. \u201cThe solution is to watch based on age ratings and to talk to the young and make them understand that not everything we see on the screen is OK.\u201d\n\nTalking on a popular TV show, Egyptian lawmaker Mostafa Bakry contended Egyptian and Arab family values are being targeted.\n\n\u201cThis is neither art nor creativity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must ban Netflix from being in Egypt\u201d even if temporarily.\n\nMagda Maurice, an art critic debating Bakry on the show, disagreed. \u201cThis movie exposes what mobile phones do to people and to their normal lives,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou cannot ban anything now but you can confront it with good art,\u201d she added. \u201cBanning has become a thing of the past.\u201d\n\nIn Egypt, much of the furor focused on the sole Egyptian woman in the cast, Mona Zaki, one of the country\u2019s biggest stars. Her character is the one seen slipping off her underwear, a gesture that many critics decried as scandalous.\n\nIn social media, some attacked her for participating in the film. The online abuse extended to actors and actresses who supported her or praised her performance. Some criticized her real-life husband, an Egyptian movie star in his own right, for \u201callowing\u201d her to play the role.\n\nThe Egyptian actors syndicate came out in support of Zaki, saying it will not abide verbal abuse or intimidation against actors over their work. It said that freedom of creativity \u201cis protected and defended by the syndicate,\u201d while adding that it is committed to the values of Egyptian society.\n\nThe Associated Press reached out to Netflix for a comment on the controversy but didn\u2019t receive one.\n\nEgypt has long celebrated its cinema industry, which earned it the nickname \u201cHollywood of the East,\u201d lured actors from other Arabic-speaking countries and brought Egyptian movies and dialect into Arab homes the world over.\n\nFilm critic Khaled Mahmoud said Egypt \u201cused to produce powerful and daring movies in the 1960s and 1970s.\u201d But much of that adventurousness has been lost with the trend of so-called \u201cclean cinema,\u201d emphasizing themes deemed family appropriate with no physical intimacy or immodest attire, he added.\n\n\u201cSociety has changed, and the viewership culture has become flawed.\u201d\n\nStorylines about affairs or sexual relations are not uncommon in Arabic films. But female stars are commonly grilled in interviews over whether they would agree to wear swimsuits or kiss co-stars on camera.\n\n\u201cOur job is to let art be art,\u201d Mahmoud said. \u201cWe cannot critique art through a moral lens.\u201d",
