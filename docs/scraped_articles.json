          "title": "Ethiopia condemns US sanctions on Eritrea",
          "text": "Ethiopia on Saturday denounced new US sanctions on neighbouring Eritrea over Asmara\u2019s role in the deadly conflict pitting Ethiopian forces against Tigrayan rebels, calling on Washington to \u201crescind its decision\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe real target for sanctions and further tougher actions by the US government and the greater international community should be directed towards the TPLF,\u201d Ethiopia\u2019s foreign ministry said, referring to the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front rebel group.\n\nEritrean and Ethiopian forces have been accused of carrying out mass rapes and massacres in Tigray and Washington has repeatedly urged Asmara to withdraw its troops.\n\nOn Saturday Eritrea said the sanctions reflected a \u201cmisguided and hostile policy\u201d by the US, and were based on false allegations.\n\n\u201cThis unilateral sanction, that shifts blame to and scapegoats Eritrea on the basis of spurious allegations, is in contravention of international law, and constitutes a flagrant breach of\u2026 sovereignty,\u201d the authoritarian state\u2019s ministry of information said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThat the primary aim of the illicit and immoral sanctions is to inculcate suffering and starvation on the population so as to induce political unrest and instability is patently clear.\u201d\n\nEthiopia on Saturday declared its support for Eritrea, denouncing the sanctions and urging its former ally Washington to \u201crescind its decision\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe real target for sanctions and further tougher actions by the US government and the greater international community should be directed towards the TPLF,\u201d Ethiopia\u2019s foreign ministry said, stressing that Eritrea was \u201cnot an impediment to sustainable peace\u201d.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken has also threatened to impose sanctions against Abiy\u2019s government and the rebels unless they move forward on talks, warning that Ethiopia risks \u201cimplosion\u201d if fighting continues.\n\n\u201cWe are not imposing sanctions at this time on elements aligned with the government of Ethiopia and TPLF to allow time and space to see if these talks can make progress,\u201d Blinken said, ahead of a three-nation trip to Africa next week.\n\nBut Cameron Hudson, a former US official now at the Atlantic Council, said the sanctions had missed the mark.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister Abiy remains in the driver\u2019s seat of this conflict and choosing to once again avoid sanctioning Ethiopian entities reflects a belief from Washington that Abiy can be engaged and his approach to this conflict changed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing particularly in evidence to support that assumption, however.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Rights abuses \u2013\n\nAs fighting has dragged on, the humanitarian toll has spiked, with reports of massacres and mass rapes.\n\nOn Saturday, the government-affiliated Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said Tigrayan rebels killed scores of civilians in the Amhara region on suspicion of being informants, supporting Abiy\u2019s government or offering aid to federal forces.\n\nDozens of civilians also died due to indiscriminate shelling by both Ethiopian forces and the rebels, the EHRC added.\n\nTPLF spokesman Getachew Reda told AFP the report was \u201cwhitewashing Abiy\u2019s crimes and blaming others for it. We won\u2019t dignify the report by response.\u201d\n\nAbiy\u2019s government has said it is committed to holding perpetrators of abuses accountable, while the TPLF has called for independent investigations into rights violations.\n\nAs international efforts to broker a ceasefire intensify, Ethiopia on Thursday laid out conditions for possible talks with the TPLF, which has claimed major gains in recent weeks and not ruled out a march on the capital Addis Ababa.\n\nThe conditions include a halt to attacks, a TPLF withdrawal from Amhara and Afar, and recognition of the government\u2019s legitimacy.\n\nThe TPLF in turn is demanding that aid be let into Tigray. No assistance has arrived by road since October 18, and 364 trucks are stuck in Afar awaiting authorisation, according to the United Nations.\n\nAbiy sent troops into Tigray last November to topple the TPLF, a move he said came in response to rebel attacks on army camps.\n\nThough the 2019 Nobel Peace laureate vowed a swift victory, by late June the TPLF had retaken most of Tigray before expanding into Amhara and Afar.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "The Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo has said that Nigeria\u2019s ability to effectively tackle the COVID-19 pandemic was as a result of strategic and responsive leadership.\n\nHe said that while many advanced economies were struggling to deal with the fallouts of the global pandemic, the federal government effectively contained the pandemic by deploying a responsive and effective public health framework.\n\nAccording to a statement issued on Saturday, the Vice President disclosed this on Friday evening at the public presentation of the book, \u2018Winning Leadership\u2019, by Major-General Pat Akem-Vingir (retd.).\n\nThe statement which was issued by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande was titled, \u2018Strategic leadership helped Nigeria tackle COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 Osinbajo says at retired General\u2019s book presentation.\n\nIt quoted the Vice President as saying, \u201cAs General Pat Akem argues in Winning Leadership that knowledgeable and agile leadership at the strategic level is one that is able to mobilise resources \u2013 human, financial and material \u2013 of nations and organisations \u2013 in an effective and result-oriented manner.\n\n\u201cSuch leadership is able to attain goals and visions and also able to protect and promote interests. In other words, effective strategic leadership purposefully provides direction and inspires.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest surprises for many was how some of the wealthiest and most developed economies of the world were tragically unprepared to handle a public health crisis on the scale and uncertainty of Covid-19.\n\n\u201cWhereas countries with more modest economic profiles, quickly deployed a public health framework that was responsive and effective.\u201d\n\nThe Vice President mentioned the establishment of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, an inter-ministerial interagency team led by the Secretary of the Government of the Federation as a reference.\n\nHe recalled that the PTF coordinated the national response, set the rules and briefed the nation daily for months.\n\nHe added that when the first doses of vaccines arrived, the task force developed the protocols and the public health system to enforce mass vaccination campaigns across the country to ensure that the first eligible vaccine candidates received their vaccinations seamlessly.\n\nButtressing his point on strategic leadership, Osinbajo said such kind of leadership requires imagination, clarity of vision and effective implementation, because of current global challenges, changes and opportunities.\n\nThe Vice President further noted that \u201cas a nation, the threats to our corporate existence today are unprecedented and hitherto unimagined. It is against this background that the author\u2019s prescriptions have to be taken seriously. As he pointed out, exceptional leaders do not just emerge, they are the products of deliberate efforts in policymaking, training and grooming.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging that there wasn\u2019t a magic solution that leaders can deploy to solve 21st Century economic, social and security challenges, Osinbajo stated that \u201conly knowledgeable, well developed, trained and motivated leaders will win.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Edo political class under the sword of damocles",
          "text": "By: Washington Osa Osifo, Ph.D.\n\nEvery upward looking society crave for good leadership. Indeed great leaders are most wanted for what they could do with their gifts and talents to revolutionize development . Their dreams and visions are always so distinctly unique that even in times of drift, their mere presence instill hope and confidence.\n\nIn that quest, sometimes, a shot in the dark occurs resulting in fortuitous satanic contraption. Edo State has just now been entrapped in such a hellish cobweb. Statecraft has suddenly become rocket science while security of lives and properties are attended with laissez faire attitude.\n\nGovernment promises on paper are advertised with bold face as monumental achievements at national fora to the chagrin of dumbstruck populace. Worse still, is that, the tyrannic display of executive powers to inflict deep wounds on citizens is phenomenal and has continued to fuel a feeling of imminent catastrophic slip into the precipice.\n\nIn the circumstances, sound logic dictates that the people should disenthrall themselves from the mess and rescue the State. Apparently, the pre- election hype, the ballyhoo, the gaudy tinsel of rhetorics and the massive hope, ballooned to high heavens has turned out as mere hot gas! The most fanatical supporters of the Governor patiently waited for a developmental momentum to no avail. Unarguably, \u2018Alaghodaro Annual Talk Shop\u2019 stands out as the greatest legacy project in these perilous times. Let it be known that no matter how much you try, an empty sack cannot stand erect!\n\nI recall vividly that in 2016, a stealthy figure silhouetted against the silver lines of the then Governor of Edo State, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole impressive stewardship, suddenly emerged on the political stage as a gubernatorial messiah. He rode on the shoulders of the then boss, Comrade Oshiomhole, who fiercely fought every opponent to pave way for him.\n\nBeing relatively unknown, it was the lot of his campaign handlers to clean him up and properly identify him before the people. A commodity must have a label and utility value before displaying it for sale in the market! As an aspirant, he looked egregiously naive, diffident and unsure-footed. He had no gift of physical appeal and was greatly hampered and unpersuasive in speech.\n\nAs his confidence built up over time, a whiff of eccentricity and unpredictability began to be increasingly noticed. His hazy image was crystallized and heavily laundered to hagiographical heights and the unsuspecting public in their characteristic gullibility bought wholesale into the project. Make no mistake about it, it was a classic shot in the dark that berthed a bull in a china shop! Everyone and everything before him was untrustworthy and a target for destruction. First, he stereotyped the entire political class as unproductive and irredeemably corrupt \u2013 a case of pot calling the kettle black! His hatred for them was never hidden.\n\nAs Governor, he organized a group of brutal media attack dogs and marshaled every ounce of gubernatorial power and influence against his benefactor, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole as National Chairman of the ruling party, All Progressives Congress, APC. It was at a monumental financial cost, as the secret activities of the conspiratorial group at the seat of power in Abuja were bankrolled with Edo State resources. By that act, Edo State lost strategic national presence in the party.\n\nHe led an onslaught against the leadership of the state APC, disorganized and dismembered them. When they obstinately refused to succumb, he hounded them down individually with guns, bombs and bayonets, venting his anger on their properties. He had a long standing plan to weaken the legislature under his administration.\n\nNo one will forget so soon how, in the year 2019, particularly on the 17th day of June, figment of impeachment imagination triggered his phobia to attack the elected members of Edo State House of Assembly at the Golden Tulip Hotel in Benin City. The attack was led by his CSO and clearly caught by cameras. Till date, Obaseki has continued to rule Edo State without a properly and legitimately constituted House of Assembly as defined by Section 91 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. On such ugly sides of history, he chose to be counted as champion!\n\nGovernor Obaseki was disqualified from running for a second term under the APC. He cried blue murder from the limbo of frustration and was rescued by the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP who bent backwards over to accommodate him. He won the election and was sworn-in for another four years tenure.\n\nLess than six months in office under the PDP, he literally asked the leadership of the PDP to hand over the structures of the party to him. To those who rescued him from the limbo of hopelessness and \u2018partylessness\u2019, taking over the party structures was a superfluous request, as it did not form part of the deal since he was not going to run for a third term. Rather than deploy emotional intelligence to negotiate a win win compromise, Obaseki characteristically resorted to iron fist measures by directing the suspension of the commanding chieftains of the party.\n\nTypical of his double barrelled approach, he filed several Court cases by proxy seeking the asphyxiation of the party and the humiliation of its leadership. Let us be more categorical here. Chief Dan Orbih ostensibly personalized the PDP struggle for nearly two decades at about the same time that Comrade Oshiomhole rescued Obaseki by making him Chairman of the state economic team after running his company into financial mess in Lagos. How dare you try to uproot such an entrenched colossus?\n\nIn any case, why should stakeholders in Edo State allow Obaseki to destroy those who make Edo count and relevant in national politics? The National Leadership of the PDP rightly denied him conspiratorial support and the Governors disowned him, both organs were wisely guided by his track record of reprehensible jackboot tactics. For a man with explosive ego and unquenchable capacity to inflict pain on others, the fight has only just begun! Beyond politics, the Governor even dared to disagree with the most sacred of our institutions on matters that are not strictly within the state government\u2018s purview.\n\nEvidence abound that the toxic sword of Damocles is menacingly hanging over the political class in Edo State. They have been targeted for humiliation and decimation with a view to poisoning the atmosphere with yet another half baked, ill- conceived and unworkable technocratic agenda. The political class must act fast with a united force. This monster must be tamed, gagged and thrown into the dungeon with the same pitiless manner that he launches out at his perceived enemies!\n\nHistory is a great teacher. Those who cannot learn from the lessons of history are doomed to repeat it. The political environment has no room for outsiders. Any political milieu that admits an outsider into the most powerful leadership position would have only invited a killer virus to itself. Party politics is a collective endeavour anchored on common political ideology and interest which are rolled out on acquisition of power through fair competition.\n\nThe parties are additionally organic entities driven by certain group values, norms, traditions and the principle of reciprocity which are expressed in patronage. Members imbibe these ideological and operational values and norms through active participation in the political process over time. These values promote party spirit, energize foot soldiers and hold the party together as a united front. A party stands endangered if an individual who has not been sufficiently groomed to internalize group values suddenly becomes the leader.\n\nThe need for systematic grooming and orientation of members is informed by the fact that the action of men proceeds best from their need, belief, passion and character. It should ordinarily form the basis for leadership recruitment.\n\nAmong mainstream politicians, there are the fickle-minded, the ones bereft of principles, good conscience and character, commonly referred to, as \u2018Any Government in Power ( AGIP)\u2019. They are pro power or pro establishment who would try to co-opt or align with the toxic outsider for their stomach sake.\n\nThis sort of devil\u2019s bargain often mutate to the benefit of the insurgent. Godwin Obaseki may not have been thrown up as President of Nigeria but as the Governor of Edo State, a subnational body, he runs the State with the same iron fist of Adolf Hitler and the hypocritical propaganda of Donald Trump. He menacingly dangles a double edged sword and the political class in Edo State live under the technocratic sword of Damocles, hanging by the slenderest thread over their heads and capable of being cut at any moment. Only a double fool will wait to be told what to do under such looming danger!\n\nToday, the political class are clearly endangered and embattled in Edo State. And when a government is secretive about her finances and expenditures, when a government is not transparent and does not give accounts of its stewardship to the people, when a government goes after the properties and investments of citizens without recourse to legal processes and procedures and when a government fails to deliver visible achievements but make fathom claims on paper about its great accomplishments, what you have is full blown tyranny. To confront a tyrant is a civil responsibility and obedience to God!\n\nIn the admonitions of Sir Winston Churchill, \u201cSuccess is not final, failure is not fatal, it is the courage to continue that counts\u201d\n\nWashington Osa Osifo, Ph.D\n\nUhunmwode Constituency,\n\nEdo State.",

          "text": "Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, has disclosed the Federal Government\u2019s plans to regulate sodium consumption by Nigerians through packaged foods.\n\nEhanire stated this at the first multi-sectoral stakeholders\u2019 meeting of Nigeria\u2019s Sodium Reduction Study, jointly organised by National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and the University of Abuja.\n\nRepresented by the Director, Public Health in the Ministry of Health, Dr. Alex Oko, the minister said the framework would help in reducing morbidity and mortality of incidence by instituting cost-effective policies and social interventions that would interface behaviours and lifestyle changes.\n\nIt would also reduce modifiable risk factors for the prioritised Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) within health in all policies approach.\n\nShe said that some of the objectives of the NCDs Multi-sectorial Action Plan include promoting a healthy lifestyle and diet, as well as reducing salt intake through the reformulation of processed food products to contain less salt.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cThe Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) Multi-sectoral Action Plan which is an alignment with WHO global NCDs action plan as well as the WHO \u2018SHAKE\u2019 technical package for salt reduction.\n\n\u201cThe implementation of the plan aims to achieve specific national subjects as an aspect of the global NCDs goal and SDGs to achieve among other things as an effective reduction in mean population in case of salt, and sodium, which means two grammes per day by 2025 through regulation and reformulation of processed food products to contain less salt,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso speaking, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Abuja, Prof Abdul-Rasheed Na\u2019Allah, said the current research on sodium consumption (salt consumption) is so crucial to the ability to live a good life.\n\n\u201cPeople think salt is sweet. In my place where I come from, we regard salt as the opposite of bitterness, but we are being told here that if you take too much salt, you risk hypertension, your kidney and different kinds of crisis.\n\n\u201cSo, it is really about knowledge and our ability to know what it is we have to eat, and our ability to be able to afford and enforce this knowledge that we have.\n\n\u201cI call on the Nigerian government especially the NAFDAC that that is part of this to not shy away from making policies to help on our people.\n\n\u201cOur policymakers must do policies to help all of us. This research will help NAFDAC and other policymakers to enforce. Also, especially in schools, we have to teach the young people in their curricula, health education and so on, that too much salt intake is dangerous. Probably, they will grow to be careful. These are the kind of topics that our curriculum should contain.\u201d He said.\n\nEarlier, the Director-General of NAFDAC, Prof Mojisola Adeyeye, said the objectives of the meeting are to present the preliminary findings of the first phase of the project which involved surveys carried out in the Federal Capital Territory, Ogun and Kano States, and to discuss potential strategies to scale up implementation of the salt reduction activities.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this meeting is to increase the awareness of the positive impact of sodium salt reduction on health in the food industry, amongst the policymakers, consumers and other stakeholders; set the regulatory agenda of scaled-up awareness on the risk of cardiovascular problems associated with high salt intake and or high salt usage amongst NAFDAC Stakeholders.\n\n\u201cSodium is mainly consumed as salt (sodium chloride) which in the diet can come from processed foods, either because they contain large amounts of salt (such as ready meals, processed meats like bacon, Corn beef, \u201cSuya\u201d, cheese, salty snack foods and instant noodles, among others, or because they are consumed frequently in large amounts (such as bread and processed cereal products).\n\nREAD ALSO: Millions of Nigerians are at risk as the government ignores other diseases\n\n\u201cSalt is also added to food during cooking (bouillon and stock cubes) or at the table (soy sauce, chilli sauce, fish sauce and table salt). Habitual consumption of excess salt may seem harmless, but it is linked to several non-communicable diseases which are prevalent in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBased on the outcomes of this study NAFDAC will be ready to do more with the collaboration of our stakeholders in the interest of safeguarding the public health. While NAFDAC is continuously making efforts using the above mechanisms to reduce the salt intake in the population, there is a need for strengthened and continued collaboration amongst relevant stakeholders including government and non-state actors in achieving the set target by WHO in salt intake reduction by 2025,\u201d she said.\n\nShe, however, called on the cooperation of food manufacturers, processors, importers, and the restaurant sector in lowering the amount of salt in the food supply to enable consumers to access a reduced salt diet.\n\nIn the report titled \u201cEvaluating implementation and scale-up of Nigeria\u2019s national sodium reduction program\u201d released at the meeting, Prof Mark Huffman of the Northwestern University said the survey showed that Nigerian foods exceed WHO benchmarks across \u201csaltiest\u201d categories.\n\nAs part of the recommendations, he identified the need to improve community awareness and knowledge as well as improve the standardization and awareness of nutritional labelling.\n\nHe also called for multi-sectoral collaboration and engagement. Strong government leadership, regulatory processes, and accountability mechanisms to enhance trust and ensure a level playing field.",

          "title": "Fresh call for restructuring: Northern elders carpet Afenifere leader",
          "text": "By Vincent Kalu, Lagos, Noah Ebije, Kaduna and Sola Ojo, Kaduna\n\nSome Northern leaders have criticized Chief Ayo Adebanjo, leader of Afenifere, over his recent press statement calling for the restructuring of the country. The leaders who include Anthony Sani, immediate past Secretary General of Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Yerima Shettima, President, Arewa Youth Consultative Forum and Prof. Usman Yusuf, former Chief Executive of National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), accused the nonagenarian of political mischief, noting that his statement was capable of promoting ethno-religious crisis in the country.\n\nChief Adebanjo had, in a press statement, entitled, \u201cLet it be heard loud and clear\u201d, stressed that, \u201cAfenifere shall be leading the Yoruba nation to demand substantial restructuring, before any fraudulent elections might be held in 2023. The response of the Buharist regime to these equitable demands restructuring the country along federalist lines, in order to restore it to its roots and original agreements, shall go a long way in shaping the position of the Yoruba people in the future.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nIt further noted: \u201cLet it be heard loud and clear: Nigeria is not only negotiable, it is evidently dying. Gen. Yakubu Gowon (rtd) fought to keep Nigeria one. Is it for the Fulani to dominate other ethnic nationalities? Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (rtd), said that Nigerian unity is non-negotiable. Is it for the Yorubas to be under Fulani domination?\n\n\u201d\n\nThe statement further appealed to the sense of justice of some eminent Nigerians: \u201cYour Eminence, Alhaji Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, Sultan of Sokoto; Gen. Abdusulami Abubakar (rtd); Bishop Kukah, can we have peace without equity and justice?\u201d\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nIn his reaction Sani advised Adebanjo to be civil when commenting on national issues, adding that democracy was not an avenue to call for war. \u201cChief Ayo Adebanjo has the right to air his views on issues of national importance and use multiparty democracy to pursue his passion,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocracy is a contest of ideas and reasons and not a bull fight in a sumo ring. As someone who professes jaunty face of democratic values, the Chief knows how to use multiparty democracy to further his desires. But in doing so, he must note that in democracy, majority has its say and way while minority has only its say. That is why the whites in Oronia in South Africa have their say but not their way.\u201d\n\nHe called on Adebanjo not only to return to his progressive politics of yesteryears, as elder statesman, but to also support his arguments and statements with facts. He said: \u201cAs a scion of Chief Awolowo who pursued progressive politics that has no place for circumstance of birth but content of character in the order of things, Chief Ayo Adebanjo would help the country more by not promoting cleavages of the nation of over 250 ethnic groups along ethnic and religious lines.\n\n\u201cMore distressing is when he does not use fact-checks in support of his allegation of Fulanization. Most Nigerians would therefore be more confident of Chief Ayo Adebanjo\u2019s submission as an elder statesman if he is able to let the nation know the distribution of access of national resources, namely appointment, projects and major contracts by ethnicity. This is because by his obsession with allegation of Fulanization does not make the situation so.\u201d\n\nShettima who confessed to having tremendous respect for the elder statesman, \u201cexcept for this approach\u201d, cautioned him to tread carefully on the issue of restructuring, adding that it was not something that affects only Afenifere or South-West, but the entire county. He noted: \u201cIt is not about Afenifere. It is not about the South-West. We don\u2019t need to shoot our feet before we get to the battle. Often this is where our leaders or political leaders do get it wrong. Nobody or a group of a few people can make a highland. It has to be seen as an inclusive project in Nigeria because everybody is a victim of this very system. Even in the South-West, Afenifere cannot be said to be speaking for all and this is the reality of things. When you begin to talk as if you are talking on behalf of the whole country then, it has a lot of suspicions.\u201d\n\nHe asked: \u201cIs the country doing fine? The answer is no. Do we need to change things so that at the end of the day we might do a different thing from what we have now? The answer is yes. It then means that the likes of him, the likes of me and others who believe in this idea must be seen to meet and discuss issues. You don\u2019t make it sound as personal affairs because once there is suspicion, you don\u2019t have the buy-in of others.\u201d\n\nProf. Yusuf called on his fellow Northerners to ignore the press statement. \u201cAyo Adebanjo is a confused, bitter, frustrated, rambling and irrelevant old man at 93,\u201d he said. \u201cMy people do not care about his message or the personality that delivered the message.\u201d\n\nBut the National President of Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr. Bitrus Pogu, differed from others. According to him, the Middle Belt Forum and the Afenifere are on the same page with regard to the issue of restructuring, adding that it has to take place for the country to move forward.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe electoral bill which has been passed by the National Assembly and waiting for president\u2019s ascent is part of restructuring. It has to take place for Nigeria to move forward and for agitations for separation and breakaway to stop. If Nigeria is restructured and everybody feels happy, and nobody is dominating the others, Nigeria would remain one, and reach the level of development it supposed.\n\n\u201cGo and read Gideon Orkar\u2019s coup statement. He captured what is happening now very well \u2013 where a group is dominating this country; not only dominating, it has now unleashed terror on others. Everywhere you go, you hear Fulani herdsmen, bandits, Boko Haram. They are coming from the area Orkar wanted to excise out of Nigeria because of their domination.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this government will do justice to restructure this country because without it, these separatist agitations will grow. Before, it was only in the Southeast and now it has come to Southwest, and you have NINAS coming out to talk on behalf of indigenous ethnic nationalities. All these agitations are coming up because Nigeria is not working.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

And one of the ways to achieve that purpose, they reasoned, was to collect N6million from Obinna\u2019s mother, Mrs Rose Nwatu,\u201d CP Agbede said.\n\nThe police boss informed Saturday Sun that the two decided to meet another teenager, 19-year-old Chinaza Favour Ukaigwe at the latter\u2019s shop in Aba, Abia State and requested for his bank account details. They told Chinaza that they wanted to use the bank account details to receive the school fees of their younger sister. The CP explained that Chinaza then gave them the bank account details.\n\n\u201cAlso, the suspect, Obinna Nwatu. on September 17, went and hid himself inside a hotel along Rhema University Road, Aba. He stayed there for three days and his gang member, Chinaza Ugorji started calling Nwatu\u2019s mother, Mrs Rose Nwatu, saying Obinna had been kidnapped and demanding a N6 million ransom. After negotiations, the woman paid N200, 000 into the bank account of Chinaza Favour Ukaigwe. The suspect, Chinaza Ugorji, who is at large, went and withdrew the money and was nowhere to be found,\u201d the police commissioner said.\n\nCP Agbede explained further: \u201cThe incident was first reported at Isiala Ngwa Police Station on September 18, and the police started investigations immediately. Later it was transferred to the Anti-Kidnapping Squad on October 4, 2021. The Anti-Kidnapping operatives swung into action and arrested Chinaza Favour Ukaigwe whose bank account Mrs Rose Nwatu paid the ransom of N200, 000 into.\n\n\u201cIt was the victim, Chinaza Favour Ukaigwe who revealed that it was Obinna Nwatu and Chinaza Ugorji a.k.a \u201cWizzy\u201d who came to his shop and collected his bank account details from him. That was what led the Anti-Kidnapping operatives to arrest Obinna Nwatu on October 7, 2021 and he confessed to have kidnapped himself.\u201d\n\nThe suspect\u2019s brother, Wisdom Nwatu also spoke to Saturday Sun: He said: \u201cI went to Isiala Ngwa Police Station on September 18, 2021 and reported that my younger brother, Obinna Nwatu was kidnapped along Stadium Road, Okpuala Ngwo to an unknown destination by hoodlums operating in an Ash colour Sienna with an unknown registration number. My brother, Obinna Nwatu went to buy recharge card that evening when the incident occurred. It was later that the kidnappers called my mother and demanded a ransom of N6million. After much pressure, my mother paid N200, 000 into the bank account of the kidnappers.\n\n\u201cI was shocked when my brother. Obinna was arrested for the kidnapping. He confessed that he kidnapped himself to extort money from our mother, Mrs Rose Nwatu. Obinna is the black sheep in the family.\u201d\n\nThe suspect, Obinna Nwatu, also explained how the incident happened to Saturday Sun. He said: \u201cI attended Prince and Princess Primary School, and from there proceeded to Good Shepherd Secondary School Umuahia. I am an SS3 student of the school. I met Chinaza Ugorji on Facebook in 2017 when I was 13 years old. We always had conversations together. It was Chinaza Ugorji who introduced me to kidnapping. He told me that he needed money. We decided to meet Chinaza Favour Ukaigwe and requested for his bank account number and we deceived him that we want to use it to receive the school fees of my younger sister and he gave it to us.\n\n\u201cI hail from Obikabia in Isiala Ngwa North Local Government Area of Abia State. My father is dead while my mother is alive. I hate my mother, Mrs Rose Nwatu. She has been so stingy, and whenever I need money, she would not give it to me. I lived in a boarding school.\n\n\u201cI \u2018kidnapped\u2019 myself and hid inside the hotel for three days while my friend extorted money from my mother. I gave him my mother\u2019s phone number. It was Chinaza Ugorji who was calling my mother and threatening her that they would kill me if she didn\u2019t pay the ransom demanded. It was later my mother paid N200, 000 to the bank account of Chinaza Favour Ukaigwe.\n\n\u201cLater, after the money was paid, it was Chinaza Ugorji who called me on the phone saying that my mother had paid N200,000 as ransom. I left the hotel after spending three days, and immediately, Chinaza Ugorji went and withdrew the N200, 000. I told him to give me my own share, and he told me we would see later. He took the N200, 000 away. I didn\u2019t get one kobo from the money. It was after Chinaza Favour Ukaigwe had been arrested that I was also arrested by the Anti-Kidnapping operatives. I have regretted what I did. Is it the stress my mother went through? I want my family to forgive me. It is a big lesson for me.\u201d\n\nThe suspect\u2019s mother, Mrs Rose Nwatu also spoke with Saturday Sun. Her words: \u201cIt was a terrible incident in my life. I never thought of it that in my life, my own son, Obinna would be involved in kidnapping. When the Anti-Kidnapping operatives came to arrest my son, I disagreed with them. I believe so much in my son that he can never be involved in kidnapping. When the kidnappers were calling for ransom, I didn\u2019t hear my own son\u2019s voice. It was still a shock when my son, Obinna was arrested. He confessed that he was the mastermind and that he conspired with a gang member to extort me of N200, 000. I do care for my son; this is just a lesson for him. I lost my husband some years back, I am the one who is caring for the family.\u201d\n\nCP Agbede said that Obinna would soon be charged to court while the police are still after the other suspect, Ugorji, who has absconded.\n\nThe police boss urged the public to always give the police useful information to enable them to move fast and arrest the fleeing suspect.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "Our Correspondents\n\nThough, President Muhammadu Buhari is yet to sign into law the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021, passed this week by the National Assembly, which, among other things, makes direct primaries mandatory for all parties for election of candidates, state governors across party lines are firming new plot to scuttle the amendment.\n\nThe governors, who felt the alteration would strip them of their power of deciding candidates for all elective positions in their parties, mounted pressure on the lawmakers to drop the amendment. But the lawmakers refused to back down; they went ahead to add mandatory direct primaries to the bill.\n\nFor the lawmakers, the amendment would strip the governors of their massive influence over delegates and restore the powers of all the members of the parties, with regard to selecting candidates for elections.\n\n\u201cThis amendment, if signed by the President, will also stop the governors from removing federal lawmakers at will. They just sit in their offices and decide who will return and who will not return. They have been doing this for over 20 years,\u201d a Senator, who pleaded for anonymity, told THISDAY last night.\n\nThe Senator eagerly pointed to how Governor Nasir El-rufai of Kaduna State stopped all the state\u2019s three senators in the Eight Senate from returning to the Ninth Senate.\n\nBut the state governors have not given up. They want their powers over delegates/selection of candidates retained and are ready to do anything to achieve this.\n\nAs a source put it last night, \u201cthe governors are ready for total war on this amendment.\u201d\n\nSources close to one of the governors told THISDAY: \u201cThe governors are waiting for President Muhammadu Buhari to return from France, so that they can pressure him to withhold assent to the bill. They believe they can convince the President to stay on their side. They are very sure that the President will send this bill back to the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nAnother source also said the governors \u201care not ruling out legal actions\u201d in case the President decides to sign the bill.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is a Constitutional issue. Any law against the Constitution becomes invalid. Constitutionally, the political parties have the right to decide their mode of primaries to select candidate. Making direct primaries mandatory is unconstitutional. In any case, democracy is also about choice in any selection process. It is undemocratic to limit the political parties to direct primaries.\u201d\n\nBut one of the Senators, who led the mandatory direct primaries, said insinuations that it was undemocratic and unconstitutional \u201cis a ruse.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cDemocracy is also about people having a say in selecting candidates for elections.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with newsmen last Monday night at the end of the meeting held at Kebbi State Governor\u2019s Lodge, Asokoro, Abuja, Kebbi governor and Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum, PGF, Atiku Abubakar Bagudu said the governors were unhappy about the National Assembly\u2019s resolution on direct primaries.\n\nThe Kebbi governor, who faulted the National Assembly\u2019s insertion of direct primary into the law, maintained that political parties should be allowed to pick the option best suited for them. Bagudu noted that the resolution was against the spirit of Executive Order signed by President Buhari, which frowns on large gathering in the wake of the global pandemic.\n\nHe further argued that direct primaries were too cumbersome, unwieldy and would overstretch the limited resources of INEC, statutorily mandated to oversee primaries conducted by political parties.\n\nHe said: \u201cDirect primaries involve supervisory role by INEC. So, if multiple political parties are doing their primaries, INEC resources will be overstretched, and I think the chairman of INEC had even commented on that.\u201d\n\nThe PDP leadership is also opposed to mandatory direct primaries.\n\nThe PDP said, \u201cOur party holds that it is the inalienable right of each political party, within the context of our constitutional democracy to decide its form of internal democratic practices including the processes of nominating its candidates for elections at any level.\u201d\n\nThe PDP also believes that no political party should force its own processes on any other political party, as the direct primaries amendment, \u201ca practice the APC sought to achieve.\u201d\n\nThe Director General, Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Lukman, also alleged that APC lawmakers pushing for direct primaries were out to hoodwink the party.\n\nThe APC chieftain said understandably, part of the sentiment informing the actions of members of the National Assembly was that \u201cNigerians have little or zero confidence on the disposition of party leaders, who are alleged to be under the direct control of governors.\u201d\n\nLukman stressed that largely because of this perception, there was an ongoing media campaign blackmailing governors; that they were the ones perpetrating all the bad practices associated with the indirect methods and therefore the reason why they were against the adoption of direct primary.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

There is, therefore, no better time to canvass for solidarity for the enthronement of peace and development.\n\n\u201cThe anniversary cautions us not to overlook our achievements and challenges of the past and present; not to overlook how our journey together has shaped our world.\u201d\n\nNigeria, he said, in felicitating with UNESCO, remained proud of its close association with the organisation since its establishment.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cSeventy-five years of building together a more advanced, knowledgeable and prosperous world through education, science, culture, communication and information.\n\n\u201cToday calls to mind the words of Federico Mayor, Director-General of UNESCO from 1987-1999 and I quote: \u2018any history begins when human beings have to draw from their knowledge of the past in order to better understand the present and look ahead to the future, when they come to realise that they must look into the facts, events and trends that have pre-figured their own era.\u2019 These are profound words, and they stand the test of time.\n\n\u201cAs we mark UNESCO\u2019s anniversary, we must acknowledge that it is a celebration of history; an occasion to remind ourselves of how far we have traveled, seeking to achieve the founding objectives of this great intellectual hub of the United Nations.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian leader further expressed happiness for being a part of the historic celebration, while congratulating UNESCO and its current leadership, for keeping the vision of the great organisation alive.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs a Member-State of UNESCO, Nigeria felicitates with all other Member-States, Associates and partners, who have walked the journey alongside UNESCO.\u201d\n\n\u2018Nigerians Competitive Abroad Due to Good Education Attained at Home\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Buhari yesterday said the competitiveness which Nigerians display abroad \u201cis a result of the good education they acquired before travelling out of the country.\u201d\n\nThis is as he urged Nigerians in Diaspora to always abide by the rules of their host countries.\n\nThe President said this when he met with the Minister of State Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, Shaikh Shakboot Alnahyan, on the sidelines of the Paris Peace Forum.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cNigerians are all over the place, very competitive. And the competitiveness starts from home, where they have acquired good education, gone into businesses, and then take all that abroad.\u201d\n\nThe President encouraged Nigerians in Diaspora to \u201csubject themselves to the rules and standards of the country in which they live, either as working class, or doing businesses.\u201d\n\nHe welcomed the offer by UAE to partner with Nigeria in the areas of renewable energy, agriculture, infrastructure logistics, and provision of vaccines to further control the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn his own part, Alnahyan said his country \u201cthinks very highly of President Buhari\u2019s leadership,\u201d noting that the Nigerian leader \u201cis striving to build a better future for generations to come.\u201d\n\nHe said there were many Nigerians in his country \u201cwho add much value,\u201d assuring that the headwinds of the recent past in the relationship \u201care now behind us.\u201d\n\nAlnahyan said: \u201cWe want to secure, deepen and strengthen the association for the future. We have a lot in common. We may be taking small steps, but they are leading somewhere.\u201d\n\nOn proposed investments in Nigeria, Alnahyan said it would be a win-win situation, \u201cwhich would bring hope and opportunities for people in both countries; we want to come and add quality and value.\u201d\n\nThe Minister equally commended the Nigerian government for its robust tackling of violent extremism.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Dogara: Nigerians Have Accepted Mass Killings as New Normal",
          "text": "*Declares country risks survival if people merely tolerate each other\n\nCharles Ajunwa\n\nA former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara has said Nigerians seem to have accepted mass killings in the country as the new normal.\n\nDogara, in a key note address titled, \u201cPeace and Development in Nigeria: The Pragmatic Approach,\u201d delivered at a summit organised by the Sultan Maccido Institute for Peace and Development Studies, University of Abuja, lamented that such killings no longer made headlines, adding that the situation had created a feeling that \u201cnothing matters anymore.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cToday, Nigeria is faced with unprecedented crisis, so much so that nothing in our history prepares us for such a time as this. We seem to have accepted killings and mass murder as our new normal and so many cold-blooded murders of our brothers and sisters no longer make the headlines in the media.\n\n\u201cAs students, lecturers and political leaders, some of us are complicit, while the few who have dared to speak up are already outraged, fatigued and have surrendered to fatalism- a feeling that nothing matters anymore. It is like Nigeria seems to be suffering from some kind of God-ordained ineluctable fate.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done before doesn\u2019t matter; all that matters is our present station. As long as we are not actively engaged in seeking solutions to these intractable issues, we are actually, wittingly or unwittingly, actively promoting it.\u201d\n\nThe former Speaker said Nigeria runs the risk of not surviving if people merely tolerated each other, adding, \u201cOur happiness cannot be the other groups\u2019 unhappiness; our strength is not and will never be in our numbers but in our unity.\u201d\n\nHe advocated a united Nigeria, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll be strong and when we strive to keep our bond and remain undivided, we will be invincible. This is what should concern every patriotic Nigerian at the moment, not scheming for future elections. All efforts of patriotic citizens must be geared towards stopping our dear country from the ongoing death by a thousand cuts.\u201d\n\nDogara argued that Nigeria\u2019s most immediate problem was the dangerous drift of the country into chaos and anarchy.\n\nApart from the rabid insecurity plaguing the nation, he said, \u201cThere are real or imagined charges of ethnic cleansing and domination of some sections by a certain section.\u201d\n\nThe former Speaker said: \u201cAttacks are unrelenting and there appears to be no end in sight. The situation has clearly gotten out of hand, following the repeated overrun of military formations by Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorists, wanton killings and kidnap for ransom and mass abduction of school children in different parts of the country.\n\n\u201cFor instance, we all know that the North bears nearly 90 per cent of the insecurity brunt of the country. If estimates are anything to go by, not less than 50,000 northerners have been killed while over three million have been displaced in the Northeast alone.\n\n\u201cNo one has the record of Northern lives lost to rural banditry, the farmer-herder clashes and ethno-religious conflicts. The number grows exponentially when we add the death occasioned by urban violence unleashed by an increasing army of mostly jobless youths suffering from substance use disorder.\u201d\n\nHe said there was also the threat posed by school dropouts and out-of-school children: \u201cA survey in 2015 put the number of out-of-school children in the country at 13.2 million. The latest MlCS data tells us that 69 per cent (9.1m) of out-of-school children in Nigeria are in northern states. The problem is further compounded by the fact that the North, just like other parts of Nigeria, is in a demographic transition.\n\n\u201cThe consequence of the \u2018youth bulge\u2019 is that there are so many young people competing for limited number of career opportunities. Those who lose out and fail to secure a place in society have become frustrated, angry and violent as predicted. This set of young people easily surrender themselves for radicalisation, as the timeless adage goes, an idle mind is the devil\u2019s workshop.\n\n\u201cInstead of the \u2018youth bulge\u2019 to be a blessing, it is fast leading to swapping of roles of our youths from productive labourers to disaffected rebels. What is left for us is to work out how to productively channel this restive energy. How do we warehouse this demography now and in the future? If we cannot find a place for them in society, how will they view us and the society they will live in? The situation is such that even the most incurable Nigerian optimist cannot sleep well in the face of these grim statistics. I hope this submit does not miss this point.\n\n\u201cThere is no hiding place for us anymore because Nigeria is no longer the same. Structural injustices, mass illiteracy, mass poverty, mass unemployment and under-employment have all combined to pull out those we had pushed to the fringes of society to our streets and villages with heavy tolls on Nigerian lives and devastation at all levels. We now have a small percentage of highly educated Nigerian youths who are prepared to question everything including questioning the questions themselves.\n\n\u201cWe succeeded in the past in decapitating oppressed Nigerians partly because they were largely illiterates and religion was used to keep them in check. Now we have seen that the frustration we fed them has reached a tipping point, the illiterates won\u2019t take it anymore, much less the educated youths who have freed themselves from fictional constraints and are asking questions like never before.\n\n\u201cIt is a pity that many are calling for the disintegration of Nigeria; saying that Nigeria cannot work. Unfortunately, they are emboldened by what they see but the real threats are buried in what they have failed to see. For instance, it is doubtful that if Nigeria were to break into pieces, the process will be peaceful. If a disintegration war breaks out now, the Western World had long predicted this and developed tools to secure their interest which is ensuring that the war does not distort their markets.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Launches online application portal, promises fairness\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday officially launched an online platform for its National Housing Scheme (NHS), effectively preparing the ground for the sale of over 5,000 housing units in 34 states of the federation.\n\nSpeaking at the event in Abuja, Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola, noted that the new portal was expected to facilitate home ownership and rental schemes in both urban and rural areas.\n\nOf the 36 states, it was learnt that while Lagos State is yet to provide the government with land for the scheme, Rivers State is expected to join in the phase three of the project.\n\nThe minister called on Nigerians to leverage the opportunities granted by the federal government under the programme to own apartments in any parts of the country of their choice.\n\nWhile stating that the over 5,000 houses across 34 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) are currently at different stages of completion, the minister noted that that access to affordable houses had remained a challenge for many Nigerians.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs you know, we have houses scattered across the country that are not occupied. This is because people have a preference for different building styles. In the North, the people there prefer bungalows, while the South prefers blocks of flats.\n\n\u201cSo first, what we did was to carry out a survey to know what kind of houses Nigerians want to live in and that helped us to formulate relevant policies for the project.\n\nWe currently have over 5,000 units at different stages of completion.\u201d\n\nStressing that the size of the houses range from between 1 to 3 semi-detached bungalows and 1-3 bedroom, the minister noted that the flats will be sold for between N7 million to N16.19 million each, adding that payment can either be made through a mortgage or any financial system of choice.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe least selling price for each of these houses will be N7.222 million, and the highest will be N16.19 million. The highest is a 3-bedroom bungalow, it is not just the house but it also has land along with it. The bungalows are a little more expensive than the blocks of flats which do not have additional land.\n\n\u201cThere are some slight price differences in the blocks of flats built in the riverine and swampy areas, for example, houses in Edo, Bayelsa.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time we have a platform that every Nigerian has access to. This provides an opportunity for all Nigerians to apply and ensure a fair process of allocation. We will soon start the official handover and tape cutting as the subscribers come in. We have maintenance and facilities managers in all the estates.\n\n\u201cWe introduced the online portal from which the national housing programme will be offered to members of the public. The forms are online and allow for more openness, limits human interventions, and hold us more accountable. The endgame is an economic objective.\u201d\n\nHe said that the research done by the ministry was instrumental to the implementation of the federal government\u2019s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), explaining that contractors handling the projects are wholly Nigerian.\n\n\u201cNo international contractors were involved. We have 1,000 contractors from Nigeria. It also gave the contractors an opportunity to sustain their staff. Also, all materials for the project were locally made materials,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister urged Nigerians to register online via nhp.worksandhousing.gov.ng, listing the requirements for the application as a passport photograph, current tax clearance payslip, letter of recommendation, means of identification and evidence of 10 per cent initial deposit, which he said was for mortgage subscribers only.\n\nHe added: \u201cApplicants can also take a virtual tour of the property they are interested in. They can apply and register with email and phone number. Upon verification, they can complete their application.\n\n\u201cWe have included the abridged drawings of each estate. When an allocation is booked on the online portal, it will show that it is no longer available. This way we will avoid duplicity.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks during the event, President of the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), Mr. Mustapha Isah, lauded the initiative, noting that the launch of the portal will give all Nigerians equal access to owning houses.\n\nAdded to that, Isah said that it would further ensure transparency and accountability in the entire process and urged Nigerians to key into the scheme, follow the instructions and register on the platform.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Officials of the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development have been accused of failing to distribute $100,000 (N41.1million) allowances donated by three banks to Nigeria\u2019s women basketball team for their Tokyo 2020 Olympic participation.\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters, a member of the senior women basketball team, D\u2019Tigress, revealed that their allowances, bonuses, training grant worth $4,900 had also not been paid.\n\nShe added that none of the D\u2019Tigress team members would show up in camp in preparation for the February 2022 FIBA World Cup if the Nigerian government failed to pay them.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe last time we checked, some of our allowances, bonuses and training grants have not been paid. All our accounts numbers have been submitted but still no remittance. Donations made by banks for players, officials, volunteer stipends etc. dating all the way back to 2018 but I will let the managers address the vendor/contractor\u2019s situation.\n\n\u201cThey forget we all have a relationship and do communicate; $500 each 2018 FIBA World Cup for players and officials; $1,000 each for finishing final 8 in FIBA World Cup; $1,000 each bonus for winning AfroBasket in Senegal for 2019 players and officials.\n\n\u201c$300 - $400 each Mozambique Olympic Qualifier allowance balance, were supposed to be paid $100 per day; $2,000 each training grant balance from Tokyo Olympics, players only. The $100,000 donated by three Nigerian banks to all the players and officials that made D\u2019Tigress Olympics qualification possible final roster. The men also got $100,000 assigned to them, the total was $200,000.\n\n\u201cMiscellaneous expenses by players and officials; the full breakdown has been submitted to the outgoing Basket Ball President and the honourable minister, Sunday Dare.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect to the association leadership, the Presidency, the Ministry and NBBF administration old and new, if these monies are not paid before the next qualifier of the next tournament in February 2022, FIBA World Cup, the entire D\u2019Tigress team will not show up in camp.

          "text": "German sportswear manufacturing giant, PUMA plans to sue the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) and the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports.\n\nThe development comes as the sportswear manufacturer terminated a four-year contract it had with Nigeria in a letter dated Wednesday, August 4, 2021, and signed by the company\u2019s director, Manuel Edlheimb.\n\nAccording to reports, the AFN under the leadership of Ibrahim Gusau had entered into a controversial $2.76 million deal with PUMA on July 24, 2019, in Doha, Qatar.\n\nThe deal reportedly led to a major crisis that split the athletics body into two factions, with Gusau and AFN First Vice President, Sunday Adeleye accused of sidelining other members of the board during the signing of the deal.\n\nThe deal, signed by the Gusau-led AFN, was due to expire in 2022, Punch reports.\n\nPart of the contract is that PUMA will supply apparel to all age categories to Nigeria\u2019s Athletics team for four years at no cost.\n\nIn addition, gold medalists at the Olympic Games will earn $15,000 (N6 million), silver medalists will get $5,000 (N2 million) while a bronze medal will fetch athletes wearing the PUMA apparel at the games $3,000 (N1.2 million).\n\nIn the latest development, PUMA officials have got in touch with officials of Gusau-led AFN informing them of an intention to sue.\n\nAccording to a source quoted by Punch, the sports ministry would be made a party to the suit \u201cbecause they issued a memo granting AFN permission to seek sponsorship. PUMA sees AFN as a representative of Nigeria with that memo. It gave them confidence that AFN had approval. They also claimed that as of the time of signing the contract, the parties involved are recognised by law and FG, and there was no faction to warrant suspicion. They believe an administration is a continuum and the agreement has government backing..\u201d\n\nThis was confirmed by the AFN First Vice President, Adeleye while appearing on Arise TV as a guest on Thursday.\n\nWhile displaying evidence and documents showing the FG\u2019s approval for the federation to seek a sponsor, Adeleye said, \u201cThe contract is a non-disclosure one. It is between PUMA and AFN with FMYSD\u2019s permission. We warned that this may lead to litigation and wrote to all parties involved, including finance and justice ministries.\n\n\u201cWe are sure that PUMA will go to court on this matter. Their officials have called that they are sending documents from their legal department. We wrote the minister on the implications for Nigeria. This won\u2019t make other companies deal with Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe also argued that Gusau-led AFN did everything possible to ensure that the image of the country is protected.\n\nOn why the kits were kept in a store, he said, \u201cOur AFN has been barred from using the facility in the stadium and we needed to run the activities of the association. We have a store and office that we run. The constitution didn\u2019t say our office should be in the stadium.\u201d\n\nAsked if he would take responsibility for the termination of the contract, Adeleye said, \u201cWe should be awarded because we are patriotic. The Federal Government asked federations to look for sponsors (before Sunday Dare). This contract precedes him. They are aware of the contract.\n\n\u201cWe worked with instruction. We looked for a sponsor so that the burden can be taken off the Federal Government. The sports ministry should be sanctioned. We need a shake-up in the sports ministry.\n\n\u201cThe problem is the minister and sports ministry under his administration. Our problems have never been this worse. Federations have issues but not to this extend. Despite a court order, the minister is resolute in destroying some people. We gave the kits out, the ministry said they were not going to use the kits.\u201d\n\nThe sports ministry\u2019s had insisted that Nigerian athletes at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics will not wear PUMA because of the leadership tussle between the Gusau-led AFN board and the one being championed by the sports minister, Dare.\n\nIt was learnt that several efforts were made to give the athletes the PUMA kits, including shipping bags of kits with 40 items each to Tokyo through the Nigerian Embassy in Japan but to no avail.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of State Services (DSS) last year cleared Gusau and his vice president, Adeleye over corruption allegations levelled against them by the sports ministry.\n\nThe sports ministry in 2020 petitioned the DSS over the AFN\u2019s partnership deal with PUMA to kit Nigeria\u2019s track and field teams until 2023.\n\nThe DSS' response to the sports ministry\u2019s petition, titled \u201cRe: Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development (FMYSD), Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) and Alhaji Shehu Gusau\u201d, dated September 3, 2020, and signed on behalf of the Director-General of the DSS by Bello Mustapha, was received on September 4, 2020, by the sports ministry.\n\nIn the letter, the DSS stated, \u201cThis Service (DSS) has thoroughly investigated the matter regarding the Puma deal. The under-listed findings were established:\n\n\u201cAthletics Federation of Nigeria entered into a valid contract with Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited.\n\n\u201cThe AFN gave Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited the mandate to source for sponsors for Nigeria\u2019s track and field teams on her behalf in a letter dated September 4, 2018, signed by Ademu A. Elijah, Secretary-General of the AFN.\n\n\u201cThe AFN duly authorised Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited to deal with Puma on behalf of the federation in a letter dated June 23, 2019, signed by Patrick Estate, Head Marketing; and there is no evidence that Dynamic Sports Solution Nigeria Limited received money meant for AFN from Puma.\n\n\u201cIn view, therefore, it is reiterated that the FMYSD and the AFN board should employ an internal mechanism to resolve the lingering dispute between them.\u201d\n\nThe contract termination comes a few hours after a trending video showed Nigeria\u2019s shot put medal hopeful, Chukwuebuka Enekwechi, washing his jersey ahead of his final game at the ongoing Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\n\nThe caption in the video indicated that the athlete was given one jersey for the competition.\n\n\u201cWhen you made the Olympic Finals, but you only have one jersey,\u201d he wrote.",

You are also most aware of the enormous challenges with Custom clearance for the last batch of the Olympics uniforms this year.\n\n\u201cIt required the serious interventions of the Hon. Minister FMYSD with the Federal Ministry of Finance to make it reality. The official receipted Custom and clearing charges that NBBF had to incur in getting the uniforms out of Apapa Wharf was more than 6 millon naira, which I fully paid and that is yet to be refunded by the ministry.\n\n\u201cYou are also aware that this consignment covered for the Olympics and was used with extra procured to execute the 2021 Men\u2019s Afro-basket. The remnants are very incomplete bits and pieces of outfits as with other consignment in the past. I would urge you to process my refund efficiently, and once that is done, I can handover the remnants of the kits from the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n\u201cIn as much as I believe you re illegally and deliberately usurping the powers of the NBBF Board by trying to create task-force to organise and undertake the FIBA November qualifiers, you contact PEAK directly to purchase equipment or kits from them for your intended purposes.\n\n\u201cSec, I must warn you that your recent actions will potentially cause a huge embarrassment to Nigeria Basketball and the country at large as you have side stepped the NBBF Board in all your recent undertakings.\u201d\n\n\n\nBefore the dissolution of the NBBF committee, Ahmadu-Kida, two weeks ago had made an appeal to the Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, over the release of the \u2018adopt-an-athlete\u2019 funds meant for the preparation of D\u2019Tigers and D\u2019Tigress teams prior to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.\n\nIn the letter, the NBBF had demanded the sum of $230,000 raised through the programme for the men and women\u2019s national teams.\n\nThe letter, signed by Ahmadu-Kida and the Secretary General of the NBBF, Olabisi Afolabi, titled \u2018Re: Donations To The NBBF Under the Honourable Minister\u2019s Adopt An Athlete Programme For Olympic Basketball Teams, read, \u201cWe would like to commend the Honourable Minister for his creative initiative and state that this is real and concrete evidence of the Honorable Minister\u2019s sincere commitment towards the growth and development of basketball in the country, which has continued to encourage NBBF to strive to represent the country no matter the challenges it faces.\n\n\u201cThe Honourable Minister is also very aware that the NBBF has not received any fund from the ministry\u2019s execution of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics preparation and camping for the national men\u2019s and women\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cThese principally held in the USA with friendlies in the USA and Europe.\n\n\u201cI will recall to the Honourable Minister that the men\u2019s team made history by beating the USA and Argentina, the first and fourth-ranked basketball countries in the world.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the government dissolved the NBBF executives because of internal wrangling and rivalry in the federation.",
          "summary": "Recall that the NBBF general election had been slated to hold on the last Saturday of October, before the Federal Ministry of Youths and Sports Development postponed it indefinitely.\nThe ministry would later go on to dissolve the caretaker board of the NBBF, and as it stands, basketball federation in Nigeria has no leadership.\nIn a letter to the Secretary General of the association, Kida requested for a refund of N6million he used to clear kits used for the last Olympics before he could handover sporting equipment with him.\n\u201cYou are also aware that this consignment covered for the Olympics and was used with extra procured to execute the 2021 Men\u2019s Afro-basket.\nI would urge you to process my refund efficiently, and once that is done, I can handover the remnants of the kits from the Tokyo Olympics.",

More Africans are online, they are spending more time on the internet and relying more on digital media more than ever. According to the Social Flagship Report April 2021, created by Global Web Index (GWI), four African countries cracked the top 10 rankings for social media usage based on time spent, as Nigeria ranked first at (3:46), followed by Kenya (3:33), South Africa (3:32) and Ghana.\n\nOn the latest edition of TechCabal Live\u2014a video interview series in partnership with the UK-Nigeria Tech Hub\u2014held on October 25, we sought to understand Africa\u2019s digital media landscape, its challenges and future, and so we spoke with the editors of two of Africa\u2019s top digital newsrooms\u2014Quartz Africa Editor, Ciku Kimeria; and Stears Business\u2019, Editor-in-Chief, Fadekemi Abiru.\n\nHow can digital media in Africa create a profitable business model?\n\nWhile it is normal to get excited about the different innovative news products in the continent\u2019s digital media landscape, Abiru explains that more media houses need to produce more information that helps people understand what is going on around them.\n\nIn Africa, online news is mostly free. Only a few digital news organisations have been able to monetise their digital content. But Abiru wants this to change. \u201cLet people understand that information is something worth paying for. There is a challenge of helping people understand that where there is value, revenue can also be generated.\u201d Abiru believes that value creation is enough reason for digital media in Africa to monetise their online content. She further explains that the concept of \u201ccontent worth paying for\u201d is why Netflix and Spotify operate subscription-based business models.\n\nAbiru believes that for African newsrooms to use the subscription model successfully, they must produce deep, original and insightful pieces that cannot be found elsewhere.\n\nAfrican newsrooms have a talent problem\n\nAbiru complained about a talent shortage and the challenge of retaining talent. Ciku also believes that Africa faces a talent problem but is hopeful that training would go a long way to solve it. She added, though, that it is easier to train good writers on technical skills but very hard to teach good writing.\n\nQuality of work coming from African newsrooms must improve\n\nSpeaking on the quality of journalistic work coming out of African newsrooms, Ciku believes that there is a huge gap between African and, say, American journalism. But she believes the fault isn\u2019t entirely the journalist\u2019s. She says there has been a drop in the quality of journalism schools in Kenya, her home country.\n\nAnother reason for this drop in the quality of journalism is the university system in Africa, where there are scandals of people paying for their degrees.\n\n\u201cNow, when you read what a journalist has written, there are so many typos and errors,\u201d she lamented.\n\nYet another problem Ciku highlighted was funding. She believes African journalists can do amazing work, but their budget is way smaller than that of global publications.\n\n\u201cIf a great investigative journalist wants to go into a project in a place that\u2019s not safe, and his organisation gives him little or no money to do so, you can understand how they will not come up with the same quality of work as a global media house.\u201d\n\nThe major cause of the funding problem, Ciku said, is the environment and not individual journalists.\n\nYou can watch the rest of the conversation below:\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Is Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha a win for the creator economy?",
          "text": "Launched in 2019 by Cregital, a Lagos-based creative design agency, Disha Pages gave users the tools with which to build their own one-page websites from the comfort of their smartphones, without worrying about technicalities such as coding or sorting out a domain name.\n\nCredit: Disha (Medium)\n\nThe product was an instant hit and got considerable adoption among creators and gig workers. Unfortunately, by a little over a year after its launch\u2014at the peak of the pandemic\u2014the company announced that they were shutting down the product.\n\n\u201cHow can we help?\u201d\n\nAs soon as the announcement of the shutdown went up, the Disha team were inundated with calls and messages from baffled well wishers, all of them concerned and wondering what they could do to keep the platform alive. These early conversations were tepid, nothing was concrete\u2014until Flutterwave came into the picture offering a total buyout. The move by the payments giant, which earlier this year became a unicorn, is surprising as both companies operate in different spaces\u2014Flutterwave in payments and Disha in the creator industry. One wonders, then, what the play is here.\n\nIn a call with Flutterwave\u2019s head of product marketing, Onyedikachim Nwankwo, explained that while both companies may run different businesses, their company goals are aligned. \u201cFlutterwave is about creating endless possibilities for everyone, and Disha\u2019s goal of enabling creators achieve success and get paid for their work ties into Flutterwave\u2019s larger mission of helping small businesses thrive.\u201d\n\nNew look for Disha?\n\nIn a statement announcing the acquisition, Flutterwave says that the buyout will grow Disha\u2019s base by providing users with the ability to make, receive and withdraw money from their Disha accounts in over 150 currencies and 34 countries across the world. Despite the acquisition, however, Disha will remain an independent company. According to Nwankwo, \u201cIts original vision will be maintained.\u201d\n\nRufus Oyemade, Software and Architectural Lead at Flutterwave, states that Disha coming under the Flutterwave family means its vision will be explored farther than earlier imagined. \u201cBefore now, when users created a Disha page and linked to a Flutterwave payment link, they got taken off the Disha site. Now, with the acquisition, users can create and accept their payments, all in one place.\u201d\n\nFlutterwave has always played in the creator space, having supported arts events like ArtX Lagos. Now, as the digital world opens up to creators getting paid for their work through innovations such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the payments giant is well positioned to help creators on Disha access global markets and further grow the global creator economy, which is estimated to be worth $100 billion.\n\nFlutterwave became a unicorn in March after reaching a $1 billion valuation, and the company may be set to triple that value in the future to the tune of $3 billion by acquiring more funding.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Exclusive: Meta\u2019s VP MEA and Turkey on Facebook\u2019s transition into the metaverse",
          "text": "At the end of October, social media giant, Facebook, changed its company to Meta. The announcement was made in an hour-long video that explained the company\u2019s decision to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse.\n\nLeading that work in Africa is Derya Matras, Vice President (VP), Middle East, Africa (MEA) and Turkey, Meta.\n\nPrior to her appointment as VP in August, Matras was the Managing Director for the MEA and Turkey region. Before that, she was Country Director for Facebook in Turkey for four years. Derya holds a BSc in electronics engineering from Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey, and an MBA from Columbia Business School.\n\nOver email, Matras talked to TechCabal about Facebook\u2019s rebrand to Meta and how it plans to make money from the metaverse and deal with the challenges that come with building it.\n\nHow is the Metaverse better than Facebook in its current form?\n\nWhen Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world\u2014and we are not turning away from these existing products. Those experiences are going to form a crucial part of the future metaverse ecosystem. The Facebook app is still going to be called Facebook.\n\nThe name Meta is a clear link to our vision for the metaverse. However, the metaverse will exist, whether Meta is there or not. So, Meta means us moving beyond 2D screens towards immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality, to help build the next evolution in social technology. This is a natural evolution for our company as social media and technology evolves.\n\nWhat demographic is the metaverse targeting in Africa?\n\nGiven all that the metaverse has to offer, there\u2019s a lot at stake in making sure its possibilities are open to everyone and not just people from traditionally underrepresented groups. An inclusive metaverse benefits everyone.\n\nIs Facebook building the metaverse because it\u2019s best positioned to build something that\u2019s inevitable?\n\nIn recent decades, technology has given people the power to connect and express themselves more naturally. We started with websites, then we got phones with cameras, and then the internet became more visual and mobile. As connections got faster, video became a richer way to share experiences. If you look back over time, we\u2019ve gone from desktop to web to mobile; from text to photos to video. Now we are looking at what comes next. The metaverse will feel like a hybrid of today\u2019s online social experiences, sometimes expanded into three dimensions or projected into the physical world. It\u2019s the next evolution in a long line of social technologies, and it\u2019s ushering in a new chapter for our company.\n\nIn Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s letter, he mentioned that the \u201cmetaverse will not be created by one company\u201d. Does this mean there\u2019ll be other metaverses outside of Facebook\u2019s metaverse and that they can all exist side by side without Facebook trying to be the only metaverse out there?\n\nThe metaverse isn\u2019t a single product that one company can build. Its success depends on building robust interoperability across services, so different companies\u2019 experiences can work together. And it won\u2019t be built overnight. Many of these products will only be fully realised in the next 10-15 years. While that\u2019s frustrating for those of us eager to dive right in, it gives us time to ask difficult questions about how they should be built. We\u2019ll work with experts in government, industry and academia to think through issues and opportunities in the metaverse.\n\nWe also need to involve human and civil rights communities from the start to ensure these technologies are built in a way that\u2019s inclusive and empowering.\n\nAcross Africa, we\u2019re supporting Africa No Filter, Electric South and Imisi 3D to support creators who have been pushing the boundaries of digital storytelling using immersive technology to amplify African voices.\n\nIs there the potential for other applications and programmes to be built in the metaverse\u2014similar to the blockchain.\n\nWe are at the very start of this. A lot of the technology and infrastructure still needs to be built. It will take at least 5 to 10 years for this vision of the metaverse to come to life. This pace is going to be dictated less by business interests and more by technological realities. Infrastructure needs to be transformed with new technologies, hardware and cooling specifications to be able to support a robust service. And new hardware still needs to be built, including things like hologram displays, projectors, batteries, radios, custom silicon chips, cameras, speakers, and sensors to map the world around you and more.\n\nWhy should Facebook build this? Why not another company?\n\nThis was an important step for us to take on our journey, and as we evolve to Meta, we hope this will better reflect where we are going as a company. Like all businesses, we continue to innovate so that we can bring value to people\u2019s lives.\n\nWe are a social company with investments in technology, like VR; and the metaverse is the next frontier of virtual digital connection\u2014so it\u2019s a natural evolution for our business. But it\u2019s important to reiterate that Meta is neither going to build, own, or run the metaverse on its own. This isn\u2019t going to be a Meta product.\n\nBuilding this will be more like how the internet came about rather than how one app was launched. That\u2019s why we will be collaborating at every stage with other companies, developers, experts, and policymakers. Principles of privacy, safety, and security need to be built in from the start. If we have the principles right, then as a society, we will be better at tackling new challenges with these technologies as they arise.\n\nThe transition to communication via the metaverse will face some challenges considering that it\u2019s not just another app on the mobile phone. What challenges does Facebook expect to encounter in rolling out the metaverse in Africa?\n\nNew innovations bring new challenges, and there\u2019s lots we need to figure out. But that\u2019s why we\u2019re starting this conversation early. We have to be responsible in our approach, and we intend to do that in a number of ways:\n\nNo surprises: In the past, the speed with which new technologies have emerged has sometimes left policymakers and regulators playing catch-up. We don\u2019t want this to happen this time around. A core principle is going to be \u201cdon\u2019t surprise people\u201d. That\u2019s why we are having this conversation out in the open, way in advance of all these technologies being launched.\n\nCollaboration: Partnering with independent experts and organisations will be a crucial part of how we navigate future challenges. We have already launched a two-year $50 million investment in programmes and external research, collaborating with industry partners, civil rights groups, governments, non-profits, and academic institutions to get input as we build these technologies responsibly. This is alongside being a founding member of the XR Association (XRA), which is committed to helping build responsible XR, which includes virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and future immersive technology.\n\nBuilt-in: While we will need to continue to get better at anticipating risks, we won\u2019t be able to see around every corner. That\u2019s why the principles of privacy, safety, and security need to be built in from the start.\n\nFacebook plans to spend ~$10 billion this year on the metaverse project\u2014and even more in the coming years. How will the company make money from this?\n\nIt\u2019s very early, and our focus today is more around building the foundational pieces for the metaverse, like VR, and bringing more people into those experiences. We outlined a few areas during Connect where we think there is an opportunity around commerce. We want to help provide tools for creators and developers so they can build a meaningful business in the metaverse because we think digital commerce will become increasingly important.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that investing in the metaverse also means additional resources invested in issues like safety and security. For example, the $10 billion investment in Reality Labs that we have already announced will include spending on research to better understand how we can responsibly tackle safety and integrity challenges in the metaverse.\n\nAnd, just like the rest of the internet, we expect that free things in the metaverse would likely be powered by ads while there would also be paid experiences that are ad-free.\n\nThis is a very long-term vision. It\u2019s going to take investment over many years before the metaverse reaches scale.\n\nLately, fingers have been pointed at Facebook for inciting civil unrest in Africa and being ill-equipped to staff its Africa offices to properly regulate posts. How does Facebook plan to build the metaverse responsibly?\n\nEvery day, our teams have to balance protecting the ability of billions of people to express themselves openly with the need to keep our platform a safe and positive place. We continue to make significant improvements to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content. To suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true.\n\nWe are on track to spend over $5 billion on safety and security in 2021 alone and have 40,000 people working on these issues, including 15,000 people who review content in more than 70 languages.\n\nHow we build is as important as what we build. And we will be collaborating at every stage\u2014with other companies, developers, experts and policymakers\u2014to make sure that what we build is good for the world.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Kifta Technologies produces smart glasses, other cutting edge defence tech, for companies and countries worldwide",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of action thrillers, you\u2019ve probably seen security operatives working with hi-tech gadgets like smart glasses and smartwatches (looking at you, James Bond). In case you\u2019re wondering if those are real or if they\u2019ll ever be commonplace in Africa, we are taking a closer look at a Nigerian-founded company building hi-tech gadgets but with a twist.\n\nA conversation about Nigeria\u2019s security challenges could fill an encyclopedia. Besides the numerous lives lost, they have also had a significant economic impact, costing the country billions of dollars.\n\nThe Institute for Economics and Peace \u2018Global Peace Index 2021: Measuring Peace in a Complex World, Sydney, June 2021 report reveals that Nigeria lost $40 billion in 2020 to insecurity \u2014 Unknown gunmen, robberies and theft, and others.\n\nMoreso, in 2020, it lost about $12 million to electronic fraud in nine months. If Deloitte West Africa\u2019s report is to be believed, then the country has lost $13 billion to cybercrime in ten years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a textile businessman who received frequent supplies from Northern Nigeria, these were more than just statistics for him.\n\nIt was a typical day in 2015, and he had just received a familiar call stating that another unforeseen circumstance had disrupted his supply yet again, and he was fed up.\n\nI sent items regularly from Lagos to Kano, and I kept hearing that the containers went missing, vanished. Where are the goods? Where\u2019s the driver?\u201d\n\nWith no answers forthcoming, he installed tracking devices, which didn\u2019t do much because the perpetrators always disarmed them.\n\nThen came the light bulb moment. Monsuru Anifowoshe figured he could build a drone to monitor his trucks.\n\n\u201cTo me, it seemed like the perfect thing to build while also rendering service to other people who were, say, producers or importers who had customers around Nigeria. So I built a UAV or UAS system to monitor my goods to ensure they went to the right place at the right time.\u201d\n\nSide note: UAV stands for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, and UAS stands for Unmanned Aircraft Systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonsuru Anifowoshe, CEO of Kifta Technologies\n\nIf you\u2019ve been following the startup space, you may have noticed how startup or company founders sometimes start a business because of a problem they had which no one was fixing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMonsuru, however, maintains that his reasons were purely selfish. It was when they started building that they talked to other people in the market and realised that there was an opportunity to do something for others too.\n\nHowever, having always run a business, Monsuru, a chemical engineering graduate from the University of Lagos, had no idea how to design UAVs or UAS systems. He had to acquire some knowledge and skills about UAVs to communicate with design companies effectively, specifically, industrial design companies.\n\n\u201cSo it made it easier to talk to professional design companies, and whenever they brought designs, I could say no it can not be like this; it should be like that,\u201d Monsuru says.\n\nIn 2017, he brought in Mcdonald Ukah, an economist with solid business acumen, as a co-founder to help with the company\u2019s business development efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcdonald Ukah, co-founder of Kifta Technologies\n\nWe\u2019ve delved deep into the difficulties of building a hardware business in Nigeria, and the co-founders experienced this first hand when developing prototypes for Kifta\u2019s different products. The usual suspects like unreliable power and lack of local talent were major bottlenecks the company faced.\n\nDespite the challenges, they built a proper team of experts from different continents. Not minding the cost and the time zone issues, he explains that he didn\u2019t have time for trial and error, and he just wanted to get the best people who had done something similar and build a working prototype.\n\nThe UAV prototype cost $450k, and it took three years to complete.\n\nSidenote: The average seed round for software startups in Africa as of 2021 is $1.5 million. Almost a third of that was spent on building one prototype for a hardware startup.\n\nFollowing the success of the UAV prototype, Kifta Technologies was born, and the company now boasts different UAS systems, including firefighting UAS, Naval UAS, Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV), and the regular UAS that is not deployed over a body of water.\n\nAll these products have unique and mouth-watering features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA USV designed by Kifta Technologies\n\nAccording to Monsuru, one of the UAVs, which can travel for nine hours, uses a wireless link where the device communicates with other devices through radio waves.\n\n\u201cIt can go from Lagos to South Africa, charge for a bit, and make it back to Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBesides UAS, the company currently has a diverse range of hardware and software products. There are devices for the police, military, churches, schools, and identification systems.\n\nMonsuru, however, admits that those for churches and schools are less sophisticated than the others.\n\n\u201cWe have a couple of software that we use for pipeline security, power cable security, and border security. Some of them are like the DAS system, the DTS system, and the SCADA system. Most of these things are powered by specific hardware which we use for their operations,\u201d he says.\n\nOf all the equipment, we got to see what the police and identification glasses look like and the possible use cases. Forgive my colleagues for encouraging Monsuru to place me in his facial recognition database as a wanted person. You can watch the video below.\n\nBusiness model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonsuru and Emmanuel Paul, our Senior Reporter, test running the Smart glasses\n\nKifta\u2019s business model is simple: sell these hardware and software products to clients. The company currently has clients from different countries, but it has very minimal operation in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe might sell to an entity in Nigeria that wants to use it for their operations, and they will have to talk to the regulators by themselves. It is not yet fully operational commercially,\u201d he reveals.\n\nKifta mainly runs a B2B model focusing on African businesses. Interestingly, it gets lots of clients from outside the continent. It also licenses some of its proprietary technology, like the pipeline security software, to companies who want to use them.\n\nThe company\u2019s smart glasses, which can see up to 20 kilometres and has a facial and licence plate recognition system, is also gaining traction with security agencies in Africa. There are also industry and educational use cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou know, sometimes you develop a project and then stumble on another use case. In the manufacturing industry, we have a function that can record a step by step process on how to assemble this (smart glasses). It can record it for any newbie. The person wears this, and it lectures them. You open the motherboard; you screw it this way.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you sign a six-month or one-year deal with an expatriate. After that one year, you\u2019re certain that the ex-pat has transferred whatever knowledge into your system, and the AI in the glasses transmits it in a step by step process. The glasses teach whatever knowledge that ex-pat has transmitted or shared.\u201d\n\nThe company leverages its expertise in AI and AR to develop IoT devices for different industries. It currently has a partnership with a Rwandan company to develop IoT for farms. A method that promises to be a big boost for the country\u2019s agricultural sector.\n\nOther African countries also use its products, but he didn\u2019t mention which for security reasons. Trust us, we asked.\n\nDespite having several exciting products that could be relevant to the Nigerian situation, we found it quite telling that Kifta Technologies does not have much traction in Nigeria compared to other African countries.\n\nIts smart glasses, for example, could be relevant to Nigerian law enforcement agencies. Features like the recognition software, location search, and live transmission would help them fulfil their duties while keeping them accountable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe smart glasses can be connected to a database of people in a company, state, or country.\n\nThe glasses could be connected to the National Identity Number (NIN) database if needed. So why has adoption stalled in Nigeria? Monsuru maintains that it\u2019s a problem of accessing the right people.\n\n\u201cIf you want to install security cameras in our airports or along our borders, it\u2019s not as easy as waltzing into the customs office and saying I want to see the DG. And it\u2019s not as easy as sending them a cold email as you would send to a private company. For a government agency, it doesn\u2019t happen.\n\n\u201cThere have been situations where I tried to visit some of these places, and the security sent me away at the gate. Their favourite excuse is I can\u2019t come in without an appointment. How do I get an appointment when the contact phone number doesn\u2019t even work, and I didn\u2019t get a reply to my email?\u201d he asks.\n\nNigeria\u2019s power issues also ensure that Kifta limits its production. The production process of those products requires very steady power, and we learnt that even a 1 \u2013 2% voltage increase could damage the whole prototype if it\u2019s not configured correctly.\n\n\u201cAs much as it\u2019s beautiful to have all of these, adopting them in Nigeria is quite difficult, which is why most of our business and customers are not in Nigeria,\u201d Monsuru says.\n\nHe believes that since the high-tech defence industry is still young, most regulators are unaware that Nigerians are doing such innovations. He recommends that processes to reach relevant people should be put in place.\n\nSo far, the company has been bootstrapping and has never raised any institutional funding. It is, however, planning to raise funds to support some of its exciting plans.\n\nCommercialising defence technologies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Monsuru, one reason Kifta is trying to raise now is to expand its offerings to serve a broader market.\n\nFor him, since every facet of the hi-tech industry is quite niche, the company is working on expanding its offerings by implementing a drones-as-a-service platform in collaboration with logistics companies. Maybe not for small packages, but decent-sized parcels.\n\nIn the long run, we\u2019re also looking to scale up our UAS systems into building an air cargo system able to take a 3-ton payload that can move for five hours at a stretch,\u201d he reveals.\n\nMonsuru believes that the UAS system could significantly impact logistics in Nigeria. It would be fitted with storage systems and help many farmers get goods to the market in record time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a two-way thing, where you offer the logistics and help the farmers to become part of the global trade. By cutting off the middlemen completely, who, I must say, are responsible for the hike in food prices.\n\n\u201cImagine a basket of tomatoes in Maiduguri is \u20a6500, but when it gets to Lagos, it\u2019s already \u20a65,500. The middlemen will tell you that they incur all the risks, which was the same issue I had. So imagine you can build something where the producers can connect directly to the buyer.\n\n\u201cThey (the producers) now have the opportunity to sell a bit higher. So a farmer that sells for \u20a6500 can sell for \u20a61500.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also points out that building a cargo UAV to ensure speedy transfer of goods would have significant ripple effects on the economy and, of course, the environment.\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s going to be autonomous. It will be designed for that purpose, so it takes away a lot of associated costs because it\u2019s designed for that purpose against normal cargo planes that weren\u2019t designed for that purpose. And because a portion of it is electric, it\u2019s going to reduce emissions, following all those wonderful things we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d\n\nEffective logistics has been a considerable challenge for both traditional and electronic commerce in Nigeria. The entire industry has struggled, and every facet of the problems they face runs deep.\n\nDespite the country\u2019s well-documented challenges, the company plans to introduce a manufacturing plant in Nigeria. Though every element might not be made here, it intends to produce enough for the products to qualify as Nigerian-made.\n\nThere are interesting times ahead for Kifta, and if its defence technologies are transferred to a sector like commerce, it could be potentially game-changing. For now, Monsuru encourages the government to improve support for innovative hardware developers.\n\nHe also wants to see more talented people delve into the hardware industry. He argues that while software engineering has gone mainstream, other types of talent like firmware engineers and propulsion and control systems engineers are hard to come by.\n\n\u201cThere might be some, but have they coded into a hardware product? Because a propulsion system can be used in a manufacturing plant or a petrochemical plant, or wherever. But I\u2019m talking in terms of UAVs, smart glasses, how they move from one phase to another, How one part kicks off and what part goes back.\u201d\n\nAre you a talented person out there, and this seems like it\u2019s describing you? Kifta is hiring for as many as nine positions, and the company is actively looking for people like you.\n\n\u201cThey can always go to the website kiftatechnologies.com. And we might even increase that depending on what we decide internally on the industries we\u2019re looking to expand to. Please, I\u2019m looking for wonderful talent, and we pay considerably well. Maths people, physics people, come,\u201d he declares.\n\nSo what do you think?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor most startup founders looking to raise money, the obvious choice is equity financing. However, there is another option \u2013 debt financing. Equity financing requires that founders give away shares in their business in exchange for capital.\n\nDebt financing allows founders to raise money by selling debt instruments to individuals or investors, and this money is then paid back at an agreed-upon date with interest.\n\nSo far, few African startups have raised money this way, with fintech startups Carbon, FairMoney, and mobility startup, MAX.ng some examples. During the week, we had a chat with Hani Ibrahim, the Chief Investment Officer of Lendable, a UK-based debt financing company, to learn how the company invests.\n\nAfter studying and working in the UK across various corporate finance and investment banking roles, Ibrahim moved to the Middle East. He spent five years working in Dubai and Qatar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile there, he set up investment banking platforms for local banks and institutions in both countries. In addition, he also worked at QInvest, where he ran a $500 million credit strategy, investing across Asia, the Middle East, and parts of Europe.\n\nIn 2019, he moved to the UK and soon took up his current position at Lendable. Founded by Dyland Friend and Daniel Goldman, the firm provides credit facilities for non-bank lenders in frontier and emerging markets.\n\nInitially a Software as a Service (SaaS) company, Lendable provided an analytics platform to analyse loans. Soon after, they added an investment arm and have provided over $100 million to startups across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.\n\nInvestment thesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHani Ibrahim. Source: Supplied\n\nWhen choosing startups to invest in, Lendable focuses on startups providing credit facilities in frontier or emerging markets across Africa, Asia, and Latin America.\n\n\u201cThe investment thesis is that we target emerging markets, particularly Africa, Asia, and Latin America. But we do look at the wider emerging markets with a focus on the FinTech space. We also target businesses that promote and provide products to those that have found or typically find it difficult to access financial services.\u201d\n\nA key thing to note is that Lendable does not invest in companies at the idea stage. Instead, they invest in startups with a proven product but need capital to get to the next level. The firm provides these startups with money that is repaid over some time.\n\nOn average, these companies receive debt financing between five and ten million dollars.\n\nFintech startups are not the only ones who receive funding from Lendable. Ibrahim reveals that any tech-driven startup providing a financing option fits their investment criteria. However, companies in sectors that they believe have harmful, or no impact on their markets are excluded from their target market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really interested in is supporting micro and small businesses across the African continent,\u201d he says.\n\nThings startups should avoid\n\nIbrahim pointed out that while startups are usually focused on rolling out new products and hiring new staff, they must watch their finances, precisely how and where they are getting their capital.\n\n\u201cOne thing that they should make sure that they spend time over is to think about their financing. How are they actually getting their capital? Where are they getting their capital from, and in what format?\n\n\u201cDo they have the right mix of capital? Are they thinking about the risks of the different types of capital and the costs and drawbacks and the different types of capital\u201d\n\nBiggest success stories\n\nHaving provided financing for several companies, Ibrahim is particularly proud of Watu Credit, a boda boda financing startup. In the five years since their launch in Kenya, the company has expanded its reach into Uganda and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey were a smaller business, and we supported them with a small facility at the time. They are at least in Kenya, but most probably in East Africa, seen as the market leader for leasing motorcycle taxis in their space.\n\n\u201cTo reach a market leadership position in five years is an incredible achievement for their team. But we\u2019re also very proud to have played our part in supporting that.\u201d\n\nOn missed opportunities and regrets\n\nWith fintech the darling of investors across the world, Lendable sees a lot of pitches from startups, so I asked Ibrahim about missed opportunities and possible regrets. \u201cI think there are certainly opportunities that we\u2019ve missed. Because there is so much going on in the space, we can\u2019t do everything.\n\n\u201cWhat I would say is that I would love to do more across different markets in Africa. You know, each market has its own specific ways of doing a transaction. So we\u2019re working through each market, and I\u2019m filtering through them to see where we can do transactions.\u201d\n\nIbrahim discloses that when investments have not gone according to plan, they work with the management team to find solutions. He says that both parties work together to develop a solution that is a win for both parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s naira rebounded in the illegal market as the central bank boosted sales of dollars through commercial banks, according to traders. This has helped to close the gap with the official rate.\n\nThe currency strengthened to an average N540 to a dollar on Friday from about N570 a week ago in the unauthorized markets in Lagos and other cities where the foreign currency is freely traded, according to Abubakar Mohammed, chief executive officer for Lagos-based Forward Marketing Communications bureau de change Ltd.\n\nIt gained 0.2% to 413.48 a dollar at the spot market as of 2 p.m. in Lagos.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria increased dollar sales to banks for distribution to businesses and individuals and this move is helping to cut the number of customers that resort to buying foreign currency from unauthorized money changers.\n\nNigerians buy the greenback from traders to pay for business travels, school fees and medical bills abroad, Aminu Gwadabe, president of the Association of Bureau de change Operators of Nigeria said by phone.\n\nIn July, the regulator halted dollar supply to bureau de change operators, accusing them of aggravating the shortage of foreign currency by selling it on the black market.\n\nThat didn\u2019t stop the naira\u2019s slide.

          "text": "Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State sees recent developments as pointers that the Federal Government might be cowing the judiciary ahead of 2023.\n\nWike alleged that the invasion of the residence of Justice of the Supreme Court, Mary Odili, was a precursor to the Federal Government\u2019s likely tactic of browbeating the judiciary to a state of fear and conformity as the country enters the next political season.\n\nThe governor said the FG wants to continue to ride roughshod unchecked over the rule of law and the sanctity of the country\u2019s electoral system, hence, the renewed attack on judicial officers.\n\nThe police in Abuja have paraded those they claimed were behind the invasion, but this may not have impressed Wike who had given a 48-hour ultimatum since last week.\n\nThe Rivers State governor now said at a special court session to mark the opening of the 2021/2022 Legal Year of the Rivers State judiciary held at the Chief Judge\u2019s ceremonial court, Port Harcourt on Thursday, that: \u201cAlthough it is still early morning in our democratic match towards 2023, the attack on Justice Mary Odili is a prelude to many more and even worse political maneuverings we should be prepared to experience from the FG, which having lost relevance and popular support is becoming more and more desperate over its dwindling political fortunes by the day.\n\n\u201cWhile cases with political undertones, including the constitutional validity of certain sections of the recent amendments to the 2010 Electoral Act, if assented to by Mr. President, would necessarily come before our courts; what is important is the duty and capacity of our judiciary to save our democracy and the country.\u201d\n\nHe noted that it is the responsibility of the government at all levels to protect the judiciary and accord the courts with such assistance as they may require to enable them to safeguard their independence, advance the rule of law, and dispense justice equally and fairly to all citizens.\n\nAccording to him, Unfortunately, while the present Federal Government has been very weak in resourcing and strengthening the judiciary; it has been very strong and readily predisposed to ridiculing the entire institution and subjecting individual judges to both physical and psychological trauma for its own self-interest.\n\n\u201cWe all witnessed the infamous midnight raids on judicial residences and the subjection of some judges, to illegal raids, arrests, and detentions by agents of the Federal Government purportedly carrying out a baseless sting operation back in 2016.\n\n\u201cSince then the intimidation of judges whose judgments, intellectual or moral disposition they are not comfortable with has continued unrelenting with the latest attack on a peaceful mother, wife of a former governor and Justice of the Supreme Court, our own highly revered Hon. Justice Mary Odili.\n\n\u201cIt is important to emphasize that we allow these intimidations to become acceptable standards of behaviour and even become complicit in their unholy design to undermine the administration of justice when we all opt to keep quiet in the face of these assaults.\u201d\n\nWike, who commended the leaders of the Nigerian Bar Association, the Body of Senior Advocates, the Chief Justice of Nigeria, and members of the public for promptly condemning the siege on the judiciary, said they must quickly move beyond the verbal protestations to unveil those behind the raid on Justice Odili\u2019s residence and ensure that they all are held to account for their actions, otherwise, this impunity would never cease to rear its ugly head in the country.\n\nRead also: Rivers not fighting FG over tax collection \u2013 Wike\n\nHe challenged the Federal Government to come clean on this infamy with the names, identities, and affiliations of those allegedly arrested for their roles or found to have been involved in the attack on the residence of Justice Odili if it is not to be perceived as the primary mastermind.\n\nSpeaking on the proposed proliferation of Law School campuses, the governor urged the management of the Nigerian Law School, the Council of Legal Education, and the Federal Government to see the folly in the plan, and nib the idea from the bud before it causes more damage to a foremost institution that is already severely challenged for lack of adequate funding.\n\nHe explained that the Port Harcourt Campus of the Nigerian Law School being built by the State government was consciously demanded and approval secured from the Council of Legal Education and ultimately from President Muhammadu Buhari, through the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice and named after late Nabo Graham-Douglas, SAN.\n\n\u201cHere again, some lazy and uninformed characters have criticized our Law School development project with the unfounded and lousy allegation that it lacks budgetary provisions in our 2021 budget, even when they conceded to the propriety of the project and the optimal benefits it would attract to the state and the business community.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike said in the last six years, his administration has continued to improve the welfare and wellbeing of state judicial officers, especially, the provision of new cars, comfortable and well-resourced offices, as well as the provision of life-long residences for all judicial officers, including those serving in Federal courts and other jurisdictions external to the state.\n\nChief Judge of Rivers State, Simeon Chibuzor Amadi said since assumption of office in May 2021, he has administered the judiciary with commitment in order to raise the bar of performance of judicial officers and staff that should reflect in the speedy dispensation of justice.\n\nAccording to him, training sessions have been organized for manpower capacity development in mediation practices, infrastructure improved, and the magistracy practice laws and rules revisited for purposes of review.\n\nJustice Amadi further said that of the 30,227 cases, 11,719 cases were disposed off and warned that no application from any lawyer for a transfer of cases will be tolerated if such case has already entertained at least two witnesses in court.\n\nIn his speech, the Rivers State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Zacchaeus Adangor, SAN, said it is imperative for members of the Bench and Bar to reaffirm their unwavering commitment to the effective, efficient, and speedy administration of justice in order to continue to enjoy the confidence of Nigerians.",

          "text": "The share of the mobile money market and the value of transactions controlled by MTN Ghana may have helped unravel a picture of what to expect from the Nigerian business when MTN kicks off its payment service bank (PSB) in the next six months.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria recently granted approval in principle to MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa to operate payment service banks (PSBs), with final approval to follow in six months, subject to specific requirements.\n\nControlling about 85 percent of the mobile money market in Ghana, the MTN subsidiary in the West African country raked in revenues of GH\u00a2 1.26 billion (N84.97billion) in the nine months through September 2021, according to its financial statements.\n\nWhile the regulations governing the Nigerian mobile money industry and the level of development in the country\u2019s financial services industry differ from what is available in Ghana, the MTN MoMo business in Ghana is similar to what MTN Nigeria will be able to do in Africa\u2019s largest economy. Although the Nigerian PSB licence doesn\u2019t give room for the operators to do as much as their Ghana counterparts.\n\nUnlike in Ghana, Nigeria\u2019s PSB operators cannot provide lending and insurance products. Also, their interest-bearing assets are limited to government and central bank-issued instruments. Lending, according to market analysts, can be a profitable add-on for digital payments providers and the restrictions on offering insurance and investment products could limit PSBs\u2019 ability to generate expected revenue.\n\nTo extrapolate the revenue MTN Nigeria is likely to generate from its mobile money business in Africa\u2019s most populous nation, BusinessDay proceeded to analyze the data by Tellimer, a global technology, information, and data provider, that surveyed mobile money penetration (defined as mobile money users as a percentage of total subscriber base) across various African telcos and markets.\n\nAs expected, Safaricom had the highest penetration (71percent), given its dominance and the positive trend for mobile money in Kenya. Airtel Africa had the lowest in Tellimer\u2019s sample, at 20percent, while MTN Group had a penetration of 24 percent overall; however, the rate is much higher in Ghana, at 42 percent, due to MTN Ghana\u2019s first-mover advantage.\n\nRead also: MTN Nigeria, Airtel PSBs to create 1m direct jobs\n\nWith an assumption that MTN Nigeria will potentially have 30 percent mobile money customer base from its c68.5 million total customers and its network effect of the already existing group of c560,000 agents, analysis of Tellimer\u2019s data shows, the telco giant revenue of cNGN131bn and NGN53bn EBITDA at an assumed EBITDA margin of 40 percent per annum. This is lower than Safaricom M-Pesa\u2019s incremental EBITDA of 47 percent.\n\nA lower margin was projected for MTN Nigeria due to the tougher competition in the country\u2019s financial services industry as the largest economy in Africa is already home to several payments-focused unicorns: Interswitch, Flutterwave, Opay and, most recently, Chipper Cash.\n\nThe projection was done using Tellimer\u2019s average revenue per user (ARPU) which ranges between $2.2 and $1.3. The data provider said it assumed ARPU of $1.3 for MTN Nigeria, below the group\u2019s average for H1 21 due to the competition in the market.\n\nThere is a high level of competition in the Nigerian payments sector, with banks developing agency banking and an array of fintechs servicing a wide range of clients, Ayobami Omole, Telecoms analyst at Tellimer said.\n\n\u201cThis means that it will be very difficult for MTN Nigeria to replicate M-Pesa\u2019s success in Kenya or that of its fellow MTN Group subsidiary in Ghana,\u201d Omole said.\n\nIn trying to win over market share, the Lagos-based analyst said there will be tough price competition which will limit potential revenue. \u201cAlthough, I must say that it is too early to conclude with certainty that the telcos won\u2019t make as much money given the higher population we have in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWhen MTN Nigeria and Airtel Africa get the PSB licence in the next six months, the number of financial services providers under the new permit would increase to five. The central bank had in 2019 granted approvals to Hope PSB, Money Master PSB and 9PSB.\n\nEven though the PSBs are expected by the CBN guidelines to operate mostly in the rural areas and unbanked locations, targeting financially excluded persons, with not less than 25 percent financial service touchpoints in such rural areas, the operators\u2019 participation in the industry is expected to bring huge competition to the existing traditional banks.\n\nHaving the largest share of the market, MTN Nigeria is expected to rake in the biggest share of the revenue, even though the projection is not expected to match its success in other existing markets.\n\n\u201cThe mobile money service will be value accretive for MTN Nigeria because it means beyond voice and data, they can leverage on it to generate more revenue,\u201d Yinka Ademuwagun, Yinka Ademuwagun, investment management analyst at ValuAlliance Asset Mgt said.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s revenue to GDP ratio is the lowest in Africa, the Director-General of the Budget Office, Ben Akabueze, has said.\n\nMr Akabueze said this while speaking at the 2022 budget dialogue held in Abuja on Friday.\n\n\u201cOur revenue to GDP ratio is also the lowest in Africa,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs I said earlier, it is about 9 per cent. So, if our revenue to GDP ratio is at 9 per cent and our public expenditure to GDP ratio with recent significant growth is about 14 per cent, then already you see a gap between 9 and 14 and that gap is funded by debt.\n\n\u201cThat gap of 5 per cent is funded by debt.\n\n\u201cWe must fix our revenue challenge because oftentimes people just say cut expenditure,\u201d Mr Akabueze said.\n\n\u201cThe truth is cutting expenditure is not currently a viable option for two main reasons.\n\n\u201cFirstly, our public expenditure to GDP ratio is about the lowest even on the continent of Africa.\n\n\u201cAs a country, our public expenditure to GDP ratio is under 15 per cent.\n\n\u201cEven on the continent of Africa, that ratio, the average is over 30 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe global average is over 30 per cent.\n\n\u201cI am talking of the whole of the federal, state and local governments.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that in aggregate, governments in Nigeria are not spending too much, they are spending too little,\u201d he added.\n\nHe noted that the solution is not to cut government spending.\n\n\u201cThe solution is to make government spending more efficient and increase the scope for the government to be able to spend more because our public expenditure to GDP is so low, that is why the delivery of public goods and services is weak.\n\nHe noted that cutting personnel cost which currently stands at N4.11 trillion would not be right because public sector wages are already low compared to the private sector.\n\n\u201cThere is a correlation between low public expenditure to GDP ratio and low revenue to GDP ratio,\u201d Mr Akabueze noted.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe Ebonyi State chapter of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), has rejected what it described as a plan by the state government, working in connivance with the state house of assembly, to auction the state\u2019s liaison offices in Abuja, Lagos, Enugu and Aba to the family of Governor David Umahi.\n\nThe opposition party which kicked against the move in a statement by Nwoba C. Nwoba, its spokesman, urged Ebonyi people to join voices with it to stop the acquisition of the public belongings by the Umahis as there\u2019s no basis for which they should be sold without a replacement plan.\n\n\u201cThe attention of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in Ebonyi State has been drawn to the plan by the Ebonyi State Government in connivance with the House of Assembly to cede Ebonyi State liaison office buildings in Aba, Lagos, Abuja and Enugu to the Governor David Umahi\u2019s family. It is worrisome that the Francis Nwifuru\u2019s led House of Assembly could not deliberate extensively on the need to or not auction the property even when the PDP members in the House were objecting to the procedure adopted in deliberating on the letter containing the auction request by the State Government,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cWhy are the Ebonyi offices in Aba and Enugu auctioned outright? Is it to mean that Ebonyi people are no longer in their large numbers in these cities? More worrisome is the fact that there\u2019s no alternative to replacing them. The aim of establishing these liaison offices years back was to receive complaints from Ebonyi people scattered all over the places and attend to their daily needs. It\u2019s significant to note that these offices became redundant immediately Gov. Umahi\u2019s administration came into existence, bearing in mind that he could through the House of Assembly acquire them for personal use. This applies to the Abuja and Lagos offices which he claims sales will be public private partnership driven. We can authoritatively inform Ebonyi people that Gov. Umahi has concluded plans to acquire the property using cronies and which the leadership of the state assembly is aware of.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore urge Ebonyi people to join voices with us to stop the acquisition of these public belongings by the Umahis as there\u2019s no basis for which they should be sold without a replacement plan. We wish also to remind the Ebonyi State House of Assembly that it\u2019s not an appendage of the executive arm of the Ebonyi State Government, that they should at all times be doing the bidding of the executive without following due legislative process. To this end, we call on Ebonyi people to rise against this plan, and in case the governor finally has his way, should hold the Speaker Nwifuru-Umahi House responsible as the House couldn\u2019t listen to the different objections raised by the PDP members in the House towards approval of this obnoxious request on Tuesday and Thursday of this week respectively.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Director General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF), Salihu Moh. Lukman, has blamed All Progressives Congress (APC) in the national assembly for the questionable clause in the direct primary in the electoral act amendment Bill.\n\nHe disclosed in a statement that the current content was never in the original bill.\n\nThe PGF DG who stated this in a statement issued in Abuja and titled, \u2018Internal Party Democracy and Politics of Candidates\u2019 Nomination\u2019, described the insertion of the clause as an afterthought.\n\nHe expressed worry that the current situation was more for personal aspirations by some members of the party rather than addressing the crisis being faced in the APC\n\nAccording to him, \u201cit is worrisome that APC members in the National Assembly are the ones pushing for this amendment.\n\n\u201cRather than leaders of the party negotiating among themselves on what needs to be done to produce internal agreement to resolve all challenges facing the party, increasingly, structures of the party are being abandoned and other structures outside the statutory organs of the party are being used to attempt to address perceived problems\u201d, Lukman added.\n\nHe said; \u201cThe whole insertion of the provisions requiring political parties to adopt the direct method in the Electoral Act would appear to be an afterthought.\n\n\u201dThis is because, the original bill, which was subjected to joint public hearing by both the Senate and House of Representatives on Wednesday, December 9, 2020, at the National Assembly complex in Abuja didn\u2019t contain the insertion of Section 87 Sub Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. There was only the insertion of Section 87(1 and 2), which provides that: \u201cSub Section 1: It seeks to enact a new section 87 on the nomination of candidates by parties for elections by prescribing maximum fees payable by aspirants and restricting nomination criteria strictly to relevant provision.\n\n\u201d Specifically, the bill states that total fees imposed by a political party shall not exceed N1million on a House of Representatives aspirant; N2 million on a senatorial aspirant; N5 million on a governorship aspirant and N10million on a presidential aspirant.\n\n\u201cSub Section 2: \u2018compels a political party not to impose nomination qualification or disqualification criteria, measures or conditions on any aspirant or candidate for any election, except as prescribed under sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 177 and 187 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\u2019\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt was during the clause-by-clause consideration of the bill after the public hearing in July 2021 that the Speaker of the House, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila moved motion for the amendment to allow direct primaries to be part of the amendment.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Senate, after passing an amendment bill, which did not include the requirement to compel parties to adopt direct method for election of candidates, following a \u2018motion for Re- Committal of some Clauses of the Electoral Act No.6 2010 (Repeal and Re- enactment) Bill, 2021 (SB. 122) to the Committee of the Whole as sponsored by the Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, All Progress Congress, APC, Kebbi North\u2019 on October 12, 2021, Sections 87 (3, 4, 5, 6, 7) were inserted and passed.\n\n\u201cIt will be important therefore to appeal to both the Senate President, HE Ahmed Lawal and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila and all the leaders of the National to provide the needed leadership for the country to have the right legal framework, which can guarantee the administration of direct primary by political parties in the country as a means of entrenching internal democracy during the process of nominating party candidates for elections.\n\n\u201cThe proposal passed by the two chambers of the National Assembly on November 9, 2021 is highly inadequate and leaves more room for manipulation, which may produce more disaster for the country beyond what the nation is going through under the indirect method\u201d.\n\nLukman said while the expanded APC Tripartite Consultative Committee meeting of November 9 would have been expected to influence the final amendment to guide the work of the conference committee of the national assembly, the lawmakers decided to ambush the tripartite committee.\n\n\u201cNotice for the meeting was issued by the party, dated 4th November 2021, signed by the CECPC Secretary, Sen. Akpanuduedehe. Certainly, all members of the APC Tripartite Consultative Committee, including the APC leadership in the National Assembly should have been aware of such expectation.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, before the meeting, which was scheduled to hold, 5pm Tuesday, November 9, on that very day, the plenaries of both the Senate and the House of Representatives considered the report of the conference committee on the Electoral Act amendment and adopted the report and passed the new Electoral Act amendment bill. With such development, the expanded Tripartite Consultative Committee was confronted with a fait accompli\u201d.\n\nHe said given that the whole controversy about the proposed Electoral Act amendment is limited to the new insertions in Section 87, the National Assembly should consider reworking issues under Section 87 to make it unambiguous.\n\n\u201cThe reworked new provisions should go through all the legislative processes including public hearing to enable Nigerians also contribute to making the law.\n\n\u201cThis is a very sensitive issue, which no Standing Order of the National Assembly should be used to block the democratic rights of Nigerians in contributing to the law.\n\n\u201cWhile the reworked Section 87 is being processed as recommended, the National Assembly may wish to adopt all the other amendments and transmit them to the President for assent.\n\n\u201cUnless leaders of the National Assembly are interested in blocking the possibility of amending the Electoral Act and want to shift the blame on President Buhari, it would be very inappropriate politically to expect the President to assent to the Electoral Act amendment with the provisions in Section 87 and all its ambiguities.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the National Assembly should take responsibility and not pass the buck\u201d, Lukman added.\n\nHe said the whole debate about adopting direct method as part of the Electoral Act is mainly an APC agenda, but that there may be a calculated attempt by a section of APC leadership whose interest is to hoodwink APC members and Nigerians with the direct primary dummy.\n\nNoting that the direct method of selecting candidates within the APC began to be corrupted under the dissolved National Working Committee led by Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, Lukman said \u201cit is quite suspect that isolated aggressive campaign to include the issue of compelling parties to adopt direct primary to nominate candidates for election is being promoted by respected APC leaders without corresponding commitment to ensuring that the process of producing a verifiable membership register for the APC is finalized\u201d.\n\nLukman said the vulnerability of direct primary to manipulative intrigues of political leaders was further confirmed in the just concluded Anambra Governorship election where the APC candidate in the election, Sen. Andy Ubah, during the APC primary election was said to have emerged with 230,201 votes but only got 43,285 votes during the election.",

There was only the insertion of Section 87(1 and 2), which provides that: \u201cSub Section 1: It seeks to enact a new section 87 on the nomination of candidates by parties for elections by prescribing maximum fees payable by aspirants and restricting nomination criteria strictly to relevant provision.\n\n\u201d Specifically, the bill states that total fees imposed by a political party shall not exceed N1million on a House of Representatives aspirant; N2 million on a senatorial aspirant; N5 million on a governorship aspirant and N10million on a presidential aspirant.\n\n\u201cSub Section 2: \u2018compels a political party not to impose nomination qualification or disqualification criteria, measures or conditions on any aspirant or candidate for any election, except as prescribed under sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 177 and 187 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\u2019\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt was during the clause-by-clause consideration of the bill after the public hearing in July 2021 that the Speaker of the House, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila moved motion for the amendment to allow direct primaries to be part of the amendment.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Senate, after passing an amendment bill, which did not include the requirement to compel parties to adopt direct method for election of candidates, following a \u2018motion for Re- Committal of some Clauses of the Electoral Act No.6 2010 (Repeal and Re- enactment) Bill, 2021 (SB. 122) to the Committee of the Whole as sponsored by the Senate Leader, Senator Yahaya Abdullahi, All Progress Congress, APC, Kebbi North\u2019 on October 12, 2021, Sections 87 (3, 4, 5, 6, 7) were inserted and passed.\n\n\u201cIt will be important therefore to appeal to both the Senate President, HE Ahmed Lawal and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila and all the leaders of the National to provide the needed leadership for the country to have the right legal framework, which can guarantee the administration of direct primary by political parties in the country as a means of entrenching internal democracy during the process of nominating party candidates for elections.\n\n\u201cThe proposal passed by the two chambers of the National Assembly on November 9, 2021 is highly inadequate and leaves more room for manipulation, which may produce more disaster for the country beyond what the nation is going through under the indirect method\u201d.\n\nLukman said while the expanded APC Tripartite Consultative Committee meeting of November 9 would have been expected to influence the final amendment to guide the work of the conference committee of the national assembly, the lawmakers decided to ambush the tripartite committee.\n\n\u201cNotice for the meeting was issued by the party, dated 4th November 2021, signed by the CECPC Secretary, Sen. Akpanuduedehe. Certainly, all members of the APC Tripartite Consultative Committee, including the APC leadership in the National Assembly should have been aware of such expectation.\n\n\u201cInterestingly, before the meeting, which was scheduled to hold, 5pm Tuesday, November 9, on that very day, the plenaries of both the Senate and the House of Representatives considered the report of the conference committee on the Electoral Act amendment and adopted the report and passed the new Electoral Act amendment bill. With such development, the expanded Tripartite Consultative Committee was confronted with a fait accompli\u201d.\n\nHe said given that the whole controversy about the proposed Electoral Act amendment is limited to the new insertions in Section 87, the National Assembly should consider reworking issues under Section 87 to make it unambiguous.\n\n\u201cThe reworked new provisions should go through all the legislative processes including public hearing to enable Nigerians also contribute to making the law.\n\n\u201cThis is a very sensitive issue, which no Standing Order of the National Assembly should be used to block the democratic rights of Nigerians in contributing to the law.\n\n\u201cWhile the reworked Section 87 is being processed as recommended, the National Assembly may wish to adopt all the other amendments and transmit them to the President for assent.\n\n\u201cUnless leaders of the National Assembly are interested in blocking the possibility of amending the Electoral Act and want to shift the blame on President Buhari, it would be very inappropriate politically to expect the President to assent to the Electoral Act amendment with the provisions in Section 87 and all its ambiguities.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the National Assembly should take responsibility and not pass the buck\u201d, Lukman added.\n\nHe said the whole debate about adopting direct method as part of the Electoral Act is mainly an APC agenda, but that there may be a calculated attempt by a section of APC leadership whose interest is to hoodwink APC members and Nigerians with the direct primary dummy.\n\nNoting that the direct method of selecting candidates within the APC began to be corrupted under the dissolved National Working Committee led by Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, Lukman said \u201cit is quite suspect that isolated aggressive campaign to include the issue of compelling parties to adopt direct primary to nominate candidates for election is being promoted by respected APC leaders without corresponding commitment to ensuring that the process of producing a verifiable membership register for the APC is finalized\u201d.\n\nLukman said the vulnerability of direct primary to manipulative intrigues of political leaders was further confirmed in the just concluded Anambra Governorship election where the APC candidate in the election, Sen. Andy Ubah, during the APC primary election was said to have emerged with 230,201 votes but only got 43,285 votes during the election.",

          "text": "Libya has overtaken Nigeria as Africa\u2019s top oil producer, according to a new report by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\n\nAccording to the data submitted by Nigeria to OPEC, Nigeria\u2019s oil output fell to about 1.23 million barrels per day in October from about 1.25 million bpd in the previous month.\n\nLibya\u2019s oil production rose to 1.24 million bpd in October from 1.16 million bpd in September.\n\nBut according to OPEC secondary sources, Nigeria still pumps more oil than Libya.\n\nThe secondary sources estimate Nigeria\u2019s production in October at 1.35 million barrels per day, a decline of 45,000 bpd from about 1.40 million bpd in September.\n\nLibya\u2019s output was put at 1.164million barrels a day, higher than the 1.149 million barrels a day in September.\n\nNigeria, whose oil minister is President Buhari, recorded the second biggest drop in output in October among its peers in OPEC, after Iraq.\n\nThe country\u2019s production fell the most in the month, according to secondary sources.\n\nThe 13-member oil cartel said its total crude production averaged 27.45 million bpd in October, higher by 220,000 bpd month-on-month, according to secondary sources.\n\n\u201cCrude oil output increased mainly in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, the UAE, and Kuwait, while production in Nigeria, Gabon and Equatorial Guinea declined,\u201d the sources said.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s crude oil production rose to 9.759 million bpd, and the Kingdom was quite naturally the producer with the largest monthly increase.\n\nNigeria\u2019s output was more than 200,000 bpd below its cap of 1.6 million bpd.\n\nNigeria has been struggling to reach its quota while frequent force majeure events have also contributed to the much lower production than allowed under the OPEC+ deal, reports oil.com.\n\nAt the end of October, Shell\u2019s Nigerian unit declared force majeure on loadings of Bonny Light crude, following the shutdown of the Nembe Creek Trunk Line (NCTL) by the operator, Aiteo Exploration and Production Limited.\n\nElsewhere among African members, the combined crude production in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea fell by 30,000 bpd in October from September.\n\nThe OPEC members that raised their respective production last month included all three producers exempted from the OPEC+ cuts\u2014Venezuela, Iran, and Libya.\n\nVenezuela boosted its oil production by 57,000 bpd per secondary sources in the OPEC report. Iran and Libya saw smaller increases of 10,000 bpd and 15,000 bpd. Since production at those three is not part of the OPEC+ deal, the 217,000-bpd output increase of OPEC-13 becomes even smaller when restricted to the 10 members part of the OPEC+ pact.",

At the time this (AGF) letter was written, I believe that we had not concluded payment yet.

As far as I am concerned, I don\u2019t know why you have to take a letter from the Attorney-General.\n\n\u201cThis is Nigeria\u2019s money owned by the three tiers of government. We can take you up on that.\n\n\u201cMr Chairman, I believe that my constituency has been robbed of money. Yes. And we need to contest that letter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why the Attorney-General had to issue a letter that something that was transacted in dollars should be paid in naira rate when you have differential rates in Nigeria,\u201d he added.",

They formed a barricade outside and use it as their own car pack. They intimidate people with guns. They came into the terminal building armed to the teeth, harassing passengers. A lot of people were scared. A white lady thought there was going to be a terrorist attack on the airport.\n\n\u201cTheir commander led them into the terminal building armed with assault rifles. It\u2019s even written that weapons are not allowed in that place, that part of the airport and these people came in with AK-47,\u201d he had said.\n\nAnother source had noted that the military men invaded the place in anger because their commanders were invited to Abuja over recent viral videos depicting the rot and extortion at the airport.\n\nHe alleged that the same Air Force personnel are responsible for recruiting touts from Oshodi to extort passengers at will.\n\n\u201cAll of these because their bosses were summoned to Abuja; this comes after that video of the woman alleging corruption at the airport that SaharaReporters published and a video made by a white guy.\n\n\u201cThe security chiefs at the Airport were summoned to Abuja. But the thing is, these airforce guys are the same guys that extort arriving passengers. They even bring touts from Oshodi to come to coordinate the parking space for them so they collect money from people instead of directing them to the real car park.\u201d\n\nSome weeks ago, an American vlogger, Sabbatical called out the airport officials for requesting money at different points, in a video that has now gone viral.\n\nHe described the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) in Lagos as \u201cextremely corrupt.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2026Initiative can increase GDP by $29bn in 10 yrs \u2013 Buhari \u2026It\u2019ll advance payment boundaries \u2013 Emefiele \u2026CBDC will deepen financial inclusion, boost intra-African trades \u2013 Expert ..Lessens cost of printing the Naira \u2013 Economist \u2018\u2026Citizens need massive enlightenment\u2019\n\nThe launch of the e-Naira by President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday, last week, has sent the signal that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) was set to complete the digitalisation of the economy. In this report, BENJAMIN UMUTEME takes a look at the expectations and concerns of Nigerians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanning for Nigeria\u2019s digital currency which began in 2017 was eventually launched by President Buhari. China, Bahamas, Cambodia, and a few other countries have already issued their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\n\n\n\nFollowing a series of engagements with relevant stakeholders including the banking community, FinTech operators, merchants and a cross-section of Nigerians, the CBN designed the digital currency.\n\n\n\nSeen as a crypto-currency class, the e-Naira is meant to serve both as a medium of exchange and a store of value, offering better payment prospects in financial transactions when compared to cash payment.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the unveiling of the digital currency, President Buhari said the e-Naira came in response to the need to improve the present payment system as well as cater for businesses and households seeking faster, safer, easier and cheaper means of payments. The president said further that there were Nigeria-specific benefits of the digital currency that cut across different sectors of the economy. He also said the adoption of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) can increase Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by $29 billion over the next 10 years.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe absence of a swift and effective solution to these requirements, as well as fears that central banks\u2019 actions sometimes lead to hyperinflation created the space for non-government entities to establish new forms of private currencies that seemed to have gained popularity and acceptance across the world, including here in Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn recent times, the use of physical cash in conducting business and making payments has been on the decline; this trend has been exacerbated by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and the resurgence of a new digital economy.\n\n\u201cAlongside these developments, businesses, households, and other economic agents have sought for new means of making payments in the new circumstances.\n\n\n\n\u201cNeedless to add, close monitoring and close supervision will be necessary in the early stages of implementation to study the effect of e-Naira on the economy as a whole,\u201d he said.\n\nCBN\u2019s explanations\n\nIn his remarks, the CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele, said the e-Naira marks a major step forward in the evolution of money in Nigeria as it would advance the boundaries of the payments system in order to make financial transactions easier and seamless for every strata of the society.\n\n\n\n\u201cTherefore, the e-Naira is Nigeria\u2019s CBDC and it is the digital equivalent of the physical Naira. As the tagline simply encapsulates, the e-Naira is the same Naira with far more possibilities. The e-Naira \u2013 like the physical Naira \u2013 is a legal tender in Nigeria and a liability of the CBN. The e-Naira and Naira will have the same value and will always be exchanged at 1 Naira to 1 e-Naira.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo de-risk the process, the CBN has given careful consideration to the entire payments and financial architecture and has designed the e-Naira to complement and strengthen these ecosystems and have implemented secure safeguards and policies to maintain the integrity of the financial system. Specifically, there will be strict adherence to the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards in order to preserve the integrity and stability of Nigeria\u2019s payment system,\u201d Emefiele said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking it work\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a bid to make the e-Naira project a success, the apex bank took its time to put in place certain measure, which included the minting of about N500 million e-Naira out of which N200 million e-Naira have been issued to banks.\n\n\n\nAlso, 33 banks have beenintegrated into the e-Naira platform just as over 2,000 customers have been on-boarded. According to Emefiele, over 120 merchants have successfully registered on the e-Naira platform.\n\n\n\nFor many Nigerians, the early signs have been encouraging as over 2.5 million daily visits to the website.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, customers who download the e-Naira Speed Wallet App will be able to onboard and create their wallet; fund their e-Naira wallet from their bank account; transfer e-Naira from their wallet to another Waller; make payment for purchases at registered merchant locations,\u201d the CBN governor said.\n\nExperts\u2019 reactions\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, experts have hailed the apex bank\u2019s Digital Currency (CBDC), saying transactions \u201cwill now be very fast compared to what the speed of transaction is supposed to be using the regular USSS.\u201d\n\n\n\nReacting to the development in a chat with Blueprint Weekend, the managing director/CEO of SD&D Capital Management Limited, Idakolo Gabriel Gbolade, said that the CBDC \u201cwill not only deepen the digital economy, but will also boost intra-African trade.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cThe digital currency launch is a good initiative from the CBN because it will deepen the digital economy space and encourage intra Africa trade as well as encourage investors\u2019 confidence in our economy.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe e-Naira is a digital currency and the major aim is to boost trading activities and increase investor\u2019s confidence in the Nigerian economy. It is expected to trigger increased transactions in the economy.\u201d\n\n\n\nSimilarly, a political economist and development researcher Adefolarin Olamilekan, described it as \u201ca welcome development,\u201d saying the payment system would never be the same again with the e-Naira. According to him, it is an opportunity for Nigerians to bank with the apex bank.\n\n\n\nAdefolarin noted that with the CBDC, the CBN would significantly reduce the cost of printing money.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cAll things being equal, the CBN e-Naira launch is a welcome development. Whether Nigerians are ready for the e-Naira and not doubting its technological efficacy is a question many contemplate on. The Central Bank of Nigeria has acknowledged that the liability of the e-Naira is directly on it, which is similar to the cash we hold. The liability of the cash we hold today rests with the CBN. So, it gives Nigerians the opportunity to bank with CBN.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe e-Naira would reduce the cost of printing new naira notes. As the minting of e-Naira is electronic and charges of transferring funds would be lower for those using the e-naira. Interestingly, e-Naira is going to be a \u2018game-changer\u2019 that would provide an alternative payment system and would radically transform the payment landscape.\n\n\n\n\u201cOver the years, concerns around unwieldy portability, the acrimony associated with shortage of change for small transactions, the inflationary push associated with product pricing, the rapid deterioration of both paper and polymer notes. These are genuine fears; however, far from the above reasons, the worries about fiat Naira\u2019s purchasing power being affected by double-digit annual inflation rates, are equally significant challenges to the current Naira profile.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn his take, a professor of economics at the Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye, Ogun state, Sheriffdeen Tella, said the e-Naira is a worthy innovation by the CBN. He, however, hoped that the banks would keep the charges low so as not to frustrate the project.\n\n\n\n\u201ce-Naira is a worthy innovation by the CBN, though some other countries are already into it. It is expected to strengthen the cashless policy. It is an extension or addition to normal fund transfer except that it can be used easily for cross border transactions. It also requires an app which may not be available for those phones used by the poor people,\u201d Tella said.\n\n\n\n\n\nConcerns\n\n\n\n\n\nLike in every new project, Nigerians have continued to express concerns about the working of the CBDC and its ability to weather the storm. Some experts fear that Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) may be impacted by the introduction of the digital currency.\n\n\n\nAccording to them, the implementation of the process would determine its effects on DMBs. Economists have said also the e-Naira, when rolled out, will have far-reaching implications for the future of the banking sector in the country.\n\n\n\nFor a professor of finance and capital market, Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Uche Uwaleke, said it is an obvious fact that the launch would have effects on the future of the banking sector.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cExpectedly, being among first-time movers of a technologically-complex project such as a central bank digital currency, it is bound to create winners and losers and produce unintended consequences.\n\n\u201cThe cheering news, however, is that the CBN appears to have devoted considerable time and resources to prevent undesirable outcomes especially in relation to the health of the Nigerian banking sector.\n\n\u201cIn any case, that the CBN is testing e-Naira through pilot projects is a demonstration of a cautious approach. All said, the launch of the CBN\u2019s digital currency is an important milestone which holds a lot of promise for the financial system in Nigeria and the banking sector in particular.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, Gbolade believes that rather than being competitive, the CBDC will complement the structure DMBs have on ground.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe e-Naira is not competing with DMBs and it is a new initiative that will increase financial Inclusion in the economy.\u201d\n\n\n\nPaul Alaje, an economist, speaking on ChannelsTV\u2019s Breakfast Show \u2018Sunrise Daily,\u2019 said the CBDC would add to the payment system as it would be relatively easier and cheaper to send money from one account to the other.\n\n\n\nAccording to Alaje, it\u2019s convenient and good, especially on the short-run.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the next three to five years, we will be saving one third of what we spend to print money. It would help the CBN to know how much money is in circulation-talking about money supply and how to control inflation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe flipside\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the flipside, some experts opine that the issue of distrust is going to be a challenge. For the director, Centre for Economic Policy Analysis and Research (CEPAR), Prof. Ndubuisi Nwokoma, the e-Naira would be faced with a lot of distrust as implementation progresses.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe launch of the e-Naira is a new path being taken by the CBN to follow in the global practice of enhancing the payment system through the use of digital currency. It is novel, even in advanced societies hiccups may be encountered as implementation progresses. Even currently, many global companies have not fully embraced the use of crypto-currencies in payments,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, Alaje stated that the value of the Naira would not change overnight even with the e-Naira.\n\nHe said, \u201cI really doubt if this will help change the value of our currency. If we look at the way Naira has been in the last 20 years, and we keep the e-Naira that way I doubt if it will achieve much.\u201d\n\nThe e-Naira has the same value with the fiat Naira, but the only factor that can cause increase in the value of Naira is when there is increased FDI and investors confidence in the economy that would lead to more inflow of US dollars into the economy then the pressure on the Naira against other currencies will reduce and cause an increase in the value of Naira,\u201d Idakolo said.\n\n\n\nAdefolarin further said further that, \u201cUndeniably, the e-Naira cannot enhance the value of fiat Naira. Respectfully, going by its function, it is to ease online payment. So, e-Naira is not going to be a saving grace to the current poor performance of the fiat Naira.\u201d\n\nEnlightenments\n\nTo make use of the e-Naira efficiently, many have called on the apex bank to embark on massive consumer education in order to get the buy-in of Nigerians.\n\nThey noted that the CBN needs to work with DMBs, MFBs and other PFIs to address challenges that may arise as a result of the use of the digital currency.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is the need for more enlightenment on the modus operandi, even for educated people. One also hopes the banks with not frustrate the project through unholy charges. It\u2019s a worthy financial innovation and problems that might arise can be resolved as soon as they rear their heads,\u201d Tella said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe value question\n\n\n\n\n\nAdefolarin told this reporter that the country\u2019s import dependent economy, structural deficit, and a productive sector lacking the integration of primary, secondary and tertiary agrarian and mining sectors continues to pose a drawback to the value of the Naira.\n\nAccording to the development economist, there needs to be a synergy of both the monetary and fiscal authorities as against the current situation where the repositioning of the Naira seems to have been left to the Central Bank alone.\n\n\n\nHe opines that to enhance the value of the Naira, there is a need to diversify the economy to produce more, earn additional export revenue and be competitive against imports.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor us, healthy industrial capacity utilisation and expansion would ensure a realistic and stable Naira exchange rate that will drastically check inflation. \u201cIncontrovertible, we understand the monetary policy ideas behind e-Naira; our task to bring back fiat Naira to a more valuable national currency of pride is more tasking.\u201d",

He thanked the #FreeBritney movement which he said had been essential to ending the legal arrangement.\n\nThe conservatorship was set up and overseen by the singer\u2019s father, Jamie Spears, after she had a public breakdown in 2007 and was hospitalized for undisclosed mental health issues.\n\nInterest in the case was propelled in the past year by documentaries and the #FreeBritney movement of fans who questioned why the singer needed such restrictions while she was touring around the world and earning millions of dollars.\n\nLauriann Wright, the attorney for Jodi Montgomery, who had been entrusted with overseeing Spears\u2019 personal life, told the judge there was \u201cno reason this termination cannot happen and Ms. Spears cannot live a safe, happy and fulfilling life.\u201d\n\nRosengart said a \u201csafety net\u201d had been put in place to help Spears transition back to regular life. Judge Penny added that the current conservator should continue working to settle ongoing financial issues in the case.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shaking,\u201d Leanne Simmons, a fan and one of the organizers of the #FreeBritney movement, said shortly after the decision. \u201cIt still hasn\u2019t sunk in to hear those words, \u2018The conservatorship has been terminated.\u2019 Britney is a free woman.\u201d\n\nThe Spears case helped prompt hearings in the U.S. Congress and a new law in California aimed at preventing abusive conservatorships, which are normally set up to protect disabled people, the elderly or those suffering from dementia.\n\nTRAUMATIZED AND HUMILIATED\n\nSince revealing years of private anguish in tearful testimony in June, Spears hired Rosengart, who moved aggressively to end the restrictions.\n\nIn June, she told the court she had been humiliated and traumatized and that she wanted her life back. She said she had been forced to work and take medication against her will and was prevented from marrying or even getting her hair done.\n\n\u201cShe stepped up on June 23rd and really shocked the country and shocked the world with her powerful, poignant words,\u201d Rosengart said.\n\nJudge Penny ended the conservatorship without requiring Spears to undergo a mental health evaluation, a step often taken in such cases.\n\nThe arrangement began to crumble in September when in a sudden reversal Jamie Spears said he supported ending it because it had helped her and was no longer needed.\n\nPenny suspended Jamie Spearsfrom the conservatorship in late September, calling his involvement \u201ctoxic\u201d to the singer\u2019s well-being.\n\nRosengart is pushing for Jamie Spears to be investigated for possible financial mismanagement of his daughter\u2019s affairs, but he said on Friday it would be up to Britney Spears to decide how to proceed on that matter.\n\nJamie Spears has said through attorneys that he helped his daughter rehabilitate her career and always acted in her best interest.\n\nSpears is engaged to marry her personal trainer boyfriend, Sam Asghari, but no date has been set. \u201cHistory was made today. Britney is Free,\u201d Asghari wrote on Instagram.",

          "text": "A man who traveled to space with William Shatner last month was killed along with another person when the small plane they were in crashed in a wooded area of northern New Jersey, according to state police.\n\nThe one-time space tourist Glen M. de Vries, 49, of New York City, and Thomas P. Fischer, 54, of Hopatcong, were aboard the single-engine Cessna 172 that went down Thursday.\n\nDe Vries was an instrument-rated private pilot, and Fischer owned a flight school. Authorities have not said who was piloting the small plane.\n\nThe plane had left Essex County Airport in Caldwell, on the edge of the New York City area, and was headed to Sussex Airport, in rural northwestern New Jersey, when the Federal Aviation Administration alerted public safety agencies to look for the missing plane around 3 p.m.\n\nEmergency crews found the wreckage in Hampton Township around 4 p.m., the FAA said.\n\nDe Vries, co-founder of a tech company, took a 10-minute flight to the edge of space Oct. 13 aboard Blue Origin\u2019s New Shepard spacecraft with Shatner and two others.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take me a while to be able to describe it.

          "title": "Trump Adviser Bannon Charged after Defying Capitol Riot Subpoena",
          "text": "Stephen Bannon, a prominent adviser to former U.S. President Donald Trump, has been criminally charged for defying a subpoena issued by a congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, the Justice Department said on Friday.\n\nBannon has refused to cooperate with the House of Representatives select committee seeking testimony and documents from him, citing Trump\u2019s insistence \u2013 already rejected by one judge \u2013 that he has a right to keep the requested material confidential under a legal doctrine called executive privilege.\n\nBannon, 67, was charged with one count of contempt of Congress for refusing to appear for a deposition and a second count for refusing to produce documents. Contempt of Congress is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail and a maximum fine of $100,000.\n\nJustice Department spokesperson Bill Miller said Bannon is \u201cexpected to self-surrender\u201d on Monday in Washington and make his first court appearance in the case that afternoon.\n\nTrump has sought to stonewall the committee, which is scrutinizing his actions relating to the deadly Capitol riot, and directed his former associates not to cooperate. The charges against Bannon may bolster the committee\u2019s efforts to secure testimony and documents from other Trump associates.\n\nBannon\u2019s indictment was announced just hours after Trump\u2019s former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows refused to appear for a deposition before the committee, risking also being found in contempt of Congress.\n\nAs a top adviser to Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign who later served as White House chief strategist, Bannon helped articulate the \u201cAmerica First\u201d right-wing populism and fierce opposition to immigration that helped define Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nBannon, who has promoted a variety of right-wing causes and candidates in the United States and abroad, continued to offer Trump advice after leaving his White House post in 2017. Bannon is a prominent figure in right-wing media circles and previously headed the Breitbart News website.\n\n\u2018CLEAR MESSAGE\u2019\n\n\u201cSteve Bannon\u2019s indictment should send a clear message to anyone who thinks they can ignore the Select Committee or try to stonewall our investigation: no one is above the law,\u201d Democrat Bennie Thompson and Republican Liz Cheney, the leaders of the committee, said in a statement.\n\nBannon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt is the second time in 15 months that Bannon has faced criminal charges. Bannon was charged in August 2020 with defrauding donors to We Build the Wall, a private fund-raising effort to boost Trump\u2019s wall project along the U.S.-Mexican border, and arrested aboard a yacht belonging to a fugitive Chinese billionaire. Trump subsequently issued a pardon to Bannon before that case could go to trial.\n\nThe Democratic-led House voted to hold Bannon in contempt of Congress in October. Most of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans in Congress opposed creating an independent commission or a committee to investigate the events surrounding Jan. 6.\n\nOn that day, a mob of Trump supporters rioted at the Capitol in a failed bid to prevent formal congressional certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s election victory. Before the riot, Trump gave a speech to his supporters repeating his false claims that the election was stolen from him and urged them to go to the Capitol and \u201cfight like hell\u201d to \u201cstop the steal.\u201d\n\nThe committee has said Bannon made public statements suggesting he knew in advance about \u201cextreme events\u201d that would occur on Jan. 6. Bannon said on a Jan. 5 podcast that \u201call hell is going to break loose tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAfter the House voted to hold Bannon in contempt, it was up to Biden\u2019s Justice Department, headed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, to decide whether to bring charges. Garland in a statement on Friday said his department \u201cadheres to the rule of law, follows the facts and the law and pursues equal justice under the law.\u201d\n\nTrump on Oct. 18 sued the committee and the National Archives, which holds material dating from his presidency, in a bid to keep hundreds of pages of records secret. A judge rejected Trump\u2019s lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the public interest in learning about Trump\u2019s actions on Jan. 6 was paramount. Trump appealed that ruling.\n\nThe last successful prosecution for contempt of Congress was in 1974 when a judge found G. Gordon Liddy, a conspirator in the Watergate scandal that drove President Richard Nixon to resign, guilty.",

          "text": "U.S. President Joe Biden will hold a virtual meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday, the White House said, talks Washington hopes will create some stability amid increased tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nIt is expected to be the leaders\u2019 most extensive meeting under the Biden administration and will follow on from a telephone call between the two on Sept. 9.\n\nWashington and Beijing have been sparring on issues from the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic to China\u2019s expanding nuclear arsenal. U.S. officials believe direct engagement with Xi is the best way to prevent ties spiraling toward conflict.\n\n\u201cThe two leaders will discuss ways to responsibly manage the competition \u2026 as well as ways to work together where our interests align,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement. \u201cPresident Biden will make clear U.S. intentions and priorities and be clear and candid about our concerns.\u201d\n\nBeijing is also keen to avoid confrontation as Xi faces a crucial year ahead with China\u2019s hosting of the Winter Olympic Games and a key Communist Party Congress where he looks to secure an unprecedented third term.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry said on Saturday the leaders would exchange views on bilateral relations and issues of common interests in the summit, which will take place on Tuesday morning in Asia.\n\nA senior U.S. official said Biden would make clear he welcomes stiff competition with China, but doesn\u2019t want conflict, and played down the likelihood of a long list of outcomes often tied to top-level meetings.\n\n\u201cThis is not about seeking specific deliverables or outcomes,\u201d the official said, adding in reference to the People\u2019s Republic of China: \u201cAs we compete with the PRC, President Biden expects President Xi and the PRC to play by the rules of road\u2014and he will make that point throughout the meeting.\u201d\n\nThe meeting will come after Biden signs a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal in a big ceremony on Monday to celebrate domestic renewal plans he believes will position the United States to out-compete China.\n\nU.S. officials have played down the possibility of progress on trade, where China is lagging in a commitment to buy $200 billion more in U.S. goods and services.\n\nChina has nevertheless continued to push for relief from hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs imposed under former President Donald Trump, arguing this could help both sides by easing inflation and boosting employment.\n\nCOMPETING VISIONS\n\nBiden and Xi outlined competing visions at meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum this week, with Biden stressing the U.S. commitment to a \u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific,\u201d which Washington says faces increasing Chinese \u201ccoercion,\u201d while Xi warned against a return to Cold War tensions.\n\nAddressing APEC leaders on Friday, Xi spoke of the need to \u201cstick to dialogue rather than confrontation, inclusiveness rather than exclusion, and integration rather than decoupling,\u201d an apparent reference to U.S. moves to make key supply chains independent of China.\n\nClimate is a priority for Biden, and China and the United States, the world\u2019s two biggest carbon emitters, unveiled a deal at global talks in Glasgow this week to ramp up cooperation, including by cutting methane emissions, phasing out coal consumption and protecting forests.\n\nHowever, the superpowers have clashed increasingly over self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own and that Washington is required to provide with the means to defend itself.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken angered China this week when he said Washington and its allies would take unspecified \u201caction\u201d if China were to use force to alter the Taiwan status quo, further muddying the long-held U.S. policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d as to whether the United States would respond militarily.\n\nSenior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi told Blinken in a call on Saturday that the United States should not send the wrong signals to Taiwan pro-independence forces, according a statement on the Chinese foreign ministry website.\n\n\u201cIf the United States really wants to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait, it should clearly and resolutely oppose any Taiwan pro-independence behavior,\u201d Wang said.\n\nWang and Blinken also exchanged views on areas including energy efficiency, climate change and the Iran nuclear issue and agreed to maintain dialogue on global challenges, China said.\n\nDaniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for Asia under the Obama administration, said both Biden and Xi were worried by the risk of a military incident escalating.\n\n\u201cBiden knows that the tools for prevention and crisis management are rusty, so we should expect him to push to put in place safeguards or \u2018guardrails\u2019 to reduce risk,\u201d he said.\n\nRussel said the Sept. 9 Biden-Xi call began with Xi listing complaints, but ended with a constructive agreement for officials to continue discussions.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that the personal relationship Biden built with Xi a decade ago is still strong, and that each conversation can add some stability to the mix.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday said despite mounting challenges facing nations, it was high time peace and solidarity \u201creign supreme\u201d across the globe.\n\nThe President, who spoke in Paris, France at a ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), said the world \u201chas an opportunity to count gains of the organisation in the last seven and half decades, while exploring the historic moment for building solidarity and enthroning peace.\u201d\n\nEarlier yesterday, Buhari, while receiving the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, Shaikh Shakboot Alnahyan, on the sidelines of the Paris Peace Forum, praised Diaspora Nigerians, saying their competitiveness \u201cis a product of the good education acquired at home.\u201d\n\nAt the UNESCO anniversary, Buhari canvassed global solidarity for the enthronement of peace and development.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur world is fast changing and so are the evolving challenges. There is, therefore, no better time to canvass for solidarity for the enthronement of peace and development.\n\n\u201cThe anniversary cautions us not to overlook our achievements and challenges of the past and present; not to overlook how our journey together has shaped our world.\u201d\n\nNigeria, he said, in felicitating with UNESCO, remained proud of its close association with the organisation since its establishment.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cSeventy-five years of building together a more advanced, knowledgeable and prosperous world through education, science, culture, communication and information.\n\n\u201cToday calls to mind the words of Federico Mayor, Director-General of UNESCO from 1987-1999 and I quote: \u2018any history begins when human beings have to draw from their knowledge of the past in order to better understand the present and look ahead to the future, when they come to realise that they must look into the facts, events and trends that have pre-figured their own era.\u2019 These are profound words, and they stand the test of time.\n\n\u201cAs we mark UNESCO\u2019s anniversary, we must acknowledge that it is a celebration of history; an occasion to remind ourselves of how far we have traveled, seeking to achieve the founding objectives of this great intellectual hub of the United Nations.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian leader further expressed happiness for being a part of the historic celebration, while congratulating UNESCO and its current leadership, for keeping the vision of the great organisation alive.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs a Member-State of UNESCO, Nigeria felicitates with all other Member-States, Associates and partners, who have walked the journey alongside UNESCO.\u201d\n\n\u2018Nigerians Competitive Abroad Due to Good Education Attained at Home\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Buhari yesterday said the competitiveness which Nigerians display abroad \u201cis a result of the good education they acquired before travelling out of the country.\u201d\n\nThis is as he urged Nigerians in Diaspora to always abide by the rules of their host countries.\n\nThe President said this when he met with the Minister of State Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, Shaikh Shakboot Alnahyan, on the sidelines of the Paris Peace Forum.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cNigerians are all over the place, very competitive. And the competitiveness starts from home, where they have acquired good education, gone into businesses, and then take all that abroad.\u201d\n\nThe President encouraged Nigerians in Diaspora to \u201csubject themselves to the rules and standards of the country in which they live, either as working class, or doing businesses.\u201d\n\nHe welcomed the offer by UAE to partner with Nigeria in the areas of renewable energy, agriculture, infrastructure logistics, and provision of vaccines to further control the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn his own part, Alnahyan said his country \u201cthinks very highly of President Buhari\u2019s leadership,\u201d noting that the Nigerian leader \u201cis striving to build a better future for generations to come.\u201d\n\nHe said there were many Nigerians in his country \u201cwho add much value,\u201d assuring that the headwinds of the recent past in the relationship \u201care now behind us.\u201d\n\nAlnahyan said: \u201cWe want to secure, deepen and strengthen the association for the future. We have a lot in common. We may be taking small steps, but they are leading somewhere.\u201d\n\nOn proposed investments in Nigeria, Alnahyan said it would be a win-win situation, \u201cwhich would bring hope and opportunities for people in both countries; we want to come and add quality and value.\u201d\n\nThe Minister equally commended the Nigerian government for its robust tackling of violent extremism.\n\nDeji Elumoye in Paris, France",
