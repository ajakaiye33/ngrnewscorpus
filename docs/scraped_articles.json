          "text": "Amarachi Okeh\n\nA Consultant Gynaecologist, Dr. Ekiniyi Destiny Ochete, has cautioned Nigerians against engaging in water birth, noting that the delivery method could be risky.\n\nAccording to the gynaecologist, Nigerians should think twice before engaging in water birth because the nation lacks the required equipment that may be needed to deal with peculiar emergencies that may occur during the special delivery.\n\nOchete, who is the Chief Consultant Gynaecologist at EEK Fertility Centre, Abuja, stressed that opting for a water birth in Nigeria is risky for both the mother and the child.\n\nRecall that a Nigerian celebrity, Korra Obidi, recently shared some clips of her giving birth using the water birth method on her social media platform while in the United States.\n\nSome of her followers while reacting to the video said more Nigerians should embrace the delivery method.\n\nOchete, however, warned that the delivery method should not be replicated in Nigeria because it is risky.\n\nWhat is water birth?\n\nAccording to Ochete, water birth is a birthing method in which the mother chooses to deliver inside a pool of warm water.\n\nShe explained that a lot of women choose to use water-assisted birth because they feel it aids them during pain as water is a soothing agent when in pain, adding that the process entails giving birth in a tub of warm water.\n\nAccording to americanpregnancy.org, the theory behind water birth is that since the baby has already been in the amniotic fluid sac for nine months, birthing in a similar environment is gentler for the baby and less stressful for the mother.\n\nAccording to a study published in the medical journal: BMC Pregnancy Childbirth, the primary reason some women choose the water birth option is for pain relief, noting that, it provides a relaxing environment for the woman.\n\nHowever, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, in a recent statement said it is not recommending birthing in water because the safety of the procedure has not been determined.\n\nWhy water birth is risky in Nigeria\n\nSpeaking further with PUNCH HealthWise, Dr. Ochete noted that there are risks involved with the water birth delivery option.\n\nAccording to the fertility expert, some complications occur during delivery and require immediate attention but may be missed during a water birth leading to delayed medical intervention.\n\nIn her words, \u201cThe reason why water birth is not advisable in Nigeria for me is that we have little or no equipment to handle emergencies in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cEven with the help of professionals, I think it is advisable to give birth where equipment is available so that in cases of emergency the mother can navigate through.\u201d\n\nContinuing, she said, that complications that can arise from water birth may not be effectively handled due to lack of access to immediate emergency intervention.\n\nSpeaking on the complications, she said, \u201cSometimes we may have breach babies and if there are no experienced hands around to help through the birthing of the baby, it could cause certain severe consequences.\n\n\u201cA situation for episiotomy may also arise and then there are no professionals to stitch up the mother.

          "text": "The Nigerian Ambassador to the Republic of Benin retired Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai has advised Nigerian youths not to let themselves be used as willing tools by do-or-die politicians who want to stir up trouble in their communities.\n\nBuratai gave the advice in his Message to Nigerian Youths, titled, \u201cDynamism in Politics and Nigeria\u2019s Founding Fathers\u201d, posted on his verified Facebook page on Friday.\n\nREAD ALSOUkraine invasion: FG evacuates third batch of Nigerians from Hungary\n\nHe challenged them to instead, embrace the tenets of political dynamism and root out every factor contributing to the democracy deficit in Nigeria, such as voter apathy, ballot snatching, looting, arson, and the likes.\n\nAccording to him, youths constitute a large percentage of our voting and working population and are also going to be the number one population block that will suffer the consequences of bad governance and incompetent leaders in the future.\n\n\u201cTherefore, you must do everything to safeguard your future survival and welfare in mind. Get actively involved in the democratic process by joining a political party and electing those who will lead you. Remember that voting is a civic duty expected of every Nigerian,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former Chief of Army Staff said he spent his entire service life defending the nation and democracy because of his conviction that the political system is most conducive to peace, sustainable development, rule of law, and respect for human rights.\n\nHe said that Nigeria\u2019s 22 years of uninterrupted democracy is worth celebrating, saying that elections devoid of integrity could not bring legitimacy to the winners, security to the losers, or public confidence in their leaders and institutions.\n\nThis, according to him, weakens polities by encouraging disaffected groups to seek out less constructive outlets for their discontent, saying some people feel that there is no need to commend the Nigerian democratic project because of this challenge associated with all nascent democracies.\n\n\u201cI respectfully disagree. We are evolving, and as you can see, the system is improving daily as a result of our leaders\u2019 periodic enhancements to the democratic system.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the 2022 Electoral Act which the President, Commander-in-Chief, President Muhammadu Buhari just signed into law, is a factor that will undoubtedly improve the transparency and acceptability of the country\u2019s future elections and promote democratic governance.\n\n\u201cDemocracy remains a universal aspiration because it actually delivers.\n\n\u201cFor example, of the 20 countries with highest levels of human development as measured by the UN\u2019s human development index, 19 are liberal democracies.\n\n\u201cAmong the top 40, 36 are liberal democracies. And even the citizens of poorer democracies live, on average, nine years longer than citizens of poor autocracies, because they have better access to health and education.\n\n\u201cDemocracies are also less vulnerable to famines and conflicts.\n\n\u201cIt was the Greek philosopher, Aristotle, who said, \u201cMan is, by nature, a political animal.\u201d It means that a man is born, lives, and dies as a member of a community, and the affairs of that community are therefore his and vice-versa.\n\n\u201cThis is why since my transition back to civilian life from the Army, I have continued to participate in every civic activity I could to promote peace and strengthen our democracy. It is the reason I decided to send this message to all Nigerian youths,\u201d he said.\n\nBuratai also urged Nigerian youths to take the critical issues of participation and a vibrant democratic system in Nigeria as sacrosanct, and embrace what he termed political dynamism.\n\nHe defined political dynamism as a vigorous political activity that is geared towards progress, and strength in the polity is usually characterizlsed by patriotism, service to the fatherland, and youth inclusivity.\n\nAccording to him, youth can be a creative force, a dynamic source of innovations, and they have undoubtedly, throughout history, participated, contributed, and even catalysed important changes in political systems, power-sharing dynamics, and economic opportunities.\n\n\u201cHowever, young people also face poverty, barriers to education, multiple forms of discrimination, and limited employment prospects and opportunities.\n\n\u201cThis is a global challenge although it differs across countries, and it is why the youth must take the issue of electing their leaders very seriously,\u201d he said.\n\nBuratai hailed the dynamism exhibited by the founding fathers such as Nnamdi Azikiwe, Ahmadu Bello, and Obafemi Awolowo and offered an inclusive impression that all the regions had a say in the formation of the country.\n\nHe said that President Buhari had laid a foundation for a new Nigeria, adding that he had kept faith with his vision and principles in spite of the myriad of challenges.\n\nHe urged youths to carry the vision and principles beyond the current administration and protect the legacies for a greater Nigeria and formidable future generations",

We need Yar\u2019adua to be back into power and nobody than Bukola Saraki who was his friend, who campaigned for him can bring back those good days.\u201d\n\nIyorwuese while pouring encomium on the late president whom he described as the best thing that ever happened to Nigeria since venturing into Democracy in 1999, observed that \u201cjust like Musa Yar\u2019adua, Bukola Saraki to is well connected born and hails from a good political family that has a good pedigree also.\u201d\n\nTo cap it all, Iyorwuese asserts that \u201cthe best foot forward for Nigeria is to have a president who will unite Nigeria not one who has divided Nigerians to the extent that Nigerians are taking up arms to fight one another.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Salisu Yusuf Majigiri, the party chairman in the state, said it is just a matter of time before PDP takes over the mantle of leadership in the state and the country at large, considering their poor performance, alleging that nothing is working in the country rather insecurity hunger and unemployment has become the order of the day.",

          "text": "The battle for the national chairmanship of the All Progressives Congress (APC) remains tough for ex-Narasawa State Governor Abdullahi Adamu despite his endorsement by President Muhammadu Buhari, The Nation learnt last night.\n\nHis rivals for the position are said to have resolved to push ahead with their ambition and test their popularity during this month\u2019s national convention of the party in Abuja.\n\nThe aspirants have the backing of some APC governors for an open race for all as against imposition of the next chairman.\n\nPresident Buhari is expected to meet with the aspirants on his return from a two-week medical break.\n\nIt is understood that Buhari may use the meeting to explain the reasons behind anointing Adamu, and assuage the tension in the party.\n\nHowever, the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) is yet to commence sales of forms to aspirants in what party sources said was part of the strategy to allow the ongoing consensus building on Adamu and others to reach an appreciable level.\n\nApart from other offices, it was gathered that only one form may be sold for the office of national chairman to avoid rancour in the party and at the APC convention.\n\nSome governors, especially those from the North-Central, have been reaching out to Adamu\u2019s rivals to accept Buhari\u2019s decision on the former governor.\n\nThe horse-trading on APC national chairman was in full swing last night.\n\nThose aspiring to lead the party from North-Central are the pioneer Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum, Senator Abdullahi Adamu; ex-Nasarawa State Governor Umar Tanko Al-Makura; ex-Benue State Governor George Akume; Mallam Saliu Mustapha (Turaki Ilorin);Sen. Sani Mohammed Musa; a former Chief Whip of the House of Representatives, Hon. Bawa Bwari; and the youngest of the aspirants, Mohammed Etsu.\n\nAspirants from other geopolitical zones include another former Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum, Abdulaziz Yari; ex-Borno State Governor Ali Modu Sheriff; ex-Bauchi State Governor Isa Yuguda; Dr. Sani Abdullahi Shinkafi and Chief Sunny Sylvester Monidafe.\n\nNone of the 12 aspirants had come out at press time to step down for Adamu.\n\nIt was also gathered that the aspirants had not been briefed on the alleged endorsement of Adamu either by the President or the governors.\n\nInvestigation yesterday showed that all the aspirants were intensifying their campaign to lead the party.\n\nA top source said: \u201cNone of the aspirants is willing to step down and none has stepped down for Abdullahi Adamu.\n\n\u201cTension is growing in the party on a daily basis and there is clamour for an open contest by the aspirants in line with democratic tenets.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the aspirants are going about their campaign oblivious of the purported endorsement of Adamu.\n\n\u201cNobody is talking to the aspirants. No one is telling them the opinion of the President. And Buhari is also not forthcoming. We are only reading his body language and third rated information from the Presidential Villa after any meeting.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even know whether Adamu\u2019s candidature was designed by some forces looking for presidential ticket of the party for 2023 poll.\n\n\u201cAll the aspirants are in dilemma and they have decided to go on with their campaign.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, one of the aspirants, ex-Governor Al-Makura, said he was still going about his campaign.\n\n\u201cI am contesting for the office of national chairman of APC. I don\u2019t know of any endorsement of any aspirant, and I haven\u2019t been told of any endorsement of any aspirant,\u201d he said.\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cThe process for the election of a new national chairman has not commenced because the sale of form is yet to begin.\n\n\u201cAs a founding member of APC, I will want to see how this great party progresses. I owe it a duty to respect the guidelines of the party.\n\n\u201cAPC is a wonderful party that believes in the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria which promotes democracy.\n\n\u201cIt is not true that I have been asked to step down for anybody. This campaign has taken me one year and it indicates that I will be successful.\n\n\u201cI am still campaigning as I talk to you.\u201d\n\nThe Director-General of Tanko Al-Makura Campaign Organisation, Dominic Alancha, in a separate interview, said: \u201cPresident Buhari is a true democrat and will not do anything that does not conform with democratic norms.\n\n\u201cThe constitution of our party stipulates that in a situation where the party arrives at a consensus, a yes or no vote will be called for.\n\n\u201cSo, knowing President Buhari as a true democrat, he will follow the due process to arriving at a consensus.\n\n\u201cTherefore, for us as a campaign organization, we are waving the purported endorsement aside with a simple wave of the hand.\n\n\u201cDistinguished Senator Umaru Tanko Al-Makura is very much ready to present himself for an elective convention come March 26, and I am 100 per cent sure he will emerge victorious as the next national chairman of our great party APC, given his competence and capacity in party administration.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, a leading chairmanship aspirant, Saliu Mustapha (Turaki Ilorin) said: \u201cI am still in the race. I am not aware of a consensus candidate. The party has not communicated to me officially about a consensus candidate.\u201d\n\nThe head of media of Saliu Mustapha Campaign Organisation, Dapo Okubanjo, said: \u201cConsultations are still ongoing over the issue of consensus as it relates to the forthcoming national convention. So, as far as we are concerned, nothing is cast in stone yet.\n\n\u201cHowever, as a party man, Mallam Saliu Mustapha expects that once a decision is taken on a matter as important as that, there are official channels through which they are communicated to concerned parties.\n\n\u201cAnd until that is done, we believe that the race is still open to all contenders who show interest in being the next national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\u201d\n\nAnother chairmanship aspirant, Sylvester Monidafe, told our correspondent as follows: \u201cI am going ahead to contest. I am not stepping down for anybody.\u201d\n\nA source in the campaign organisation of Senator Mohammed Sani Musa said: \u201cSenator Musa is a committed party man. We await President Mohammadu Buhari\u2019s pronouncement on the issue of consensus.\n\n\u201cWe are in the race and we are ready to abide by the position of Mr. President.\u201d\n\nMohammed Saidu Etsu, a chairmanship aspirant from Niger State, dismissed the purported anointing of Adamu.\n\nHe asked all progressive minds in the country to erase from their thoughts the idea of an \u2018anointed\u2019 candidate, saying that he was forging ahead with his own campaign because \u201cI am confident that I will come out victorious.\u201d\n\nEtsu said: \u201cWe have our machinery on ground across all the 36 states and we will continue with our political campaigns. These are the things that we are ready for at the 26th March convention.\u201d\n\nA governor who was reacting to the development in the party said: \u201cMost of the governors do not want imposition of Adamu. They are agitating that all aspirants should meet in the field and allow APC members to determine their fate at the convention.\n\n\u201cThis is my position. I believe democracy must take its course.\n\n\u201cThe governors are however afraid of the consequences of rejecting the choice of Adamu.\n\n\u201cThe way the game is now, we keep mute when we meet with the President. But when we leave the Villa, we say our minds.\n\n\u201cIt has got to a ridiculous extent that we are now suspicious of one another because we don\u2019t know who would stab us in the back. That is the danger of not allowing democracy to work.\u201d\n\nAnother governor said the cloudy situation has caused the Caretaker Committee to delay sales of forms to aspirants.\n\nThe North-West governor said: \u201cThe Caretaker Committee is slowing down to enable the President, governors and APC leaders to build a consensus on the new set of leaders, which can ensure a hitch-free convention. They are applying wisdom to save the party from crisis.\n\n\u201cWe have not resolved the zoning formula for offices because we go forward and backward on it. There is no party leadership which can sell party offices\u2019 forms in a chaotic situation.\n\n\u201cOther than the wish of the President on Abdullahi Adamu, there is no consensus on him, even in Nasarawa State. We need to address the issue of the national chairman of APC as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question, the governor said: \u201cIn a presidential system like ours, it is difficult to resist the choice of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cBut he needs to listen to alternative views because running a party is beyond the chairman alone.\n\n\u201cWe want fairness, equity and justice for all members in the party.\u201d\n\nA party source said: \u201cThe ongoing consensus building on the next national chairman and other officers is slowing down the sale of forms.\n\n\u201cWe want a hitch-free national convention and we need to consult widely.\n\n\u201cAfter unanimity of opinion, the party may end up selling a nomination form for the office of national chairman to only the preferred candidate.\u201d\n\nA top source said the President was aware of the intrigues in APC.\n\nBut he said Buhari would address certain issues, including the choice of a new chairman before the convention.\n\nThe source added: \u201cI am aware Buhari has demanded a security report on all the aspirants.\n\n\u201cI have got to know that he has plans to meet with all the aspirants before the convention to assuage tension.\n\n\u201cHe is likely to meet with them after he returns from his two-week vacation.\n\n\u201cNo one told him before he demanded the list of all aspirants from the Chairman of the CECPC, Governor Mai Mala Buni.\n\nMeanwhile, a youth group in the party, APC Youth Stakeholders Forum, yesterday kicked against consensus candidacy during the national convention of the party.\n\nIt said party leaders should emerge through an elective process where all delegates at the convention are made to vote.\n\nThe youth stormed the national secretariat of the party to protest any imposition of candidates under the guise of consensus arrangement.\n\nAddressing newsmen at the end of the peaceful protest at the party headquarters in Abuja, one of the conveners of the forum, Malam Yunusa Ahmadu Yusuf, said party members should be allowed to determine who leads them.\n\n\u201cOur demand here is that party stakeholders should be allowed to make their input.\n\n\u201cMembers should be allowed to say what they want, who would lead them, how, when, where, and that is what we have settled for and that is why we are here today,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen told that a national chairmanship aspirant had agreed to accept anyone endorsed by the President, another youth leader, Muktar Akoshi, said President Buhari is a democrat, \u201che will not impose any candidate.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe President believes in the supremacy of the party. So if any individual came out to say we would abide by what the President has said, yes, everybody will give Mr. President the respect of being the President of the Federal Republic and also abide by anything he said. But we are sure that the President knows the definition of democracy.\n\n\u201cHe knows that it is only good to allow people to choose who governs them.\u201d",

          "title": "The hell we saw in Ukraine \u2013 Trapped Nigerians",
          "text": "By Chika Abanobi, Kate Halim, Chioma Okezie-Okeh, Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, And Vera Wisdom Bassey\n\nNigerians living in Ukraine have described life under the Russian invasion as hellish. The condition is heightened by a lack of basic amenities like food, water, and clothes under the harsh winter weather, and racism. Their accounts were corroborated by a Ukrainian as well as Poland-based Nigerian who is helping to take care of his trapped fellow countrymen and women.\n\nTheir revelations came as the first batch of the flights from Poland, Romania, and Hungary carrying refugee Nigerians aboard Air Peace and Max Air, arrived yesterday, at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. Though the Federal Government has budgeted $8.5m for the airlifting which is expected to bring home about 2,000 stranded Nigerians, some of the people that Saturday Sun spoke to, including a medical student and one of the parents of about 4,000 Nigerian students said to be studying in that country, criticized the government for taking the decision a bit late. All the same, they remain grateful for their efforts.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nWhat it means to be trapped in Ukraine\n\nThe Nigerian medical student, Dennis Otumudia, stranded in Kharkiv told the story of how he woke up to the sound of bombs going off around him. The young man who claimed that a lot of African students, mostly from Nigeria and Morocco, are trapped in Ukraine, stated that the major means of transportation over there are trains and metro services. But the services they provide were shut down, making it difficult for foreigners like him to leave the country.\n\nOtumudia who criticised the Nigerian government for not being proactive added that since there had been signals that something like this would happen, they should have acted fast. His words: \u201cWe were told that they would evacuate us when the airports are open. I was in Kharkiv and tried to reach the embassy for a while but the contact number I had was not connecting.\u201d\n\nNigerian students in Ukraine, he said, needed somebody to tell them what was going on but regretted that there was nobody to do that. \u201cThey needed somebody in a position of authority to give them reliable information as to what to do because they were scared of their lives but we couldn\u2019t see anybody until much later.\u201d Another medical student, Fehintola Moses, 22, told the BBC about his unsuccessful attempts to leave Sumy, in northeast Ukraine, where there had been fighting between the Ukrainian Defence Forces and the Russian troops. Sumy is also near another frontline in Kharkiv.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nThrough WhatsApp messages and voice notes, he spoke of how his efforts to leave the city were aborted after his university told him that the train lines nearby were being controlled by Russian forces. He said he was told to stay at the campus. He added that there is no public transport in the city as some roads have been damaged. \u201cWe had a good supply of food; grocery shops are still open \u2013 which I fear may not last long,\u201d he said. \u201cThe school is providing foodstuff for people who need it. We have water. We are still trying to sleep and wake up. What we need is someone who can remove the Russian soldiers from the streets, someone who can repair the bridges, someone who can make sure the railroads are safe. That\u2019s what we honestly need right now.\u201d\n\nJohanna, a 17-year-old Nigerian who also found herself trapped in Ukraine is seriously praying to return to the country alive. \u201cI am a Nigerian studying at V.N Karazin National University, Kharkiv, Ukraine,\u201d she told an international electronic medium. \u201cI am studying medicine and I am a first-year student. Initially, I did not see the need to leave till Putin gave a date for the war. It got so serious, there were bombings in Kharkiv, my city. We had to hide in underground bunkers for our safety. We could hear the sound of the bomb; we were not sure of the next minute and there was chaos everywhere. So, I just had to leave. I have never gone through something like that before. I booked a taxi to take me to the Poland border. The driver collected a lot of money from me. He was supposed to drop me in Medyka. He did not but just said, \u2018walk down a bit and you will see Poland\u2019s border.\u2019 I met a lot of people heading to the border.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cWe were not close to the Poland border and we had to walk the whole day and throughout the night. I was very cold, very hungry, and couldn\u2019t sleep. Even if I wanted to sleep, it was too cold; I was shivering. On getting to the border, I didn\u2019t like the experience there. They just kept us waiting there for no reason. They were letting Ukrainians go. We were there for more than five hours. If you are a Ukrainian, there is no need to seek clearance. They would even push you aside to make way for their people. The fact that we are not in our country does not mean that we are not human.\u201d The young woman said she eventually managed to cross the border with a group of Ukrainian women.\n\nAnother Nigerian, Queen Alita Peter, claimed that she was forced out of a train because of her skin colour. \u201cWhen we heard about the attack, we knew that it was time to leave,\u201d she said. \u201cMeanwhile, it was already too late because some of us had flights to catch that day. In the train, a lady just told me to get out of the train for no reason. The train we boarded together. I asked her why. She said they only let children and women go. I asked her if I was a man and she said, I had to leave because I am not a Ukrainian. I told her \u2018this train does not belong to you, it belongs to the government and they want people to enter and get to the border.\u2019 She insisted that she is a Ukrainian, it is her government and she has the right to decide who enters the train and ordered me to get down.\u201d\n\nEberechukwu a 300 level student in one of the Ukrainian universities, said before the closure of the airport, he had the premonition. He thereafter alerted his parents about his uncomfortable feeling. The young man, the only child of his parents, said that not too long after he did so, his parents sent him some money to leave for the UK. But as soon as he left the country, the airport was shut down indefinitely. Another student, Damilare Toyin who finished his degree programme together with his niece who is now a medical doctor at Ile-Ife said he could not return immediately because of his intention to continue with his master\u2019s degree. But as the crisis deteriorated he took a train to Hungary. It was from there he was flown home.\n\nFrom Kiev, Ukrainian lady speaks to Saturday Sun\n\nA Ukrainian national, Kathryn Verbina, who corroborated most of the reports said that the Ukrainian military needs technical support. The woman, who, in a chat with Saturday Sun, said there was no time to talk, because \u201cmy country is at war,\u201d sent pictures and videos of the war situation to Saturday Sun, with sounds of bomb-blasts and gunfire rending the air. The pictures depict desolation, disbelief, horror, with many soldiers and civilians, including women and children, being consumed in the attacks.\n\nOne of the videos showed dead bodies of soldiers lying on the ground, with Russian soldiers closely monitored and walked around them. Also in the pictures were houses wrecked by Russian shelling. Dead bodies of children were strewn everywhere. Explaining the situation, Verbina said: \u201cI woke up at 5am because of the explosions. Men go in self-defence while women and children run into the bunkers.\u201d\n\nShe further told Saturday Sun: \u201cRight now, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Krerson and other cities are being attacked.\u201d Asked if she wished to run away to safety or stay back in Ukraine, she said: \u201cI want to remain at home.\u201d But she, however, added that she was not feeling safe. She called on the international community, especially the United Nations to tell the truth about what is going on in Ukraine.",

          "text": "By Chukwudi Nweje\n\nSome leading groups from the South-West, South-East, Middle Belt and Northern parts of the country are singing discordant tunes over some of the recent bills passed by the National Assembly to amend some sections of the 1999 constitution.\n\nPan Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, apex Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) and the Arewa Youth Consultative Forum are not on the same page on the amendment bills passed by the National Assembly.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nAfenifere, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, MBF and AYCF hailed some of the amendment bills, including granting autonomy to the 774 local governments councils Nigeria as well as their rejection of life pension for Senate presidents and Speakers of the House of Representatives. But they claimed the amendments, overall, fell short of the restructuring and true federalism Nigerians wanted.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, said while certain aspects of the amendments passed by the National Assembly appeared nice on paper, they fell short of the desired restructuring to true federalism that Nigerians had been clamouring for.\n\nFor instance, he noted that the proposal to reduce the items on the Exclusive Legislative List in favour of states is commendable, but that the amendment only touched on peripheral items rather than on core subjects of true federalism.\n\nAfenifere knocked the National Assembly for not allowing state and local government police, despite the level of insecurity in the country and the failure of a centrally commanded police structure to stem the insecurity. It also condemned the attempt to remove the power to conduct local government elections from the State Independent Electoral Commissions (SIEC).\n\nHe admitted that some state governments do manipulate the SIEC to subvert electoral choices in their areas, but said the solution was not in transferring the power to conduct local government elections to the central government.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nHe further said: The Kaduna State local government elections conducted by Governor El Rufai can serve as an example of the possibility of having a fair local government election. In the said elections partly conducted electronically, the opposition PDP won some council areas against the ruling APC candidates.\u201d He noted that autonomy to local governments and the judiciary is a good development as some state governors fiddle with local government funds.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nPresident of the Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr. Pogu Bitrus, said the autonomy for local governments is a good development, and noted that the new amendment will free the local governments from the stranglehold of the state government.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt will bring the government closer to the people. It will also bring about enjoyable facilities to the grassroots, more so now that we have so much insecurity in the land. The local government with their autonomy can play a role in stabilizing their areas of control. So, it is a good and welcome development.\u201d National Publicity Secretary of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Chief Alex Ogbonnia, said autonomy for local government will mark the beginning of democratic governance in Nigeria. He noted that the cancellation of state/local government joint account will help the local governments work better as a tier of government.\n\nHe also commended the lawmakers for turning down the proposal for pension to be paid to former Senate presidents and former Speakers of the House of Representatives.\n\nPresident of the Arewa Youths Consultative Forum (AYCF), Alhaji Yerima Shettima also commended the passing of local government autonomy. He noted that autonomy for local government councils would allow the \u2018commonest\u2019 people be part and parcel of government.\n\n\u201cAgain in terms of security, people will feel that they have a stake in it government with autonomy to the local governments because people come from the community,\u201d Shetimma said.\n\nA lawyer and former President of Aka Ikenga, Chief Goddy Uwazurike, believed that a perfect document would one day be attained. He noted that there is the need for arms of government that need to be independent to be truly independent \u201cin word and deed.\u201d He also supported the listing of the power generation, distribution and transmission.\n\n\u201cLet states take care of their energy needs. The capacity for Lagos, Rivers, Delta, Kano and Anambra definitely cannot be at the same level as in Borno, Katsina, Ebonyi and Ekiti,\u201d Uwazurike said.",

None of the major political parties has zoned its presidential ticket.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nIgbo Elders Consultative Forum (IECF), was the first to raise the alarm that major political parties were about zoning their presidential position elsewhere other than the South East.\n\nThe group also said they have discovered that some Igbo sons and daughters are being used to fine-tune the plot, with a promise of being chosen as running mate to whoever emerges the presidential candidate in any of the major political parties.\n\nChairman of the forum, Dr Chukwuemeka Ezeife, who stated this at a press conference in Abuja, was emphatic that the position of the zone was not for any other position from any of the political parties, except the presidential ticket.\n\nEzeife warned that the zone would not support any party that failed to field candidate from the South East.\n\n\u201cWe are waiting for them, as they will meet their political waterloo this time if they insist on short-changing the South East this rare opportunity of producing a credible, patriotic, detribalised and dynamic president of Nigeria in 2023,\u201d he said.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution...

Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cI understand clearly the dilemma faced by these leaders but Nigerian politics is at a point of no return where national destiny is at stake and where patriotism and political wisdom must supersede personal ambition,\u201d Obiozor said.\n\nHe, therefore, pleaded with the nation\u2019s political class to drop all fears and prejudices against Ndigbo and to forge a common front to move the nation forward.\n\nObiozor also noted that Ndigbo, as an ethnic nationality, is blessed with a good number of capable, patriotic and credible personalities who are eminently qualified to govern the country and meet the expectations of the citizenry through equity, justice and fairness.\n\nHowever, National Publicity Secretary of the apex Igbo socio-cultural body, Chief Alex Ogbonnia commended prominent sons of the region that have thrown their hats in the ring. They include former President of the Senate, Chief Anyim Pius Anyim, Senate Whip, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, Ebonyi Governor; Chief David Umahi and Sam Ohuabunwa, among others.\n\nAlso, President of Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), Prof Uzodinma Nwala, has described those against the next president of Nigeria coming from the South East as enemies of democracy.\n\nNwala said: \u201cWe are calling on our people to stand firm on their demand that the next President of Nigeria must come from the South East.\u201d\n\nFor celebrated scholar and founding National Secretary of Alliance for Democracy (AD), Prof. Udenta Udenta, he was particularly surprised that men in the calibre of the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader, Bola Tinubu and the former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, could be campaigning for president when both are very much aware that their zones had for several years at one time or the other interchanged as President or Vice President respectively.\n\nUdenta in an interview, argued that the South East in 1999 was clearly denied the Presidency just to favour the South West because of the sentiment of the annulment of the June 12, 1993 election.\n\n\u201cFor me, there is no way that Obasanjo\u2019s eight years of Presidency, Osinbanjo\u2019s eight years of Vice Presidency should not translate into a clear, visible, unambiguous statement for power to shift to that part of the South that has not experienced this Presidential power after all the sacrifices of Dr Ogbonnaya Onu, Dr Ezeife and Alex Ekwueme and the rest of them.\n\n\u201cLet me explain few myths to further buttress my bearing. Falae and late Uncle Bola Ige squared off at the Royal Hotel in Ibadan and Falae won and became the AD candidate, the same way Obasanjo defeated Ekwueme and emerged as PDP candidate. The Rovan selection was a South-West selection of the AD.\n\n\u201cHowever, Dr. Chukwuemeka Ezeife who is alive today, purchased the N1million form of the Alliance for Democracy to participate in that process and won a strong vote of the South-East and South-South of the country, but the expanded meeting of the AD leadership, the National Working Committee (NWC), National Executive Committee (NEC), the caucus of the party, the Board of Trustees, the owners of the party met at the Cultural Centre opposite UTC, Abuja, to decide between Falae and Ezeife who would be candidate of the party. Our leader who was my father, Arthur Nwankwo actually misfired that day; he knows from his grave that I am not lying, and the South-East and South-South went up in anger, led by Bassey Ekpo Bassey. We had entire North, South-East and South-South with us, Ezeife had beaten Olu Falae right there in that hall, but after three, four, five hours of robust conversation, they asked Ezeife to step down and he graciously did so and raised the hands of Olu Falae. That was how Falae became the candidate of the party.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the Southwest of this country should know that they stand morally disqualified to run for the office of the President until the South-East has taken their turn, and whoever is in the South-West called by whichever name presenting himself for 2023 Presidential seat, for me, is rapacious in his appetite and insufferably greedy to seek for the office.\u201d",

          "text": "But oil multinational sold all its shares, not JV assets to Seplat\n\nNOC\u2019s action opens up possible legal tussle\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited may have created a wedge in the highly acclaimed transaction that would have seen Seplat Energy, an indigenous oil firm, buy over oil shares belonging to ExxonMobil, THISDAY has learnt.\n\nThe deal between ExxonMobil\u2019s Nigerian unit, Mobil Oil Producing Nigeria Unlimited (MPNU), the first since the signing of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) in August last year, had attracted plaudits from industry leaders.\n\nThe Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) to acquire the entire share capital of MPNU, THISDAY had reported, was for a purchase price of $1.283 billion, plus up to $300 million contingent consideration.\n\nHowever, THISDAY learnt from officials NNPC, that the state-owned oil giant has opted to exercise its Right of First Refusal (RFR) on the sale of the assets.\n\nThe RFR is reportedly contained in the Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) of the Joint Venture (JV), which represents NNPC\u2019s position on the planned sale of the shares to Seplat Energy Plc.\n\nEfforts to get NNPC to speak on the matter were not immediately fruitful, but a top source in the oil firm told THISDAY, \u201cWe will address it at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nBut an industry source who preferred to remain anonymous said last night that NNPC\u2019s action could lead to legal tussle between Seplat and the national oil company. The source stressed that NNPC did not have the power to halt the acquisition of the multinational oil company\u2019s shares by Seplat.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cSeplat bought ExxonMobil\u2019s shares, not assets. Whereas NNPC has right of pre-emption over the sale of assets, it does not have right over sale of shares.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the source explained that with its present structure, NNPC was now a commercial entity and no longer a regulator, as it used to be in the past, \u201cso, it is the regulator that can interfere in the matter.\u201d\n\nThe source added, \u201cHowever, they have to check the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) because if they say they are taking over ExxonMobil, that means they are taking over staff, pensions and liabilities and not assets.\u201d\n\nIt was gathered that NNPC had already notified Mobil Producing Nigeria Unlimited of its intention to exercise the right of pre-emption on ExxonMobil\u2019s planned sale of its entire asset in Nigeria\u2019s onshore and shallow waters.\n\nHowever, a reliable source told THISDAY that the politics underlying the stoppage of the deal could markedly derail the new verve the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) was expected to bring to the industry.\n\nIt was learnt that NNPC was intending to have a special arrangement with a company belonging to a northerner operating in the oil and gas industry, under a \u201cstrategic management contract.\u201d\n\nIndustry sources said that the state-owned oil firm, which is the major shareholder in the JV with ExxonMobil, might have exercised its right of first refusal on the assets as part of a new era, which will focus solely on building the long-term profitability of the NNPC Limited.\n\nThe Mele Kyari-led company had previously conveyed its decision to exercise its rights and match any offer by interested parties for the assets following ExxonMobil\u2019s decision to receive bids for their share of the JV, the platform reported.\n\nSeplat Energy subsequently put forward a winning bid for the assets and reached an agreement with ExxonMobil.\n\nRight of pre-emption is a legal right to parties in a joint venture to be the first to be considered for any planned sale or takeover of assets in the JVs if either party choose to trade them off.\n\nA letter signed by the Group Managing Director, Kyari, and addressed to ExxonMobil, quoted NNPC as reiterating its resolve to take over the company\u2019s share of the assets.\n\n\u201cWe are aware that you reached an agreement to divest from onshore and shallow waters JVs,\u201d the letter read, adding, \u201cClearly we are interested.\u201d\n\nAnnouncing the agreement, ExxonMobil had earlier said that the deals were subject to approval and the new position of NNPC, meaning that the whole process of sale and purchase agreement between ExxonMobil and Seplat Energy has to be discontinued.\n\nSeplat Energy, the company that made the winning bid, had staked over $1.2 billion for the deal to acquire the entire share capital of MPNU plus contingent consideration and was waiting for the minister\u2019s consent before the latest development.\n\nThis meant that the state-owned oil firm must not, based on its exercise of right of first refusal, pay below the $1.2 billion mark.\n\nAccording to the letter, NNPC also reiterated that it had already transformed from being a corporation to being a profit driven company and it now had the capacity to buy over the share of ExxonMobil in the Joint venture.\n\nThe NNPC had recently announced a funding agreement with Afreximbank for up to $5 billion to grow its investment in new and existing upstream assets.\n\nRecently, the publishers of Africa Oil and Gas Report raised the alarm over the attempt by the national oil company to crowd out private investors, saying that enough space should be created for some level of diversity in investment. That alarm has now proved to be a wakeup call on increasingly seemingly grab all posture.\n\nCommenting on the pre-emption rights as expressed by NNPC, Publisher of the magazine, Toyin Akinosho, who had spoken on Arise News Channel, urged NNPC to free the space for entrepreneurs to come in, insisting that the company already has a lot in its basket and was even finding it difficult to cope.\n\nAkinosho maintained, \u201cNNPC is in JV with companies that produce at least 45 per cent of our crude. That\u2019s a lot of material for them already. The assets they operate are the least optimised of all the assets in the industry.\u201d\n\nWhile accusing NNPC of grabbing assets all over the country, he wondered why the national oil company was allegedly stifling investment in the sector. According to him, the kind of partners that NNPC may hand over the assets to are always not the most experienced in the space, adding that the whole idea is \u201cgift\u201d it to a third party.\n\n\u201cIt would not manage the assets, so any excuse about \u2018this being taken over in the interest of the state\u2019 is untrue. In the last three years, it has implemented Finance and Technical Service Agreements (FTSAs), with companies that it chooses to work the assets,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*NDLEA to arraign suspended \u2018super cop,\u2019 four IRT members on eight counts of drug trafficking\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nThe federal government has commenced moves to extradite the suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Abba Kyari, to the United States of America to face fraud allegations.\n\nFew hours after the extradition process commenced, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), which currently has Kyari in its custody following his arrest for alleged illicit drug dealing, also initiated a court process against him. By this development, Kyari, four of his colleagues in the Inspector General of Police Special Intelligence Response Team (IRT), and two others would be arraigned any moment on drug-related charges.\n\nNDLEA filed an eight-count criminal charge against the defendants at the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\nThe implication of the NDLEA court action against Kyari is that he cannot be extradited to the US, even though the federal government has commenced the extradition process.\n\nSection 3 (f) of the Extradition Act says, \u201cA fugitive criminal- (a) who has been charged with an offence under the law of Nigeria or any part thereof, not being the offence for which his surrender is sought; or (b) who is serving a sentence imposed in respect of any such offence by a court in Nigeria, shall not be surrendered until such a time as he has been discharged whether by acquittal or on the expiration of his sentence or otherwise.\u201d\n\nKyari, a once celebrated officer of the Nigeria Police, is currently enmeshed in various criminal allegations in connection with cases for which the \u201csuper cop\u201d had previously won accolades for fighting.\n\nFollowing the arrest and imprisonment of Abass Ramon, a.k.a Hushpuppi, over a $1.1 million wire fraud and Ramon\u2019s alleged implication of Kyari, who was then Commander of the Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), the United States had requested the extradition of Kyari to explain his alleged involvement in the crime.\n\nMonths after the extradition request, yesterday, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN), disclosed that the federal government had filed an application for the extradition of Kyari before the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Abuja. Malami stated that the application, which followed a request by the diplomatic representative of the American embassy in Abuja, was filed under the Extradition Act and marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/249/2022.\n\nOnly recently, the AGF, while speaking during a television programme, assured that the President Muhammadu Buhari administration would extradite Kyari to the US to answer to the fraud charge filed against him, Hushpuppi, and four others if the government felt convinced to do so.\n\nSpeaking on the extradition application, the minister said it was \u201cfor the surrender of Abba Kyari, who is a subject in a superseding three counts indictment.\u201d He said the offence for which Kyari\u2019s extradition was being made was not political or trivial.\n\nMalami added that the request for the surrender of Kyari was not made to persecute or punish him on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinions, but in good faith and the interest of justice.\n\nThe minister stated that if surrendered, Kyari would not be victimised at his trial and will not be punished, detained or have his personal liberty restricted due to race, nationality or political opinions.\u201d\n\nMalami explained that having regard to all the circumstances in which the offence was committed, it would not be unjust or oppressive, or too severe a punishment, to surrender him. He noted that there was no criminal proceeding pending against Kyari in Nigeria for the same offence.\n\nNDLEA to Arraign Kyari, Four IRT Members on Eight-count Drug Charge\n\nThe federal government would any time from now arraign Kyari, four of his colleagues in the IRT, and two others on drug related offences.\n\nKyari and his co-accused were arrested on February 14 and handed over to the police for investigation over allegations bordering on illicit drug dealing.\n\nThe charge, filed yesterday and marked FHC/ABJ/CR/57/2022, was signed by NDLEA\u2019s Director, Prosecution and Legal Services, Mr. Joseph Sunday.\n\nBefore yesterday\u2019s suit, the anti-drug agency had obtained a court order to detain Kyari and others for another 14 days to enable it conclude its investigation and then charge them to court.\n\nOthers listed in the charge included Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Sunday Ubua; Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Bawa James; Inspector Simon Agirigba; Inspector John Nuhu; Chibuinna Patrick Umeibe; and Emeka Alphonsus Ezenwanne.\n\nIn count one, Kyari, ACP Ubua, ASP James, Inspector Agirigba, and Inspector Nuhu, all of Intelligence Response Team were said to have between January 19 and 25, dealt in 17. 55 kilogrammes of cocaine and committed and offence contrary to and punishable under section 14 (b) of the Natural Drug Law Enforcement Agency Act, CAP 30, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004.\n\nCount one read, \u201cThat you DCP Abba Kyari, ACP Sunday J.

          "text": "*EU observer mission meets parties, stakeholders ahead of next year\u2019s polls\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), yesterday, dashed the hope and plans of many people, when it declared it would not register any new political parties, because they would not be able to participate in the 2023 general election by law.\n\nINEC, which claimed that the reason was because the new Electoral Act barred the registration of new political parties to participate in any general election twelve months before, added also that the same new electoral law, allowed for the merger of political parties, only nine months to the general elections.\n\nThere are currently 18 registered political parties in the country.\n\nHowever, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, called on INEC to be truly independent in the conduct of subsequent elections and not allow itself to be manipulated as was the case in 2019, which its National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, claimed the opposition party won but was denied.\n\nThe PDP also called on all security agencies not to allow themselves to be used to subvert electoral processes as was done during the Federal Capital Territory and other elections in Imo and Plateau States recently.\n\nAt the same time, the European Union (EU) Election Observation Follow-up Mission, led by the Head of EU Observation Mission, Mrs Maria Arena, yesterday, hinted that it has held talks with political parties and other stakeholders ahead of next elections and would give a report of its meetings soon.\n\nSpeaking at a town hall meeting organised by the Nigeria Guild of Editors, INEC national commissioner in charge of Publicity and Chairman Voters Education, Festus Okoye, reiterated that, \u201cThe Act also provides that new political association must apply for registration not later than 12 months before a general election while applications for merger must be filed not later than 9 months before election.\u201d\n\nWhile noting that registration and their participation were already time barred, Okoye said, INEC has already released the timetable and schedule of activities for the conduct of the 2023 general election, fixing Presidential and National Assembly elections to hold on the 25th of February 2023 and Governorship and State Assembly Elections to hold on the 11th of March 2023.\n\nHe said the law provided that the election funds due to the Commission for any general elections were to be released to the Commission not later than one year before the election.\n\nOkoye explained that Nigeria was entering a critical and challenging phase in its electoral process as there were new, creative and progressive provisions and innovations in the new law, adding: \u201cThe law has tight timelines that must be carefully managed.\n\nUnder the new law, the Commission shall issue the Notice of Election not later than 360 days before the date fixed for the conduct of elections. Political parties must submit the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates not later than 180 days before the election.\u201d\n\nThe INEC national commissioner said the new law contained such new provisions relating to ballot boxes and voting devices, accreditation of voters, determination of over-voting, visually impaired and incapacitated voters, post-election procedure and collation of election results.\n\nAccording to Okoye, \u201cIt also contains power of the Commission to review declared results, nomination of candidates, limitation of election expenses and the jurisdiction of courts in pre-election matters among other provisions.\u201d\n\nHe called on the media to isolate and analyse these provisions and thereafter treat the entire law as a compound package for the conduct of elections in Nigeria.\n\nAccordingly, he said a good knowledge of the law and its provisions would assist in crafting good editorials and holding the Commission and the Political Parties accountable to their implementation.\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe 2023 general election will come with challenges and the Commission is determined to surmount these challenges and conduct free, fair, credible and inclusive election. Growing insecurity in several parts of the country and the increasing number of internally displaced persons will pose challenges to the conduct of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cSo many of the internally displaced persons are in the houses of friends and relatives and have lost their Permanent Voters Cards and it is next to impossibility to recreate their constituencies and polling units.\n\n\u201cThis is because section 47(1) of the Electoral Act clearly provides that a person intending to vote in an election shall present himself with his voter\u2019s card to a Presiding Officer for accreditation at the polling unit in the constituency in which his name is registered.\n\n\u201cSome of these persons are no longer in their constituencies and can no longer access their polling units and so many of them have lost their Permanent Voters Cards. While it is easy to recreate constituencies and polling units in clustered camps of Internally Displaced Persons (IDP camps), it is next to impossibility to do so for persons staying in scattered locations,\u201d he stated\n\nIn view of this, Okoye said, \u201cFor the internally displaced, the Commission will print new Permanent Voters Cards for them and recreate their polling units in their camps and they will be eligible to vote in some of the elections depending on their location and their proximity to their State and Federal Constituencies.\n\n\u201cThis is in accord with section 24(1) of the Electoral Act, which provides that, \u2018In the event of an emergency affecting an election, the Commission shall, as far as practicable, ensure that persons displaced as a result of the emergency are not disenfranchised.\n\n\u201cBased on this, the Commission developed regulations and guidelines on IDP voting and will implement the intendment of the law and the Regulations and Guidelines,\u201d he disclosed\n\nOkoye hinted that the Commission was currently at the terminal phase of its Continuous Voters Registration Exercise (CVR), as there were so many communities that were still inaccessible to INEC registration officers.\n\nHis words: \u201cIn the next few weeks, the Commission will roll out modalities for the further devolution and rotation of the CVR to our registration areas and the security of our personnel and the registrants are fundamental to the success of the exercise.\n\n\u201cWe are determined to register all eligible registrants but will not expose our staff to unnecessary danger. We will roll out and roll back depending on the security situation in different parts of the country.\u201d\n\nHe stated said that it was important for the media to continue to highlight and analyse the causes and possible solutions to the security challenges in the country and continue to hold government accountable.\n\nHe equally explained that the various security agencies must try as much as possible to degrade if not neutralise the security threats and challenges in different parts of the country, adding that voting and the exercise of democratic mandate might not be the priority of persons enveloped in a climate and atmosphere of fear and anxiety.\n\nOn the innovations in the Commission, he said. \u201cAs some of you are aware, the Commission has introduced new and creative changes in the enumeration of voters, the party nomination processes and the conduct of elections. The Commission is currently conducting the Continuous Voters Registration Exercise (CVR) both physically and online using the new INEC Voter Enrolment Device (IVED).\n\n\u201cThe Commission has introduced an online nomination portal through which Political Parties upload the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates. The Commission has also introduced an online portal through which international and domestic observers and the media apply for accreditation.\n\n\u201cThe Commission has also introduced the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) for voter accreditation and authentication. The Commission introduced the INEC Result Viewing Portal (iRev) through which polling unit level results are uploaded to a result-viewing portal in real time.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is firmly of the view that greater use of technology in the electoral process will, to a large extent, reduce human interference in the voting, counting and collation process.\u201d\n\nHowever, Okoye said the Commission was conscious of the fact that technology did not operate itself and that the human element is ever present, but added, that the Commission would continue to learn from issues and challenges that arise from the deployment of technology as well as innovate and improve on them.\n\nMeanwhile, Ayu, who spoke yesterday when the EU Observation Mission visited, maintained that the party had evidence that security agencies were used to subvert the electoral processes in the recent bye-election in some states, while charging its members to henceforth rise up and defend their votes.\n\nSpeaking at the PDP national secretariat, Ayu charged INEC to be genuinely independent to enable democracy to thrive in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, the PDP was not making flimsy excuses of the security agencies being used to subvert the electoral processes, adding, \u201cWe have the hard core evidence and we have submitted same to INEC.\u201d\n\nHe said the PDP would mobilise and sensitise the voters as well as asked them to defend their votes when the need arises\n\n\u201cWe have seen a decline in those things, which were promoted as a political party, including the establishments or creating of certain institutions that will strengthen democracy in this country. And, therefore, we are very worried that those, instead of strengthening the democratic process, which will see democracy sustained, we see a sustained decline in those democratic practices,\u201d he said.\n\nHe identified such things like the conduct of elections, use of security services to attack judges, to attack citizens, instead of protecting them to survive the electoral process.\n\n\u201cWe have evidence; I will stand by our position. We are happy that these are not just empty pronouncements, even you. You have shown to me in 2019 report, which you have read \u2013 shows clearly some of those problems that we\u2019re complaining \u2013 we\u2019ll keep complaining as long as these practices are sustained,\u201d Ayu stated .\n\nThe PDP National Chairman explained that the party had evidence that it won the 2019 general election, and lamented that justice was not done.\n\nAccording to him, it would not be good to allow such injustice to continue as was the case in the last FCT elections, where it was awarded three local governments of Abuja Municipal Area, Kuje and Bwari area councils, whereas it won 44 councillors and the APC won only 18 councillors.\n\nHe insisted that the electoral processes were subverted, because Abaji, Kwali and Gwagwalada area councils were in the rural areas of the FCT\n\nThe Head, EU Observation Mission, Arena, said the mission had been in the country meeting political parties, stakeholders and media in the last five days and would make its findings known to the public soon.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Evacuation of Nigerians Delayed After Flight Exceeded Allotted Duty Hours",
          "text": "*First batch expected to arrive today\n\n*Ukraine says talks with Russia agreed on humanitarian corridors\n\nChinedu Eze and Dike Onwuamaeze\n\nThe authorities of Chopin Airport, Warsaw, yesterday cancelled the evacuation flight that was expected to bring in from Poland the first batch of Nigerians that escaped the on-going conflict between Ukraine and Russia. The plane was to take off from that airport.\n\nIn continuing reactions to the conflict, particularly by Western countries and institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group yesterday declared support for the people of Ukraine and decried the war raging in the country that has caused devastating human and economic consequences.\n\nThe US White House yesterday announced new sanctions on Russian oligarchs in President Joe Biden\u2019s latest attempt to squeeze Russian President Vladimir Putin as the invasion of Ukraine advanced.\n\nThe flight meant to evacuate stranded Nigerians was cancelled because the aircraft overstayed its allotted duty hours. The crew that operated the Air Peace flight from Nigeria to Poland had spent their allotted hours of duty and, according to international standards, they could not exceed the allotted hours.\n\nFlight and Duty Time Limitations (FTL) recognised by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) is the rule, which ensures that aircrew fatigue does not decrease flight safety.\n\nSince most aviation incidents and accidents are result of human factors, fatigue is taken into account as a major factor, which also contributes to the human error. Therefore, fatigue of crewmembers has been an issue in civil aviation since the 1944 Chicago Convention.\n\nThe Nigerian evacuation flight was shifted to early today morning and it was expected to arrive the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, later today.\n\nAmbassador Bolaji Akinremi, who arrived Poland with the Air Peace flight, disclosed this.\n\nAkinremi explained to Arise TV, \u201cThe reality is that the flight has been rescheduled to tomorrow (Friday). The main reason is because of the delay during the check in because they have to gather them together from different hotels and by the time we would be ready after the check in, the crew that had been waiting since 9:00 am overshot their duty hour, which is allocated to them.\n\n\u201cThey have waited from 9am to 2pm. It means they have already waited five hours and they are going to have nine hours flight. That is already more than the standard allowed. So the authorities of the airport said they won\u2019t allow us to go.\n\n\u201cSo we have to come down. But arrangement has been made to ensure that we all stay together in the same hotel and we will leave very early tomorrow, 4am with the bus so that we can join the flight early.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Ambassador to Poland, Christian Ugwu, who was visibly worried over the postponement of the flight, attributed the delay to the unruly behaviour of some Nigerians who could not prepare quickly to board the flight, but also expressed optimism that the flight would take off today.\n\n\u201cI am very sure by tomorrow morning the flight will take off,\u201d Ugwu said.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that before the flight was cancelled, passengers had been allowed to board and they had all been stamped after passing through security. They were already in the aircraft before the airport authorities announced the cancellation, so the evacuees had to de-board.\n\nHowever, about 1,500 Nigerians may be missing as out of the 2,222 that were received only about 600 could be accounted for.\n\nArise News reported, \u201cNigerian authorities, the Nigerian embassy here in Poland, said they only had a count of 600. But it seems at this point, there are more than 1,500 Nigerians, who are missing.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, President Muhammed Buhari announced the approval of $8.5 million for the evacuation of about 5, 000 Nigerians who had moved from Ukraine to neighbouring countries where they were expected to be evacuated from.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs had arranged the evacuation of Nigerians from Ukraine\u2019s neighbouring countries.\n\nThe chartered flights were initially arranged to depart on Wednesday, to bring the first batch of Nigerians home on Thursday.\n\nThe following Nigerians, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs records indicated that evacuees received by Nigerian embassies at Hungary were 650 persons, Poland 350 persons, Romania 940 persons and Slovakia 150 persons.\n\nThe Ministry arranged that Max Air would airlift Nigerians from Romania (560 persons), Air Peace to Poland (364 persons), and Air Peace to Poland (360) persons.\n\nThe first batch of evacuees was expected to arrive Nigeria on Thursday, March 3, 2022.\n\nIMF, World Bank Declare Support for Ukraine, Mobilise $5.2bn\n\nThe IMF and the World Bank Group declared support for the people of Ukraine and decried the war raging in the country that has caused devastating human and economic toll.\n\nThe Brent Wood institutions made their views known about the war that was provoked by Russia\u2019s recent invasion of Ukraine in a joint statement signed by Managing Director of IMF, Ms. Kristalina Georgieva, and the President of World Bank Group, Mr. David Malpass.\n\nThe statement reads in part, \u201cWe are deeply shocked and saddened by the devastating human and economic toll brought by the war in Ukraine. People are being killed, injured, and forced to flee, and massive damage is caused to the country\u2019s physical infrastructure.\n\n\u201cWe stand with the Ukrainian people through these horrifying developments.\u201d\n\nGeorgieva and Malpass noted that the war was also creating significant spill overs to other countries while commodity prices were being driven higher at the risk of further fuelling inflation that hit the poor the hardest.\n\nThey said, \u201cDisruptions in financial markets will continue to worsen should the conflict persist. The sanctions announced over the last few days will also have a significant economic impact. We are assessing the situation and discussing appropriate policy responses with our international partners.\n\n\u201cOur institutions are working together to support Ukraine on the financing and policy fronts and are urgently increasing that support. We have been in daily contact with the authorities on crisis measures.\n\n\u201cAt the IMF, we are responding to Ukraine\u2019s request for emergency financing through the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI), which our board could consider as early as next week.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we continue to work on Ukraine\u2019s Stand-By Arrangement program, under which an additional $2.2 billion is available between now and the end of June.\u201d\n\nThe statement also said the World Bank Group was \u201cpreparing a $3 billion package of support in the coming months, starting with a fast-disbursing budget support operation for at least $350 million that will be submitted to the board for approval this week, followed by $200 million in fast-disbursing support for health and education.\u201d\n\nIt explained that this package would include the mobilisation of financing from several development partners, and welcomed the already-announced support from many bilateral partners.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cThe World Bank and the IMF are also working together to assess the economic and financial impact of the conflict and refugees on other countries in the region and the world. We stand ready to provide enhanced policy, technical, and financial support to neighboring countries as needed. Coordinated international action will be crucial to mitigate risks and navigate the treacherous period ahead. This crisis affects the lives and livelihoods of people around the world, and we offer them our full support.\u201d\n\nWhite House Announces New Sanctions on Russian Oligarchs\n\nThe White House has announced new sanctions on Russian oligarchs, in Biden\u2019s latest attempt to squeeze Putin.\n\nThe new list of individuals described as \u201cPutin\u2019s cronies and their family members\u201d would be cut off from the US financial system, their assets in the US would be frozen, and their property would be blocked from use, according to a fact sheet from the White House.\n\nAccording to the CNN, there would be full blocking sanctions on eight Russian elites, plus their family members and associates.\n\nIt included a move to target Putin ally Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov, \u201cone of Russia\u2019s wealthiest individuals,\u201d according to the White House, and will include his super-yacht and private jet.\n\nThe US is also sanctioning Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, whom the White House described as \u201ca top purveyor of Putin\u2019s propaganda.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States and governments all over the world will work to identify and freeze the assets Russian elites and their family members hold in our respective jurisdictions \u2014 their yachts, luxury apartments, money, and other ill-gotten gains,\u201d the fact sheet said.\n\nOther individuals who would be subject to full blocking sanctions are: Nikolai Tokarev (along with his wife Galina, daughter Mayya and his two luxury real estate companies); Boris Rotenberg (along with his wife Karina, and his sons Roman and Boris); Arkady Rotenberg (along with his sons Pavel and Igor and daughter Liliya); and Sergei Chemezov (along with his wife Yekaterina, his son Stanislav and stepdaughter Anastasiya).\n\nThe list also included Igor Shuvalov (along with his five companies, his wife Olga, his son Evgeny and his company and jet, and his daughter Maria and her company), and Yevgeniy Prigozhin (along with his three companies, his wife, Polina, his daughter Lyubov, and his son Pavel).\n\nThe US disclosed that it would also impose visa restrictions on 19 oligarchs and 47 of their family members and close associates.\n\nThat would target oligarchs, \u201cknown to direct, authorise, fund, significantly support, or carry out malign activities in support of Russia\u2019s destabilising foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Treasury will also issue sanctions on disinformation targets. That includes SDN Strategic Culture Foundation and associated outlets Odna Rodyna, Rhythm of Eurasia, and Journal Kamerton; SouthFront; SDN InfoRos; New Eastern Outlook; Oriental Review; United World International; and Geopolitical.\n\nIt will also designate \u201c26 Russia and Ukraine-based individuals who play central roles in these organisations, enabling the Government of the Russian Federation\u2019s efforts to spread disinformation and influence perceptions as a part of their invasion of Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe US and its allies have taken a wide range of actions in recent weeks intended to punish Moscow for the invasion, including harsh new sanctions and export controls aimed at imposing severe costs on the Russian economy.\n\nBiden announced on Tuesday the US would ban Russian aircraft from US airspace, joining a growing number of countries who have closed their skies to Russia. The US and its allies have also agreed to release 60 million barrels of oil from their reserves.\n\nUkraine Says Talks with Russia Agreed on Humanitarian Corridors\n\nA Ukrainian negotiator said yesterday that a second round of ceasefire talks with Russia had not yielded the results Kyiv hoped for, but the sides had reached an understanding on creating humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians.\n\nUkrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the two sides envisaged a possible temporary ceasefire to allow for the evacuation of civilians.\n\n\u201cThat is, not everywhere, but only in those places where the humanitarian corridors themselves will be located, it will be possible to cease fire for the duration of the evacuation,\u201d Reuters quoted him to have said.\n\nThey had also reached an understanding on the delivery of medicines and food to the places where the fiercest fighting was taking place. It was the first time the two sides had agreed any form of progress on any issue since Russia invaded Ukraine a week ago.\n\nPodolyak said the outcome had fallen short of Kyiv\u2019s hopes, however.\n\n\u201cTo our great regret, we did not get the results we were counting on,\u201d he said, without elaborating.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I can say is that we discussed the humanitarian aspect in sufficient detail, because quite a lot of cities are now surrounded. There is a dramatic situation with medicines, food, and evacuation,\u201d Podolyak said\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The current situation is called SNAFU: Situation Normal All Fouled Up. Normalcy will definitely return. \u201cBe patient, my soul. Thou hath suffered worse than this.\u201d (Thomas Holcroft). \u201cWhy are you downcast, O my soul? Why the unease within me? Put your hope in God, for I will yet praise Him for the salvation of His presence.\u201d Psalm 42:5.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu has promptly approved the sum of $8.5m for the evacuation of Nigerians in Ukraine. Good. That\u2019s what a responsible father does to family members in distress. He\u2019s also working night and day, ensuring the country has fuel, power, infrastructure, and all the good things of life. Be patient my soul...\n\n\u201cKnock, Knock, Who\u2019s there? Yes, do you remember the title of that book by James Hadley Chase that we read in the 70s and 80s? Were you old enough then? Do you also remember the song we used to listen and dance to then? Written by Aaron Schroeder and Sid Wayne, released in 1959 by Isley Brothers, and it became a global hit. Were you old enough then?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna knock on your door, ring on your bell Tap on your window too,\n\nIf you don\u2019t come out tonight when the moon is bright. I\u2019m gonna knock and ring and tap until you do.\u201d Are you like King Lear at his gloomy worst? I\u2019ve come to knock on your door. Are you saturnine and lugubrious \u2018cos there\u2019s no fuel, no light, no power? \u201cDem go reach bed power no dey, shuffering and shmiling ,\u201d Fela Anikulapo-Kuti had sang long ago. \u201cBe patient my soul, thou hath suffered worse than this.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were cases of bad fuel before in this country. We slept for days, weeks on end at petrol stations, queuing for fuel. We survived. We will survive again. Las las.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to knock and ring and tap on your door today, to remind you that it is not all doom and gloom in our country. However overcast the sky is, there\u2019s always a shimmer of light. And that was what we were shown a couple of weeks back, when the Minister of Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, accompanied by Works and Housing Minister, Babatunde Raji Fashola SAN, and their other counterparts addressed a town hall meeting on infrastructure financing and human capital development. It was like streaks of light in an overcast sky.\u201d",

A much bigger push for food price inflation comes from outside food production, particularly the energy, fertiliser and feed sectors,\u201d said FAO economist Upali Galketi Aratchilage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll these factors tend to squeeze profit margins of food producers, discouraging them from investing and expanding production.\u201d\n\nAccording to the report, the February reading only partly incorporates market effects stemming from the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nThe overall rise in FPI was led by an 8.5 percent increase in the FAO vegetable oils price index, a new record high.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report said it was principally due to sustained global import demand, which coincided with a few supply-side factors, such as lower soybean production prospects in South America.\n\nThe dairy price index averaged 6.4 percent higher in February than January, supported by lower-than-expected milk supplies in Western Europe and Oceania, as well as persistent import demand, especially from North Asia and the Middle East.\n\nThe report added that the cereal price index increased 3.0 percent over January due to rising quotations for maize and other coarse grains, caused by continued concerns over crop conditions in South America, uncertainty from Ukraine, and rising wheat export prices.\n\n\u201cWorld wheat prices increased by 2.1 percent, largely reflecting uncertainty about global supply flows from Black Sea ports. International rice prices increased by 1.1 percent, sustained by strong demand for fragrant rice from Near East Asian buyers and the appreciation of the currencies of some exporters against the U.S. dollar,\u201d the report reads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe FAO Meat Price Index rose 1.1 percent from January, with international bovine meat quotations reaching a new record high amid strong global import demand and tight supplies of slaughter-ready cattle in Brazil and high demand for herd rebuilding in Australia.\u201d\n\nThe FAO sugar price index also declined by 1.9 percent amid favourable production prospects in India, Thailand and other major exporters, as well as improved growing conditions in Brazil.\n\nFAO also published a preliminary forecast that shows worldwide cereal output may increase to 790 million tonnes this year.\n\nIt said anticipated high yields and extensive planting in North America and Asia should offset a likely slight decrease in the European Union and the adverse impact of drought conditions on crops in some of the North African countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFAO has also updated its forecast for world cereal production in 2021, now pegged at 2 796 million tonnes, a 0.7 percent increase from the year before,\u201d it added.\n\n\u201cGlobal cereal utilisation in 2021/2022 is now seen at 2 802 million tonnes, a 1.5 percent annual increase.

          "title": "Vault Hill is building a human-centric metaverse. What about it?",
          "text": "Jimi Daodu has always been entrepreneurial. Back at Babcock University, he had established an entertainment business that organised parties in the school. After Daodu completed his master\u2019s programme in Advanced Computing at the University of Bristol, he wanted to stay back in the UK for a couple of years to work and earn back his master\u2019s fees. At the time, Daodu recalled, the British government allowed international students to apply for a post-work-study visa, which grants one a two-year stay in the UK. Daodu got the post-work-study visa, but things started to look grim when, for months, he couldn\u2019t get a job. Frustrated from his job search, Daodu contemplated booking a return ticket to Nigeria and returning to his shoe selling business.\n\nHe eventually got a job that sustained him until he got yet another which secured a visa for him and got him to stay. In the past decade, Daodu has worked in project management, hospitality, financial services, and the telecommunications industries all in the UK.\n\nDaodu was born in Lagos, Nigeria, and lived most of his years in the bustling city. He had studied Computer Science at Babcock University before going to the UK for a master\u2019s degree in Advanced Computing at the University of Bristol.\n\nIn 2017, Daodu got into the crypto space, Ripple (XRP), Bitcoin (BTC) were buzzy, so, he bought a couple. He then stumbled on virtual lands and saw them as an opportunity to diversify his digital assets and, as a Nigerian accustomed to the notion that land is the best investment, he bought some, even though he knew nothing about virtual lands. He got 8 plots of land in virtual spaces: 2 plots in Decentraland and 6 in Somnium Space for $200 each.\n\nThe idea for what would become a blockchain-based metaverse company, Vault Hill, started to form last February when he got an email stating that there was an offer on his land. He accepted the offer and sold a plot of land in Somnium Space for $10,000. He was stunned because he hadn\u2019t gotten such a high return from the stocks and shares he had purchased.\n\nHe realised that the only reason the buyer paid that much was because of the value associated with the virtual land, so, he realised that there was a market there. When he shared his idea with his friends, they said, \u201dJimi, you have come with your ideas again!\u201d But Daodu assured them: \u201cThis is the one.\u201d\n\nFounder and CEO of Vault Hill, Jimi Daodu\n\nIn May 2021, Daodu started bootstrapping Vault Hill by selling a few investments as well as plots of land in Somnium Space, for amounts ranging from $9,000 to $12,000. To differentiate itself from other virtual spaces and metaverse, Vault Hill City (Vault Hill\u2019s Metaverse) has four different islands and each island has 7 human-themed districts: Play, Romance, Curiosity, Community, Idealism, Vitality, and Imagination. \u201cEach district is human-themed to ensure the metaverse is open to everybody. This space is infinite; it is hard to choose a target audience, so we want to build an ecosystem where anyone can come in.\u201d Currently, the cost of a plot of land in a district in Vault Hill City range between $2,000 and $2,600.\n\nDaodu describing a metaverse, said, \u201cMetaverse is a shared virtual space. It\u2019s like Twitter, but in a gamified perspective\u2014the use of augmented reality and virtual reality. In a metaverse, you have to create a digital representation of yourself called an avatar, which allows you to navigate the digital world since you can\u2019t go into the digital world with your physical body.\u201d Daodu\u2019s definition of a metaverse involves a connection to the blockchain, decentralised finance, and freedom from control by the government, or even private individuals.\n\nIt is in respect to this vision that Vault Hill is building through 3 phases and at the end of the third phase, Vault Hill is handed over to a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO)\u2014the community of token and landowners\u2014which will be responsible for decision making on its metaverse.\n\nVault Hill is building a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace to allow NFT artists to list their art on the metaverse and display it to potential buyers through a gamified experience. Vault Hill is also encouraging companies to build edifices in their metaverse. The two plots of land Daodu bought on Decentraland were merged together to build Vault Hill\u2019s sales office.\n\nVault Hill is also partnering with Ready Player Me to build out avatars and incorporate digital wearables and limited-edition accessories. It is also partnering with Nigerian brands including Crivel Watches and Looks Like a Good Man for corporate and traditional wear. \u201cAdditionally, we are currently working to have interoperability of avatars. That is, using one avatar across multiple metaverses instead of having to create one for Vault Hill, and another for Decentraland,\u201d Vault Hill said. Vault Hill Part is also partnering with Lingua54 to use machine learning to translate the speeches of avatars across different languages in real time.\n\nAs funding was a constant headache for the team, Vault Hills started talking to traditional venture capitalists to raise funds, but a lot of them didn\u2019t understand what they were building. A senior colleague, at the time, had said \u201cIf you\u2019re talking to VCs, and they don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re building, you\u2019re doing something right.\u201d\n\nTo meet its funding needs, Vault Hill created a token called VHC token\u2014which is currently going for $0.003697 on Coin Market Cap, as of the time of writing. With it, Vault Hill raised $2.1 million in pre-pre-seed and private equity rounds, selling 25% of its total supply of tokens of 340 million. The majority of the fund will go into product development and hiring, Daodu said.\n\nMajority holders of the VHC token or majority landowners in the Vault Hill City will have voting power in the DAO. The VHC token will serve as a medium of a transaction within the metaverse, give majority token holders voting power in Vault Hill\u2019s proposed DAO and reward content creators when they get to sell or get traction for their artworks and content.\n\nDaodu speaks about the challenges of building a metaverse company: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a book on how to build a metaverse, so there isn\u2019t anything like what a good one looks like.\u201d But one challenge stands out: getting talent. \u201cYou need a host of developers\u2014extended reality developers, a mix of augmented and virtual reality developers, blockchain developers, full-stack developers, etc, but because it is an emerging technology and these skills are not taught in most traditional schools yet, they can be difficult to find.\u201d\n\nBut Daodu is optimistic, especially about the increase in VR adoption in recent years, which he said is both the cost and effect of the cost of the tech. \u201cAs adoption grows, the cost of technology always drops. The Oculus quest is retailing for $300, would that get to $50- $100 at some point in time? Absolutely. People are already spending $1,000 on an iPhone every year.\u201d\n\nDaodu noted that Vault Hill is not building an escapism platform, but intentionally thinking about how humans do things in the real world and then creating a way to augment it virtually\u2014with an ultimate aim of fostering human interaction. For example, in its Vitality district, it will collaborate with physiotherapists to help people with mental health challenges and create an augmented reality (AR) consultation service for London Bridge sports medicine, which will allow patients that can\u2019t come in physically for consultation in the hospital to get consultation services through augmented reality.\n\nThe first glance of Vault Hill City will be up by Q2 2022 and by the end of the year, it will be fully running. \u201cUsers will be able to design their own unique experiences, explore their fantasies, and also enjoy activities they do in the physical world such as interacting with other users, attending events, playing games, curating arts, exercising, host shows, visiting a library, build a music studio, and so much more,\u201d Vault Hill said. \u201cUsers will be able to access the metaverse using a virtual reality headset for a fully immersive experience. But they will also be able to explore the metaverse through laptops.\u201d\n\n\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Two years and 3 million rides later, can SafeBoda keep its lead in Nigeria?",
          "text": "On Wednesday, Ibadan-based Ugandan bike hailing startup SafeBoda clocked two years of operating in the Nigerian market.\n\nSafeBoda launched in Nigeria in December 2019 but started operations in January 2020. The startup had initially set to launch in May 2019 but months of deliberations\u2014including that of the best city market entry\u2014delayed its launch.\n\nThen, finally, in a surprising move which immediately created an outlier reputation for the company, SafeBoda skipped Lagos, the Nigerian commercial hub, to launch in Ibadan, a decision that continues to pay off\u2014especially considering that the Lagos government shutdown bike hailing businesses a month after it launched.\n\nSafeBoda\u2019s growth since its launch has been groundbreaking. In June 2020, about 6 months after its operation started, it reached a milestone of 100,000 rides. Also, in August 2020, it grew 150% and recorded 250,000 rides. And by the end of the year, while it was pausing its Kenyan operation, it celebrated half a million rides in Nigeria.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHowever, its defining growth started when in April 2021, the startup reached the 1 million rides milestone; that\u2019s a 150% growth in a month. Prior to that, it had done the same rate quarterly, and since then to date, it\u2019s been bumping up the numbers.\n\nAs anyone would expect, an increase in the number of rides must have been the result of an increase in other proportional metrics. By June 2021, 100,000 passengers had signed up on the platform, and 3 months after that, its 8,000th rider was onboarded. And in November it was doing 20,000 rides daily.\n\nFast forward to today, SafeBoda claims to have recorded over 3 million rides, more than 10,000 riders, over 100,000 users, and completed 50,000 deliveries.\n\nThe startup currently offers 3 services in Nigeria: rides, deliveries, and airtime purchase. The payment vertical which has already launched in Uganda, will launch in Nigeria soon.\n\nThe end and the beginning of an era\n\nSafeBoda is endearing to people for many reasons. One of them is its first Nigeria Country Director Babajide Duroshola, who led the startup from launching till June last year when he exited for another East African startup that had just expanded into Nigeria.\n\nSafeBoda Nigeria\u2019s new Country Director Olaoluwa Arokoyu\n\nChanging leadership always comes with challenges and SafeBoda faced its fair share. But it quickly made an internal replacement when it appointed its Head of Operation Olaoluwa Arokoyu as CEO. Arokoyu had previously worked in operations with Opay and Jumia and joined SafeBoda 5 months prior to Duroshola\u2019s exit.\n\nEver since his appointment, Arokoyu has achieved some laudable milestones including taking the company from 2 million rides to over 3 million rides, optimising the app for address verification during the onboarding process to reduce fraudulent activities, and improving how riders are being paid to increase brand loyalty among riders.\n\nCreating a better experience for all\n\nSafeBoda says it\u2019s as compassionate with its riders the same way it is with passengers. It says in a statement that it\u2019s constantly looking for a better way to increase the earning power of its riders while giving passengers a good experience. \u201cAs a result of this increased earning power, SafeBoda riders and their families have access to a more quality lifestyle.\u201d\n\n\u201cSafeBoda\u2019s primary mission is to provide a better standard of living for drivers and customers. Everything we do is aligned with this goal,\u201d Arokoyu told TechCabal.\n\nSafeBoda\u2019s riders in Ibadan\n\nFor SafeBoda riders like Ghazali Saheed, who\u2019s the 5964th rider that joined the bike-hailing startup, the best thing about SafeBoda is the respect they [the riders] get from customers that other riders don\u2019t get. \u201cSafeBoda also makes it easy to set targets and reach them. It\u2019s easy for us to know where to get a lot of orders so that we can easily reach our targets,\u201d he said.\n\nLike many bike-hailing startups, SafeBoda is also destigmatising bike [okada] riding in Ibadan and Nigeria as a whole. The way it looks, it\u2019s like these bike-hailing companies are formalising a sector that\u2019s been informal for a long time.\n\n\u201cThe okada or boda business isn\u2019t categorised to be prestigious within African communities. But with a touch of orange, the story is different. SafeBoda riders are highly regarded and respected, not just because of the colour but because of their conduct,\u201d said Clement Obaro, Growth Manager at SafeBoda.\n\nCompetition is stronger than ever\n\nDue to SafeBoda\u2019s success in Ibadan, it has become apparent that the city is the new juicy spot for the bike-hailing market and, as a result of that, it has also become a battleground. Everybody wants a piece of the pie. Uber last month launched its bike-hailing arm in Ibadan and joined the host of others like MaxNG, ORide, and Gokada to snag more market share from SafeBoda.\n\n\u201cWe have been expecting this to happen and now that it has, we are not worried. Our focus is to keep giving the best experience to our customers and keeping our riders happy and willing to complete more rides daily,\u201d said Arokoyu. \u201cThe sky is wide enough for all birds to fly; healthy competition is always good for business.\u201d\n\nSafeBoda is one of the most active bike-hailing companies in sub-Saharan Africa as it holds more than 80% market share in Uganda and Nigeria. Uber and Bolt had first launched their bike-hailing product in Uganda but couldn\u2019t beat SafeBoda.\n\nIf combining the popularity and capital war chest of Uber and Bolt, the two most powerful mobility startups in the world, couldn\u2019t beat SafeBoda in Uganda, there\u2019s no saying that only Uber can pull it off in Nigeria. But it\u2019s a different market, however, with the level of loyalty SafeBoda has built among riders and customers, it won\u2019t be an easy call to dominate over it in Ibadan.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Facebook content moderators in Kenya will receive a 30-50% pay rise. This announcement comes two weeks after an investigation report by TIME revealed that content moderators in Nairobi were subject to poor pay and working conditions by Sama, a company responsible for Facebook\u2019s sub-Saharan Africa content moderation since 2019.\n\nEvery content moderator will receive an extra 20,000 Kenyan shillings ($176) per month, Sama told employees in a meeting on Tuesday, sources revealed to TIME.\n\n\u201cThe raise means that the lowest-paid Facebook content moderators at Sama will now take home around 50,000 Kenyan shillings ($439) each month after-tax, or around $2.20 per hour for a 9-hour working day. This is up from around $1.50 per hour previously.\u201d\n\nAll content moderators were also promised yearly bonuses worth one month of their salary, as an incentive to remain at the company, according to the sources.\n\nDespite the obvious correlation, Habel Kamau, a human resources director at Sama\u2019s Nairobi office, said that the salary increase wasn\u2019t a result of the release of the investigation by TIME. He claimed that the conversations about a salary increase had been ongoing for a while now, adding that the pay raise was made possible due to budget cuts from other places and not as a result of Sama receiving additional money from Facebook.\n\nAlthough the pay raise is welcomed by many of the content moderators, some still say it\u2019s not enough. Sama employees remain some of Facebook\u2019s lowest-paid workers anywhere in the world. While the lowest starting salary of a Facebook content moderator at Sama is $2.20 per hour, outsourced content moderators for Facebook in the U.S. are paid a typical starting salary of $18 per hour.\n\nSouth African Daniel Motaung, a former employee of Sama who was fired after trying to lead a union, noted that in 2019 employees had requested for their pay to be doubled. \u201cThis increase will make a difference but it won\u2019t change their lives,\u201d Motaung said in the statement. \u201cThey still won\u2019t be able to buy a house or feed their families in line with the \u2018lifting the poor out of poverty\u2019 narrative that Sama continuously boasts about.\u201d\n\nSama didn\u2019t comment on allegations that its managers suppressed a unionization effort in 2019, which led to Motaung losing his Job. Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company also declined to comment on the announcement of the pay raise.\n\nThe announcement of the pay raise is seen as a win for the content moderators and validation of the power in employees speaking up.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

I asked because it has become a catchword in a country with over 56 million unbanked adults.\n\nFinancially included individuals have access to basic financial services like a savings account, credit, and insurance. Also, a higher exclusion rate in Nigeria could result in a poorer population because a lack of access to credit and insurance places them at a competitive economic disadvantage.\n\nThe Enhancing Financial Innovation Access\u2019 (EFInA), Access to Financial Services in Nigeria 2020 Survey (a2f) (PDF), shows that Nigeria has one of the highest rates of financial exclusion in Africa at 35.9%.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsequently, given the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) goal to increase that figure to 94% by 2024, there is still much work to be done. And recently, the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) has joined the fray.\n\nNIPOST unveiled its new agency banking platform at a ceremony in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja, in January 2022. The platform includes a free debit card that can be used both offline and online, and it is available at all NIPOST locations in Nigeria\u2019s 774 local governments.\n\nThe agency banking platform, according to Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, would conform to the Universal Postal Union\u2019s (UPU) financial inclusion standards. He also stated that this is a part of the government\u2019s plan to digitise postal services and increase financial inclusion in the country.\n\nWhat is the plan? How do they intend to achieve this? You can catch up with this here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nHow to improve customer experience\n\nMTN in the metaverse\n\nSudo Africa\u2019s $3.7 million pre-seed\n\nChari\u2019s new acquisition\n\nImproving customer experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the most memorable customer service experience you\u2019ve had? It could be a good or a bad one, but trust me when I say that the bad ones outnumber the good ones, at least for me.\n\nThe most recent experience I had was on Wednesday. I wanted to buy plantain, so I inquired about the price due to its size. \u201cOmo,\u201d I said after hearing the price. \u201cThese plantains aren\u2019t good for this price\u2026\u201d I wasn\u2019t even done when the vendor cut me short, saying, \u201cGo and buy it elsewhere if it\u2019s too small.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not surprised, right? What exactly did I say to deserve that? I was indirectly expressing my dismay about the country\u2019s economic situation, and she responded in that manner? I didn\u2019t even think twice; I left for somewhere else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou might not have experienced this with roadside vendors, but you may have had similar dealings with telcos, retailers, or big corporations, ranging from a long wait time to being treated rudely or simply haven\u2019t been shown empathy.\n\nCustomer experience \u2013 the feeling or memory that a customer or prospective customer has whenever they come in contact with a business \u2013 is dependent on a company\u2019s customer service.\n\nSo, how can customer experience be enhanced? Apart from demonstrating empathy or helping employees understand customers aren\u2019t angry or frustrated with them, but with the product or service, you can use tools to help improve this experience. And that is exactly what MyServiceAgent does for businesses.\n\nMyServiceAgent is a technology company offering a variety of tools to businesses to improve the customer experience. Chimgozirim walks us through what they do and how the company uses AI to help companies to improve their customer experience.\n\nPlease read it here: Built in response to COVID-19, MyServiceAgent now helps businesses improve customer experience with AI\n\nMTN in the metaverse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s no news that African telecom, MTN, has joined the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Shopify in betting big on the metaverse by purchasing 144 plots of land in Africarare, South Africa\u2019s first metaverse.\n\nWhat exactly is the Metaverse? The concept of a metaverse is not new. It was first described in the novel Snow Crash, published in 1992. Several companies later created online communities based on the concept, the most notable was Second Life, which debuted in 2003.\n\nAccording to Investopedia, it is a digital reality that combines aspects of social media, online gaming, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and cryptocurrencies to allow users to interact virtually.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means the metaverse is a shared virtual world that people can access via the Internet. In other words, it is a virtual world in which people can live, work, shop, and interact with others from the comfort of their room in the real world.\n\nIn the metaverse, technologies VR and AR are combined to create a sense of \u201cvirtual presence.\u201d\n\nAlso, the term \u201cmetaverse\u201d did not become popular until Facebook changed its corporate name to Meta in October 2021. At the time, the company announced plans to invest $10 billion over the next year to realise its vision of the metaverse.\n\nThe big question is, why did MTN decide to join the Metaverse? Is it to follow a trend, improve customers\u2019 digital experiences, or what?

Approximately 50,000 merchants use the platform for credit and bookkeeping services. It allows these businesses to manage the credit they extend to their customers.\n\nYesterday, the company announced that it had acquired Axa Credit, the credit branch of Axa Assurance Maroc, for $22 million.\n\nWhat does Chari do? Chari is a mobile app that allows small retailers in Morocco and Tunisia to order products from Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) multinationals and local manufacturers and receive them in less than 24 hours. It was founded in 2020 by Ismael Belkhayat (CEO) and Sophia Alj (Co-founder).\n\nThe acquisition of Axa Credit will provide Chari with the credit licence required to begin lending to its FMCG B2B clients, who will then lend money to their consumer clients.\n\nChari believes that shop owners understand their customers\u2019 spending habits, where they live, and when and how they are paid, and thus can perform the credit risk assessment that a traditional bank cannot.\n\nThe company intends to charge merchants a setup fee and low-interest rates as it gains more users.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nHow to Make \u2018Friends\u2019 with Anxiety: A Simple Technique to Gain Perspective.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the fintech space, phrases like \u201cfinancial inclusion\u201d and \u201cbanking the unbanked\u201d have become so prevalent that they\u2019ve almost certainly become buzzwords. Sometimes, it appears that a fintech startup claiming to be the latest saviour is born every second.\n\nThis is hardly surprising considering the proliferation of fintech startups in Nigeria\u2019s tech ecosystem and the largely unsolved problem of the unbanked. According to the Enhancing Financial Innovation Access\u2019 (EFInA), Access to Financial Services in Nigeria 2020 Survey (a2f) (PDF), the country\u2019s financial exclusion rate is 35.9% \u2014 one of the highest in Africa.\n\nThat leaves almost 54% unbanked. Considering the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) plan to increase that number to 94% by 2024, there\u2019s still quite a bit to be done. And the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) has recently thrown its hat in this ring.\n\nIn January 2022, NIPOST unveiled its new agency banking platform at a ceremony in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja. The platform comes with a free debit card that works offline and online and is available at all NIPOST outlets in Nigeria\u2019s 774 local governments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, the agency banking platform would follow the Universal Postal Union\u2019s (UPU) standards on financial inclusion. He also said that this is part of the government\u2019s plan to digitise the postal services and improve financial inclusion in the country.\n\nHow would this work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy UPU standards, NIPOST\u2019s agency banking platform should provide essential services like savings, payments, money transfers, insurance, and credit. However, it appears the platform would work much like a multi-teller PoS-based service, so the exact mechanics of how NIPOST hopes to serve its customers are a bit sketchy.\n\nTechpoint Africa sent a mail to the Postmaster General\u2019s office but received no reply and a visit to the NIPOST headquarters in Ile-Ife, Osun State, revealed that not much is known about the platform yet other than its March expected launch date.\n\nHowever, NIPOST is licensed by the CBN as a super agent and, by CBN guidelines, cannot provide insurance or credit facilities.\n\nAccording to Pantami, the free debit card would use biometric authentication.\n\nIn Africa, South Africa-based fintech, Paycode, provides biometric debit cards, which the company says are operational in several countries, including Namibia, Botswana, Nigeria, and Mozambique. In Namibia, Paycode works with the Namibia Post Ltd (NamPost).\n\nA biometric debit card uses the owner\u2019s fingerprints to authenticate transactions, ensuring additional security and ease of use by the uneducated, thus making it suitable for financial inclusion, especially in rural areas.\n\nThis also means the card can be used offline. For example, Paycode says anyone with access to its API can verify users biometrically without connecting to the Internet. ExtoLabs, a California-based software company with plans to launch in Africa, uses a Bluetooth connection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn unknown player\n\nInterestingly, NIPOST did not mention a partnership with any fintech company to deliver this card. However, pictures of the ceremony in Abuja reveal a name \u2014 GingrPay \u2014 etched on the demo cards.\n\nA Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) search uncovered a company named GingrPay Nigeria Limited incorporated on May 18, 2021. A Google search led to a third party website with more info like directors, shareholders, persons with significant control, and companies where GingrPay company officers show up as directors or shareholders.\n\nThe website cites GingrPay\u2019s activity description as \u201cTo facilitate electronic circulation of money as well as the exchange of value between individuals and organisations on a timely and consistent basis using technological softwares.\u201d\n\nA search on the CBN website does not turn up any licence registered to the company name.\n\nVisiting other nations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, postal services are no strangers to providing financial services. In Brazil, Correios, the state-owned postal company, operates the Banco Postal in partnership with Banco do Brasil, providing banking services to the unbanked.\n\nIn India, the India Post Payments Bank is a subsidiary of the India Post and has been in operation since September 2018, serving over four crore \u2014 40 million \u2014 customers. Initially, because the India Post appeared to be haemorrhaging money, there was some resistance to the initiative.\n\nOn the continent, in Ghana, the Ghana Post provides various financial services like agency banking in partnership with banks, insurance, and GhPostPay, which enables users to make online transactions. Remittance services are currently suspended.\n\nIn the Benin Republic, government-owned Le poste du B\u00e9nin enables customers to have both savings and current accounts, and provides credit facilities, insurance, and remittance.\n\nNamibia\u2019s NamPost gives customers access to a funeral cover and a savings bank that provides investment products, and save-as-you-earn accounts, among other things.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, postal services are used by significantly poorer persons, older, less educated, and people less likely to be employed than those who have an account at a financial institution or both a financial institution and the post office.\n\nLogically, it follows that postal institutions are essential to fostering financial inclusion.\n\nThe financial inclusion play\n\nNIPOST has made several attempts in this arena.\n\nIn 2017, it signed a partnership agreement with Nigerian fintech startup, Paga, to improve financial inclusion.\n\nOn a call with Techpoint Africa, Arike Okunowo, General Manager, Sales and Distribution, explained that the partnership broke down after a few months because there were some issues surrounding the staffing needed to successfully run the business.\n\nThe partnership saw Paga provide the platform, which NIPOST\u2019s workers manned. But Okunowo explained that the staff already had primary assignments and this created conflict.\n\nAs she told Techpoint Africa, \u201cIf you want to run financial services, you need some level of focus so that if the customer comes in, you are always available to attend to them.\u201d\n\nShe also said that NIPOST was very keen on having its staff man the platform with no third-party interference. However, she also said that they would be open to a possible partnership with the postal company in the future.\n\nOn its financial services page, the postal service company says it provides domestic transfers, international remittance, agency banking \u2013 this appears to have been on the page since April 23, 2021 \u2013 and mobile money services.\n\nNIPOST owns an International Money Transfer Operators (IMTO) licence and says it has partnered with companies like Western Union.\n\nA visit to the NIPOST headquarters in Ile-Ife, Osun State, revealed that the agency no longer carries out any of these services and doesn\u2019t seem to have done so for a while, an offshoot of Pantami\u2019s decision in 2019, which saw the agency adopt a cashless policy. All cash transactions, including remittance, are to be done in a banking hall.\n\nThere are also plans to create a microfinance bank.\n\nWhat industry players are saying\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkunowo believed NIPOST\u2019s infrastructure makes it a good centrepoint as a shared resource.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say NIPOST should actually be a shared resource for all the providers because of its infrastructure, and because it\u2019s such a major part of the Nigerian state.\u201d\n\nWhile Edidiong Uwemakpan, Director, Brand and Corporate Communications, TeamApt, believed the decision is commendable, she worried about fraud.\n\n\u201cWhere I begin to find challenges is that you were trying to eliminate cash. Now, part of agency banking is, of course, bill payments, and that makes sense. But then the cash in, cash out part of things, that\u2019s where I don\u2019t really see how they plan to do it.\n\n\u201cBecause, are you going to be giving your NIPOST workers a float so that they can give people cash? And you were already trying to eliminate cash in the past because of fraud.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that NIPOST appears not to have partnered with well-known fintechs. And while Okunowo could not confirm if NIPOST had approached Paga, Uwemakpan said TeamApt did not receive any communication from the postal agency.\n\nHowever, though Uwemakpan believed that the market is big enough to contain everyone, she raises concerns regarding the number of outlets NIPOST has \u2013 3,000 \u2013 and whether this would be enough to serve customers. She said NIPOST might need to expand its reach to compete.\n\nOne thing Okunowo and Uwemakpan agreed on is that this endeavour requires quite a lot of investment by NIPOST.\n\nA digital economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, the Federal Government of Nigeria announced a three-year modernisation plan for NIPOST. By 2020, the postal agency was to have been unbundled into six subsidiaries: NIPOST Banking and Insurance Company; NIPOST Property and Development Company; NIPOST Transport and Logistics Services Company; NIPOST E-government Services Company; and NIPOST E-commerce Services Company.\n\nIn January 2022, speaking at a media parley held in Abuja, Dr Ismail Adewusi, Postmaster General and CEO of NIPOST, said that NIPOST was to be unbundled once more, this time, in three places: NIPOST Properties and Development Company; NIPOST Transport and Logistics Company; and NIPOST Microfinance Bank Limited.\n\nHe also said the unbundling would be done before the end of January 2022. However, there has been no announcement to that effect.\n\nThe NIPOST Act is still in the process of being repealed, and the Nigerian Postal Service (Repeal and Reenactment) Act 2021, passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives in 2021, is currently awaiting assent by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nWhen assented to, this means that NIPOST can be unbundled into whatever subsidiaries it sees fit and would hold regulatory powers, making the Postal Agency a Commission.\n\nNIPOST has also partnered with several private companies on its path to full digitisation. In December 2021, it announced an agreement with Egyptian startup, eGATE to create an app that automates last-mile delivery. Customers will be able to track communication with drivers and monitor their delivery.\n\nIn 2018, NIPOST introduced its Address Verification System and Digital Address System. Both were done in collaboration with identity verification startup, Youverify, to improve mail delivery and resolve addressing issues, but the link to the website leads to a dummy page.\n\nHowever, interestingly, there are plans to launch a digital postal code system that is expected to solve the same problem before the end of the first quarter of 2022.\n\nWhat next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the surface level, NIPOST does seem to have a lot planned that should benefit the average citizen, but implementation and consistency appear to be lacking.\n\nTo pull off its latest scheme, it might require an overhaul of its entire processes \u2013 like its unbundling, for instance. But these are still early days, and there is much that can still happen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "title": "How Nigeria\u2019s five big banks navigated regulatory fees in 2021",
          "text": "From afar, the Nigerian banking industry seems very competitive, but when the financial statements of each bank are examined, double figures running into millions separate them.\n\nIn return for their heavy investments, banks and shareholders expect to make a profit. From the audited and reported financials, the profitability of Nigerian banks is not in doubt.\n\nBeyond profitability, there are also regulatory concerns.\n\nFindings by BusinessDay showed lenders currently pay a charge of 0.5 percent of assets to the fund which is controlled by Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) and used to help pay down liabilities incurred from acquiring about 12,537 Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) worth N1.7 trillion from 22 financial institutions, following the 2009 banking crisis.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2021, Nigeria\u2019s largest banks which include First Bank of Nigeria (FBN), United Bank of Nigeria (UBA), Guaranty Trust Holdings (GTCO), Access Bank, Zenith Bank, paid N175.03 billion as AMCON levy, 15.69 percent higher than N151.28 billion incurred the previous year, the highest in seven years.\n\n\u201cThe effect of the levy, was on- and- off-balance sheet assets were charged, was such that big banks ended up paying significantly more overtime to clean up the banking system, which sounded fair at the time because the bigger banks stood to benefit more from having a safer banking system,\u201d according to Adesoji Solanke, Director, Frontier and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) banks, Research analyst, Renaissance Capital.\n\n\u201cIt was however appropriate to give the AMCON levy a finite life to avoid moral hazards and fiscal risks,\u201d he added.\n\nSince the AMCON levy is equal to 0.5 percent of total assets, banks are increasingly contributing a larger percentage of their income to the AMCON fund as total assets grow.\n\nAyo Ebo, Economist/Head, Research & Strategy, Greenwich Merchant Bank believes bank\u2019s regulatory fees have outlived its usefulness and should be reviewed.\n\nHe said, \u201cAlthough the AMCON levy is significant, it needs to be reviewed because the levy increases as the assets of banks grow which would impact their profitability.\u201d\n\nBecause banks factor in regulatory costs when establishing the rate at which they will lend money to their customers, the regulatory cost leads to a higher lending rate.\n\nAccording to Ebo, \u201cBanks factor the statutory cost before determining the rate at which to give out loans. So, an increase in regulatory costs leads to an increase in lending.\u201d\n\n\u201cStopping the levy would mean a reduction in lending rates,\u201d he added.\n\nThe largest Banks\u2019 in the first nine months of 2021 incurred N645.99 billion as operating expenses, 14.28 percent higher than N753.62 billion incurred in the full year 2020.\n\nFurther analysis by BusinessDay shows that regulatory costs took a higher percentage of their operating expenses compared to the other expenses in the same segment.\n\nThe banks recorded a net profit margin of 161.11 percent in the first nine months of 2021 despite the increased regulatory fee incurred in that period. This is compared to the net profit margin of 134.71 recorded collectively in the full year 2020.\n\nAMCON was set up by the Federal Government in 2010 with a 10-year mandate due to the rising bad loans and the need to save the banking industry from imminent collapse. However, it was amended in 2019 to end in 2023, to further enable banks to track debtors that are able but unwilling or refusing to pay amongst other additional benefits.\n\nBanks already have to contend with other regulatory fees such as the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) which is a specified minimum fraction of the total deposits of customers that commercial banks have to hold as reserves either in cash or as deposits with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). This was increased from 22.5 percent to 27.5 percent in January 2020, one of the highest in the world.\n\nSolanke said, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen significant lending to the Federal Government of Nigeria by the Central Bank of Nigeria, funded by Nigerian banks\u2019 naira deposits taken via the CRR. Nigerian banks have probably the highest CRR in the world, and are operating under some of the most difficult regulatory conditions.\u201d\n\nAnalysis by BusinessDay shows that in ascending order, FBN Holdings, followed by Access Bank, Zenith Bank, UBA, and GT Holdings Company are the tier-1 banks charged with the highest AMCON levy.\n\nIn the period under review, First Bank of Nigeria, one of Nigeria\u2019s biggest banks, incurred the highest regulatory cost of N45.89 billion, 2.89 percent higher than N44.56 billion incurred in 2020. This is 35.41 percent of the Bank\u2019s operating expenses totalling N129.57 billion.\n\nThe net profit margin is one of the efficiency ratios used to gauge an organisation\u2019s efficiency. It is a financial ratio used to calculate the percentage of profit a company produces from its total revenue.\n\nFirst Bank, in its first nine months of 2021, recorded a net profit margin of 9.55 percent compared to 17.06 percent recorded in 2020.\n\nRead also: Here are banks that offer loans without collateral\n\nLikewise, Access Bank incurred an increase in regulatory cost by 14.6 percent to N41.51 billion in the first nine months of 2021 compared to N35.44 billion incurred in the previous year. This cost sapped 21.98 percent of its operating expenses which totalled N188.89 billion.\n\nThe largest lending company by total assets recorded a profit margin of 17.59 percent in the first nine months of 2021-despite the increased AMCON levy-this is higher than 13.86 percent recorded in the full year 2020.\n\nZenith Bank, the most capitalised bank saw regulation fee increase by 18.38 percent to N37.92 billion in the nine months of 2021 from N30.95 billion last year. This is 27.69 percent of N136.95 billion incurred as operating expenses.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2021, the biggest bank by market capitalization recorded a net profit margin of 30.96 percent, compared to 33.11 percent recorded in the previous year.\n\nUnited Bank for Africa (UBA), the pan African Bank saw an increase in regulatory cost by 20.28 percent to N27.82 billion compared to N23.13 billion in the previous year. Out of the N123.22 billion incurred as operating expenses, 22.58 billion was spent on regulatory costs.\n\nUBA recorded a profit margin of 17.59 percent in the first nine months of 2021, higher than 13.86 percent recorded in 2020.\n\nGTCO incurred an increase in regulatory cost by 27.27 percent to N21.89 billion in the period under review from N17.2 billion the previous year.\n\nThe second most capitalised bank spent 32 percent of its operating expenses, N67.36 billion on regulatory costs.\n\nThe Bank recorded a net profit margin of 72.57 percent, the highest amongst the other banks, compared to 44.25 percent recorded in the last year.\n\n\u201cSo when you see any Nigerian bank delivering 20% return on equity despite CRR, low-interest rates and AMCON levy still in place, those returns could easily be 50% higher under somewhat normalised circumstances,\u201d Solanke said.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s quest to keep its citizens addicted to cheap petrol is causing more pain than gain as the country\u2019s daily subsidy hits N10.1 billion, findings by BusinessDay shows.\n\nWhile other oil-dependent economies rake in billions of dollars due to soaring oil prices, Africa\u2019s biggest oil-producing country finds itself in a rattrap situation.\n\nAccording to an exclusive petroleum pricing template, Nigeria\u2019s landing cost of petrol rose by 18 percent to N333.09per litre on February 25 using the official exchange rate of $416.46 and 1,341 litres per metric tonnes.\n\nWith daily petrol consumption put at about 60 million litres by the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and a subsidy of N168.87 per litre, the above development means Nigeria\u2019s daily subsidy amounts to over N10.1 billion as the pump price of the product remains steady at N162-N165 per litre.\n\n\u201cWith rising oil prices, Nigeria\u2019s current petrol subsidy is very enormous and is hitting Nigeria\u2019s crude income very deeply,\u201d the National Operations Controller of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association Nigeria (IPMAN), Mike Osatuyi told BusinessDay.\n\nThe international oil benchmark, Brent crude, the gauge of Nigeria\u2019s crude, jumped to $118 per barrel on Friday from $77.24 per barrel on December 31, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe current market reality shows Nigeria pays about N17 billion daily on petrol subsidy,\u201d Osatuyi lamented.\n\nCheta Nwanze , a partner at SBM Intelligence, an Africa-focused geopolitical firm with extensive research network spread across Nigeria, predicts Nigeria\u2019s 2022 subsidy spend would be the highest on record, surpassing the former administration\u2019s records.\n\nRead also: Subsidy must end for Nigeria to stop crude oil theft, fuel scarcity -Orji\n\n\u201cNigeria is in a deeper financial hole than it has ever been, and the only thing the government has done is to dig even deeper,\u201d Nwanze said.\n\nAn analysis of data collated by BusinessDay showed that without subsidy, petrol would be selling for about N333.099 per litre as of February 25.\n\nFurther analysis of the petroleum pricing template showed the cost of petrol quoted on Platts stood at $918.75 per metric tonne (N285.33 per litre, using the I&E rate of N416.33/$1) on February 25 2022 from $754.75 per MT on December 31, 2021, with a freight cost of $26.77 per MT (N8.31 per litre).\n\nOther cost elements that make up the landing cost include lightering expenses (N4.81), Nigerian Ports Authority charge (N2.49), Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency charge (N0.23), jetty throughput charge (N1.61), storage charge (N2.58), and financing (N2.17).\n\nThe pump price is the sum of the landing cost, wholesaler margin (N4.03), admin charge (N1.23), transporters allowance (N3.89), bridging fund (N7.51), marine transport average (N0.15), and retailer margin (N6.19).\n\n\u201cBefore the end of 2022, Nigeria\u2019s petrol subsidy will hit N6 trillion,\u201d Kelvin Atafiri who runs Cavazzani Human Capital Limited, an investment firm exposed to the oil and gas sector, said.\n\nThe above development means the ability of Nigeria\u2019s three tiers of government to meet their various 2021 obligations is also under more risk as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) says it expended N210.38 billion on petrol subsidy in January 2022.\n\nAccording to NNPC\u2019s latest presentation at Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) meeting, the shortfall included a December 2021 value of PMS shortfall of N176.48 billion plus the outstanding value shortfall recovery of N33.90 billion accrued over 2021.\n\nThe oil firm said it would deduct N242.5 billion (about N143.7 billion for January 2022 recovery and November spot arrears of N98.8 billion) during next month\u2019s FAAC meeting.\n\nFurther checks showed that NNPC did not remit any money to the FAAC for onward distribution to the federating units \u2013- an action that may lead to state governments\u2019 inability to pay salaries.\n\nFindings by BusinessDay showed FAAC allocation declined by 17 percent to N574.668 billion in January 2022.\n\n\u201cSubsidy payment is a gorilla that has swallowed Nigeria\u2019s economy and has led to the collapse of education institutions, road infrastructures and health facilities,\u201d Wumi Iledare, a professor of economics and former president of Nigerian Association for Energy Economics (NAEE).",

          "text": "\u201cSpeak to yourself like the leader of a victorious army would return to his battalion, and you will see yourself succeed\u201d Bukola Ewediaro Group Head Corporate Services VFD Group\n\nBukola is a Human Resource Professional, Certified Trainer, Brand and Perception Professional with over 19 years of work experience across Human Resource Consulting, Employees Learning & Development, Customer Service Management, Brand Management, Quality Control, and Internal Audit Management. She started her career at Marina International Bank (Now Access Bank Plc) as the lead Customer Service Team.\n\nShe proceeded to the Internal Audit function of the Bank, ensuring 100% compliance with regulatory, statutory reports. Her career progression led her to XL Management Services as the Lead of the Quality Control Team. It was also drafted into a strategic committee that defined the Brand\u2019s quality vision. She moved to First City Monument Bank as Team Lead Service Management, managing over 20 branches by facilitating training on excellent service, monitoring customer experience at the various branches, and was the key person responsible for the design of the first Service Level Agreement(SLA) policies of the bank then veered into the Brand Management of the Bank in various roles but majorly as the Internal Communications key officer responsible for information dissemination with the creative expression of the bank\u2019s vision, mission & Strategic Objectives, Championing Culture Transformation Road Shows with the management to all the regions (North, South, East & West) of the bank.\n\nAs a firm believer in Social Responsibility, this made her adopt a Girl\u2019s Secondary School to help them navigate into adulthood with the appropriate decision-making tools & workshops. She is an Associate of the Institute of Chartered Accountant of Nigeria(ICAN) with a Training Certification from the University of Central Missouri USA, A Certified Life Coach from NCFE UK, and has facilitated over 30 trainings.\n\nIn this interview with Lehle Balde, she tells us a little more about what it took to become the woman she is today.\n\nIn what ways have you broken the bias in your career?\n\nI know there are biases in women in Leadership; however, I forge ahead because I am fully aware of my strengths and skills and, as we commonly say, \u201cwhat I bring to the table.\u201d So, I drown the noise and show up for my assignments; I lead with conviction, I believe I am firm but fair, and I hope posterity will indeed be kind.\n\nRead also: Heritage Bank, NGO position women for wealth creation\n\nWho inspires you?\n\nI get inspiration from the values I perceive from different people. These values are: authenticity, humility, boldness, gracefulness, and graciousness are some of the traits I admire and have seen in both notable people and the not so obvious so that I won\u2019t narrow my admiration to one person, but if I must mention names, Michelle Obama for her gracefulness as the First Lady of USA, Mrs. Bukola Smith, MD of FSDH for her humility, Chimamanda Adiche for her authenticity, Ceracerni a young muralist who tells her mural journey so beautifully with the courage she takes on challenges, the list is endless,\n\nWhat has been the most challenging aspect of your career, and how have you overcome it?\n\nOvercoming imposter syndrome whenever I take on a new phase in my career journey or even embark on personal business. Imposter syndrome is genuine, and many people experience it.\n\nWhat have you learned about leading an organization to success as a corporate service professional?\n\nYou have the courage of conviction whenever you must navigate a decision, believing in the gifts and talents. You also have to drive the vision passionately. Similarly, it means you must know that there will never be a perfect scenario with perfect cases, so you must keep striving and keep finetuning the process as you go along.\n\nWhy is it essential to invest in young girls?\n\nFacts have revealed that having women in leadership positions positively affects the balance sheet. Also, the pandemic showed that countries led by women had fewer fatalities because the women in leadership reacted faster to the pandemic than their male counterparts. Perhaps our psychological makeup accounts for this; with these facts, it\u2019s essential to invest in women to attain the highest office to take on the challenge to improve the economic and social lives of the populace.\n\nWhat advice do you have for your women looking to work in corporate services?\n\nYou should do It! It would help if you did an assessment that assessed your personality scientifically to determine your strengths and areas of improvement, then open yourself to opportunities along the path, horn your skills with continuous education both formally and informally.\n\nIf you could tell your 16-year-old self-something, what would you say?\n\nBe very intentional about what you say to yourself. Speak to yourself like the leader of a victorious army would return to his battalion, and you will see yourself succeed. Also, open yourself to new opportunities and take on challenges, i.e., have a growth mindset that is willing to try things, learn, travel, invest, cry if you must, be human, and most importantly, we are all trying to figure out the journey.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said his administration will partner the federal government on the management of the Okomu National Park, to revitalize the park and strengthen security in the area.\n\nObaseki disclosed this on Thursday while addressing the Conservator of the Okomu National Park, Mr. Augustine Obekpa, when he visited the park in Udo Community, Ovia South-West Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe governor also stated plans to send a forestry bill to the Edo State House of Assembly for consideration to bolster efforts at protecting the state\u2019s forest reserves.\n\nHe noted, \u201cWe are going to be sending a forestry bill to the Edo State House of Assembly for consideration next week. We will make sure that we expand the law beyond forestry assets to also cover the natural assets found around the forest.\n\n\u201cWe want to collaborate with the National Park Service. I will visit the Minister of Environment to offer her a certain proposal to allow the Edo State Government to jointly manage the park with the federal government because this is our resource.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cWith that collaboration, it means that we would put in more resources. We would like to increase the number of rangers and park officers to protect not only this park but some other reserves that are around us here, particularly the Okumo Reserve and the Gelegele Reserve.\n\n\u201cWe will pay for the new hires under such an arrangement. We will upgrade your training, as well as provide more facilities and amenities for the park.\n\n\u201cNobody will come here if they don\u2019t feel secure and safe. This does not apply only to the park and the resources around this area, but it is important for people to know that they are secured when they come in to enjoy nature.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will make sure that we improve the security of this park and expose the beauty and ecotourism opportunities of the park,\u201d he added.\n\nObaseki further stated, \u201cWe have been hearing of nefarious activities of criminal elements, both in the park and the forest reserve, and also the Okomu Oil Palm Company. Today, we are on a fact finding visit to examine what exactly is going on in the park.\n\n\u201cWe have to find out the number of attacks, where the attacks are coming from and see how the state government can come in and collaborate effectively with the park using the full security system in the state to deal with the security challenges that we have here.\n\n\u201cGovernment will not just sit back and allow the kind of criminality that we are seeing in this area. Our worry is that if we don\u2019t confront them now, it will get out of hand.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping to get the full report from you and to understand clearly how the criminals are operating. We saw a truck outside the premises which I believe was recently seized with high quality wood.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know how expensive these items are. Our concern is that these criminals come in, log illegally and take the logs out, sell them and procure more arms and come in to occupy the territory,\u201d Obaseki noted.\n\nIn his remarks, the Conservator of the Okomu National Park said the park is home to white-throated monkeys, Buffalo and Elephants, noting that farming, hunting and illegal logging was affecting the natural habitats of the animals.\n\nObekpa appealed to the governor for logistics support to enable them to effectively protect the forest assets.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

We are engaging with investors in plantation agriculture so that a good cache of our forests is protected and preserved, even as they go about their businesses in a sustainable manner.\n\n\u201cWe are in partnership with stakeholders, including the Nigerian Air Force and other security agencies to preserve our forest reserve, particularly the Okomu Forest Area against criminals. This will prove critical in protecting elephants and other endangered animals in the forest. We will continue to explore even better channels to protect our endangered wildlife assets,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to the UN, \u201cWorld Wildlife Day is an opportunity to celebrate the many beautiful and varied forms of wild fauna and flora and to raise awareness of the multitude of benefits that their conservation provides to people. At the same time, the Day reminds us of the urgent need to step up the fight against wildlife crime and human-induced reduction of species, which have wide-ranging economic, environmental and social impacts.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

(It allows Nigerian men\u2019s foreign-born wives to be awarded automatic citizenship); Deny Nigerian women indigeneity through marriage; Deny 35 per cent appointed positions for women and settling for 20 per cent; Deny women affirmative action in party administration and leadership; and Deny specific seats for women in the National Assembly, among others.\u201d\n\nHe noted: \u201cIn Edo State, we have a healthy mix of women in our cabinet, as they occupy more than 30 percent of positions of commissioners and Special Advisers in government. They provide invaluable service to ensure the proper functioning of the engine of government. At the senior cadre of the civil and public service, women make up more than 50 percent of the Permanent Secretaries, which provides them with ample opportunity to serve the people. Our experience has proven that women bring a rare knack of commitment and sense of service to drive change and engender progress like never before seen in the civil service.\n\n\u201cEdo people hope that their own representatives at the National Assembly did not vote along the lines of disenfranchising their women population because to do so will mean that they do not care about those who sent them to represent them at the Assembly.\n\nStressing that the Assembly missed a golden chance, he said: \u201cIt is heartbreaking that the National Assembly members missed a golden opportunity to redesign Nigeria\u2019s political landscape by enshrining landmark legislation that promotes inclusion and provides women with the legal backing to gain equitable representation at the apex level of lawmaking and political participation.\n\n\u201cOur administration has continued to provide women with the opportunity to take up important roles in governance and they have proven to be excellent managers of human and material resources.\u201d\n\n\u201cI, therefore, lend my voice in calling on the National Assembly to reconsider its decision and take proactive and affirmative action in providing more opportunities for women to participate in politics, governance and all spheres of human endeavour,\u201d he stressed.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "How We Escaped Intense Bombings, Death In Ukraine-Russia War \u2013 Nigerians",
          "text": "Nigerians who escaped Russia\u2019s ongoing military offensive in Ukraine arrived in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital, on Friday, narrating how they escaped the intense bombings and missiles fired by Russia\u2019s military forces.\n\nThe war, which has led to the death of hundreds of civilians and troops, leaving thousands injured and many more displaced, has seen millions of foreign nationals fleeing Ukraine for neighbouring countries.\n\nAs of Friday night, no fewer than 775 Nigerians had been flown back to the country. The first batch comprising 415 persons arrived from Romania in the morning while the second batch, comprising 180, arrived from Poland at about 6:30 pm. Another 180 arrived in the third batch. They were all received at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. One more batch was being expected from Hungary and Poland as of the time of filing this report.\n\nSome of the returnees who fled Ukraine to Romania told Saturday PUNCH how they were able to escape the invasion. Despite appeals for diplomacy and the heavy sanctions imposed by other countries, the European Union and other allies, the Russian forces, under the strict orders of President Vladimir Putin, have continued to launch bombs and missiles into different parts of Ukraine, the second largest city in Europe.\n\nAnuoluwakintan Olawoye, a 300-level medical student at the University of Ternopil, said apart from the racial discrimination, she starved, trekked and stood for long hours. She noted that the reports of the invasion and bombs going off in different parts of the country were enough to plant fears in anybody, but that she was happy she was able to escape.\n\nShe said, \u201cI do not wish my enemy what I went through, even though mine was not as bad as others\u2019. There was a curfew, we starved because there was nothing to buy, no store opened and sirens blared every time! No taxis to move from one place to another. We had to trek for hours. The city was becoming vacant. We couldn\u2019t sleep knowing that the country was at war.\n\n\u201cOn Thursday morning, there was a bombing in Kyiv but thankfully I was in Ternopil so I escaped. Again on Friday, some parts of Lviv were bombed; Lviv is two hours journey away from Ternopil.\u201d\n\nOlawoye said she made for the Romanian border after trekking for hours but on getting there, she found that preference was given to Ukrainian citizens.\n\nShe added, \u201cWe got to the border around 4 pm and we were told to wait. We waited till 8 pm and they didn\u2019t allow us (blacks) to go inside. We attempted to make a move when they called on women and children and they turned us back. They only allowed their citizens to go. It was two hours after they left that they said they would come back to us.\n\n\u201cWe pleaded with the officers that the snow was much outside, I was shivering as a result but they did nothing. I crossed about 2 am and it was by luck. Some were not that lucky. The racism that I encountered at the Ukrainian border was not for the weak. They were pushing us aside just to allow their trucks to move. They shouted at us, pushed us and did all sorts.\u201d\n\nOlawoye, however, said she was treated very well in Romania, noting that she would be proceeding to meet her parents. She added that she would love to return to Ukraine to complete her studies once the war ends.\n\nAlso, Abraham Praise said she never believed she could experience such in her lifetime, especially with the bombs and missiles that had killed both troops and civilians in different parts of the country.\n\nShe said, \u201cI trekked for three hours non-stop. I had friends who trekked for more hours. You just had to forget you have legs while you keep going. The thought of you keeping yourself alive would keep you going. Some people fainted along the road. The stronger ones among us had to give them support. I never thought I would have to experience something like this.\u201d\n\nAbraham called on the government to assist evacuees with therapy to get over the experience, saying people who survived war, no matter how distant, needed some counselling.\n\nShe said, \u201cEveryone who has gone through this experience needs therapy. Although we are a strong people, to have made it out alive and be able to see your friends and families is exciting. For some of us, the future is still uncertain because of the disruption in our academics. I am in my third year while some others are in their final year and are meant to graduate in June.\u201d\n\nPraise added, \u201cAlthough I am happy I would be seeing my family, this is not just the way I wanted it. But there is still life and there\u2019s hope. If this is where we would have to start from to move ahead, we are ready.\u201d\n\nRabia Zalka who was in Ukraine with her sister said she didn\u2019t know if she would survive, but that to have made it back to Nigeria alive despite the invasion, rising tension, the bombing of cities and even the capture of the Nuclear plant by the Russians, meant a lot to them.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was really serious until my sister and I walked a long distance to the Romanian border. I trekked for hours. It was not easy. We were keeping an eye on each other and helping each other,\u201d said Zalka.\n\nAnother returnee, Peter Ajuwon, said the Ukraine war should serve as a lesson to Nigerians on the importance of peace.\n\nHe said, \u201cWar is not a favourable situation. Every aspect of life gets affected. I encourage people to embrace peace in Nigeria. Our experiences crossing the border to Romania were not pleasant. Getting to Romania was hell, but we had a pleasant experience in Romania. We got a lot of support from the Romanian government and the Nigerian Ambassador there. Some Romanian NGOs showed us love too; they didn\u2019t discriminate.\u201d\n\nSome of the parents and relatives who came to receive them were visibly elated seeing their children alive. Some of them had kept vigil at the airport, awaiting the return of their children.\n\nOther parents whose children had yet to arrive were seen lurking around and anxiously waiting for their children\u2019s return.\n\nMrs Zalka whose two daughters were among the first batch said she was happy to have her daughters back in the country. She told our correspondent she could not eat, she cried almost every day and prayed for the safe return of her daughters who were schooling in Ukraine.\n\nZalka said, \u201cWe thank God they are back with us. I was not eating, I cried almost every day and prayed fervently while they were away. I don\u2019t have anything to say but to thank God.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the next plans for her daughters, she told our correspondent that she would enrol them in another school in Nigeria.\n\nShe said, \u201cI have secured admission for them in the country, so by next month they should be back in school. There are a lot of universities looking for students, particularly those from Ukraine.\u201d",

After days, which turned into weeks of grandstanding, we were able to meet with our client- Onyendu Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cIn his unshaken/undeterred resolve, Onyendu was in high spirits as he took time to explain why he protested against the denial of access to his lawyers during the last three successive visits.\n\n\u201cHe was deeply troubled with those incidents, particularly when it was done in flagrant disregard and violation of extant orders of the court. We understood Onyendu\u2019s grouse and seized the opportunity to intimate him of the measures we have taken so far to ensure that such ugly incident does not reoccur.\n\n\u201cOnyendu used the opportunity to offer advice and words of encouragement, particularly to myself. He took his time to urge me to remain resolute and focused, and never to be distracted by the deliberate evil ploys of the enemies to break me.\n\n\u201cIndeed, Onyendu saw tomorrow! Unknown to him that at the time he was handing down these words of encouragement and encomium, the slander mongers were hurriedly putting together another stunt which, was, however, dead on arrival.\n\n\u201cOnyendu particularly encouraged me to be strong and even stronger in the coming days. He said that I should expect more and more slander, but I should be assured that he and Umuchineke will always be there for me.\n\n\u201cWe all agreed that this is a very critical period as victory is staring on our faces and, any opportunity offered to be distracted will take us back because the enemies are united in their resolve but their evil plots are all surmountable.\n\n\u201cAs for me, I am firm and solid any day any time. I remain firm like the rock of Gibraltar! Forward ever and backward never. On a lighter note, Onyendu requested his visiting team to make out time to hang out and enjoy some bottles of drinks.\n\n\u201cIn summary, Onyendu is in a very strong and firm spirit now than before. He implores all his followers and Umuchineke to remain undivided, resolute, and unshaken in their resolve for victory.\n\n\u201cOnyendu assures everyone that he will come out victorious and stronger. He commended his supporters and Umuchineke, and urged you to remain prayerful and continue to be peaceful in your conduct as you have always demonstrated over time. Onyendu is profoundly proud of you all.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate you all, Umuchineke, for your support and perseverance. Be assured that it will surely end in praises.\u201d",

          "title": "How Electoral Act\u2018ll be game-changer in 2023",
          "text": "\u2026Aspirants speed up consultations \u2026It\u2019s hope for PDP aspirants \u2013 Mohammed \u2026No, it\u2019s searchlight on political parties, a win-win for APC \u2013 Okechukwu, others \u2018\u2026Not about individual ambition, but credible process\u2019\n\nThe new Electoral Act has thrown up some issues around the emergence of candidates ahead of the 2023 elections. BODE OLAGOKE and ABDULRAHMAN ZAKARIYAU take a holistic view on the striking benefits of the new legal instrument in the conduct of the nation\u2019s elections and how both the parties and their candidates stand to gain and lose.\n\nFor over a decade, Nigerians waited for an amended Electoral Act. Many times it was passed by the National Assembly and rejected by President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) government.\n\nInterestingly, after what could be described as an endless wait, President Buhari signed the amended Electoral Act into law February 25, 2022.\n\nA critical look at the amended Act showed that the 2023 election may be more credible and acceptable than the previous general elections. This is largely because some major sections of the document have corrected the defects in the nation\u2019s electoral system.\n\nMajor highlights of the Act\n\nMany sections and clauses of the new Electoral Act inspire hope and excite political parties, politicians and ordinary Nigerians. For instance, Section 50 of the Act states that \u201cvoting at an election and transmission of results under this Act shall be in accordance with the procedure determined by the Commission.\u201d In the past, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had demonstrated its commitment and capacity to use the electronic transmission method in many elections. This has given the commission power to decide on whether to apply electronic transmission or not.\n\nAlso, the Electoral Act has addressed the issue of over-voting as contained in Section 51. Therefore, the total number of accredited voters will now become a factor in determining over-voting at election tribunals.\n\nSection \u201c50(2) states: \u201cWhere the number of votes cast at an election in any polling unit exceeds the number of accredited voters in that polling unit, the Presiding officer shall cancel the result of the election in that polling unit.\n\nSubsection (3) of this section further says: \u201cWhere the result of an election is cancelled in accordance with subsection (2), there shall be no return for the election until another poll has taken place in the affected polling unit.\u201d\n\nThis is just as Section 94 of the Act stipulates early commencement of campaign seasons at least, 150 days to elections. This provision has the advantage of giving the political parties and candidates sufficient time to reach the electorate with their manifestoes.\n\nAlso, in another provision, political parties are empowered by the Act to conduct a fresh primary election to replace candidates who die during elections.\n\nThis is explicitly stated in Section 34(3) that, \u201cIf after the commencement of poll and before the announcement of the final result and declaration of a winner, a candidate dies (a) the Commission shall, being satisfied with the fact of the death, suspend the election for a period not more than 21 days; and (b) in the case of election into a legislative House, the election shall start afresh and the political party whose candidate died may, if it intends to continue to participate in the election, conduct a fresh primary within 14 days of the death of its candidate and submit the name of a new candidate to the Commission to replace the dead candidate: Provided that in the case of Presidential or gubernatorial or Federal Capital Territory Area Council elections, the running mate shall continue with the election and nominate a new running mate.\u201d\n\nThe Electoral Act has also approved the use of card readers, as mandatory accreditation technology before voting. Section 47 (1) states that \u201cA person intending to vote in an election shall present himself with his voter\u2019s card to a Presiding officer for accreditation at the polling unit in the constituency in which his name is registered.\u201d\n\nSubsection (2) adds: \u201cTo vote, the presiding officer shall use a smart card reader or any other technological device that may be prescribed by the Commission, for the accreditation of voters, to verify, confirm or authenticate the particulars of the intending voter in the manner prescribed by the Commission.\u201d\n\n(3) \u201cWhere a smart card reader or any other technological device deployed for accreditation of voters fails to function in any unit and a fresh card reader or technological device is not deployed, the election in that unit shall be cancelled and another election shall be scheduled within 24 hours if the Commission is satisfied that the result of the election in that polling unit will substantially affect the final result of the whole election and declaration of a winner in the constituency concerned.\u201d\n\nThe major issue addressed by the electoral act, which is perhaps the most topical of it all is that it stopped presidents or governors from making their appointees automatic delegates in an indirect primary election.\n\nSection 84(10-13) of the Act states: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the Convention or Congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\n\n\u201cWhere a political party fails to comply with the provisions of this Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate for election shall not be included in the election for the particular position in the issue.\n\n\u201c Notwithstanding the provisions of this Act or rules of a political party, an aspirant who complains that any of the provisions of this Act and the guidelines of a political party have not been complied with in the selection or nomination of a candidate of a political party for election, may apply to the Federal High Court for redress.\n\n\u201cNothing in this section shall empower the Courts to stop the holding of primaries or general elections under this Act pending the determination of a suit.\u201d\n\nWike, Atiku \u2018war\u2019 ignited\n\nWith the Act, the race for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 2023 presidential ticket gets tougher with former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Bauchi state Governor Bala Mohammed, Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike and Sokoto state Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal having very limited time to put their acts together ahead of the party\u2019s presidential primaries.\n\n\u201cWhen President Muhammadu Buhari signed the Electoral Act, Atiku and other aspirants who are in a race for PDP presidential ticket have realised they have limited time.\n\n\u201cSince on February 25, 2022, when President Muhammadu Buhari signed the amended electoral act, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has stepped up consultation and this has further widened the crack in the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum. The forum is divided over zoning.\n\n\u201cThere is a proxy war going on within the PDP. While Wike is leading the war on behalf of the governors to prevent the former Vice President from getting the ticket, Atiku has rolled out all his machinery and engaged more in direct consultations with different stakeholders and organs within the party. As it is, in PDP zoning or no zoning Atiku will contest,\u201d said a major stakeholder within the party.\n\n\u201cSo, the Electoral Act and the timetable released by INEC have made more of the aspirants within the PDP to scale up in their consultation and campaign. So, all PDP presidential aspirants are consulting and also waiting for the party to realise the timetable,\u201d the source further added.\n\nWhat hope?\n\nA political analyst, Aminu Mohammed, said the Act would give opposition parties, especially the PDP, the hope of winning the 2023 elections.\n\nIn a phone chat with Blueprint Weekend, Mohammed recalled that, \u201cThat the 2010 amendments and other amendments by former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan-led Federal Government are part of what contributed to the success of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe introduction of the card reader was an added advantage that provided the then opposition party-the APC- that hope and victory.\n\n\u201cSo, with this amendment, there is hope for the PDP and candidates of other opposition parties. In the amended Electoral Act, more sections back the use of technology for accreditation, computing of results and other processes. So, it means the possibility of rigging will be reduced.\n\n\u201cYou see, now with the electronic transmission of election results from the polling units through to the collation centres, the practice of distorting figures of votes cast, may have become history.\n\n\u201cAnother benefit for political parties and their presidential hopefuls is that Section 94 of the Act provides all political parties opportunity for early commencement of campaign seasons, at least 150 days to elections. This provision has the advantage of giving the political parties and candidates, sufficient time to get to the electorate with their manifestos,\u201d he further asserted. \u201cAlso, the clause which makes it mandatory for political appointees to resign from their positions before participating as delegates at political party congresses and conventions or, as aspirants to elective offices, will provide a level playing field for all. So, there\u2019s no special treatment for any candidate or party.\n\n\u201cSo, to a large extent the amended Electoral Act will protect the opposition parties, especially the PDP against the plans by the ruling party to use the power of incumbency to make things work in their favour. Like every other law, this will ensure equity and fairness in the conduct of elections; it will protect the weak, in this case, the opposition party.\u201d\n\n\u2018Searchlight on political parties\u2019\n\nHowever, in the view of the director-general, Voice of Nigeria (VON), Osita Okechukwu, the new Act is a searchlight on political parties about their commitments to internal democracy.\n\nSpeaking in a telephone interview with Blueprint Weekend, Okechuckwu, who is also an APC chieftain, said the operationalisation of the Act would affect the selection process of candidates by the political parties.\n\nOkechukwu said Buhari has bequeathed to Nigerians an Electoral Act that empowers the deployment of the Smart Card Reader, Biometric Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) and other technological devices for electoral fidelity.\n\nHe said \u201cthe coming into force of the Electoral Act 2022 marks a significant turning point in Nigeria\u2019s journey towards electoral reforms, reinforced democratic rights, higher voters turn out and consolidation of democracy,\u201d stressing that by signing the Bill into law, the president had given lovers of democracy a booster shot of Vote-Rigging-Vaccine (VRV).\n\nThe VON boss described the new electoral law as a \u201csearchlight on the commitment of political parties to internal democracy and building of a united and inclusive country.\u201d\n\nHe said the battle between leaders and the led over accountability has shifted to the ballot box and social contract strengthened to be honoured, urging Nigerians to always reflect on the remarks by President Buhari when he signed the bill, especially where the President said, \u201cDistinguished Senators and Honourable Members of the National Assembly, from the review, it is my perspective that the substance of the Bill is both reformative and progressive.\n\n\u201cI am making this bold declaration, because I foresee the great potentials of the Bill. Worthy of note include the democratic efficacy of the Bill with particular reference to sections 3,9(2), 34, 41, 47, 84(9), (10) and (11) among others.\u201d\n\nBMO\u2019s take\n\nSimilarly, a pro-Buhari group, the Buhari Media Organisation (BMO), said the development would accord popularity and credibility to Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nChairman of the group, Niyi Akinsiju, said the new law has defined the new political environment for the political parties.\n\n\u201cIt better defined political environment and political parties now understand the options available to them. In fact, the new electoral law will popularise our electoral system and accord it credibility.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a win-win for APC\u2019\n\nIn yet another reaction, an APC member, Hon. Theo Imasuagbon, described the Act as \u201ca win-win for the party and all its presidential aspirants.\u201d\n\nHe told one of our correspondents that the ruling party and all its presidential aspirants stand for free, fair, credible and acceptable election.\n\nHe said, \u201cOur presidential hopefuls are not perturbed with the amended Electoral Act, rather they are consulting party members and other national stakeholders to achieve their ambition.\n\n\u201cWe are happy that the federal government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari of the APC, signed the amended Electoral Act. This shows what our party stands.\n\n\u201cThis clearly shows that the APC wants a simple and credible process for Nigerians to elect their leaders. If the process is simple and credible, more people will get involved. So, all the provisions in the amended electoral law will give all presidential aspirants and all political parties equal opportunity.\n\n\u201cWith this act, rigging is gradually becoming a thing of the past. So, any aspirant who will emerge as presidential candidate and any party that will emerge winner in the 2023 election must be popular. When the process is credible, it will throw up competent leaders and many will accept the outcome. So, 2023 elections will be better than 2015, because of the amendment.\u201d\n\n\u2018Not about ambition, but credible process\u2019\n\nAlso, weighing in on the issue, a political analyst, Dr. Katch Ononuju, said the Act has no implications on presidential aspirants, but rather about enabling a credible electoral process.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with this reporter, Ononuju said: \u201cThe amended Electoral Act doesn\u2019t have anything to do with anybody\u2019s aspiration for 2023 presidency.\n\n\u201cIt is an issue that solves the North \u2013 South scam because it kills three birds instantly. One is the issue of incident form which is also a way to manipulate population arguments. The issue of biometric applications, then the issue of transmission of voting data from the voting booth to the collation centre.\n\n\u201cSo, it will help to address all manipulation of population numbers in election results. No doubt, all political parties, presidential aspirants and Nigeria will benefit from it. Subsequent elections will be more credible,\u201d he said.\n\nMaking it work\n\nConsidering the efforts put in to the Act and the attendant controversies, many Nigerians are hopeful that the Act is the game changer the nation needs to up its game in the electoral process.\n\nBut notwithstanding this optimism, analysts are of the view that credible as the document appears, it will only give the desired results if allowed to be fully operational.\n\nThey further contended that for the presidential aspirants and any others for that matter, certain anomalies which the Act seeks to remove from the nation\u2019s electoral system is one huge challenge they may have to face in the realisation of their ambitions ahead of the 2023 polls considered as a litmus test case for the brand new Electoral Act.",

          "text": "Nigeria has moved to sixth in the latest Global Terrorism Index (GTI), following successes in the fight against Boko Haram insurgents.\n\nThe country dropped two places from fourth, a position it has occupied since 2017.\n\nThe GTI, published by an independent and non-profit think tank, the Institute for Economics & Peace (IEP) indicated that Nigeria, Syria, and Somalia are the only nations, among the 10 most affected by terrorism, to get an improved score from 2020 to 2021.\n\nAccording to the report, there was a decline in the number of terrorism-related deaths in Nigeria. It attributed this to the death of Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau, and the Federal Government\u2019s efforts at defeating the group.\n\nREAD ALSO: MNJTF Troops Neutralise Several Boko Haram/ISWAP Insurgents At Nigeria-Cameroon Borders\n\n\u201cTotal deaths from terrorism in Nigeria fell to 448 in 2021, the lowest level since 2011. Terror-related casualties dropped by almost half compared with the previous year. However, the number of terrorist attacks increased by 49 per cent between 2020 and 2021. 36 percent of attacks were claimed by ISWA, Boko Haram being responsible for eight per cent and 44 percent not attributed to any group.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, ISWA became the deadliest terrorist group in Nigeria. The decline of Boko Haram continued into 2021, with Boko Haram responsible for only 69 deaths, a decrease of 77 percent from the previous year. This is the lowest number of deaths by the group for a decade. Boko Haram\u2019s decline has resulted in a substantial improvement in terrorism in Borno State, which experienced a decrease of 71 percent in terrorism deaths when compared with the prior year,\u201d the report said, which was published on Wednesday, read.\n\n\u201cAttacks in the state also decreased from 121 to 86 respectively, a decrease of 30 percent. The state, however, remains the hardest-hit region in Nigeria for terrorism, accounting for half of all terror-related deaths in 2021. Boko Haram\u2019s decline coincides with a number of factors, most significantly the death of the group\u2019s leader, Abubakar Shekau. Shekau, who committed suicide by detonating an explosives vest during a confrontation with ISWA in May 2021.\n\n\u201cGiven the demise of their leader, Shekau\u2019s followers were faced with the decision to either continue Shekau\u2019s ideology or join ISWA. It has been reported that as many as former Boko Haram commanders have joined ISWA after Shekau\u2019s death. Attacks by ISWA as well as counter-terrorism efforts by the Nigerian government and foreign military forces have significantly weakened Boko Haram\u2019s impact in Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "Ukraine\u2019s president has attacked Nato leaders in a fiery speech over their refusal to implement a no-fly zone around the country.\n\nSpeaking from Kyiv, Volodymyr Zelensky said the West\u2019s reluctance to intervene has given Russia \u201ca green light\u201d to continue bombarding towns and villages.\n\nNato has argued that a no-fly zone will result in confrontation with Moscow.\n\nBut Mr Zelensky said he disagrees that direct action could \u201cprovoke Russia\u2019s direct aggression against Nato\u201d.\n\nIn angry comments, he said the argument reflects the \u201cself-hypnosis of those who are weak, under-confident inside\u201d and that Western reservations indicated that \u201cnot everyone considers the struggle for freedom to be Europe\u2019s number one goal\u201d.\n\n\u201cAll the people who will die starting from this day will also die because of you. Because of your weakness, because of your disunity,\u201d a furious Mr Zelensky added.\n\nOn Friday, Nato\u2019s secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, warned that the introduction of a no-fly zone could lead to a \u201cfull-fledged war in Europe involving many more countries and causing much more human suffering\u201d.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken also ruled out the introduction of a no-fly zone, but told the BBC he is convinced Ukraine can win its war with Russia.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how long this will go on,\u201d America\u2019s top diplomat said. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how long it will take. But the idea that Russia can subjugate to its will 45 million people who are ardently fighting for their future and their freedom, that does not involve Russia having its thumb on Ukraine, that tells you a lot.\u201d\n\nAs Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine enters tenth day Moscow\u2019s forces continue to heavily shell many cities.\n\nIn the south-eastern port city of Mariupol, the city\u2019s mayor has said that residents are under a \u201cblockade\u201d after days of \u201cruthless\u201d attacks from Russian forces which has seen power and water shut off to the city\u2019s 450,00 strong population.\n\nVadim Boychenko wrote on the Telegram messaging app that the city is \u201csimply being destroyed\u201d and said officials are prioritising \u201cthe establishment of a ceasefire so that we can restore vital infrastructure and set up a humanitarian corridor to bring food and medicine into the city\u201d.\n\nIn Kyiv, a massive convoy stretching out over 40 miles (64km) remains stalled outside the city, but the Ukrainian capital has come under renewed assault, with explosions caused by intense shelling audible in the city centre.\n\nThere have also been unconfirmed reports of fresh fighting on Saturday in the north-eastern city of Sumy and of rocket attacks on the train station in Ukraine\u2019s second city, Kharkiv, above a metro station where city residents are sheltering from shelling, and in the northern city of Chernihiv.\n\nAnd the US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, has warned that Russian troops have advanced within 20 miles (32km) of Ukraine\u2019s second biggest nuclear facility.\n\nHer comments follow Friday\u2019s attack on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which she said reflected a \u201cdangerous new escalation\u201d in Russia\u2019s invasion. Moscow\u2019s ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya, dismissed reports that Russian troops attacked the plant as \u201clies\u201d and \u201cdisinformation\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile in Russia, a new law signed by President Vladimir Putin that would impose prison terms of up to 15 years on people charged with spreading \u201cfake news\u201d about the war in Ukraine has seen several western media outlets, including the BBC, suspend operations in the country.\n\nTim Davie, the BBC\u2019s director-general, said the legislation \u201cappears to criminalise the process of independent journalism\u201d in Russia, while the Washington Post said it will remove by-lines from pieces written by its reporters in Russia.\n\nIt comes as Sky News released dramatic footage of their correspondent Stuart Ramsey coming under fire outside Kyiv.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Zelensky addressed massive rallies in support of Ukraine in several cities across Europe, including the Czech capital Prague and the Georgian capital Tbilisi.\n\nHe warned demonstrators: \u201cIf Ukraine does not survive, the whole of Europe will not survive.\u201d\n\nBut in the Serbian capital of Belgrade, some 4,000 people have taken part in a pro-Russian rally that marched from a monument of Russian Tsar Nicholas II to the Russian embassy.\n\nDemonstrators sang the Serbian and Russian national anthems and carried Russian flags and pictures of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nElsewhere, in a sign that Western sanctions are starting to have a tangible impact, Italian police have seized the yachts of two of Russia\u2019s wealthiest oligarchs.\n\nOfficers seized a 213ft (65 metre) yacht worth $27m (\u00a320m) owned by Alexey Mordashov, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and Russia\u2019s richest man, in the northern port of Imperia, officials told local media.\n\nAnother yacht, owned by Gennady Timchenko, another oligarch with close ties to Putin, has been impounded in Imperia, officials said.\n\nMordashov is worth an estimated $29bn and built his wealth around the Russian steel producer Severstal, while Timchenko is said to hold around $17bn of assets and made his fortune in oil trading.\n\nBBC",

But as the United States and other NATO members send weapons for Kyiv and more than 1 million refugees spill through the continent, the conflict is already drawing in countries far beyond Ukraine\u2019s borders.\n\nRussia continues to crack down on independent media reporting on the war, also blocking Facebook and Twitter, and more outlets say they are pausing their work inside the country.\n\nAnd in a warning of a hunger crisis yet to come, the U.N.

For decades, you have been the pride of our dear nation and its flagbearer in striving for the maintenance of peace not only in Africa but also across the globe.\u201d\n\nIn his message, Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, described Obasanjo as a quintessential leader not only in Nigeria but globally.\n\nHe said the retired military general and elder statesman, \u201cis worth celebrating at 85, having served Nigeria in many capacities, especially for unity, peaceful coexistence and socio-economic growth and development of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu, in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary Mr. Gboyega Akosile, Friday, said Obasanjo is one of the few Nigerian leaders who had contributed immensely to the growth and development of the country both as military and civilian leader, and left with impeccable records.\n\nHe said Obasanjo at the global level \u201cis a leader to be reckoned with\u201d due to his passionate involvement on African affairs and other global issues.\n\nSanwo-Olu said: \u201cObasanjo has made lots of positive impacts in the country as a military officer and political leader, fighting along with several other patriots for a united Nigeria during his days in the Nigerian Army.\n\n\u201cHe has written his name in gold as the first Nigerian to serve as Head of State and later Civilian President. He also administered the country with focus on improving the lives of the citizens and the country\u2019s economy.\u201d\n\nGovernor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State also felicitated with Olusegun. In a brief statement posted on his Instagram page, Abiodun showered praises on the former president, describing him as a \u201cliving legend\u201d.\n\nHe also prayed that the former president continues to age gracefully in excellent health.\n\nA message released by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin in Abeokuta yesterday read: \u201cNot many can boast of your profile \u2013 civil war hero, federal commissioner, former chief of staff, supreme headquarters, two-term president of Nigeria, retired military general, peace maker, farmer, family man, politician, author, traditional titles\u2019 holder, global statesman and with an earned Doctor of philosophy (Ph.D) obtained at age 80.\n\n\u201cYou remain, for us, an inspiration as a living legend and symbol of Ogun Standard of Excellence. As you clock 85 today, you still spend every moment, not just for yourself, but for the successor generations and the rest of humanity. Even at your advanced age, you keep sacrificing for security, stability, development and co-operation across Africa and the rest of the world. Your footprints remain indelible in the sands of time. Our prayer is that you keep trudging in excellent health on the global plain and may every stage of your life be more exciting than the previous.\u201d\n\nThe Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello described Obasanjo as an \u201cexceptional and patriotic leader who used \u201cThe best of his life to work for the unity and stability of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBello said that the former president also worked tirelessly to achieve peace on the African continent\n\nIn a message to mark the 85th birthday of the elder statesman, the governor said Obasanjo had also become \u201ca living legend and a strong voice within and outside the shores of the country, considering the outstanding and commendable sacrifices he made for Nigeria and many African countries.\n\n\u201cChief Obasanjo is one leader that has had a very rare opportunity to serve the country both as a Military Head of State and democratically elected president and did so exceptionally well.\n\n\u201cHis democratic finger prints on the African continent are indelible. He is a beacon of democracy and stands tall in the hall of fame of the greatest African leaders,\u201d Bello said.\n\nThe governor on behalf of the government and people of Niger State joined millions of well-wishers of the former President, within and outside Nigeria to pray for more strength, good health and wisdom to the celebrant.\n\nFormer Senate President, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim described Obasanjo as a foremost statesman and citizen of the world.\n\nIn a birthday message to the former President who clocked 85 today, Anyim, a frontline presidential aspirant for next year\u2019s election said Obasanjo had demonstrated unwavering commitment to the unity, peace and progress of Nigeria.\n\nThe former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and staunch member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) also recalled that OBJ, as the former President is popularly called, played key roles at various stages of Nigeria and Africa\u2019s political history.\n\nThe congratulatory message, which Anyim personally signed read: \u201cBaba! You are a true citizen of the world, an outstanding leader in Africa and our nation\u2019s pre-eminent statesman. You have demonstrated unwavering commitment to the unity, peace and progress of our dear country, Africa and the world at large.\n\n\u201cYou stand out as a true patriot. You have continued to give your all to see Nigeria take her place among the comity of nations, as a richly endowed country.\n\n\u201cYou have played key roles at various stages of Nigeria\u2019s and Africa\u2019s political history. At all those stages, you provided visionary and principled leadership guided by deep love for and commitment to the well-being of Nigerians and the black man.\n\n\u201cYou have remained a voice of reason, cautioning and proffering solutions as Nigeria wades through the many challenges of nation building. You have written letters, books, given lectures at home and abroad, all in the effort to communicate your thoughts and ideas on how to make Nigeria work. As a result, your stature towers on the world stage.\n\n\u201cBaba, I want to assure you that Nigerians appreciate you and your noble contributions to the peace, unity, progress and development of our dear country.\n\n\u201cGod has blessed you with good health, strength and a sharp mind. May He continue to uphold you as you continue your worthy service to our dear country, Africa and the world at large.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government on Friday evacuated 804 Nigerians fleeing the devastation caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThis came on a day a coalition of 165 Nobel laureates, including Nigeria\u2019s Wole Soyinka, openly condemned the Russian Federation led by Vladimir Putin, for its \u201cunprovoked military aggression towards Ukraine.\u201d\n\nThe evacuees arrived on three flights to Abuja with the first batch of 450 from Romania landing at the private jet terminal of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja at 7:10 am via Max Air.\n\nThe second batch of 180 Nigerians, including four children arrived on board Air Peace from Poland at 6.55 pm.\n\nThe third batch arrived at around midnight from Hungary on board Air Peace.\n\nThe evacuees were mostly students who fled Ukraine to Romania, Hungary and Poland following Russia\u2019s invasion of the Eastern European country.\n\nThe arrival of the Nigerians is a welcome relief after initial reports that they and other Africans were being ill-treated and prevented from leaving Ukraine through the Polish border.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, who condemned the ugly development, said there were about 4,000 Nigerians in Ukraine, mostly students.\n\nHe said one group had repeatedly been refused entry to Poland so they travelled back into Ukraine to head for Hungary instead.\n\nAccording to President Buhari in a tweet, \u201cAll who flee a conflict situation have the same right to safe passage under the UN Convention, and the colour of their passport or their skin should make no difference.\u201d\n\nSome of the evacuees who spoke to journalists on arrival yesterday appreciated the federal government for its efforts in ensuring they were safely evacuated but narrated the pains they had to go through to get out of Ukraine.\n\nWegwu Kella, a female Nigerian from Rivers State and student said it was a bitter/sweet feeling leaving Ukraine back to Nigeria.\n\nShe said: \u201cI feel Ukraine has been home and since my arrival in that country, things have been working out well but I feel I am safe and returning to Nigeria to meet loved ones. I was really in another city when the bombing started. The social media was awash with news of the impending attack so I had left the capital city. When I was leaving for the border, I was in the cold and had to walk for six hours straight to get to the gate and on getting to the gate they were allowing only Ukrainians to pass and I had to leave and get a bus to another border point. This took another 24 hours to get to but this time around I was in a bus.\n\n\u201cI cannot explain how I got here because I was going to miss the flight, I went to the embassy yesterday to register and I got to the airport and was told the plane was full. I waited to see if any opportunity arises and today because I was in front of the line I was able to make the flight.\u201d\n\nAnother evacuee, Eniola Badejo, also a student appreciated the government\u2019s efforts, but appealed for more information and better coordination as the exercise continued.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe thank our government because it has been really tiring, we went through a lot of stress, many of us travelled all the way and we barely slept. I am just happy going back to my family.\u201d\n\nNigeria\u2019s Ambassador to Poland, Christian Ugwu appreciated President Buhari for his swift intervention and release of funds to get all stranded Nigerians in Ukraine back home.\n\nUgwu said the embassy in Poland was on top of the situation and had successfully coordinated the first batch that was being evacuated already.\n\nThe ambassador, however, urged all Nigerians who had made it to Poland to ensure they got ready to be evacuated home rather than remain in Poland.\n\nAmb. Bolaji Akinremi, leader of the evacuation exercise from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, explained that the March 3 flight was cancelled due to delay in getting all the intending evacuees together from their respective hotels.\n\nAkinremi explained that as at when they were ready, the International law did not allow for the crew members to continue with the journey as they had overshot their duty time.\n\nWole Soyinka, 164 other Nobel Laureates Condemn Invasion\n\nA coalition of 165 Nobel laureates, including Wole Soyinka, Friday openly condemned the Russian Federation, led by Putin, for its \u201cunprovoked military aggression\u201d towards Ukraine.\n\nThis was stated in an open letter jointly signed by the Nobel laureates, who stated that there were other peaceful ways to solve disputes.\n\nThe scholars also noted that the invasion \u201cwill stain\u201d the international reputation of the Russian state for decades to come.\n\nA copy of the letter made available on Vox Ukraine partly read: \u201cIn a move that recalls the infamous attack of Nazi Germany on Poland in 1939 (using similar tricks of feigned provocation) and on the Soviet Union in 1941, the government of the Russian Federation, led by President Putin, has launched an unprovoked military aggression \u2014 nothing else but a war \u2013 against its neighbour, Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe choose our words carefully here, for we do not believe the Russian people have a role in this aggression.\n\n\u201cWe join in condemning these military actions and President Putin\u2019s essential denial of the legitimacy of Ukraine\u2019s existence.\n\n\u201cThere is always a peaceful way to resolve disputes. The Russian invasion blatantly violates the United Nations Charter, which says all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.\n\n\u201cIt ignores the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, which obligated Russia and others to respect the sovereignty, independence, and existing borders of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe Russian invasion will stain the international reputation of the Russian state for decades to come. It will pose barriers to its economy and inflict hardships on its population. The sanctions imposed will restrict the ease of movement of its talented and hardworking people in the world. Why raise this fence between Russia and the world now?\n\n\u201cHundreds of Ukrainian soldiers, Russian soldiers, and Ukrainian civilians, including children, have died already. It\u2019s so sad, so unnecessary. We gather in this appeal to call upon the Russian government to stop its invasion of Ukraine and withdraw its military forces from Ukraine.\u201d\n\nReinstating their support for Ukraine, the scholars said, \u201cWe respect the calm and the strength of the Ukrainian people. We are with you.\n\n\u201cOur hearts go out to the families and friends of all, Ukrainians and Russians, who have died and been injured already. May peace come to this piece of our beautiful world.\u201d\n\nRussian Forces Seize Europe\u2019s Largest Nuclear Power Plant\n\nRussian forces seized control of Europe\u2019s largest nuclear power plant yesterday after a battle with Ukrainian troops that caused a fire and fears of a catastrophic accident.\n\nThe Ukrainian nuclear regulator said that the fire had been extinguished and no radiation leak had been detected, with site staff still able to work at the Zaporizhzhia site.\n\n\u201cThe Zaporizhzhia NPP site has been seized by the military forces of the Russian Federation. The fire was extinguished by the Ukrainian State Emergency Service units,\u201d the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine said in a statement.\n\nEarlier, fighting had erupted between Russian invasion forces pushing towards the city of Zaporizhzhia and Ukrainian defenders, causing a blaze at the plant and global alarm.\n\nThe power station is located in southern Ukraine on the Dnipro River and produces a fifth of Ukraine\u2019e electricity.\n\nAny fire in a nuclear plant revives memories of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, also in Ukraine, which left hundreds dead and spread radioactive contamination west across Europe.\n\nOf the six reactors at Zaporizhzhia, the agency said, one is in operation and producing power, one has been turned off and four are being cooled to prevent overheating.\n\nThe regulator did not say, however, what each reactor\u2019s status had been before the fire.\n\nAn on-site inspection is being carried out by Ukrainian staff.\n\nUkraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of resorting to \u201cnuclear terror\u201d by risking a repeat of the Chernobyl disaster and begged world leaders to back Kyiv.\n\nHe said: \u201cNo country other than Russia has ever fired on nuclear power units,\u201d he said in a video message released by his office. This is the first time in our history; in the history of mankind. The terrorist state now resorted to nuclear terror.\u201d\n\nZelensky alleged that the Russian troops had knowingly fired on the nuclear facility.\n\n\u201cThese are tanks equipped with thermal imagers, so they know where they are shooting,\u201d said Zelensky.\n\nUkraine\u2019s nuclear facilities have been a major point of concern since Russia\u2019s military invaded the country last week and began bombarding cities with shells and missiles.",
