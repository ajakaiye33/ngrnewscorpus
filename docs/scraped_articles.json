          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nDr. Patrick Matemilola has lived with HIV for almost 30 years having been diagnosed with HIV in 1992. He, however, says he has never taken antiretroviral drugs to subdue the virus but has been able to stay healthy and maintain a CD4 count above 600. The former National Coordinator, Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS in Nigeria said he has for years depended on daily intake of fruits, eating a balanced diet, living a positive lifestyle and doing regular exercise to stay healthy. LARA ADEJORO reports\n\nGetting infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus can be life-changing. Most people feel devastated after testing positive for the virus. Some people like Dr. Patrick Matemilola, have however managed to live positively with the virus\n\nWhen Matemilola was diagnosed with the virus in 1992, he felt surprised but noted that it wasn\u2019t a complete shock to him.\n\nAs a medical practitioner, he took his diagnosis in stride and has been living a healthy, happy, and fulfilling life with the virus for almost thirty years.\n\nThe 68-year-old doctor got to know his HIV status after the blood he donated to save a patient who needed blood transfusion at a clinic was screened.\n\n\u201cI was an Army officer but I was involved in administrative work. I was in the headquarters and I was in charge of training in the Nigerian Army Medical Corps.\n\n\u201cSo, I was called one evening that a patient needed blood transfusion at a private clinic and I donated my blood but they have to screen the blood. Hours later, I was called back that my blood tested positive for HIV.\n\n\u201cI went back and I confirmed it. I have been living with the virus since then and there has been no problem,\u201d he told PUNCH HealthWise.\n\nMatemilola was a former National Coordinator, Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS in Nigeria and has contributed immensely, to HIV mitigation interventions both nationally and internationally. He works currently as the Oyo State Manager with Defence Health Maintenance Limited.\n\nHe said telling others about his status has helped him live above stigmatisation.\n\n\u201cMy friends know about my status, my family members know. My family took it very well and I didn\u2019t have any problem with my children. They are aware of my condition and they are all HIV-negative and we have been living very well with the situation. I am happy that I have been able to contribute majorly to the response of HIV/AIDS in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said for the past thirty years, he has never taken antiretroviral drugs to subdue the HIV virus and he has been able to maintain a CD4 count above 600.\n\n\u201cI was lucky because of my medical background, and of course, I am a very religious person so I took it to God in prayers. Since 1992 up till today, though I still go for regular tests, I\u2019ve never had any sickness associated with HIV.\n\n\u201cI have never used antiretroviral drugs and life has been good. The drugs are very important but in the early days of the response in the late 80s and early 90s, the drugs were not given to everybody. Then, when you test positive for HIV, they will ask you to do a CD4 count and a normal person has a CD4 ranging from 500-1500 but they insist that the CD4 count must fall to 200 before they will start you on drugs.\n\n\u201cThat was the thing that I was worried about in those days because when you test and they say your CD4 count is 600, they will tell you to go and come back for another test and it can go on and on like that.\n\n\u201cWhat they were doing was watching your CD4 count until they can start you on drugs, which was wrong,\u201d he narrated.\n\nThe CD4 count is a test that measures how many CD4 cells you have in your blood. The test results help the doctor know how much damage has been done to the immune system and what\u2019s likely to happen next if antiretroviral treatment is not initiated.\n\nAccording to experts, keeping the CD4 count up with effective antiretroviral drugs can hold off symptoms and complications of HIV and help patients live longer.\n\nThe World Health Organisation says if a person\u2019s CD4 cell count falls below 200, their immunity is severely compromised, leaving them susceptible to infections and death.\n\n\u201cSomeone with a CD4 count below 200 is described as having an advanced HIV disease (AHD).\n\n\u201cHIV viral load measures the amount of virus in the blood. This test is used to monitor the level of viral replication and effectiveness of ART.\n\n\u201cThe treatment goal is to reduce the viral load in the blood to undetectable levels (less than 50 copies/ml), and the persistent presence of detectable viral load (greater than 1000 copies/ml) in people living with HIV on ART is an indicator of inadequate treatment response and the need to change or adjust the treatment regimen,\u201d WHO said.\n\nNigeria has the third-largest infected population (2 to 3.2 million) of people living with HIV/AIDS in the world after South Africa and India, according to the National Agency for the Control of AIDS.\n\nThe agency added that the estimated number of annual infection is 103,404, while the estimated number of annual deaths is 44,830 and the estimated number of people living with HIV/AIDS is 1,800,000.\n\nExplaining further, Matemilola said a positive lifestyle, regular exercise, a balanced diet, daily intake of fruits are all beneficial for people with HIV.\n\n\u201cOur body system recognises body temperature and tries to keep us within that normal range.\n\n\u201cThat is why if you\u2019re in a cold environment, your body adjusts to that environment and if you\u2019re in a hot environment, your body adjusts to the environment.\n\n\u201cThe same thing happens to the CD4 count. When it is falling, your body tends to raise it and when it is getting very high, your body knows how to balance and maintain it.\n\n\u201cSo, if your CD4 count is falling, there are certain things you can do to help your body to maintain it. For example, your body needs protein to be able to build new cells. You also need energy.\n\n\u201cWhat we advise people is to take a very balanced diet. The diet should contain an adequate amount of protein, carbohydrates, fats, and oil, etc.\n\n\u201cAlso, your body needs minerals and vitamins. You can take a bowl full of fruits and you also need to exercise. Those are the three major things and the body will build the CD4 count and if it does not fall below 200-250, you are not likely to have opportunistic infections and you can live your life very well.\n\n\u201cIn 2003, my CD4 count fell to 220 and many of my friends advised me to start ART and I said if I\u2019ve been able to live from 1992 to 2003, then I can manage myself. Just applying these types of measures I explained helped my body and my CD4 count rose to over 600 and till now, it has never fallen below that.\n\n\u201cIt is good to know your HIV status early while you are still healthy and can access many available services and not wait until AIDS develops before seeking help,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking with PUNCH HealthWise, a clinical haematologist, Dr. Wole Banjoko said with the right treatment and care, people with HIV can live a normal lifespan.\n\n\u201cTaking antiretroviral medication regularly and as directed reduces viral load, thus decreasing the risk of transmitting HIV to others.\n\n\u201cThe patient should be taking his medication regularly and he must be going to the clinic to monitor his CD4 count and if any change is noticed, they can change the drugs.\n\n\u201cThe patient has to eat well by eating fruits and vegetables. He has to eat foods low in calories and as much as possible, do the things that will not cause the spread of the disease,\u201d Dr. Banjoko said.\n\nThe haematologist also urged the government to create more accessible clinics for persons living with HIV/AIDS.\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t want to come to those centres because it\u2019s too public. That\u2019s the major thing pushing people back. They are worried about stigma.\n\n\u201cThey should make it possible for patients to collect their drugs where they are treated,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Fortune Eromosele, Abuja\n\nHead of the Civil Service of the Federation, Folashade Yemi-Esan, has called for accountability in all spheres of leadership.\n\nShe made the call at the third anniversary and ordination of 14 deacons/pastors of the Exousia Church of God, Abuja. According to her, God will hold accountable leaders who misuse their leadership roles in any position they find themselves.\n\nShe noted that leadership roles comes with responsibilities and therefore urged all the newly inducted leaders in the church as well as leaders in the country, to be transparent and honest at all times in their offices.\n\nShe said, \u201cOrdination is a very big responsibility to those that have been ordained because right now they have to work honestly with God alone and not listen to side talks. I think it is a big responsibility that has been placed on their shoulders. I just pray that God himself will help them to carry that responsibility so that on the last day they will reap their rewards.\n\n\u201cI think leadership is always a position of responsibility because we have God to answer too, and so all leaders should be aware that at some point God will have to ask us to give an account of our stewardship.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Senior Pastor of the Exousia Church of God, Kunle Shoyele, declared his appreciation to God for mercies shown to him for the past three years in ministry, but however, expressed optimism that a time would come where honest and transparent leaders would rise to the occasion of the insecurity challenges bedevilling the country.\n\nHe added that God will in due time, bring Nigeria out of its current security challenges, using the newly inducted members of the church as a point of contact to reach out to other leaders in the country for the ability to sustain good leadership.\n\nHis words, \u201cI will like to thank the Lord for his mercies over my life and family and I also thank the Lord for his mercies over the Exousia church for his mercies in the last three years of the ministry.\n\n\u201cWe believe that God will help our country Nigeria and help our leaders to lead us right, leadership is very key in the fulfilment of a people. Today the people we\u2019ve ordained, we are praying that they will be leaders that will bring transformational change to the church of God and by extension to the world at large.\n\n\u201cLikewise in Nigeria, we believe God in the season that we are in, that a new army is rising, God is raising men and women of integrity who will stand for the truth that is expected in leadership. I mean a leadership that will be sincere to its people.\n\n\u201cWe trust God that as he has given us leaders in this country, he would also give us leaders in this nation that will be there to defend the integrity of this nation and stand for the truth. Let\u2019s fix our system so that we all can enjoy it, let us move from just saying to doing.\u201d\n\nFielding questions from journalists, Pastor Dare Samuel of the newly inducted ministers, said Nigerian leaders ought to do the needful by taming the insecurity challenges confronting the country.\n\n\u201cMy advice to Nigerian leaders is to do the needful by taming the insecurity challenges that we are going through and also we in the leadership position in the house of God will also pray for them for strength to carry on with this task that has been committed to them, so that they will not fail in it.\u201d\n\nTo this end, he said, \u201cI want to say a big thank you to God almighty who has made this day possible for me. It came to me not as a surprise but as a task and responsibilities that I have to do to sustain this position.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigerian Government has reacted to the decision of the United Kingdom, UK, to put Nigeria on its red list over the Omicron variant of COVID-19.\n\nLai Mohammed, the Minister of Information and Culture, expressed hope that the UK government would immediately review and rescind its decision.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Abuja on Monday, Mohammed said the UK government\u2019s decision was unjust, unfair, punitive, indefensible, and discriminatory.\n\nThe minister said the decision was not driven by science.\n\nAccording to Mohammed: \u201cAs you are aware, Britain has put Nigeria on its red list and banned foreign travels from our country. This is as a result of the discovery of COVID-19 cases, the Omicron variant, in Nigeria. Britain now joins other countries, including Canada, which have taken similar action against Nigeria over Omicron.\n\n\u201cLet me say straight away that it\u2019s up to the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) to respond to this action by the British Government and others, and I have no doubt that the committee will respond appropriately.\n\n\u201cHowever, as the spokesman for the Federal Government, I can say, without mincing words, that the decision by the British Government to put Nigeria on the red list, just because of less than two dozen cases of Omicron which, by the way, did not originate in Nigeria, is unjust, unfair, punitive, indefensible and discriminatory. The decision is also not driven by science.\n\n\u201cHow do you slam this kind of discriminatory action on a country of 200 million people, just because of less than two dozen cases? Whereas British citizens and residents are allowed to come in from Nigeria, non-residents from the same country are banned. The two groups are coming from the same country, but being subjected to different conditions. Why won\u2019t Britain allow people in both categories to come in, and be subjected to the same conditions of testing and quarantine? This is why this decision to ban travelers from Nigeria, who are neither citizens nor residents, is grossly discriminatory and punitive.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, let me use this opportunity to highlight the fact that travel ban, the type that has been slammed on some African countries, is a knee-jerk reaction that can only be detrimental to our quest to most conclusively tackle this pandemic. Instead of these reflex responses that are driven by fear, rather than science, why can\u2019t the world take a serious look at the issue of access to vaccines, and ensure that it is based on the principles grounded in the right of every human to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination on the basis of race, religion, political belief, economic or any other social condition.\n\n\u201cMany developed countries have used the advantage of their enormous resources or relationship to sign agreements with manufacturers to supply their countries with vaccines ahead of making them available for use by other countries. Even before the clinical trials were completed, millions of doses of the most promising vaccines have been bought by Britain, US, Japan and the EU. Some of these countries bought doses five times the size of their population, while others, mostly in Africa, have little or no access to vaccines. This is the real issue to address, instead of choosing the easy path of travel bans, which the UN Secretary General called Travel Apartheid. Let the world know that no one is safe until everyone is safe.\n\n\u201cWe sincerely hope the British Government will immediately review the decision to put Nigeria on its red list and rescind it immediately. Nigeria has handled the Covid-19 pandemic with utmost responsibility and based on science, and has rightly earned global accolades for its efforts. Nigeria does not belong on any country\u2019s red list.\u201d\n\nOmicron: Ban on African countries unfair, discriminatory \u2013 Adesina",

It reiterated its earlier position on not making vaccination compulsory but rather people should be encouraged to go for it.\n\nThe NEC said it has approved and perfected an arrangement to reward and encourage academic performance across Nigerian tertiary Institutions. This involves giving merit awards to the best graduating students in science and technology-related courses in three universities and a College of Education in each of the six geopolitical zones commencing from March, 2022.\n\nThe communique reads,\u201dNAAT commended the Federal Government efforts in its fight against insecurity and urged them to intensify more efforts in curbing the menace.\n\n\u201cNAAT commends the Federal Government for releasing the revitalization fund to universities and calls for its appropriate utilization.\u201d\n\n\u201cNAAT commends the Federal Government for the on-going construction and repairs of federal roads across the country and calls on state governments to emulate these efforts.\u201d",

We are persuaded to ask if boarding schools is still the way to go?\n\nIn recent times, the media has been awash with stories of physical, sexual abuse and gross bullying perpetrated by so-called \u201csenior students\u201d in boarding houses and these stories have slowly faded away without any real investigation and punishment.\n\nMost recent is the case of Sylvester Oromoni jnr, the 12-year- old student of Dowen College, Lekki, Lagos State, who was allegedly bullied by a set of senior students and lost his life in the process.\n\nVarious media report quoted the deceased father, Sylvester Oromoni Snr as alleging that his late son was beaten and forced to drink a substance for refusing to be initiated into a secret cult group.

          "title": "UNN: Inside the ramshackle Zik\u2019s Flats",
          "text": "The Zik\u2019s Flats, an estate of hostels at the University of Nigeria Nsukka (UNN), until recently, has been part of the hostel facilities provided by the university for its students. DAMIAN DURUIHEOMA , who visited the estate recently, reports that the huge edifices have become dilapidated due to several years of abandonment; resulting in the unfit state of the buildings for human habitation.\n\nThe University of Nigeria Nsukka (UNN) has come a long way. It is the home of the great \u201cLions and Lionesses,\u201d a popular sobriquet for the institution\u2019s students and graduates.\n\nThe university was founded by Nigeria\u2019s first President, Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe in 1955 and formally opened on October 7, 1960. The institution has three campuses located at Nsukka, Enugu and Ituku-Ozalla\u2013all in Enugu State.\n\nAccording to the university\u2019s verified Facebook handle, the UNN has about 40,000 students. The main campus of the university is located on 871 hectares (2,150 acres) of hilly savannah in the town of Nsukka, about 80 kilometres north of Enugu, with an additional 209 hectares of arable land available for experimental farming and 207 hectares for housing development for members of staff.\n\nLike every human creation susceptible to wear and tear, various edifices at the institution are currently in a decrepit state. However, the most debilitating is Zik\u2019s Flats.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe nature of Zik\u2019s Flats\n\nZik\u2019s Flats is an estate of 20 storey buildings and 12 bungalows used as hostels by the Nsukka Campus of the university for its students. The estate, The Nation learned, was owned by Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe, who later, before his death, handed it over to the management of the country\u2019s premier university as part of his social welfare contributions to the institution. The asset was equally meant to help the university to reduce the effects of accommodation problems experienced by the university as a result of its growing population.\n\nWith well-built duplexes of two-storeys and bungalows with about 700 hostel-size rooms and over 3,000-bed spaces, expansive playgrounds, a line of dozens of stores, a car park and a cafeteria with many restaurants, Zik\u2019s Flats was definitely the most beautiful and exciting hostel to live in.\n\nThis is in addition to the feeling of sharing a perimeter fence, by students, with the Great Zik\u2019s Onuiyi Haven, where the family of the country\u2019s first President currently live in.\n\nThis, it was learnt, was the reason Zik\u2019s Flats became the residential hall reserved for first-year students, a kind of technique meant to introduce them to the school system and enable them to adapt to studying before being sent into the main campus.\n\nHow dilapidation crept in\n\nOver the years, however, the estate has been left abandoned and taken over by grasses, trees and dangerous reptiles, which have become constant threats to surrounding buildings, especially that of the family of the late Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n\nOur correspondent\u2019s recent visit to the Nsukka Campus of the university revealed the sorry state of the estate, which hitherto provided shelter for a teeming number of students, and housed dozens of business centres, as the buildings now stand desolate and abandoned.\n\nWith a 40, 000-student population and with an annual intake of about 10,000 students, investigation reveals that the existing 17 halls of residence in the Nsukka Campus of the university have a total bed space that is less than 8,000.\n\nPlausible reasons for abandonment\n\nThis perhaps, explains why private hostel businesses are thriving more in Nsukka Town with each room going for a minimum of N150, 000 as against N12, 000 paid for a bed space in the university by students.\n\nDespite this huge amount and coupled with the prevailing economic situation, it is said that some members of the university staff and top officials of the management present and past are alleged to be clandestinely building private hostels and consequently allowing the school hostels to deteriorate.\n\nThe Nation gathered that before he left office two years ago, the immediate past Vice-Chancellor of the University of Nigeria, Prof. Benjamin Chukwuma Ozumba, inaugurated the construction of a modern hostel complex on a Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) Model. The hostel complex which promised to be a new model of hostel accommodation in the country was to replace the old dilapidated Ziks Flats. But, the investigation showed that the project never saw the light of the day.\n\nStakeholders\u2019 concerns\n\nExpectedly, some stakeholders are concerned that, at a time when many students are facing accommodation problems with its concomitant health consequences, the university only thought it wise to leave Zik\u2019s Flats to deteriorate and waste away.\n\nOne of the former students of the university, Dr Ben Ugwuh, who spoke with our correspondent, lamented that successive administrations in the university had allowed the estate to be in unimaginable ruins.\n\nUgwuh, who disclosed that he once lived in the hostel, said it was unbelievable that a university that was in a constant shortfall for students\u2019 accommodation would allow the place to remain desolate.\n\n\u201cIt beats my imagination why a university such as the great UNN should allow these structures to be in this current state with no student living there in the past seven years,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stated, however, that the only possible reason Zik\u2019s Flats and other hostels in the university were \u201cbeing allowed to rot away,\u201d was to allow private hostel owners, most of who are members of the university staff, to make heavy returns on their investments.\n\n\u201cApart from the rumours we have heard, I know that members of the university management and most members of staff of the university have numerous hostels within Nsukka Town. These hostels charge between N150, 000 and N250, 000 per annum for a room. Do a comparison with what each student pays for a bed space in school hostels.\n\n\u201cAnd to think that most of the Vice-Chancellors in recent times, including the current V-C, Prof. Igwe, were occupants of Zik\u2019s Flats makes the rumours strongly believable. So, I think it\u2019s a deliberate policy of making the private hostel owners have good returns on their investments that led to the abandonment of Zik\u2019s Flats and other hostels by successive administrations in the university. If not, just tell me what else could have inhibited the V-C from rebuilding the place he once lived as a student.\n\n\u201cThe situation is equally affecting other hostels in the university. You must have heard about the disturbing state of hostels within the campus. This is part of the strategy to force students to live in private hostels,\u201d Ugwuh said.\n\nRevamping Zik\u2019s Flats viable?\n\nA senior member of staff of the university, who preferred anonymity, told The Nation that rebuilding Zik\u2019s Flats would cost the university more than what it could earn in 20 years.\n\nThe source said: \u201cWe are talking about a project that is capital-intensive. Rebuilding Zik\u2019s Flats alone will gulp more than N5 billion and after that, you begin to charge N12, 000 or N15, 000 accommodation fees per session. We\u2019re not even talking about maintaining the hostel itself which costs the university almost N100 million per session.\n\n\u201cEqually remember that the university pays for the costs of providing electricity, water, internet services, security, sewage maintenance, repairs and cleaning.\n\n\u201cI think this is one of the frightening reasons successive administrations, including the current administration of the University led by Prof. Charles Igwe, the Vice-Chancellor, have looked away from rebuilding Zik\u2019s Flats.\u201d\n\nZik\u2019s family reacts\n\nIt is, however, no surprise that even the wife of the late Owelle of Onitsha and First Nigerian President, Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe, Emeritus Professor Uche Azikiwe, and the entire Azikiwe family are in deep pains over the continued abandonment and deterioration of her husband\u2019s legacy.\n\nShe lamented the current state of Zik\u2019s Flats at the university, saying the dilapidation of the block of buildings given to the university by her late husband always moved her to tears each time she beheld the buildings.\n\nAccording to the spouse of the late sage, the asset was handed over to the university in 1989 by the Great Zik himself when he celebrated his 85th birthday as part of his investments in human capital development.\n\nOptions for reviving Zik\u2019s Flats\n\nIn a chat with The Nation in Zik\u2019s Onuiyi Haven in Nsukka, Prof. Azikiwe expressed displeasure that successive administrations of the premier university in the country allowed such monumental infrastructure to waste when the institution was facing acute accommodation problems for students.\n\nShe said since the University was not capable of maintaining the structures, the estate should be given back to her family to rehabilitate, manage and transfer back to the university.\n\nShe stated that it was a great disservice to the name of her husband to be associated with the ruins the flats had become.\n\nAzikiwe said since her Onuiyi Haven shared a common fence with the flats, she has missed the hustle and bustle and warmth of students\u2019 presence in the flats.\n\n\u201cThen, in 1989 when my husband celebrated his 85 birthday, he gave out the place to the university for a token. I can\u2019t even remember what it was. If you call it a sale, people might laugh at us. When my husband and I were discussing after the transaction, he told me that he decided to give the hostels out to the University \u2018for a Song\u2019 because, in Igbo land, you don\u2019t give out something like that without records. His thoughts were that the hostels would help the university community.\n\n\u201cAfter my husband passed on in 1996, we started noticing that Zik\u2019s Flats are facing gradual deterioration.\n\n\u201cIt was when the place was finally abandoned that people started asking us questions about renovation; thinking it was still our property. I kept telling them that it was the university\u2019s property to which they could not understand why the university should allow such an asset to deteriorate and waste.\n\n\u201cIf you look around, you will see private hostels flourishing and each self-contained room costs from N140, 000 and above.\n\n\u2018No legal battle over Zik\u2019s Flats\u2019\n\nOn insinuations with regard to an alleged legal battle between the Azikiwe family and the university that was stalling the rebuilding of the estate, Azikiwe said the family was not in any legal battle with UNN, over the control of Zik\u2019s Flat.\n\nShe described the reports of the alleged legal impasse with UNN over control of Zik\u2019s Flats as currently spread on social media as only existing in the figments of the imaginations of mischief-makers.\n\nWhile describing the allegation as fake news, she added that her heart bleeds each time she sees the level of dilapidation at the facility.\n\nHer words: \u201cOne of my friends who had a shop at the flats came to me and said she heard that our family (Azikiwe) took the university to court over control of those hostels. I told her that there was nothing like that and that if anybody took the university to court over anything, it is not the Azikiwe family.\n\n\u201cThe issue is that the family didn\u2019t take the university to court. The property belongs to the university. It is the responsibility of the university to maintain, rebuild, reconstruct and manage the facility.\u201d\n\nShe noted, however, that her family had approached the immediate past Vice-Chancellor of the University, Prof. Benjamin Ozurumba for a possible takeover and renovation but nothing positive came out of it.\n\n\u201cAt a point during the tenure of the former V-C, Prof. Ozulumba, I contacted him and asked to know why the buildings have remained like that. I am not happy each time I hear the noise coming from that place each time it is windy or raining.\n\n\u201cI always walk around the perimeter fence every morning and evening as part of my exercise. It\u2019s either you see fallen roofs and planks with nails or you see snakes that come from there to our premises. I told him (the V-C) that I am not happy about this. I don\u2019t know why the university should allow this huge source of income and source of accommodation for students to deteriorate.\n\n\u201cThe former V-C told me about an arrangement with a housing firm to build, operate, and transfer (BOT). His tenure ended without any work.\n\n\u201cI have also complained to the new V-C, Prof. Igwe and requested for the family to take over the facilities to build, operate, and transfer so that this legacy will not go down.\n\nThat Zik\u2019s legacy will not go down\n\nThis is a very big legacy that Zik\u2019s family will prevent from going down. If they can\u2019t do it, they should let us know so that we can get property developers to do it and hand it over when they would have recovered their money. If they don\u2019t want it, we can take it over.\n\n\u201cWittily, the current V-C told me that he was one of the students that sang that night in front of our gate when it was falsely reported that my husband had passed on in 1989. He was living in Zik\u2019s Flat then.\n\n\u201cI implored him to do something so that it would be one of the legacies his administration would be remembered for.\u201d\n\nThe former lecturer in the university said the Azikiwe family should continue to explore every possible avenue to ensure the rehabilitation of the buildings to befit the name of her husband, after which the buildings were named.\n\nWhen confronted with questions about the ruins in the facility, the Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Igwe declined to comment. Igwe, who was at a one-day workshop organised by the Resource and Environmental Policy Research Centre (REPRC) of the University and Environment for Development (EfD) Initiative Nigeria, for journalists and environment reporters, rather told our correspondent that he would not make comments on that because the forum was not a place to talk to journalists about Zik\u2019s Flats.\n\nAlso, efforts to get the reaction from the university\u2019s spokesman, Dr Okwun Omeaku on the matter failed.\n\nOmeaku rather told our correspondent that he was not competent enough to talk about the issue, adding that it was only the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Administration) that had the authority to speak to the press on the matter.\n\nHowever, after almost two months of appointments with the DVC through the Public Relations Officer of the university, the DVC was not available for reactions.\n\nDr Omeaku would later inform our correspondent that meeting with the DVC would be a chance game, and through his words, the DVC was not available on each visit.",

This will mean that only UK residents or citizens of the UK can enter the UK from Nigeria from that point onwards, and they would have to quarantine in one of the relevant hotels,\u201d Sajid Javid, the UK health secretary, said on Saturday. According to the UK guidance on quarantine arrangements for persons who are travelling in from countries on the red list, British citizens or residents coming in from Nigeria are required to quarantine for 10 days on arrival at a government-approved hotel at a cost of \u00a32,285 for an adult.\n\nThere is an \u201cadditional rate for 1 adult (or child over 11)\u201d at \u00a31,430, while an \u201cadditional rate for a child aged 5 to 11\u201d is \u00a3325.

          "title": "Anger, Dismay Across Nigeria over UK\u2019s Red Listing of Country",
          "text": "*Hardliners call for retaliation, want British Airways, Virgin Atlantic banned\n\n*UK\u2019s action not supported by science, discriminatory and outrightly racist\n\n*Insist Omicron did not originate from Africa, demand fairness\n\nObinna Chima\n\nIn a policy many have described as racist, misguided and discriminatory, Britain\u2019s ban on Nigerians from travelling to the United Kingdom (UK), while allowing many western countries, where Omicron is also present is sparking fury among Nigerians across the country who are stoutly condemning the British government\u2019s action, accusing it of racism. They wonder how the British government came to such drastic measure especially when it is not supported by science.\n\nThe same feeling was evident amongst the nation\u2019s leaders who have equally expressed shock and consternation at Britain\u2019s selective red listing of Nigeria and South Africa, their largest Commonwealth allies.\n\nRather than seek to work with its Commonwealth allies, Britain decided to isolate these countries\u2019 citizens for punishment through the ban.\n\nBritain\u2019s outright ban is however in sharp contrast to that of the United States Government, whose response to the Omicron variant, has received sweeping commendation across board, for not banning travellers outright, but insisting they must produce evidence of a negative test result at the point of departure as well as a day-two test result after arrival in their country.\n\nExpectedly, many Nigerians are livid and have started to urge their leaders to reciprocate the poor treatment to the UK by banning their national carrier, the British Airways and Virgin Atlantic flights in addition to British citizens from Africa.\n\nLast week, the South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, had embarked on a visit to some African countries, a move described by some as an attempt to galvanise African countries to act in solidarity against Britain and her imperialists.\n\nSome officials of the Ministry of Health and NCDC, who spoke to THISDAY in confidence, questioned the data, which formed the basis for the decision by the British government to ban Nigerians.\n\nFirst, they argued that the British government acted arrogantly by not discussing their discoveries with the Nigerian government. \u201cSo, right now, Nigeria is in the dark about what the action is predicated on.\n\n\u201cThe UK, instead, chose to announce the ban without discussing the data in its possession with the Nigerian government,\u201d a source said.\n\nNigeria\u2019s health officials who spoke to THISDAY, reiterated that Nigeria has in place, stringent protocol, which it enforces religiously on travellers leaving the country.\n\nIt will be recalled that before any traveller could embark on a trip to UK or other countries, not only is that intending traveller expected to fill a passenger location form, he/she is expected to possess a proof of negative COVID test result. \u201cIf this is the case, the Nigerian officials wonder how a passenger, who tested negative at the point of travel from Nigeria could suddenly test positive of COVID-19 upon arrival on UK soil.\u201d\n\nBut not done with Nigeria, the UK government, yesterday, took further measures against Nigeria as the British High Commission announced that it would pause \u201cmaking decisions\u201d on visitor visa applications from all red list countries, including Nigeria.\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY, a top official in the Ministry of Health and another reliable source at the NCDC, faulted the decision by the UK government.\n\nAccording to the sources, the action of Britain wasn\u2019t supported by science or data.\n\nOne of the sources wondered: \u201cWhat data did they use in arriving at the decision? Are there people, who are Nigerians that travelled with a negative COVID-19 test and later got into London and tested positive? Did they talk to the NCDC or any Nigerian official? They just went ahead and put Nigeria on the red list.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, a top official in the Presidency revealed that the Nigerian government was preparing to respond to the action by the UK government, insisting that the Presidency was shocked by the ban imposed on Nigeria.\n\nThe source said Nigeria was only given one hour notice before its inclusion on the red list, contrary to known international convention, and described the action by the UK government as the height of racism.\n\n\u201cThe UK did not talk to the Nigerian government about the red list until one hour before the announcement.\n\n\u201cIs that the way it is done? Are we still in the era of slave trade? This is a total discrimination against the developing world, particularly, Africans. Africa will have to come together and take a position,\u201d he added.\n\nContinuing, he hinted that Nigeria and South Africa might, have to come together to lead a response. \u201cWe should also not allow the British people to come to our countries. Since their government has banned our people from their country.\u201d\n\nThe source, who attributed the spread of the virus to vaccine inequality, pointed out that efforts by Nigeria and other developing countries to purchase the vaccine was deliberately being frustrated by developed countries, adding that this was one of the reasons Africa was lagging far behind in vaccination effort.\n\n\u201cThe developed world produces vaccines and Africa and the other developing countries are willing to pay for it, but they are not willing to sell and they are busy taking second, third doses and even booster shots, while a lot of countries don\u2019t have vaccines and at the same time, threatening us.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, this Omicron variant did not start from Africa, it started from Europe. So, what have they done to those European countries that the Omicron was also detected in their countries? Did they place them on red list too? The only possible explanation for targeting Africa, is because we are blacks. Racism is at the heart of the policy, nothing more, nothing less,\u201d the source stated.\n\nThe UK, at the weekend, had updated its so called Red List, indicating countries prohibited from entering the UK in view of the new COVID-19 variant called \u201comicron\u201d.\n\nIn a move that many have described as rushed, ill advised and lacking scientific basis added Nigeria to its red list, which contains 11 mostly Southern African countries becomes effective from today.\n\nThis implies that from today, UK and Irish citizens and residents arriving from Nigeria must isolate in a government-approved managed quarantine facility for 10 days, and receive two negative PCR tests, as further precautionary action is taken against the Omicron variant. A temporary travel ban was therefore introduced for all non-UK and non-Irish citizens and residents, who had been in Nigeria in the last 10 days, meaning they would be refused entry into the UK. This does not apply to those, who have stayed airside and only transited through Nigeria while changing flights.\n\nAccording to analysts, who faulted the action, the Omicron variant has now been found in over 40 countries around the world including many from the European Union but none has been banned by the British Government.\n\nData analysis from the New York Times, stated that the omicron variant had been reported in Austria, Brazil, Chile, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Ghana, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, R\u00e9union and Romania.\n\nOthers were Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, India, Israel, Norway, Portugal, Spain and the United States (16 states of America).\n\nAs of November 30, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reported about 33 cases of the Omicron variant across eight countries in Europe, including the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Italy, and Portugal.\n\nThe NPR also claimed that this variant had been found in other areas of the world, from Hong Kong to Israel.\n\nAccording to a New York Times report, Omicron could had even spread at a convention in New York on November 23, 2021, before South Africa announced it had identified the variant on its soil.\n\nGiven these large number of countries with reported/confirmed cases of the omicron variant, it is almost impossible to offer any other explanation for UK\u2019s banning only black African countries except racism, the source insisted.\n\nThe global spread of the Omicron variant, as of Friday, in Africa, Botswana had 19 cases; Ghana \u2013 34; Mozambique \u2013 2; Nigeria \u2013 3 and in South Africa \u2013 infections spreading in seven of nine provinces.\n\nEqually, the data showed that Zimbabwe had unspecified number of cases. Similarly, in the Americas, Brazil as of Friday had three cases; Canada \u2013 10; and United States \u2013 10. In Asia-Pacific, while Australia had reported nine cases as of Friday; Japan \u2013 two; India \u2013 two; Malaysia \u2013 one; Singapore \u2013 two; South Korea \u2013 six; and Sri Lanka had one case.\n\nIn Europe, Austria had one case; Denmark \u2013 13; Finland \u2013 one; France \u2013 two; Germany \u2013 seven; Greece, Iceland, Ireland, and Italy had one case each; Netherlands \u2013 14; Norway \u2013 five; Portugal \u2013 13; Spain \u2013 five; Sweden \u2013 six; Switzerland \u2013 two and UK \u2013 42.\n\nIn the Middle East, Israel had reported three cases as of Friday; United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, had one each.\n\nThe sources also cited the case of India where the Delta variant was first discovered, but the UK government didn\u2019t take stern action it took against African countries over the Omicron.\n\n\u201cThis Delta variant was first reported in India around 24 March 2021. By one week\u2019s time (around 1st April), India was reporting over 100,000 new infections a day, and rising. But the UK did nothing. It was not until a full month after (around 23 April 2021) that the UK government added India to the red list.\n\n\u201cWhy did it take them only a few days, during which not much has been known about omicron, to add 11 African countries to their red list?\u201d, the source further queried.\n\n\u201cNigerians are for now so livid about the vaccine colonisation in the world today, this has exposed the hypocrisy in advanced economies against the developing countries,\u201d it added.\n\nAnalysts agreed with the position of the WHO Director General who was recently quoted as saying that the high rate of vaccine colonisation had hurt global cooperation, leading to deglobalisation of the global economy.\n\nBritain Pauses Issuance of Visas to Nigerians\n\nMeanwhile, the British High Commission, while announcing its resolve to pause \u201cmaking decisions\u201d on visitors visa applications from all red list countries, which included Nigeria, said the decision was to support the country\u2019s health system.\n\nThe decision was announced in a statement yesterday.\n\n\u201cTo support the UK Government\u2019s aim to protect public health from COVID-19 and associated variants of concern (VOC), UK Visas & Immigration (UKVI) will pause making decisions on visitors visa applications in all red list countries, including Nigeria, until travel restrictions are lifted.\n\n\u201cIf you apply for a visit visa in a red list country and you meet the UK Immigration Rules, your application will be paused. You will not receive a decision on your visit visa application whilst red list travel restrictions remain in place.\n\n\u201cYou will not be able to request a refund of your visa fee once you have given your biometrics at a Visa Application Centre (VAC). If you already hold a valid visit visa and are intending to travel to England as a visitor from a red list country, you will not be allowed to enter,\u201d the statement added.\n\nIn a related development, Governor Ned Lamont has confirmed that a fully vaccinated man has marked Connecticut\u2019s first case of the Omicron COVID-19 variant.\n\nState officials said the man, who is in his 60s, is from Hartford County. Sequencing performed at the Connecticut State Public Health Laboratory confirmed the presence of the variant.\n\nThe man developed mild symptoms on November 27. An at-home COVID-19 test was positive two days later and a molecular test also came back positive on December 1, nbcconnecticut.com quoted Lamont as disclosing.\n\nLamont also said because of vaccinations, there was less need for COVID-19 restrictions or mandates in the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Outrage as ECOWAS\u2019 Report Uncovers ISWAP\u2019s N18bn Terror Financing Network",
          "text": "Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nOutrage, anger, and disgust were some of the responses of security experts and civil society organisations (CSOs) at the weekend following a report by the Inter-governmental Action Group on Money Laundering in West Africa (GIABA) that the terror group, Islamic State\u2019s West Africa Province (ISWAP) moved a whooping N18 billion annual revenue through the Nigerian financial system to fund its activities.\n\nThe federal government was criticised for its failure to track the movement of funds by the terrorist groups, Boko Haram and ISWAP, through the country\u2019s financial system. This was despite the trial and conviction of terror sponsors from Nigeria by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia, who also made available intelligence on the convicted terror financiers to Nigeria. The Nigerian government was alleged to have taken no action on the matter.\n\nGIABA is a task force set up by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The organisation is a specialised institution of ECOWAS responsible for strengthening the capacity of member states towards the prevention and control of money laundering and terrorist financing in the region.\n\nThe report estimated ISWAP\u2019s revenues, which it put at $36 million (N18 billion) annually, to be larger than that of Boko Haram. It said much of the revenue came from trading activities and taxation in the Lake Chad region.\n\nBut reacting to the findings, security experts were miffed by the failure of the Nigerian government to leverage intelligence on terror financiers supplied by UAE and Saudi Arabia to try to track the circulation of the illicit funds.\n\nSpeaking on the GIABA report, Executive Director of the Rule of Law and Advocacy Centre (RULAAC), Mr. Okechukwu Nwangwuma, deplored the federal government\u2019s failure to contain terror financing.\n\nNwangwuma said, \u201cAt a time that the Nigerian government has been in a frenzy embarking on various schemes to regulate the media and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), spending huge resources to purchase equipment to track information about human rights groups and activists with all the measures to track the resources coming to NGOs from international development partners, with all the financial and operational regulatory processes put in place and targeted at organisations involved in development work, it is no longer in doubt that government is obsessed with going after perceived opponents and critical media, while terrorists and their sponsors are allowed to freely transact business without being monitored and arrested.\n\n\u201cI do not know how I can avoid the conclusion that this government is intolerant of, sympathetic to, if not in complicity with, terrorists. People in, or connected to, government appear to be benefitting from the proceeds of terrorist activities.\u201d\n\nNwangwuma added, \u201cLook at the ease with which terrorists kidnap people in mass and demand and receive billions in ransom. There are people in high places, including in government, who are the sponsors and beneficiaries.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with THISDAY, also, Assistant Regional Vice President, Region 11, ASIS International, one of the largest associations of security management professionals in the world, Dr. Kabiru Umar, said the report showed the inability of the country\u2019s counterterrorism efforts to block funding avenues of the terror groups.\n\nUmar stated, \u201cA good testament to the authenticity of the GIABA report is the inability of Nigeria\u2019s counter terrorism efforts to block the funding avenues of the terror groups operating in Nigeria, including ISWAP and JAS.\n\n\u201cThe report alleged that ISWAP might have generated about N18 billion in Nigeria. That is huge and explains why the group is strong and able to exercise influence.\u201d\n\nThe GIABA report also stated that the federal government failed to confiscate assets of terrorists as stipulated in the global anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing standards.\n\nHowever, in his contribution, a former army spokesman, Brig. Gen. S. K Usman (rtd), said government had taken steps to address terror funding, but it was not providing adequate information on such steps.\n\nUsman said, \u201cI am not speaking for government, but I would say that some steps have been taken by government in that regard, for instance, the arrest of BDC operators.\n\n\u201cThere is also a challenge of making available information on what government has done with countering terror financing.\u201d\n\nUmar also acknowledged that though government had taken steps to address the issue of terror financing, gaps still remained.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe report is, therefore, an independent assessment of how well Nigeria is faring with regards to its commitments to AML/CFT (Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism). It has pointed out several positive achievements but several challenges as well. It is absolutely important that the entirety of MDAs study these report and heed its recommendation.\n\n\u201cFrom 2019 to date the Nigerian government has taken some steps that were recommended by the report, such as closer look at the financing of NGOs and of Bureau De Change operators.\n\n\u201cSome vital measures that remain a huge challenge is implementation of AML/CFT measures by some financial and banking institutions, who are a major risk factor within the industry but are yet to buy in.\u201d\n\nThe report indicted intelligence and anti-graft agencies, notably, the Department of State Services (DSS) and the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) for the failure to trace and stop terror financing.\n\nIt said, \u201cThe Department of State Services, Nigeria\u2019s lead counter-terrorism agency, has significant ability to identify and investigate TF activity. It conducts parallel financial investigations in conjunction with terrorism investigations. However, there is little evidence of the effectiveness of such efforts.\n\n\u201cThe content of TF-related Suspicious Transactions Reports submitted to the NFIU (Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit) has not been of demonstrable value, appearing to add little to Nigeria\u2019s CFT (Combating the Financing of Terrorism) efforts.\n\n\u201cThe agency maintained that Nigeria did not demonstrate effective legal and operational frameworks for seeking international cooperation, including for the recovery and repatriation of assets.\u201d\n\nIn a chat with THISDAY, a senior military officer, who retired on the rank of major general, said government was not committed to halting terror funding. The retired senior officer, who spoke anonymously, queried the federal government\u2019s failure to try the suspects arrested so far.\n\nHe stated, \u201cWhat has government done? United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia arrested Boko Haram financiers, prosecuted them and jailed them; their accomplices are still here. About 400 BDC operators were arrested, the Attorney-General promised to prosecute them. What has happened?\n\n\u201cSome 1,000 insurgents were arrested after which government promised to try them in June. Are we still in June? There is simple a lack of commitment to do so.\u201d\n\nFormer Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr. Ibrahim Magu, had raised the alarm that some NGOs in the North-east were allegedly operating about 50 bank accounts each. Magu called on banks to provide the anti-graft agency with information on such organisations.\n\nThe GIABA report was adopted by the global financial intelligence agency, Financial Action Task Force, whose recommendations help authorities to go after the money of criminals dealing in illegal drugs, human trafficking and other crimes.\n\nThe report stated, \u201cBoko Haram/ISWAP pose significant TF (Terrorist Financing) risks that are challenging to disrupt, operating in large part outside the formal financial and commercial system in the conflict zone.\n\n\u201cAs with other forms of illicit financial activity, the pervasive use of cash enables these groups\u2019 funding. A study estimated ISWAP\u2019s revenues, deemed larger than Boko Haram\u2019s, at up to USD$36 million annually, much of it from trading activity and taxation in the Lake Chad region.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cAccording to Nigerian authorities, both groups have also continued to mobilise, move and utilise funds through the formal financial and commercial system as well, accounting for a relatively small portion of TF activity. These groups also engage in international trafficking activities and as sworn adherents to the Islamic State, also have links with other regional and global terrorist networks.\n\n\u201cThe authorities believe that any external support from ISIS Core may account for a small portion of ISWAP\u2019s overall revenues. However, trade with broader criminal networks that could extend to regional jihadist organisations appears to generate significant income for both Boko Haram and ISWAP.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Underproduction, subsidy payment hurting national oil company\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nOf the expected remittance of N2.09 trillion into the Federation Account between January and October, 2021, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited was only able to pay N511.66 billion, about 25 per cent less than the projected national oil revenue in the review period.\n\nAn analysis of the figures showed that for the period under review, the sum of N1.581 trillion was recorded as variance between the budgeted amount and actual sum remitted by the company.\n\nThe data was part of the national oil company\u2019s November presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC).\n\nThe section of the document tagged, \u201c2021 Monthly Actual NNPC Oil and Gas Revenue and Distribution to FAAC\u201d, indicated that for the entire year, NNPC had projected a total of N2.511 trillion as payment to the three tiers of government. That forecast was largely a mirage, given the severe shortfall posted between January and October.\n\nWhereas the company was supposed to pay N209.30 billion every month into the federation account, the report, which covers its October operations, showed that a paltry N14.85 billion was remitted, representing the least so far released throughout the whole year, apart from April when it remitted nothing.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear how the authorities augmented the shortfall last month, but in November the three tiers of government shared N671.910 billion as FAAC revenue for the month of October, as against N739 billion the previous month.\n\nHowever, a release from the Federal Ministry of Finance stated that the amount was inclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT), \u201caugmentations,\u201d exchange gain, and non-oil mineral revenue.\n\nIn the month also, the federal government received N284.292 billion, states got N209.838 billion, while the 774 local governments received N156.282 billion.\n\nOil-producing states received N21.498 billion as 13 per cent derivation of mineral revenues, according to the communiqu\u00e9 released at the end of the meeting.\n\nUnder the current sharing arrangement, the federal government takes 52.68 per cent of the revenue shared, states get 26.72 per cent, while the local governments get 20.60 per cent.\n\nRecently, Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi, who is also Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), lamented that the NNPC had literally not remitted funds into the FAAC in the last four months.\n\nFayemi added that the failure of the NNPC to remit funds into the federation account was responsible for the decision of his administration, for instance, to slash the subvention of Ekiti State University (EKSU).\n\nA review of the figures released by the NNPC during the November FAAC presentation showed that between January and October, the company was barely able to meet a third of its obligation to the federation.\n\nIn January, the national oil company paid N90.8 billion of the N209.3 billion projection; in February it remitted N64.16 billion and in March, the NNPC paid N41.1 billion into the federation account.\n\nBut in April, it paid nothing to the three tiers of government; in May it was N38.608 billion; in June it paid N47.16 billion while in July it remitted N67.2 billion.\n\nThings appeared better in August, when NNPC remitted N80 billion to the joint account, but it fell again to N67.533 billion in September, before slumping to N14.85 billion in October.\n\nAlthough the mandatory cuts imposed by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) last year initially played a role in the inability of NNPC to meet its obligation to the federation, ageing upstream infrastructure, oil theft and outright sabotage have combined to hobble the country\u2019s oil production.\n\nNigeria has been unable to meet even the tapered production quota allocated to it by OPEC, thereby further reducing its total crude oil export, coupled with the subsidy payment, which continues to eat deep into the national oil company\u2019s resources.\n\nOn Sunday, THISDAY exclusively reported that NNPC will again make a deduction of roughly N200 billion from the joint federal, state and local government account when the FAAC meets later this month to share the statutory monthly allocation.\n\nA THISDAY analysis of the document detailing the presentation of the national oil company to FAAC in November, indicated that the N200 billion will be the highest amount deducted by NNPC since it resumed payment of petroleum subsidies in February this year.\n\nIn all, it further showed that NNPC has removed at least N1.027 trillion from monies accruing to the three tiers of government in the country between February and October as payment for the controversial petrol under-recovery.\n\nA breakdown of the various deductions indicated that payments have increased progressively, growing from N24.3 billion in February, to N60.3 billion in March and N61.9 billion in April this year.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Ex-senate president: It\u2019s not a right, it\u2019s not legal\n\n*Former governor: We\u2019re ready to kneel and beg for it\n\n*CSOs to match to UK, US embassies over electoral bill\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nA former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, a former governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife, and a host of other stakeholders, have advised the Southeast zone to persuade other geo-political zones to support them to achieve a presidency of the Igbo extraction in 2023.\n\nThey said this on Saturday at the United For Better Nigeria Initiative (UBNI) National Convention in Abuja.\n\nThis is as a coalition of several civil society groups, has hinted of a plan to match to the embassies of the United Kingdom and the United States as part of pressures on President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the electoral bill as passed by the National Assembly.\n\nHowever, Anyim, while speaking at the UBNI convention, said it was neither a right nor legal for the southeast to demand Igbo presidency in 2023.\n\nHe said the Igbo had to persuade other zones to support their dream if they would produce a president in 2023.\n\nAccording to the former senate president, who has also indicated interest to contest the PDP presidential ticket. \u201cIs it right for the Southeast to produce the next president? My answer is legally no, and the reason is that the constitution is clear; the constitution says every Nigerian of 40 years is entitled to aspire for that office.\n\n\u201cOn the other side, morally, is it right? Is it an entitlement? I will say yes, because the federal character principle enshrined in the constitution encourages rotation.\n\n\u201cThe reason I have to make this clarification is that when the right you have is not legal, the only approach and the instrument you have is persuasion.\n\n\u201cSo, the approach, the language will be to persuade others to see reason with you that morally, they should support you to take a turn since it rotates.\u201d\n\nAnyim, therefore, encouraged the Southeast that as they go ahead advocating Igbo presidency, it should be with an attitude of persuasion.\n\nIn like manner, Ezeife said the kind of Nigeria God wanted, when He created Nigeria was for her to develop into a superpower among nations, and raise respect and dignity for all blacks on earth.\n\nHe said one of the ways to achieve the feats the nation wanted was to carry everybody along without discrimination.\n\n\u201cSo, I found Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo and other groups in this place talking about the need for federal character. If you do it that way, there will be unity; if there is fairness, equity, justice, you will have unity and progress.\u201cIn the absence of those, you see where we are now. It is not a matter of giving us president, we don\u2019t give, you have to work for it. The Igbo does not prostrate.\n\n\u201cThe Igbo man does not keel but this time, we are prepared to kneel down to every part of Nigeria, every group, every ethnic group in Nigeria, we are prepared to even prostrate, because we believe in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nEzeife noted that the Igbo people had contributed greatly to the development of Nigeria in terms of infrastructure, intellect and business, adding that, it was time to give the Igbo people the chance to build Nigeria to the standard God wanted it.\n\nCoordinator-General of UBNI, Mrs Nkolika Mkparu, said there was a feeling of political marginalisation after over a century (by 2023), that the Southeast region was yet to produce a president.\n\nMkparu said UBNI, a non-partisan political advocacy group, which had been involved in enlightenment for a united Nigeria deemed it fit to beam searchlight on the issue.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that our strongest strengths are from the north, our great leaders are from the north, so we are working with the whole nation with the understanding that inclusiveness is what will lead Nigeria to a better future. Inclusiveness that will bring us together in one union is what will bring our country together.\n\n\u201cNigeria is huge enough for everybody. Nigeria has the capacity to hold everybody, Nigeria has the intellectuals, Nigeria has all it takes to lift the county. All we are asking for is to give the southeast also a chance to lead.\n\n\u201cAll the other parts have tried. South-south has tried, North has tried, South-West has tried since over 50 years now, so, we are hoping that we should be allowed to try.\u201d\n\nThe guest speaker, Prof. Mutiullahi Olasupo, who is the Director of the Institute for Peace Leadership and Development Studies, University of Abuja, said it was right for the Southeast to produce the next president in the interest of peace and natural law of justice.\n\nHe said it was imperative for all Nigerians to exclusively resolve to see the Igbo presidency achieved in 2023, adding that the same mechanism that produced former President Olusegun Obasanjo in 1999, should also repeat itself by 2023, to produce a president from the South-East.\n\n\u201cOut of all the six geo-political zones in this country, it is only the southeast that has not produced the president in this country. Does that mean that the South East is not being recognised as a geopolitical zone in Nigeria?\u201d he asked.\n\nMeanwhile, a coalition of several civil society groups, in a statement titled, \u201cElectoral Bill: 2-Days of Civic Action. Let\u2019s Rise and Defend our Democracy\u201d, said they had slated Wednesday and Thursday, 8th and 9th of December, 2021, for protests to compel President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the electoral bill as further delays might be dangerous\n\nVenue for the two protests are the US/UK Embassy Central Business District, Abuja, beginning from 7:00am in the morning\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s prevail on Mr. President to assent to the Electoral Bill and stop further delay. Nigerians want it signed now. Allow the will of the people rather than few politicians,\u201d the group stated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "They said this on Saturday at the United For Better Nigeria Initiative (UBNI) National Convention in Abuja.\nHowever, Anyim, while speaking at the UBNI convention, said it was neither a right nor legal for the southeast to demand Igbo presidency in 2023.\nHe said the Igbo had to persuade other zones to support their dream if they would produce a president in 2023.\nMkparu said UBNI, a non-partisan political advocacy group, which had been involved in enlightenment for a united Nigeria deemed it fit to beam searchlight on the issue.\nNigeria has the capacity to hold everybody, Nigeria has the intellectuals, Nigeria has all it takes to lift the county.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For most of these people, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a lethal blow, making it harder to access healthcare, in addition to the stigma some already face.\n\nOur Reporter, Bolu Abiodun, xrayed tech tools that could be game-changers for persons living with disabilities in Africa for this year\u2019s celebration.\n\nYou can read here: 4 tech innovations that can make life easy for physically challenged Africans\n\nOr if you\u2019d prefer audio-visuals, you can click this link\n\nInterestingly, on Friday, December 3, the Kenyan Bankers Association launched \u2018Deaf eLimu Banking\u2019, a Kenyan sign language self-training tool developed in partnership with Financial Sector Deepening Trust (FSD Kenya) and software engineering firm, Deaf eLimu Plus.\n\nA timeline of recent 5G events in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s changed since September 27, 2021, and Techpoint Digest No.176? That depends on what you count as a change.\n\nWell, in that newsletter, we brought you news of Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami\u2019s prediction of a January 2022 launch of the 5G network in the country.\n\nFar behind other countries like South Africa \u2014 probably on shaky ground \u2014 and Kenya, where some citizens already enjoy the 5G network, one wonders if a January 2022 date is still feasible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the first 5G tests held by telecoms giant, MTN in 2019, we\u2019ve seen house debates on health issues, a Memorandum of Understanding involving the C-Band Spectrum, and an auction committee set up.\n\nWhat do we know currently? After the Nigeria Communications Commissions (NCC) released a Draft Information Memorandum on the Spectrum auction in October 2021, a final document was presented on November 10. A deadline for bid submissions was set for November 24, 2021.\n\nAccording to the NCC, due to an Air Traffic Controllers strike, on November 23 that disrupted flights operations in Lagos, the deadline was moved to November 29, 2021.\n\nSome traction: On December 1, 2021, the NCC announced bids from three companies, MTN Nigeria, Airtel Networks Ltd, and Mafab Communications Ltd \u2014 a recently incorporated telecoms company licenced by the Commission.\n\nThe auction is set to take place on December 13, 2021.\n\nI have several questions: Why are Nigeria\u2019s other major telcos \u2014 read Glo and 9mobile \u2014 not on the list of approved bids? Did they apply? Would this auction hold in time? Is a January 2022 date still feasible?\n\nWith MTN Nigeria\u2019s recent share sales, continuing profits recorded by telcos operating in Nigeria, and a 5G auction coming up, 2022 is shaping up to be an exciting year for the telecommunications space in the country.

Faustina Urassa, Programme Officer at the Kilimanjaro Association of Spinal Cord Injury (KASI), Tanzania, sees it as an opportunity to help others who have lost their ability to walk.\n\nUrassa trains people who have suffered from spinal cord injury how to use wheelchairs. Using a wheelchair herself, she says, \u201cif you have the appropriate wheelchair that meets your needs and suits you, you\u2019ll forget about your disability.\u201d\n\nFor young South African, Gift Moloke, living with disabilities means a difficult schooling process. Moloke, who has down syndrome, was rejected by several schools his mother applied to.\n\nAccording to the United Nations (UN), 80 million people live with disabilities in Africa. However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) puts the number of people living with disabilities at 300 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the numbers might be inaccurate, the story of Urassa and young Moloke are not the only ones on the continent. While it is already difficult to live with these disabilities, society makes it even more difficult.\n\nThe UN also affirms that most Africans living with disabilities are excluded from school and work opportunities.\n\nIn 1992, the UN proclaimed December 3 as the International Day of Persons with Disabilities in a bid to \u201cpromote an understanding of disability issues and mobilize support for the dignity, rights, and well-being of persons living with disabilities.\u201d\n\nFrom people living with learning disabilities to stuttering and being deaf, we have explored what living is like for people with disabilities and the role of technology in making life easier.\n\nNotably, Techpoint Africa has, at different times, covered tech tools that can ease life and work for people living with specific forms of disabilities like stuttering, deafness, Dyslexia, and Dyscalculia, among other learning disabilities.\n\nIn celebration of the International Day of the Disabled, we are looking at four tech innovations that could help people living with disabilities globally.\n\nTactile watches for the visually impaired\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEone Switch with additional rings Source: Oracle Time\n\nHyungsoo Kim, CEO, Eone timepieces, created the Eone when he realised that all watches and clocks rely heavily on vision.\n\n\u201cCould there be a way to cater for the blind?\u201d he thought to himself. Kim and his team went to work and came up with the Eone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Eone allows users to check the time simply by touching and looking at it. Think of it as a regular watch, but it has balls instead of an hour and minute hand. One on the surface indicates the minute, and another on the side that shows the hour.\n\nEone stands for Everyone. Kim believes that products and services should be inclusive, and while his invention works well for the blind, people with vision can use it.\n\nRecalling when a group of visually impaired persons was testing the Eone, Kim was asked if the watch was made specifically for the blind.\n\n\u201cI said yes and expected a positive response, but they said, \u2018that\u2019s not what we want; what we want is what everyone else also likes.\u2019\u201d\n\nReturning the sense of touch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProsthetic arm\n\nWhile prosthetic limbs are nothing like the natural, they can give amputees something close.\n\nDr Luke Osborne, a researcher at John Hopkins University, Baltimore, US, wants to get prosthetic limbs even close to being natural with his invention, E-dermis.\n\nThe invention could return the sense of touch to prosthetic users. The tech works with a phenomenon known as phantom limb syndrome.\n\nAccording to Osborne, it is a \u201csensation where you\u2019ve lost a limb or part of a limb, but you can still feel it. The region of the brain that represents the limb is still there and still working to some extent.\u201d\n\nOsborne wants to tap into this sensation and help people who have lost a limb feel things they\u2019ve not been able to for a while.\n\nEliminating stigma with fashionable prosthetics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBionic arm Source: CNET\n\nWhile Osborne is looking to return the sense of touch to prosthetic limbs, a group of video game enthusiasts is working on making it life-like.\n\nA video game company and a company that develops bionic arms \u2014 DEUS Ex Universe and Open Bionics \u2014 came together to create prosthetics that are more than just medical devices.\n\nOpen Bionics Co-founder, Joel Gibbard says, \u201cwhat we are trying to do is change the prosthetics industry so we can offer affordable, functional, and beautiful prosthetic devices to amputees.\u201d\n\nLooking like something out of a video game, Andre Vu, Executive Brand Director of DEUS Ex Universe, says they wanted the device to be something people wore fashionably.\n\nOpen Bionics has made a semi-functional prototype of these fashionable bionic arms and hopes to perfect the useability.\n\nTranslating sign language into speech\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUni demo. Source: the Daily Mail\n\nUni, a device created by MotionSavvy, converts sign language into text or speech, making it possible for deaf people to communicate effectively.\n\nIn a demo by Alexandr Opalka, MotionSavvy CTO, the device read his hand and converted it into speech.\n\nUsing sensors with dual cameras, it detects the movement of joints in the hands and fingers and interprets them into speech.\n\nWhile assistive technology is great, most of them are pretty expensive and inaccessible to many people with disabilities.\n\nAccording to the UN, 200 million people globally need assistive tech for low vision and over 400 million require products that assist hearing.\n\nWhile the high price tag of these devices contributes to their inaccessibility, they are often not included in welfare schemes, making them even more expensive in high-income countries.\n\nMore attention needs to be paid to assistive tech but, more importantly, persons with disabilities.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, different reports on Africa\u2019s digital economy have shown a steep gender divide. Be it access to the Internet, financial services, or startup funding opportunities.\n\nHowever, recent efforts from notable entrepreneurs are putting new blocks in place to try bridging that gap. In 2021, two amazing women in Nigeria\u2019s ecosystem partnered to launch FirstCheck Africa, a fund whose focus will be \u201cwriting first checks for audacious female founders, with bold ideas, at the \u201cridiculously early\u201d stages\u201d.\n\nOther platforms have also formed new ways to meaningfully engage women and bring more of them into the conversation in Internet adoption, financial inclusion, entrepreneurship, and angel investment.\n\nHowever, these initiatives have not been without their challenges. Access to opportunities has been a significant issue for most people. Herconomy founder, Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, found this even more true for women and began building solutions to address them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDurosinmi-Etti had stints with companies like Arcadia group in the UK, and Heineken (Nigerian Breweries), where she began to work on sustainability projects.\n\nIn 2016, she launched Parliamo Bambini and Philos and Zoe, startups easing the baby and child industry through locally manufactured furniture and clothing for children.\n\nIn 2016, Durosinmi-Etti was one of the selected entrepreneurs by the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). She and her co-founder, Olamide Olatunbosun, quit their jobs to focus on expanding their business. Their passion for women gelled nicely with an entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nFor Durosinmi-Etti, 2018 was a game-changer, as she used lessons from previous years to launch her, Accessing Grants for Startups: A guide for African entrepreneurs. The book\u2019 launch helped establish a community, and what followed was probably unforeseen by anyone in the founder\u2019s circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIfedayo Durosinmi-Etti, CEO, Herconomy\n\nFast forward three years to 2021, and Herconomy has raised $600k pre-seed led by VC firm Oui capital. Excitingly, 90% of its raise came from its community, some of whom were notable Angel investors, including:\n\nNkiru Ayemere \u2013 CEO, Zephans and Co, Ehi Onwudiwe \u2013 Director, Business Transformation, Ernst and Young, Olanrewaju Smith \u2013 CEO, World Bay Technologies, Ope Makinwa \u2013 Head of Reserve, Diageo, Ama Akpata \u2013 Co-founder, Jand2gidi.\n\nThrough its freemium membership model, the company offers weekly capacity-building workshops and brand discounts on Qatar Airways, Adidas, and Raddison Blu Lagos. It has a job board and became Amazon\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria for their EU region.\n\nThe startup also plans to introduce a savings feature where members can earn high interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut how did this happen?\n\nA long journey to a community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Durosinmi Etti launched her book to help people access startup grants in 2018, she couldn\u2019t have guessed that it would sell up to 10,000 copies or one day spur a growing community empowering women across Africa with core financial services.\n\n\u201cA lot of people kept on asking me, \u2018oh, my gosh, like, oh, the book was so good\u201d but how do they get more information about grants opportunities, and you know, scholarships, and all that, that going forward. So I started posting opportunities on my Instagram page,\u201d she says.\n\nAfter some days of doing this, Durosinmi-Etti grew fed up with the look of her page, so she decided to create a separate page for people to get grant and scholarship information. They also made sessions and workshops for people who wanted more information from the book.\n\nThe page began to gain traction, so she hired an assistant to lessen her burden and focus on her then business, Parliamo Bambini.\n\n\u201cThe business started growing so fast, and friends advised me to hire more people. But I was like, how am I going to afford more people? Are you people playing? I felt like the page was pulling me away from my business at the time, which I quit my 9 \u2013 5 job for, not knowing that this was actually what God was calling me to do,\u201d she recounts.\n\nDurosinmi-Etti, however, admits that though she was resisting at the time, the success of the business, whose goal was to empower women, was undeniable as it began to amass members by the thousands. In December 2019, a friend advised her to move to Telegram and create a community of paying members.\n\nThe proceeds were to hire more talent for the team, keep the community vibrant, and create more structured ways of helping people get these opportunities like capacity-building workshops.\n\n\u201cSo we paid somebody to create, like a web platform for us. And we\u2019re supposed to launch it on my birthday in 2019, and I was in San Francisco at the time. And we launched, we announced and did some paparazzi (fanfare) around it. But on the day of the launch, the web platform crashed.\u201d\n\nPutting her disappointment aside, Durosinmi-Etti moved those supposed to sign up on the platform to Telegram. By March 2020, the platform reportedly grew from zero to 500 subscribers who paid \u20a65,000 ($12) a month or \u20a650,000 ($121).\n\nScaling and growing to financial services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been in a WhatsApp group of 150 keyboard warriors, imagine how it feels to be offline for a few hours and meet thousands of messages when you get back. For a group of 500 paying subscribers, this was an even bigger issue that threatened to hurt the startup.\n\n\u201cI knew if I didn\u2019t build an app, our company would have died, and everyone would have left the group. So in March 2020, I decided to commission someone to build the app. It was supposed to be ready by June, but technical issues and COVID caused a delay. Coincidentally, Apple approved the app two days before my birthday in December 2019,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti states.\n\nThe Telegram experience may have been challenging, but Durosinmi-Etti believes it helped the startup\u2019s customer discovery process.\n\n\u201cSome people wanted to talk about stuff like sex, and others wanted to talk about entrepreneurship, career, others wanted to get jobs. So we just knew that we couldn\u2019t put everybody in the same box.\u201d\n\nSo Herconomy ( then AGS tribe) created a community-based platform where people could chat. It also added a new feature where people could get discounts on different brands like airline tickets, hotels, and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHerconomy partners with Qatar Airways to give members of its community discounts on flight tickets\n\nDurosinmi-Etti reveals that these discount offers pushed membership adoption through the roof. The startup boasts of different members globally in the UK, Australia, UAE, Canada, and Egypt.\n\nWhen they started posting jobs on the platform, they struck a partnership with Amazon became the tech giant\u2019s first recruitment partner in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOne of the main reasons why people liked the platform was our focus on empowering women. We have something called the AGS enterprise challenge, where we give women small grants of \u20a6500k, \u20a61 million, and \u20a61.5 million. We also offer small grants through other channels and other organisations that partner with them,\u201d she reveals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGS Enterprise Challenge 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAGS Enterprise Challenge 2020\n\nThe app featured a freemium model that lets members access the job board and community for free. The silver membership provides access to its weekly capacity building workshops (Lightbox), and the Gold membership, which cost $120, positions subscribers for offers such as airline or hotel discounts.\n\nTo date, Herconomy claims to have disbursed about \u20a630 million ($73,000) worth of grants to 42 women and men.\n\nIn response to Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s difficulties saving, the AGS tribe began to host a savings challenge in partnership with another organisation she didn\u2019t name. Impressively, they were able to get 500 women who cumulatively saved $100,000.\n\n\u201cAnd that was how I realised that a lot of women needed this service. So, we decided that we\u2019re going to add the savings feature to our platform so more women could save.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the name AGS tribe no longer made sense for what the startup was building, and it needed a new brand to position it as a financial services company looking to empower more African women.\n\nThen came the name, Herconomy.\n\nRaising funds in record time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRahmat Lasisi, CTO, Herconomy, and Ifedayo Durosinmi-Etti, CEO, Herconomy\n\nWith the platform\u2019s growth, Durosinmi-Etti realised that it had to build a structure around the startup, and she needed funding to do that. Unfortunately, none of the investors she reached to understood what she was doing or how a community would make sense.\n\nIn August 2021, while participating in the Startup Bootcamp accelerator in Senegal, she sent out a message on her Insta stories asking people to indicate if they wanted to invest in Herconomy, and 130 people showed interest.\n\nSidenote; The startup placed a $20,000 cap on this investment.\n\nA month later, after getting a commitment of $150k from three friends, she sent an email to those who indicated interest. To her surprise, she got a pledge of $5.7 million in 24 hours, all from people ready to pay by the set deadline of October 15. The list increased from 130 people to 509.\n\n\u201cI was confused as I did not believe this was possible. So I reached out to Zach (Zachariah George, Managing Partner, Launch Africa), our portfolio manager from the accelerator, and other people who were well versed in investments. We organised a workshop explaining what making such an investment could mean,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe just gave different scenarios and told them that this is not blood money, and their money could easily go bust. After explaining everything, they said they understood, so the fundraising began.\u201d\n\nHowever, the $20,000 cap prevented several members of the community from investing. Leveraging the platform, Getequity, the startup decided to create a special purpose vehicle for people who wanted to invest smaller amounts ranging from $30 to $10k.\n\nThe company plans to focus on testing and improving its savings product and invest heavily in marketing.\n\nChallenges and the future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Lagos Techie on Unsplash\n\nThe following paragraphs might, perhaps, be familiar, but one of Herconomy\u2019s most significant challenges so far has been getting the right tech talent.\n\n\u201cFinding a woman in technology to be our Chief Technology Officer was a huge, huge challenge. There were a lot of things we didn\u2019t take into consideration while building our app because we didn\u2019t have a CTO,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti says.\n\nShe also argues that when it outsourced its app development in 2020, several ideas could have been better understood by an in house team. Thankfully, during the Startup Bootcamp accelerator, one of the mentors, Oshone Ikazoboh, recommended Herconomy\u2019s CTO, Rahmat Lasisi.\n\nDespite the challenges with the outsourced app, Durosinmi-Etti is grateful that the community could grow to over 15,000 members.\n\nThe startup is currently looking at acquiring a licence with the next raise. Still, it remains focused on building its financial services product which it\u2019s gearing towards empowering more women.\n\nConsidering all the previous records about the struggles of female founders, Durosinmi-Etti recounts that the nature of her fundraising was humbling, and it could serve as encouragement for more women out there.\n\n\u201cFor me, I think this whole process is just about understanding where you\u2019re trying to build an understanding that no matter what it is, no matter how hard you fall, you know, you\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she maintains.\n\n\u201cBut if you don\u2019t try, you never know. I never thought I would be able to run a team like this. I\u2019ve been paying salaries of 10 people for over a year just with our own, like revenues and everything, but there were months when I wasn\u2019t sure how to pay the next month salary.\n\n\u201cSo to be honest, it has been a testimony and I just feel like women just need to take chances on themselves and just continue pushing and pushing,\u201d Durosinmi-Etti concludes.\n\nAre you a woman building awesome stuff with technology? Did Durosinmi-Etti\u2019s story inspire you? Then, we\u2019d love to hear your story. Kindly reach out to me (emmanuel@techpoint.africa) or my colleague, Oluwanifemi (oluwanifemi@techpoint.africa).

          "title": "Nigerian nurses joining UK workforce hit all-time high",
          "text": "The number of Nigerian nurses that joined the UK workforce in the six-month period from April to September 2021, is more than any time in history and this is despite a ban on \u2018active recruitment\u2019 of health and social care personnel from Nigeria.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s analysis of data from the register of the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) of the United Kingdom, shows that a record 1,334 Nigerian trained nurses joined the workforce between March and September 2021. For context, within the same period of 2017, only 23 Nigeria-trained nurses joined the UK workforce. With the recent addition, there are now 5,612 Nigeria-trained nurses in the UK, a 51 percent increase within four years from 2,792 as of March 2017.\n\nA code of practice for the international recruitment of health and social care personnel in England lists Nigeria among countries that should not be targeted for recruitment by agencies who secure the services of nurses willing to work in the UK. However, individual nurses are allowed to find jobs and other opportunities on their own, and despite the lack of active recruitment are leaving Nigeria in numbers never seen before.\n\nAs noted in previous reporting by BusinessDay, poor pay, often also paid late, unsatisfactory conditions of work, perceived low appreciation, and the generally poor quality of life in Nigeria have made seeking employment in places like the UK attractive for nurses and other health workers in Nigeria. The pay is also in many cases, more than 10 times what they currently earn in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cApart from the monetary aspect which is far better than peanuts Nigerian Nurses earn, I would say a lot of nurses want better lives, better environment, a government that works, supports and fights for its people,\u201d said Ayomiposi, a nurse who at the time of this interview in January was still trying to leave Nigeria, but now in the UK. \u201cA lot of hospitals are not well equipped and Nurses are undervalued here in Nigeria even in the health sector.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Ease of migration sees Nigerian nurses in UK hit 5yr high\n\nWhile emigration from Nigeria as a function of visa approvals to places like the UK has not seen a spike in recent years, that of health workers has been an exception and continues to rise.\n\nIn February, BusinessDay had reported a four-year high increase in Nigeria-trained nurses joining the UK workforce, but as data continues to show, the exodus is likely to continue and even quicken.\n\nThe data used for the story in January 2021 was for updated March 2020 records. However, by March 2021, when the UK NMC had data for exactly a year after, 685 Nigerian nurses had joined. In the six months from October 2020 to March 2021, the UK\u2019s healthcare added 567 Nigeria-trained nurses to its workforce, and this number has more than doubled over the following six months to the current 1,334. The NMC register is updated twice a year; March and September, capturing entrants in the six months before each period.\n\nThe now quickened pace of departure by nurses shows a steady but overlooked trend over the years. Medical doctors are not the only ones leaving Nigeria, and while their departure has received more coverage, other health workers are leaving too.\n\nAs of June 20, 2018, there were 5,351 Nigeria-trained doctors in the UK and by December 03, 2021, the number had risen by 69.6 percent to 9073, which also marks a 12.18 percent increase within the year from 8,088 in January. With the entry requirements for nurses said to be lower and more nurses available in Nigeria (although still not sufficient), it would only be a matter of time before the population of migrant nurses overtake that of doctors.\n\nAyomiposi, a 24-year-old Nigeria-trained nurse had taken the IELTS exam twice when she was interviewed in January, but yet to get the required scores to proceed with her planned migration.\n\nA few weeks ago, she finally left Nigeria for the UK after passing the IELTS at her third attempt, refusing to be overcome by the initial setbacks. At her old job with a Health Maintenance Organisation (HMO) in Lagos, she wouldn\u2019t state her actual pay but gave the range as being between N876,000 (\u00a31,550)- N2.16 million (\u00a33,823) per annum, whereas she already had a peek into what her future pay at between \u00a326,000 and \u00a330,000 could be in the UK.\n\nHave her expectations been met, she was asked in a WhatsApp chat, to which she responded, \u201cSure it was met.\u201d Ayomiposi is one of the 1,334 nurses who left Nigeria between March and September, even as others prepare to follow in their steps in search of better lives.",
          "summary": "BusinessDay\u2019s analysis of data from the register of the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) of the United Kingdom, shows that a record 1,334 Nigerian trained nurses joined the workforce between March and September 2021.\nFor context, within the same period of 2017, only 23 Nigeria-trained nurses joined the UK workforce.\nWith the recent addition, there are now 5,612 Nigeria-trained nurses in the UK, a 51 percent increase within four years from 2,792 as of March 2017.\nIn February, BusinessDay had reported a four-year high increase in Nigeria-trained nurses joining the UK workforce, but as data continues to show, the exodus is likely to continue and even quicken.\nHowever, by March 2021, when the UK NMC had data for exactly a year after, 685 Nigerian nurses had joined.",

These are some of the fundamental macro economic issues, which is not taking us anywhere. Agricultural business is a serious business in the country. Some of the macro economic situations are changing.\n\n\u201cAs a government, our focus is how to be serious and help address the challenges. 50 to 60 years ago, our communities, society, and the economy were driven by agriculture.

This is the major challenge, amongst other problems.\n\n\u201cSome assistance you are providing is to help us re-enact agriculture again because that is the only thing that can sustain us.

As we continue to watch this case closely, we extend our prayers and support to the Oromoni family.\n\n\u201cAs they mourn the loss of their young son, I pray that Almighty God gives them the strength that they need at this difficult time.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the umbrella body of Ijaw Youths worldwide, the Ijaw Youths Council (IYC) has joined in demanding for justice for the Ikaw born student.\n\nIn a statement signed by Comr. Ebilade Ekerefe National Spokesman, Ijaw Youth Council and made available to newsmen in Warri, the group said,\n\n\u201cWe watched with awe and shock the reported circumstances surrounding the death of a 12-year-old student of Dowen College in Lagos, Sylvester Oromoni Jnr.\n\n\u201cWe have read to our chagrin that the late Oromoni was indeed the latest victim of bully and harrowing assaults by fellow students.\n\n\u201cThe supposed injuries from the beatings led to his death, according to a Twitter user with the handle\n\n@perrisonoromoni, the boy\u2019s cousin.\n\n\u201cTo our utter consternation, the school denied all allegations stating that Oromoni was neither bullied nor beaten but only complained of hip pain after playing football.\n\n\u201cHowever, contrary to the school\u2019s statement, the victim\u2019s cousin rolled out photos and video evidence, which tended to corroborate the fact that the child was bullied and beaten which had led to this avoidable untimely death.\n\n\u201cLate Sylvester Oromoni Jnr is a son of Ijaw land from Ogbeh-Ijoh area of Warri South-West Local Government of Delta State. The circumstances that led to his death are indeed irksome to all Nigerians of good conscience who have displayed tremendous solidarity in the condemnation of evil. We are thankful to them.\n\n\u201cThe Justice we demand is the holistic type that will bring to book the killers of this boy and members of the\n\nschool management, who instead of speaking the truth, soiled their souls by\n\ntrying desperately to cover up the evil deeds.\n\n\u201cWhile we thank and commend the Lagos State Government for its speedy initiative towards shutting down the Dowen College, the Ijaw Youths worldwide wants to call on the Lagos Commissioner of Police to launch a detailed and meticulous investigation into the death of Sylvester\n\nOromoni Jnr.\n\n\u201cWe also call for the arrest of the Principal of the school, students mentioned and staff involved in the\n\nalleged attempt to change the narrative that led to the death. They have shown evidence of a deliberate attempt to conceal murder. The fake story about the hip injury from a game of football shows in clear language that they are complicit in the crime!\n\n\u201cWe want to appeal to the police and other security agencies to be professional and not to be deterred by the massive influence behind the school. The school is a business concern of powerful people.\n\n\u201cThere are online reports quoting the principal of the school as having said that lectures would go on online. This story if true amounts to organizing a party around the corpse of the late Sylvester Oromoni. The state government should halt it.\n\n\u201cWe also demand from the Lagos State Government and the Ministry of Education that the operating license of\n\nthe school be suspended to send a clear signal to careless institutions who place emphasis on their businesses to the utter exclusion of the lives of the future leaders in their care.\n\n\u201cFinally, We commend all concerned Nigerians; we commend the media for the huge attention given to this disturbing development, we commend our celebrities, who trooped out in their numbers in speaking out to condemn this heinous crime while calling for justice to prevail. We are strengthened by the unprecedented solidarity showed by Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe therefore commiserate with Sylvester Oromini Snr and the entire Ogbeh-Ijoh Royal family on this royal blood that has been spilled in a most dastardly manner.\n\n...",

How do we encourage more homegrown businesses leverage the Capital Market for growth? And can the Informal sector participate in the capital markets?\n\nSpeaking on: \u201cTechnology as a Tool for Financial Inclusion in Nigeria: A Fintech Approach,\u201d Toluwalope said that over the past few years, technology had allowed more and more people gain access to financial services.\n\nHe noted that and that has increased by default, the customer base of capital market operators had increased by default with the advent of technology.\n\n\u201cEssentially, the rise of digital financial services means growth for the capital market. In the same vein, by utilising technology to democratise capital market access and participation, we can direct, expand the current digital savings and investment offerings to leverage the capital market for increased returns.\n\n\u201cToday, the average Nigerian can open an account via the APP or by visiting a PocketMoni agent location, send and receive money. We can expand this to include buying shares on the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) or bonds on FMDQ and the likes.\n\n\u201cBillions in investments happen outside the capital markets through unlicensed forex trading, crypto trading and even sports betting platforms.\n\n\u201cThis gives insights into the risk appetite of the average Nigerian. We can leverage technology to capture this value while delivering Financial Inclusion,\u201d he said.\n\nToluwalope said regulators and other stakeholders had explored different initiatives that have been utilised to deliver financial inclusion in the past.\n\nOn regulator-led Initiatives, he explained that implementation of a three-Tier KYC Structure was created to enable financial institutions expand access to the unbanked, while maintaining controls for risk mitigation.\n\nHe added that licensing of Mobile Money & Agent Banking Operators led to the rise of digital wallets and digital-first financial services delivered through the wallet-based ecosystems, rather than bank account based.\n\nHe said licensing of Payment Service Banks enables other non financial entities to leverage their distribution network to deliver financial services at the last mile, among others.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "title": "Gov David Umahi\u2019s anarchic tendencies and failed presidential bid, By Abia Onyike",
          "text": "On the 1st of December, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s newspaper of record, PUNCH carried a news report titled, \u201cUmahi Removes Aides, Suspends Others Over Five Consultants Abduction\u201d. The report had it that Gov. Umahi suspended Permanent Secretaries from Effium Community and removed two Development Centre Co-ordinators in Ohaukwu LGA over \u201cthe lingering crises in the area which led to the abduction of five expatriate construction workers\u201d. Umahi suspended the salaries of the Perm Secs. Though we condemn the criminal act of abduction and kidnapping, but believe that it borders on trite law for Umahi to continue his primitive acts of impunity and brigandage in the name of governing the state. How did he come about this macabre dance?\n\nWhat is the relationship between the abduction and the seizure of salaries of Perm Secs. This is extremely wicked and quite typical of him. Is it the duty of the Governor to start punishing people without any form of authorization?\n\nWho gave him the power to be this lawless and impudent? Has he set up a panel of inquiry to investigate the circumstances surrounding the crises in Effium? Were the Perm Secs indicted by such a panel? What kind of backward administration is Umahi bequeathing in Ebonyi State.\n\nWhat will Umahi do if Gen. Muhammadu Buhari wakes up one day to order his removal from office for the numerous cases of insecurity, intermittent communal disturbances and rampant killings going on in several parts of the state?\n\nI cannot even understand how Umahi\u2019s mind works. The other day, three persons who were arrested and charged to Court over the killing of a young man in Afikpo South LGA were released on the orders of the State Attorney General who is Umahi\u2019s agent in the State Ministry of Justice. A 36-year old young man, Kelechi Amos Irem was brutally killed and Umahi didn\u2019t see the need to allow justice to take its full course but in Effium, the abduction of expatriates can lead to the dismissal of innocent Government functionaries. In the case of Ogwuma Community, the alleged killing by members of a notorious group, MORE KAN BE DONE was normal and the alleged killers must be protected and set free without trial. This is jungle justice and government of double standards as perpetrated by an anarchic ruler, a despot and brutal dictator.\n\nUmahi does whatever he likes and nothing is ever held sacrosanct. No rules are applied. This is raw, crude and unfathomable. Umahi is making a mockery of the Courts in Ebonyi state and he should be called to order. We give it to him as the Head of the Executive Arm of Government but he should know that there is something called \u201cSeperation of Powers\u201d which is in the Nigerian Constitution. The idea of Seperation of Powers was enunciated by Montesquieu, a 17th Century French Philosopher and Judge before Umahi\u2019s great grandfather was born. He should stop his archaic culture of bullying Judges and infiltrating into their duties. It is a shame that someone who has been battling with high level insecurity can come so low to be releasing accused criminals in a capital offence like murder. No wonder the case of unknown gunmen can never be resolved with the constant intervention in court trials to set free hardened criminals. Gov. Umahi is not satisfied with being Governor and Head of Executive branch of Government. He wants to be totalitarian. He will remain restless unless he controls the Judiciary, in addition to the enormous and illegitimate influence which he wields over the Legislature. Such a political obsession is an anathema and has never happened in a democratic society. Umahi may be a good student of Niccolo Machiavelli (1469-1527), the conservative philosopher who taught the world the unethical and crude doctrine that the end justifies the means. But in world affairs, all Machiavellian operatives ended up as villains. They were often ignored by history for their shameless pursuit of naked self interest and callous cash payment.\n\nNobody remembers Joseph Stalin today for good, inspite of his heroism, because he was a murderer. But Leon Trotsky is worshipped with followers all over the world till today. Adolf Hitler is only remembered in a negative sense. But we still remember Rosa Luxembourg positively and hold her in high esteem for her anti-war campaigns. In South Africa, we never remember the Buthelezis, but we remember the liberation fighters of the African National Cingress- Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo, Joe Slovo, Ruth First, Chris Hani, Steve Biko etc . In the history of African military leaders, we hold J. J. Rawlings in high esteem alongside Thomas Sankara. Who remembers the likes of Sani Abacha or renegades like Mobutu Sese Seko or Emperor Bokassa? In the same vein, Umahi will never be remembered except for his evil deeds and destructive antecedents and for his stavartion policies targeted against civil servants( working and retired).\n\nUMAHI\u2019S FRUSTRATIONS AND OUTBURSTS OVER ASUU LEADERSHIP IN EBSU\n\nIn continuation of his anarchic and totalitarian bullying of other independent/autonomous bodies in the polity, Gov. Umahi often manifests his frustrations with the open society. He is jittery that the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) at Ebonyi State University is not under his control, so that he can unilaterally dismiss its leadership as he sacks his own appointees. During his recent presentation of the 2022 budget estimates at Ebonyi State House of Assembly, Umahi threatened that he will go to Court to enable him remove the Executive of the Union.\n\nHe always wants to remove other people from office. He is the only person who cannot be removed, like the Rock of Gibraltar. Well, it is even good he has accepted that he lacks the powers to change the ASUU leadership, the way he ruthlessly destroyed and factionalized other Trade/ House Unions in the state in pursuit of his selfish aggrandizement. Let him go to Court and let ASUU meet him in Court. At least, he now appreciates that he cannot always have his way as an unbridled tyrant in an open democratic system.\n\nUMAHI\u2019S FALTERING PRESIDENTIAL AMBITION\n\nGov. Umahi has been distributing and sharing the resources of Ebonyi state to all kinds of people in Nigeria as part of his inordinate presidential bid.The other day, it was reported in the news that the #25m he doled out to Ohanaeze Youths Wing caused disarray amongst the youths. Not too long ago, I personally criticized Gov. Umahi for giving out #30m to Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka of Adoration Ministry, Emene, Enugu. Trailer loads of rice and yams sent by Umahi to Northern Nigeria are no longer news. Nigerians now make jest of Ebonyians as poor people who are only good at wasting the little resources they have, even while their citizens are rated amongst the poorest Nigerians based on reliable data from National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nUmahi is punishing civil servants and retirees by withholding their salaries, emoluments, pensions and gratuities since 2015. Umahi introduced this evil policy in order to siphone money meant for civil servants for his useless presidential aspiration. A man whose government is indebted to workers, banks and foreign lenders is busy splashing public money in search of an illusive presidency.\n\nWhile these are going on Gov. Umahi\u2019s special task forces are at work in the Abakaliki metropolis extorting money from innocent residents and traders. They raid shops to impose punitive taxes on the poor traders, seizing their wares and dragging them on bare floor. The other day, the premises of a man who sells doors and plywood was invaded. Umahi\u2019s agents looted his shop, carting away his doors and plywood. By the time the dust settled, the building materials had disappeared into thin air. That is the level of brigandage promoted by Umahi\u2019s lawless government.\n\nAnd his phantom/phoney presidential bid has hit the rocks. His party, APC is not looking in the direction of the South East or the North for the Presidential ticket. So, Umahi cannot be President nor Vice President. He is now meandering to see if he can go to APGA or return back to PDP to realize his mad ambition. But when the news broke last week, his foot soldiers started with the lying game.\n\nFull of hubris and utterly shameless, they forgot that this was the same road they travelled in October, 2020 and they started the same journey with self- denial until they were caught red-handed. Umahi should be advised to put a stop to his continuous spraying of Ebonyi money on the streets of Nigeria, unless he wants to go the way of Joshua Dariye or Jolly Nyame, erstwhile Governors of Plateau and Taraba who are currently in a very unpalatable condition at the moment. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\n\nUMAHI\u2019S DAYS IN GOVT. HOUSE ARE NUMBERED\n\nGov. Umahi has less than 18 months to pack out of the Government House and hand over power to his successor on 29th May, 2023. This is the last full year budget he will operate as a sitting Governor. How time flies. This is the second to the last Christmas he will celebrate as an occupant of the Government House. Then he will begin to adjust to go into life outside power, after running a very unpopular government and stepping on toes. As the enemy of the people, he may arrange to go into a reticent hibernation, some sort of exile where he will remain incommunicado and reflect on how he brutalized humanity because of political power. Then God will judge him accordingly.\n\nEbonyians are looking forward to that day when their Chief Oppressor will leave office and they will sing songs of freedom in Thanksgiving. And that would be for those who will survive Umahi\u2019s doomsday regime of starvation and impunity. We look forward to that day.\n\nAbia Onyike is a former commissioner for information in Ebonyi State.",

          "text": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited remitted N511.66 billion between January and October, 2021 to the federation account, about 25 per cent less than the N2.09 trillion expected to be remitted for the period.\n\nAn analysis of the figures by ThisDay showed that for the period under review, the sum of N1.581 trillion was recorded as variance between the budgeted amount and actual sum remitted by the company.\n\nThe data was part of the national oil company\u2019s November presentation to the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC).\n\nThe section of the document tagged, \u201c2021 Monthly Actual NNPC Oil and Gas Revenue and Distribution to FAAC\u201d, indicated that for the entire year, NNPC had projected a total of N2.511 trillion as payment to the three tiers of government. That forecast was largely a mirage, given the severe shortfall posted between January and October.\n\nWhereas the company was supposed to pay N209.30 billion every month into the federation account, the report, which covers its October operations, showed that a paltry N14.85 billion was remitted, representing the least so far released throughout the whole year, apart from April when it remitted nothing,ThisDay reported in\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear how the authorities augmented the shortfall last month, but in November the three tiers of government shared N671.910 billion as FAAC revenue for the month of October, as against N739 billion the previous month.\n\nHowever, a release from the Federal Ministry of Finance stated that the amount was inclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT), \u201caugmentations,\u201d exchange gain, and non-oil mineral revenue.\n\nIn the month also, the federal government received N284.292 billion, states got N209.838 billion, while the 774 local governments received N156.282 billion.\n\nOil-producing states received N21.498 billion as 13 per cent derivation of mineral revenues, according to the communiqu\u00e9 released at the end of the meeting.\n\nUnder the current sharing arrangement, the federal government takes 52.68 per cent of the revenue shared, states get 26.72 per cent, while the local governments get 20.60 per cent.\n\nRecently, Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi, who is also Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), lamented that the NNPC had literally not remitted funds into the FAAC in the last four months.\n\nFayemi added that the failure of the NNPC to remit funds into the federation account was responsible for the decision of his administration, for instance, to slash the subvention of Ekiti State University (EKSU).\n\nA review of the figures released by the NNPC during the November FAAC presentation showed that between January and October, the company was barely able to meet a third of its obligation to the federation.\n\nIn January, the national oil company paid N90.8 billion of the N209.3 billion projection; in February it remitted N64.16 billion and in March, the NNPC paid N41.1 billion into the federation account.\n\nBut in April, it paid nothing to the three tiers of government; in May it was N38.608 billion; in June it paid N47.16 billion while in July it remitted N67.2 billion.\n\nThings appeared better in August, when NNPC remitted N80 billion to the joint account, but it fell again to N67.533 billion in September, before slumping to N14.85 billion in October.\n\nAlthough the mandatory cuts imposed by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) last year initially played a role in the inability of NNPC to meet its obligation to the federation, ageing upstream infrastructure, oil theft and outright sabotage have combined to hobble the country\u2019s oil production.\n\nNigeria has been unable to meet even the tapered production quota allocated to it by OPEC, thereby further reducing its total crude oil export, coupled with the subsidy payment, which continues to eat deep into the national oil company\u2019s resources.",

From the beginning, the government would have worked with the religious leaders and the traditional leaders in discussing this issue so that it would be able to penetrate to the grassroots.\n\n\u201cWe are going to try our best to talk to people to receive this vaccine to prevent it from resurgence.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Prof Ibrahim Umara of the University of Maiduguri, urged political leaders to play a leading role by openly taking the vaccination alongside family members to prove to people that the virus is real.\n\nOn the mandatory vaccination order issued to federal workers by government, Umara said the order is more of moral issue than constitutional matter, noting that it is a moral duty for citizens to abide by the order so as to curtail spread of the virus.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the Head of programme CDD, Mr Allison Timipere, said being that effective information around COVID-19 could be spread from religious angles , the CDD felt that having a sensitisation programmes like this that target religious and traditional leaders would promote sensitisation of the COVID-19 vaccination process to the followers.\n\n\u201cFrom this meeting, the professionals like people from the National Primary Health Care Development Authority and of course, the National Orientation Agency (NOA), could help dispel those negative narrative about the vaccine , so when they returned to their Mosques and Churches they would be better able to inform members of their congregation to begin to accept the vaccines ,\u201d Timipere said.",

It also promised to pay N22.1bn earned allowances to university workers.\n\nWhen contacted on Saturday night, ASUU president told one of our correspondents that government had not met all the demands.\n\nOsodeke said the union would meet on Sunday to take a decision on the issue. As of the time of sending this report, the union was still meeting.\n\n\u201cThe deadline will elapse by Sunday. They only met one out of our requests which is the NEEDS assessment; the revitalisation funds of N30bn but they paid only N20bn to the universities. The other requests have not been fulfilled even the ones they promised. Our officers are meeting tomorrow, we will let you know our decision by tomorrow (Sunday),\u201d he said on Saturday.\n\nWhen contacted at 8:30pm on Sunday, ASUU president said the union was still meeting. \u201cWe haven\u2019t taken a final decision yet. We have to consult all our branches and zones. The national cannot just sit down and call for action. The government didn\u2019t implement what they promised us,\u201d he said\n\nBut Nwajiuba said the ministry of education had written its finance counterpart on the payment, adding that the Minister of Finance had acknowledged the receipt of the letter.He said, \u201cWe have sent a letter to the ministry of finance and in the letter we did a breakdown of each university and the individuals to be paid. We do not pay unions. What we will do is to pay each university. We have done the breakdown.\n\n\u201cI spoke to the minister of finance yesterday and she said she got the letter and her ministry would work with the breakdown that we gave them.

It also promised to pay N22.1bn earned allowances to university workers.\n\nWhen contacted on Saturday night, ASUU president told one of our correspondents that government had not met all the demands.\n\nOsodeke said the union would meet on Sunday to take a decision on the issue. As of the time of sending this report, the union was still meeting.\n\n\u201cThe deadline will elapse by Sunday. They only met one out of our requests which is the NEEDS assessment; the revitalisation funds of N30bn but they paid only N20bn to the universities. The other requests have not been fulfilled even the ones they promised. Our officers are meeting tomorrow, we will let you know our decision by tomorrow (Sunday),\u201d he said on Saturday.\n\nWhen contacted at 8:30pm on Sunday, ASUU president said the union was still meeting. \u201cWe haven\u2019t taken a final decision yet. We have to consult all our branches and zones. The national cannot just sit down and call for action. The government didn\u2019t implement what they promised us,\u201d he said\n\nBut Nwajiuba said the ministry of education had written its finance counterpart on the payment, adding that the Minister of Finance had acknowledged the receipt of the letter.He said, \u201cWe have sent a letter to the ministry of finance and in the letter we did a breakdown of each university and the individuals to be paid.

          "title": "Shekarau visits Tinubu amidst battle with Ganduje for Kano APC",
          "text": "Senator Ibrahim Shekarau on Sunday joined the growing number of chieftains of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, who have visited the former governor of Lagos, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu in his Bourdillon Ikoyi Lagos home in the past few weeks.\n\nShekarau, also a former governor of Kano State, reportedly held a closed door meeting with his Lagos host during the visit.\n\nHowever, no statement has been issued on the purpose of the former Kano governor visit to the Lagos chieftain of his party at least as at the time of writing this story.\n\nBut Shekarau\u2019s visit to Tinubu, who has obviously started consultation with prominent individuals and stakeholders across the country on his interest to run for the presidency in 2023 came against the background of his ongoing battle with Abdullahi Ganduje, the incumbent governor of Kano for the control of the state chapter of APC.\n\nThe Kano chapter of APC had been factionalised with one faction tagged G7 led by Shekarau and the other faction led by Ganduje before the recent congresses of the party.\n\nJust like in other APC states, the G7 faction and the Ganduje faction of the party had elected two parallel executives at the congresses of the party, including the 18 October state congress.\n\nWhile the G7 faction elected Haruna Danzago as the chairman of its executive, Abdullahi Abbas was elected to lead the Ganduje faction of the party.\n\nThe G7 faction had consequently petitioned the National Headquarters of APC.\n\nBut the APC National Appeal Committee had recognized Abbas as the authentic chairman of the party in the state.\n\nShekarau challenged the decision in court, asking for the nullification of the congresses at the ward, local government and state levels conducted by the Ganduje faction while his own should be recognized.\n\nIn a judgment delivered on Tuesday, a Federal High Court in Abuja granted the Senator\u2019s request while also restraining the Ganduje faction from appointing a new executive.\n\nMembers of the Ganduje faction had vowed to appeal that judgment while arguing that the Federal High Court in Abuja lacks the jurisdiction to hear the case.\n\nKano Commissioner for Information, Mohammed Garba, in a statement, also said the court ruling only affected the ward congress of the party.\n\nBut members of the Shekarau faction have been rejoicing over the court judgment.\n\nAnalysts have also been pontificating on its implication for the 2023 presidential ticket of APC, especially if the judgment was not upturned.\n\nFor one, Kano has played pivotal roles in presidential election in Nigeria because of its huge population.\n\nThe state, with the high number of political appointee and party members will even play a crucial role in determining who emerges the presidential candidate of APC because of the huge voting strength it will bring to the table regardless of whether direct or delegate system is used for selection of its flag bearer.\n\nGanduje and members of his faction of APC are believed to be strong supporters of the presidential ambition of Tinubu.\n\nMembers of Kano House of Assembly who are mostly loyalists of Ganduje had also, at various times, pledged to work for Tinubu presidency.\n\nThe former Lagos governor has also paid several visits to Kano.\n\nAnd for the first time in a decade, the annual Tinubu Colloquium was held in the ancient city this year, a move believed to be arranged by Ganduje to popularise the former Lagos governor\u2019s presidential ambition in the Northern part of the country.\n\nThe expectation was that Ganduje will bring in the strength of Kano APC to support Tinubu when the push comes to shove on the selection of APC presidential candidate.\n\nBut with the court judgment which at least for now, effectively put the control of the structure of Kano APC in the hands of Shekarau, such expectation seemed to be in jeopardy.\n\nIndeed, a national newspaper had on Saturday reported that the judgment giving control of Kano APC to Shekarau was a setback for presidential ambition of Tinubu.\n\nBut Senator had not at any time indicated that he is opposed to the former Lagos governor\u2019s speculated presidential ambition.\n\nAt an event at Bayero University Kano on Saturday, Governors Kayode Fayemi and Abubakar Badaru of Ekiti and Jigawa states respectively addressed Ahmadu Haruna Zago as Kano APC\u2019s chairman.\n\nThe recognition of Danzago as Kano APC Chairman by Fayemi, who is also said to be interested in the 2023 presidential ticket of APC was widely reported in national newspapers.\n\nSo, was Tinubu\u2019s meeting with Shekarau a move to get the court sanctioned Kano APC overlord to his side or a trouble shooting effort in a troubled chapter by a concerned party chieftain? Only time will tell.",

Those who declared these bandits as illegal or outlaws suggest that they know who the bandits are and have not done anything about them. For me, it\u2019s a waste of time and a show of ignorance on the part of those who did that because I don\u2019t know who answers bandits, whether they have address or location in such a manner that when they do banditry, you know where you can arrest them.\u201d\n\nHe also added that the prominent advocate for bandits, Sheik Gumi, can only be arrested if those who demanded Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s release are arrested.\n\nGaladima said: \u201cHow about those who went to the President to request the release of Nnamdi Kanu who is the professed leader of IPOB? Why didn\u2019t they arrest those people if you are arresting Sheik Gumi?\n\nFan-Kayode, however, took to his Facebook page to reply to his \u201cerudite old friend.\u201d\n\nHe wrote: \u201cSad to hear these words from an ordinarily profound and erudite old friend like Buba.

          "title": "Omicron COVID-19: Red alert begins, British Airways cancels UK bound flight, passengers stranded, at Lagos Airport",
          "text": "There was momentary confusion Sunday at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) Lagos following the cancellation of the Lagos-London Heathrow, United Kingdom bound flight by the British Airways.\n\nAlthough, the airline said the cancellation was due to operational reasons, Blueprint, however, gathered that the development might not be unconnected with the Omicron variant of COVID-19.\n\nAfter 21 Omicron cases linked to the country, the United Kingdom added Nigeria to its red alert with effect from Monday (4.00am).\n\nCuriously, the airline did not also operate its inbound flight from London to Lagos, thus raising the suspicion that the red alert signal by the UK might have fully taken effect.\n\nSources at the airport linked it to the implementation of the travel ban imposed on countries considered red flags to the new Omicron variant of COVID-19.\n\nWith 134 Omicron cases reported in the UK, from 4am on Monday UK and Irish citizens and residents arriving from Nigeria must isolate in a Government-approved quarantine facility for 10 days, and receive two negative PCR tests, as further precautionary action is taken against the Omicron variant.\n\nWhen Blueprint visited the MMIA Sunday evening, several passengers who had thronged the airport for check-in procedures were turned back as there were few staffers of the airline to attend to their inquiry.\n\nAirport sources further said \u201cthe situation was to get a clearer picture of what\u2019s happening around the Omicron variant of a thing. Don\u2019t forget that Nigeria has been added to the travel red alert. So, I have the feeling that the airline wants to get a clearer picture from the UK authority.\u201d\n\nBut some of the airline workers, who volunteered certain information to the visibly disturbed passengers, said the flight was only rescheduled for the early hours of Monday.\n\nUpon further probe into reasons for the cancellation, flyers, signed by the BA Customer Service Duty Manager Nwanorue Alexander, were freely distributed among the passengers.\n\nOur checks revealed that BA flights from London which ought to have left Saturday night also did not operate.\n\nIt was rescheduled to leave Sunday morning.\n\nAlerting its passengers an email Sunday, the airline wrote: \u201cWe would like to inform you of a change to the departure time of your flight to London Heathrow. Due to operational reasons, we have had to make this adjustment to our schedule. Your flight will now be departing Lagos a day later than originally scheduled.\u201d\n\nNigeria added to red list\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria has been added to the travel red list Monday after 21 cases of Omicron reported in England linked to travel from this country.\n\nCurrently, the vast majority of cases in the UK have clear links to overseas travel from South Africa and Nigeria.\n\nOver the past one week, 21 reported Omicron cases reported in England were said to have originated from Nigeria.\n\nUK Secretary of State for Health Sajid Javid via his official twitter handle had said UK and Irish citizens travelling from Nigeria would be allowed into the country after quarantine for a certain period.\n\nHe tweeted, \u201cIn light of the most recent data, we are taking further action to slow the incursion of the Omicron variant. From 4am on Monday, only UK/Irish citizens and residents travelling from Nigeria will be allowed entry and must isolate in a managed quarantine facility.\n\n\u201cAnd from 4am on Tuesday, anyone travelling to the UK from countries not on the Red List will be required to take a pre-departure test, regardless of their vaccination status.\n\n\u201cVaccines remain our first line of defence\u2014 the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones. Please get vaccinated or #GetBoosted as soon as you can.\u201d\n\nSince then, the geographical spread of Omicron has been on the rise, with 37 countries around the world now reporting Omicron cases and over 134 cases identified in the UK.\n\nNew analysis conducted by the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) indicates that the window between infection and infectiousness may be shorter for the Omicron variant, which increases the efficacy of pre-departure testing as it is more likely to identify positive cases before travel.\n\nIn light of this emerging evidence and the changing global picture with regards to the spread of Omicron, from 4am on Tuesday, anyone wishing to travel to the UK from countries and territories not on the red list must also show proof of a negative PCR or LFD pre-departure test, taken no earlier than 48 hours before departure. This applies to vaccinated passengers and children aged 12 and above.\n\nAirlines will be required to check for pre-departure tests alongside completed Passenger Locator Form, and passengers will not be allowed to board a flight without providing evidence of a negative test result.\n\nGiven the reduced incubation period of the Omicron variant, passengers are advised to take the pre-departure test as close as possible to their scheduled departure to the UK and no earlier than 48 hours before travelling.\n\nAdditional measures were set out by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on November 27, and the Government will review all temporary measures after three weeks to ensure that they remain necessary and proportionate, and this will take place on December 20.\n\nJavid said: \u201cWe knew this winter would be challenging but the arrival of a new variant means we must further strengthen our defences.\n\n\u201cAs our world-leading scientists continue to understand more about the Omicron variant we are taking decisive action to protect public health and the progress of our COVID-19 vaccination programme.\n\n\u201cI urge everyone to do their bit to slow the spread by following the new travel rules, wearing masks where mandatory and most importantly getting the booster jab when called.\u201d",

Jennifer Edosonwan, Akiniyi Olumide and Adeyemi Abiodun.\n\n\u201cAt the close of hearing and deliberation during the conference, which held on 30th October, 2021, eight of the petitions were found to be meritorious while three were not awarded compensation.\n\n\u201cThe sum of N36, 200,000.00 was awarded as compensation to the deserving petitioners. It is however imperative to note that the panel only awarded for grievous bodily harm or other forms of assault occasioned to them or their immediate family members to the exclusion of all other claims.\n\n\u201cHowever, due to the exhaustion of the N400, 000, 000 set aside by the state governor as victims compensation fund, the panel was unable to award the said compensation to the deserving petitioners.\n\n\u201cThe panel consequently recommends that the state government approves and release the amounts awarded to the respective petitioners,\u201d the body suggested.\n\nIn general, the panel recommended the prompt removal of section 84 of the Sheriff and Civil Process Act of 2004, which it said hinders claimants from fully realising judgement sums given by various courts.\n\nIt further called for reinforcement and reinvigoration of the Complaint Response Unit (CRU) of the police force, setting up structures for reporting bad police behaviour, improvement of the general welfare of police, curbing the application of violence by the police and prompt arrest and prosecution of erring officers.\n\nAmong others, it further stated that the constitutional timeframe within which suspects must be kept within custody must be observed at all times.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

This is really impressive. I can say without any equivocation that this hospital has more high-tech medical equipment than all the hospitals in Lagos put together. This is most certainly the best equipped hospital in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\u201cThe medical mission was initiated to cater for the heath need of indigent Nigerian patients in need of cardiovascular healthcare which is quite expensive and not within the means of most Nigerians. With this initiative, there is increased accessibility to these life-saving therapies and increase awareness in the community on prevention and treatment of heart diseases.\u201d\n\nOlofintila said VOOM Foundation is a US-based team of Surgeons and Clinicians which provides Clinical expertise, free surgeries and major surgical consumables such as Oxygenators and Valves among others for these surgeries.\n\nHe added that the HHF was set up to provide care (surgery) to indigent patients and training to willing Clinicians.\n\n\u201cABUAD Multi-system Hospital was established to provide affordable world-class medicare, quality Medical Education and put an end to outward medical tourism through which Nigerians fluff away millions of Dollars on medical bills outside the country\u201d.\n\nOn the competence of ABUAD hospital, Olofintila quoted the immediate past Minister of Health, Prof. Isaac Folorunso Adewole to have said: \u201cThis Hospital will offer us what we hitherto believe cannot happen in this country. It will also improve the poor Health Indicators in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWith what I have seen here today, this Hospital matches the best in the world and it will certainly put an end to medical tourism outside Nigeria.\u201d\n\nVictor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti",

I am ashamed of the sort of accommodation our staff are living in.\n\n\u201cThe council has met the Minister of FCT and he has assured us to do something soon. And a delegation will soon go to FERMA to come in and give the university special consideration especially the roads within the mini campus and the residential areas,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will definitely partner with government agencies, we will attract funding and invite investors and discuss with government to build befitting houses that befits a university lecturer status,\u201d he added.\n\nSpeaking on the theme of the retreat, \u201cNavigating Myriad of Challenges in Managing Universities in Today\u2019s World,\u201d he said they all have a role in repositioning the university by thinking out of the box to surmount the never ending challenges they struggle to carry out their duties.\n\nThe pro-chancellor identified problem of funding and staff attitude to work among reasons for organising the retreat, adding that the session, hopefully would chat a new course for the varsity.\n\nEarlier the Vice Chancellor Prof. Abdul-Rasheed Na\u2019Allah said many factors were fighting against the university, adding that many staff do not do their duties but collect salary.\n\nHe added: \u201cThey do not come to work on time, some do not teach while others spend just an hour and leave.\n\n\u201cIf we must attain the greatness and if we are ready to serve Nigeria truthfully speaking we must put all these things aside, and stop rumours and allegations. If we ready to move forward we must jettison the past.\u201d\n\nHe said the university must be a class of its own and does not need to drag or copy others as it is destiny for other universities to look up to it for excellence and copy them in the concentration of funding, admission, structures and competitiveness , etc.\n\nOn his part the Permanent Secretary of Federal Ministry of Education, Sonny Echono said the retreat was put together to explain the separation of powers and roles to avoid conflicts in the university.\n\nHe said retreat has proven to be useful and improved governing of universities.\n\nEchono noted that Nigerian universities were faced with challenges of sustainable funding, autonomy, industrial harmony, institutional ranking, compliance with status regulations and enhanced governance and administration.\n\nHe opined that to address and mitigate these challenges, the universities would need to remain proactive and continue to come up with appropriate responses particularly in this knowledge driven era.\n\n\u201cA veritable tool in this regard is regular interface between members of councils and principal officers and other stakeholders involved in management of university,\u201d he said.\n\nOn issue of university sustainable funding, he added: \u201cI am of the very strong view that as long as we depend on government budgeting to run university systems, given inadequate priority given to the education sector coupled with other external factors and dwindling resources, expectation from the budgets will continue to remain a challenge.\u201d\n\nHe said funding should be determined based on cost in a particular course of study and what it takes to produce a student over the course of duration of that programme and every stakeholder should partake in it.\n\nKuni Tyessi in Abuja",

          "text": "The ongoing bickering between the Senate and Saipem Nigeria Limited over alleged violation of the Nigerian Local Content Act in the award of contracts for the delivery of the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG)\u2019s $10 billion Train 7 project by the latter, may degenerate to the suspension of the multi-billion dollar project, experts have warned.\n\nAn oil and gas services expert and Vice Chairman of the Petroleum Technology Association of Nigeria (PETAN), Mr. Ranti Omole, gave the warning, pointing out that the progress of the project delivery may be stalled if the Senate exerts its power and forces Saipem to halt further Train 7-related contract awards.\n\nOmole told THISDAY in a phone interview that if that happens, it would have huge negative impact on the nation and NLNG itself, as it would also stall the drive to enhance LNG export and increase the federation\u2019s revenue and other derivatives from the Train 7 project.\n\nThe Senate Committee on Local Content had last Wednesday, accused Saipem of deliberately circumventing Nigeria\u2019s Local Content Act by sidelining Nigerian manufacturers in the bidding for the contract awards as provided for in the law.\n\nBut Saipem responded by saying that it acted on the instruction of its client \u2013NLNG, adding that all it did was within the scope provided by NLNG which allowed it to source for highly specialised steels not available in Nigeria from outside the country.\n\nIt stated that the arrangement was within the finance export scheme between NLNG, South Korea and Italy.\n\nTrain 7 is expected to add eight million tonnes of gas supply to the existing 22 million tonnes and ramp up NLNG\u2019s production by about 35 per cent.\n\nContractors for the project are SCD JV Consortium, comprising Nigerian affiliates of Saipem (Italy), Chiyoda (Japan) and Daewoo (South Korea.\n\nCommenting on the Senate\u2019s squabble with Saipem and the implication of that on the project and the Nigerian economy, Omole said, \u201cNow, if the Senate is forcing a stop on future contracts award and project activities, definitely, it will stall the progress of the project and also stall the time to get the gas \u2013 NLNG\u2019s export. It will also prolong the time the country wants to get more from LNG export.\n\n\u201cAnd nowadays, it\u2019s not just for you to get to market, you just need to get to market at the right time because there are quite a number of LNG projects that are pushing out all over the world. So, it\u2019s good for us to get to market early.\n\n\u201cDefinitely, the impact will be huge if the Senate stalls the project by forcing a stop on future contract award for the continuous delivery.\u201d\n\nThe PETAN vice chairman said the good side of the intervention was that the alarm raised by Senate on the alleged violation of Local Content Act was a warning for Saipem to ensure compliance and improve their grade level to accommodate more local participation.\n\nHe added that the Senate\u2019s alarm was also a warning to all multinational companies in Nigeria that it was no longer business as usual, stressing that contractors may need to further look for where Nigerian companies could do more work by getting technical support from foreign companies whom they partner with in projects execution.\n\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s the good side of it. It\u2019s a warning that it\u2019s no longer business as usual \u2013 you cannot sign Local Content Plan and do whatever you like. So, the more there is competence in Nigerian companies and they get involved in projects execution, the better for the economy,\u201d Omole stated.\n\nHe argued that the Senate has the responsibility to act if Saipem was not complying with the local content plan of the Train 7 project by not patronising local companies that have the capacities to participate in the project.\n\nHowever, in its reaction, NLNG reiterated its full commitment to the delivery of the Train 7 Local Content Plan and the overall delivery of the project.\n\nIn a note sent to THISDAY, yesterday, signed by its General Manager, External Relations and Sustainable Development, Mrs. Eyono Fatayi-Williams, NLNG disclaimed \u201cthe importation of highly specialised steel equipment\u201d, as contained in Saipem\u2019s presentation at the Senate, saying it was based on the approved Nigerian Content Plan for the Train 7 Project.\n\nThe liquefaction company maintained that it was fully committed to its partnership with NCDMB in delivering the Nigerian Content Plan for the Project, in line with its vision to be a global LNG company, helping to build a better Nigeria.\n\nNLNG added that it was working closely with Train 7 Engineering, Equipment and Construction (EPC) contractors and stakeholders in Bonny to ensure that the Train 7 Project\u2019s commitments were delivered.\n\nHowever, NCDMB, the country\u2019s local content agency, declined to comment on the matter as its corporate communications personnel did not respond to an enquiry sent to him as of the time of filing in this report.\n\nPeter Uzoho",

          "title": "Nigeria: Persuade Other Zones for 2023 Presidency, Anyim, Ezeife Urge South East",
          "text": "A former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, a former governor of Anambra State, Chief Chukwuemeka Ezeife, and a host of other stakeholders, have advised the Southeast zone to persuade other geo-political zones to support them to achieve a presidency of the Igbo extraction in 2023.\n\nThey said this on Saturday at the United For Better Nigeria Initiative (UBNI) National Convention in Abuja.\n\nThis is as a coalition of several civil society groups, has hinted of a plan to match to the embassies of the United Kingdom and the United States as part of pressures on President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the electoral bill as passed by the National Assembly.\n\nHowever, Anyim, while speaking at the UBNI convention, said it was neither a right nor legal for the southeast to demand Igbo presidency in 2023.\n\nHe said the Igbo had to persuade other zones to support their dream if they would produce a president in 2023.\n\nAccording to the former senate president, who has also indicated interest to contest the PDP presidential ticket. \u201cIs it right for the Southeast to produce the next president? My answer is legally no, and the reason is that the constitution is clear; the constitution says every Nigerian of 40 years is entitled to aspire for that office.\n\n\u201cOn the other side, morally, is it right? Is it an entitlement? I will say yes, because the federal character principle enshrined in the constitution encourages rotation.\n\n\u201cThe reason I have to make this clarification is that when the right you have is not legal, the only approach and the instrument you have is persuasion.\n\n\u201cSo, the approach, the language will be to persuade others to see reason with you that morally, they should support you to take a turn since it rotates.\u201d\n\nAnyim, therefore, encouraged the Southeast that as they go ahead advocating Igbo presidency, it should be with an attitude of persuasion.\n\nIn like manner, Ezeife said the kind of Nigeria God wanted, when He created Nigeria was for her to develop into a superpower among nations, and raise respect and dignity for all blacks on earth.\n\nHe said one of the ways to achieve the feats the nation wanted was to carry everybody along without discrimination.\n\n\u201cSo, I found Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo and other groups in this place talking about the need for federal character. If you do it that way, there will be unity; if there is fairness, equity, justice, you will have unity and progress.\u201cIn the absence of those, you see where we are now. It is not a matter of giving us president, we don\u2019t give, you have to work for it. The Igbo does not prostrate.\n\n\u201cThe Igbo man does not keel but this time, we are prepared to kneel down to every part of Nigeria, every group, every ethnic group in Nigeria, we are prepared to even prostrate, because we believe in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nEzeife noted that the Igbo people had contributed greatly to the development of Nigeria in terms of infrastructure, intellect and business, adding that, it was time to give the Igbo people the chance to build Nigeria to the standard God wanted it.\n\nCoordinator-General of UBNI, Mrs Nkolika Mkparu, said there was a feeling of political marginalisation after over a century (by 2023), that the Southeast region was yet to produce a president.\n\nMkparu said UBNI, a non-partisan political advocacy group, which had been involved in enlightenment for a united Nigeria deemed it fit to beam searchlight on the issue.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that our strongest strengths are from the north, our great leaders are from the north, so we are working with the whole nation with the understanding that inclusiveness is what will lead Nigeria to a better future. Inclusiveness that will bring us together in one union is what will bring our country together.\n\n\u201cNigeria is huge enough for everybody. Nigeria has the capacity to hold everybody, Nigeria has the intellectuals, Nigeria has all it takes to lift the county. All we are asking for is to give the southeast also a chance to lead.\n\n\u201cAll the other parts have tried. South-south has tried, North has tried, South-West has tried since over 50 years now, so, we are hoping that we should be allowed to try.\u201d\n\nThe guest speaker, Prof. Mutiullahi Olasupo, who is the Director of the Institute for Peace Leadership and Development Studies, University of Abuja, said it was right for the Southeast to produce the next president in the interest of peace and natural law of justice.\n\nHe said it was imperative for all Nigerians to exclusively resolve to see the Igbo presidency achieved in 2023, adding that the same mechanism that produced former President Olusegun Obasanjo in 1999, should also repeat itself by 2023, to produce a president from the South-East.\n\n\u201cOut of all the six geo-political zones in this country, it is only the southeast that has not produced the president in this country. Does that mean that the South East is not being recognised as a geopolitical zone in Nigeria?\u201d he asked.\n\nMeanwhile, a coalition of several civil society groups, in a statement titled, \u201cElectoral Bill: 2-Days of Civic Action. Let\u2019s Rise and Defend our Democracy\u201d, said they had slated Wednesday and Thursday, 8th and 9th of December, 2021, for protests to compel President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the electoral bill as further delays might be dangerous\n\nVenue for the two protests are the US/UK Embassy Central Business District, Abuja, beginning from 7:00am in the morning\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s prevail on Mr. President to assent to the Electoral Bill and stop further delay. Nigerians want it signed now. Allow the will of the people rather than few politicians,\u201d the group stated.\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja",
