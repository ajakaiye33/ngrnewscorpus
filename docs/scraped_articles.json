          "text": "Senate\n\nSays this cost of smuggling business is very huge and debilitating to Nigerians\n\nTo Summon the NSA, Chief of Army Staff, Chief of Naval Staff, others on Smuggling\n\nAs Lawan Pallies with paramilitary chiefs over border security\n\nWe have porous borders and absence of governance at the border communities making their job difficult, Customs CG\n\nBy Henry Umoru\n\nABUJA- THE Senate has asked all the heads of Security agencies and paramilitary heads in the country to as a matter of urgency, stem the huge level of smuggling of Petroleum products in the country.\n\nSpeaking yesterday in Abuja when he met with heads of security and paramilitary agencies, the President of the Senate, Senator Ahmad Lawan who tasked them to do more to checkmate smuggling of petroleum products out of Nigeria, said that the cost of smuggling business is very huge and debilitating to Nigeria and Nigerians.\n\nREAD ALSO:Group lauds NASS for supporting NYSC Trust Fund Bill\n\nLawan has vowed to summon the National Security Adviser, NSA, Major- General Babagana Monguno, rtd who is supposed to coordinate the entire security apparatus for protecting the nation\u2019s borders; the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Farouk Yahaya; the Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Awwal Zubairu Gambo and others as to come up with the way forward against the backdrop that a lot of our products are shipped out to other countries through the water ways.\n\nIn attendance at the meeting were the Comptroller General of Nigerian Customs Service, Col. Hameed Ali(rtd), Commandant General, Nigerian Civil Defence Corps, Ahmed Abubakar Audi, representative of the Director General of the State Security Service, San Gesto and representative of the Comptroller General of Nigerian Correctional Service, Haliru Ishaka Abdulmumini\n\nIn his opening remarks, Lawan said that the meeting was a follow up to the Monday meeting with Finance and Petroleum Ministers which was to find a way forward on the administration and Management of fuel subsidy in Nigeria\n\nThe President of the Senate said, \u201cWe are all aware that some of the products particularly the PMS is smuggled out and yet we paid subsidy on what is smuggled out.\n\n\u201cSo this meeting( yesterday) is to look into the ways and means of controlling the smuggling of the petroleum products with a view to minimising the cost of fuel subsidy to our country.\n\n\u201cI know individually, these organisations have been carrying out their responsibilities on this, but I think that we are coming into a special moment. Our situation is such that we cannot afford anymore to allow this smuggling business to continue because the cost is very huge and debilitating to our people.\n\n\u201cAt a point I will hold a meeting with the National Security Adviser who is supposed to coordinate the entire security apparatus for protecting our borders.\n\n\u201cI will also hold some engagement with the military especially the Navy because a lot of our products are shipped out to other countries through the water ways.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day what we hope to achieve is to minimise or where possible eliminate the incidents of smuggling of petroleum products that we import into the country for our people.\n\n\u201cThe figures of what we consume in the country continue to fluctuate. At one point it was almost 100 million litres per day and surely this is difficult to believe that we consume almost 100 million litres per day within our borders. Certainly, a good percentage of it goes out.\n\n\u201cThis will be the first engagement but certainly this is not the last. We need to look at the strategy, maybe how we undertake our activities at the borders, the different agencies, the inter-agency cooperation that is so essential between the agencies. The application of technology in surveillance and who should host that technology.\n\n\u201cI believe there is a need for deployment of drones and other technologies that are available these days and probably the office of the National Security Adviser should be able to be in charge of that and make the information and data available to all the agencies that need them.\n\n\u201cI believe at one point, we will need the participation of the NCC being the major Institution in our country in charge of the enhancement of technology, the ICT particularly.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you this is going to be a special partnership between the National Assembly and the executive arm of government because today\u2019s situation demands that we do things differently.\n\n\u201cOur Committees in the Senate that supervise the Customs, the security agencies, will be up to date with their oversight. We need to see in the next six months, what different strategies will bring to us.\n\n\u201cWe want to see also our citizens participating in the surveillance. We have to mobilise our citizens especially those at the borders. That when they see trucks conveying petroleum products to our neibouring countries, they should not only say something, they should say it to those who need to know. And that is to our security agencies.\n\n\u201cSo we need to mobilise our citizens as well because this is something that affect all of us. Not about government. And anyway, government is about the people.\n\n\u201cWhat we are trying to do is to reduce the level of snuggling of petroleum products out of Nigeria and that will translate into reducing the bill that we pay as petroleum subsidy.\u201d\n\nResponding, the Comptroller General of the Nigerian Customs Service, Col. Hameed Ali, rtd\n\nwho complained of porous borders and absence of governance at the border communities which made their job difficult, said that his agency had been doing a lot in trying to ensure that the smuggling of petroleum products out of Nigeria was minimised to the bearest level.\n\nHameed Ali said, \u201cLet me say here generally speaking, that we have a porous border. You also know we do not have all those equipments you have made mention of in ensuring the surveillance of our borders.\n\n\u201cAnd one more critical thing is that, within our border communities, there is no presence of governance. Our border communities completely lack presence of governance.\n\n\u201cTherefore, those of us who are shouldered with the responsibility of ensuring that we gate keep, we find it difficult because the ordinary man in Some border does not see reason why he should be compliant, does not see reason why he should work with the security in Nigeria to protect the border.\n\n\u201cThis is simply because there is no presence of governance. In some areas, this border community cross to other country to get basic amenities.\u201d",
          "summary": "\u201cSo this meeting( yesterday) is to look into the ways and means of controlling the smuggling of the petroleum products with a view to minimising the cost of fuel subsidy to our country.\n\u201cAt the end of the day what we hope to achieve is to minimise or where possible eliminate the incidents of smuggling of petroleum products that we import into the country for our people.\n\u201cOur Committees in the Senate that supervise the Customs, the security agencies, will be up to date with their oversight.\nThat when they see trucks conveying petroleum products to our neibouring countries, they should not only say something, they should say it to those who need to know.\nAnd that is to our security agencies.",

          "text": "By Johnbosco Agbakwuru\n\nABUJA\u2014THE Presidency last night attacked the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom over his comment when he appeared on Arise television programme where he said that Nigerians are regretting voting for President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015.\n\nThe Presidency accused Ortom of blaming the President where he has allegedly done nothing to improve the welfare of the Benue state people.\n\nREAD ALSO:Police score Obaseki high as Orhionmwon gets first area command\n\nIn a statement issued by Mallam Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, the Presidency said Nigeria has had enough of failed politicians who blame others as a diversion for their inability to improve citizens\u2019 lives.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cThere are two types of politicians in Nigeria today. The first are politicians who are leaders that offer solutions to the challenges facing the voters and the country. They bring forward policies, and implement them, to improve the lives of others.\n\n\u201cThe second, politicians who offer excuses for the challenges voters face. They avoid ideas and instead blame others for problems they have either not solved or have themselves created.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari is a leader. He inherited a treasury that had been emptied by previous administrations \u2013 and he sought and succeeded in repatriating billions of dollars of stolen funds from overseas. His administration discovered more than 500,000 bank accounts operated by Ministries, Agencies and Departments. In these accounts, the money belonging to the government was kept.\n\n\u201cSame government agencies went to the banks to borrow money kept by sister agencies at exorbitant interest rates. What is more, some of the signatories had left the service or were \u201cunknown\u201d and so no one had access to the funds.\n\n\u201cMDAs are now compelled to use the Treasury Single Account, TSA, domiciled in the Central Bank of Nigeria. And the President brought forward the first and only plan to address farmer-herder clashes in 100 years, supporting states to rediscover grazing reserves and create ranching lands that have successfully reduced tensions while increasing harmony and saving lives.\n\n\u201cGovernor Samuel Ortom, office holder, is that other politician. He inherited unpaid salaries and pension arrears \u2013 and rather than find a way to raise the funds to pay them, he has blamed the President.\n\n\u201cThis is a President who has not failed to pay the salary of those working for the federal government and declared the failure of states to do so \u201ca national disaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo avert this, he had, at various times lent money to the states in excess of N1.682 trillion, and Benue, Mr Ortom\u2019s state did not miss out on all occasions: Salary Bailout, Excess Crude Loan and Budget Support loan, each repayable in 20 years. Lagos for instance didn\u2019t collect any of the loans.\n\n\u201cA few other states declined to take one or two. Mr Ortom, an office holder who collected on all occasions, currently holds the country\u2019s longest record of unpaid salaries and pensions, has no reason, absolutely no reason, to blame President Buhari for the mess in which he put his state and its workers.\n\n\u201cHaving first come claiming that his predecessors created the arrears, it was his business to prove that he was better by paying. Instead of doing that, he joined them! And while he runs up even further salary and pension debts on top of those he was bequeathed, instead of respecting the voters who elected him to office, he publicly attacks them in unprintable words and has raised his own thuggish militia to harass and violate them.\n\n\u201cThe Governor now claims the voters wish to be \u201crescued by the PDP\u201d and \u201cregret voting for Buhari.\u201d The voters, of course, will not be asked to vote for the President again because \u2013 as a leader \u2013 President Buhari and the All Progressives Congress, APC respect term limits and the constitution, and will stand down next year at the end of his second democratically elected mandate.\n\n\u201cIt seems unlikely, however, that any voter would seriously consider it possible to be \u201crescued\u201d by a party that would today, allow a politician such as Governor Ortom in its ranks.\n\n\u201cWhat is certain, however, is that Nigeria has had enough of failed politicians who blame others as a diversion for their inability to improve citizens\u2019 lives.\u201d",

          "text": "A Project Development Agency, PRODA, under the Ministry of Science and Technology is currently engulfed in an internal crisis following ongoing attempts to sack the Director-General, Dr. Fabian Okonkwo.\n\nDAILY POST reports that the agency\u2019s DG was recently sacked following a recommendation by the investigative panel set up to look into the allegations by the board of the agency, then headed by its Chairman, Comrade Dan Onjeh.\n\nThe board had raised about seven strong allegations against the then DG, but forces in the ministry and other interested parties frustrated its effort to sanitize the agency.\n\nA source in the agency told DAILY POST that, \u201cdespite the effort of the board to sanitize the agency, forces frustrated the board to the point of asking the then board Chairman, Comrade Dan Onjeh to step down.\u201d\n\nIt said that in the wisdom of the investigative panel set up to look into the seven-strong allegations leveled against the then DG by the board, he was sacked.\n\nIn the report of the investigative panel obtained by DAILY POST, all seven allegations including those of violation of staff promotion process, recruitment, contracts and others, were all upheld by the panel.\n\nThe panel consequently recommended the sack of the then DG, with the presidency acting upon the recommendation.\n\nBut a report available to DAILY POST says the new board of the agency allegedly working with some forces had sacked the DG that took over in acting capacity from the then DG.\n\n\u201cAfter the DG was sacked, another board was set up because the Ministry of Science and Technology said the tenure of the board had elapsed. But that\u2019s not even the problem, the new board was not comfortable with the man acting as the DG. He was fired. There are forces interested in ensuring that the person in charge must allow them to run the way they want to run, especially in relation to contracts and others.\n\n\u201cWhen the Acting DG was sacked, the most senior person in the agency, Dr. Fabian Okonkwo stepped in as the new Acting DG. And since his emergence, he has known no peace as the new board is now after him.\n\n\u201cThey want him to go back to the initial recommendations by the House of Reps committee which was in line with what the then DG and the ministry wanted. And because he wanted to follow due process in his dealings with the board and award of contracts, they are now looking for how to push him out of office,\u201d the source told DAILY POST.\n\nOur correspondent gathered that on Tuesday, January 25, 2022, the board Chairman, Hon. Emma Eneukwu, was at the PRODA headquarters in Enugu to hand over a sack letter to the DG, who was said to be out of office. The letter, according to sources, was at the instance of the ministry working with the board to ensure that the DG leaves office.\n\nThe source said, \u201cBecause the agency\u2019s DG is not dancing to the tune of the board, it\u2019s now in alliance with the Ministry to remove Mr Fabian. Just imagine that the DG has always been away from the office because of the several threats by the board. I think he is saying he can\u2019t be taking orders from them because he is answerable to the presidency who appointed him.\u201d\n\nWhen DAILY POST contacted Eneukwu, he said the board was not interested in the job of the DG, and they were only carrying out the directive of the ministry, alleging that the DG was running the agency down. He said, \u2018\u2019Whether he is DG or not, it doesn\u2019t concern us. He is running the board down.\n\n\u201cWe came in here and we saw him running the place down, grounding the place completely. He has no interest in uplifting the place. His interest is to sell the place and make money from it and the board is not happy about it. The board is not interested in anybody being DG or not, our interest is to make sure the place thrives.\n\n\u2018\u2019Any DG that comes with the interest of running the place down, the board will not be happy with him. And the ministry is aware of the development and is doing something about it. The board reports to the ministry, and it\u2019s the ministry that oversees these things that will take decisions. And I think they have taken the decision which is being implemented.\n\n\u201cThe board doesn\u2019t implement, the board doesn\u2019t remove. The board only advises on steps that should be taken. The board is not interested in the day-to-day adjudication of happenings.\n\n\u2018\u2019I don\u2019t know who Fabian is. I met him for the first time when they appointed me board chairman but he refused to allow the board to sit. There is a regulation that guides the board and the parastatal. Since we came in, we have never sat. For 3 months now! Where does this happen? \u2018\u2019\n\nWhen the board chairman was asked to highlight areas the DG was running the agency down, he said he was not in the position to respond to that question as he was working on the implementation of the directive of the ministry. And when he was asked to disclose the position of the ministry he is implementing, he hung up.\n\nWhen the DG, Dr Fabian was reached, he declined comments on the matter.\n\nAttached to this report is the petition by the Dan Onjeh-led board, the observation of the panel, as well as its final report and recommendations leading to the sack of the then DG.",

          "title": "Dogara speaks on suspension as Jakada Bauchi by Emirate Council",
          "text": "The immediate past Speaker, House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Yakubu Dogara, on Tuesday, absolved himself of the recent attack on the emirs of Bauchi and Dass by irate youths over the recent violence in the Bogoro and Tafawa Balewa local government areas.\n\nThe convoys of the emirs of Bauchi and Dass, Alhaji Rilwanu Adamu Sulaiman and Alhaji Usman Bilyaminu Othman, were on 31st December, 2021 attacked on their way to Bogoro to attend the 21st memorial anniversary of Sayawa crusader, Baba Peter Gonto, following violence that erupted over the anniversary.\n\nThe attack led to the suspension of the former speaker as Jakada Bauchi by the Bauchi Emirate Council until the final determination of the case filed against him and others before the state High Court by the state government.\n\nA statement distributed to journalists in Bauchi by Dogara\u2019s media aide, Turaki Hassan Adamu, stated that while he was yet to be served with any letter of suspension by the emirate council, he was not informed of any allegation of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cYesterday (Monday), January 24, 2022, the Bauchi Emirate Council purportedly announced my suspension as Jakadan Bauchi. As of today, I am yet to be served with any letter of suspension and more tenuously. I was never informed that there was an allegation of wrongdoing against me pending before the Emirate Council.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t join issues with the emirate council because of the respect I have for both His Royal Highness and the Emirate Council.\n\n\u201cBut because there is a ludicrous and legally inchoate criminal complaint filed against me and others by the Governor of Bauchi State and his money bag lackey who are at the centre of it all, I have decided to state my own side of the story as several well wishers and even the press have inundated me with request to respond to events of yesterday so that I am not convicted in the court of public opinion,\u201d Dogara stated.\n\nAccording to him, the letter of his purported suspension, which was not on the Bauchi Emirate Council\u2019s letterhead, was all over the social media, adding that the reason for the suspension was clearly hearsay.\n\nIn his words, \u201con close examination, I noticed that the letter of suspension as seen on social media is not contained in the real letter head of Bauchi Emirate Council. That speaks volumes.\n\n\u201cMoreso, the reason for the suspension, if true, was that my \u201cname was mentioned,\u201d which clearly is hearsay. Bauchi Emirate is one of the oldest in the country and I doubt they would take a decision based on hearsay, especially when I am available and can be invited to appear before the Emirate council to face any allegations of wrongdoing against me. This, if true, is no doubt a violation of my constitutionally guaranteed right to fair hearing.\n\n\u201cIt is additionally alleged in the letter under reference that I didn\u2019t sympathise with the two Emirs over the unfortunate incident involving them, which is totally untrue.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, reproduce below the message I sent to the two Emirs in the aftermath of the incident for all to see: \u2018I wish to write and extend my sympathies to you over the unfortunate incident involving your entourage while making your way from Bauchi to Bogoro earlier today. It is a huge embarrassment to all of us in my constituency and the entire state which I totally condemn and disavow.\n\n\u201cIt is worth noting that I would have loved to personally visit to extend my apologies on behalf of my constituents but I know that such a visit would be misconstrued as was the case in the past when the gates of some palaces were shut anytime I visited as Speaker.\n\n\u201cIt is pointless to emphasise that the incident was totally avoidable as I had already requested the security agencies to obtain security guarantees from the organisers of the event failing which they should advise them to postpone the event in the interest of peace. It was therefore mindless in the first place, for anyone to have encouraged you to put yourself in harm\u2019s way, especially when it was obvious that a security breach was more probable than likely granted the tension generated by the recklessness of those who were supposed to show leadership.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, his messages were sent through a proxy for obvious reasons, adding that there are witnesses to the fact that his messages were delivered and acknowledged.\n\nHe added that, \u201cIt was also said in the letter under reference that I did not show remorse over the incident. As we all know, remorse comes as a consequence of guilt. The Emirate council cannot convict me over hearsay, without investigation and without inviting me to face any allegations against me.\n\n\u201cI maintain a clear conscience before God that I have nothing to do with any mayhem in Zaar land, not least the incident involving the two Emirs as I had no inkling whatsoever that they would be attending an event that was already marred by crisis before it began.\n\n\u201cI make bold to say, without any equivocation, that I did not know the Emirs have been invited to attend the event and even if invited, that they would indeed attend because none of the two Emirs is accustomed to attending any such event in Zaar land.\n\n\u201cTherefore, how could I have been responsible for any incident involving them? Those who should show remorse are those who insisted on going on with the event and unconstitutionally flooded the area with soldiers whose actions led to the breakdown of law and order in the area.\u201d\n\nDogara, who represents Bogoro/Dass/Tafawa Balewa Federal Constituency in the National Assembly, however, submitted that the council\u2019s decision might have been influenced by the Bauchi State government, which he alleged had been pressurising the Emir of Bauchi to withdraw his traditional title.\n\n\u201cEven if it turns out to be true that the Emirate Council did what they must do, it would be no surprise to keen watchers of events in Bauchi State. I am aware that both His Royal Highness and members of the Council have been under tremendous pressure from the Bauchi State Government to withdraw the traditional title conferred on me for quite some time now.\n\n\u201cIt is all part of a smear campaign to portray me as insensitive and convict me in the court of public opinion for the political gains of some desperate characters,\u201d he stated.",

It means we will not have people to run to in the future. I encourage them to join the police and other force.\n\n\u201cMaybe our youths are not encouraged by the behaviour of our police hence they are not joining. There is also a need to take care of the police welfare and needs.\n\n\u201cIn some places where you see the police, you admire them and want to join because the right thing has been done in taking care of them\u2026\u201d He said.\n\nSimilarly, Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, who was represented by AIG Olusola Subair (rtd) said: \u201cWe all need to know that we can only attain prosperity in an ambience of security.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the police, we need to do a lot of homework that will make people to be attracted to the job.\n\n\u201cThe police officer must know that a little effort can go a long way to change the way you are perceived by the public. There has to be an effort to change the narrative.\u201d\n\nAddressing the audience, Chairman, Police Service Commission (PSC), IGP Musiliu Smith (rtd.), assured that some of the issues raised would be looked into, urging that responsible and upright young citizens should be encouraged to apply to breach numerical shortfalls and put the country on the right path in efficient policing.\n\nSmith noted that the police and policing were indispensable to a peaceful and growing country that is determined to change the narrative on the issue of her internal security.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe must continuously raise alarm if we notice that some criminal elements in our community are applying to join the police with the recommendation of some community leaders.\n\n\u201cWe must therefore all come together as a community to ensure that only the best are recruited into the Nigeria Police. The PSC has adopted an approach to improving police, citizens relationships through community engagement forums such as this one where issues that affect citizens are addressed.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of providing security and safety is defeated if the police as a security organisation are contaminated with persons who are criminally-minded thanks to the poor calibre of those applying for the recruitment.\n\n\u201cNo one knows better the character of its citizens than members of the community therefore, citizens are encouraged to kindly urge people of good character to join the force.\n\n\u201cThose applying for intake should take the process seriously by preparing very well for the examination to give them the best possible chance of success.\u201d",

          "text": "Importation of petroleum products should be stopped forthwith by the Federal Government because it is \u201cakin to handing over our national sovereignty to other climes,\u201d the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has said.\n\nThe congress argued that it was foolhardy for the government to think it could regulate the price of a product it does not produce.\n\nIt berated the government for continuing to pay subsidies on petroleum products, thereby abandoning the nation\u2019s refineries after spending $9.5 billion on their Turnaround Maintenance and Greenfield refineries between 2012 and now.\n\nThe NLC stated these in a letter it addressed to the governors as key members of the Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo-led National Economic Council. The council had recommended that the pump price of fuel be increased from N162.50 to N302 per litre.\n\nThe letter is jointly signed by NLC President Ayuba Wabba and General-Secretary Emmanuel Ugboaja.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nIn the letter, the congress insisted that its Thursday planned protests would go ahead because an increase in petroleum products price, whether now or in the future, would inflict more hardship on Nigerians.\n\nIt warned that workers would have no other choice than to down tools any time the government decided to impose another round of petrol price hike.\n\nThe congress accused government of failing to honour an agreement with the organised labour on the freezing of further increases in the pump prices.\n\nIt also expressed dismay that government failed to reconvene a committee meeting on petrol and electricity tariffs for over two years despite entreaties from organised labour.\n\nLabour argued that the \u201cperennial increase of the pump price of petrol\u201d amounted to \u201ca transfer\u201d of its failure and inability to effectively govern the country.\n\nThe NLC said it was befuddling that India and Kuwait that host some of the world\u2019s oldest refineries had expanded the production capacities of their facilities while Nigeria remains unable to maintain its own that are not as old.\n\nIt said: \u201cDigboi Refinery in Upper Assam India is reputed to be the oldest operating refinery in the world. The Digboi Refinery was commissioned on 11th December 1901 with an installed capacity of 0.5 million bpd but has over the years been up-scaled to 0.65 million bpd.\n\n\u201cThe Mina Al-Ahmadi Refinery in Kuwait which was built in 1949 with an initial capacity of 25,000 bpd has been scaled up to currently process 466,000 bpd.\n\n\u201cThe connecting dot between the two refineries is that both are in developing countries with similar colonial antecedents like Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe predatory argument that our refineries are too old for maintenance, therefore, falls flat in the face.\u201d\n\nPart of the letter reads: \u201cIt is the well-considered view of Nigerian workers as conveyed through the leadership of organised labour that the proposed hike if it goes through, would induce and impose an unprecedented degree of hardship on Nigerian workers, their families and the generality of the populace.\n\n\u201cNigerian workers understand that government pays out significant amount of money as so-called petrol subsidy. Nigerian workers also appreciate the fact that the monies spent on the so-called petrol subsidy would be totally unnecessary if the government is alive to its responsibilities of proper management of critical national assets, especially our local refineries.\n\n\u201cIt is the mismanagement of our four public oil refineries over the years by successive governments that have opened the floodgates of mass importation of refined petroleum products and consequently unfurled incessant increases in the prices of refined petroleum products.\n\n\u201cThe fact is very clear \u2013 there is no way a country can control the price of what it does not produce. For a critical national security product like petrol and other refined petroleum derivatives, the situation is akin to handing over our national sovereignty to other climes. There is no better description of neo-colonialism and toxic neo-liberalism than this.\u201d\n\nThe NLC noted that the incessant hike in the pump price of petrol is self-inflicted and therefore totally unacceptable.\n\nIt blamed the trend on the failure of the government to maintain the public refineries and build new ones, institutionalise importation price model, incongruities in the petroleum sector/broader governance challenges and non-implementation of agreements.\n\nThe congress added: \u201cOver the years, the government has invested billions of taxpayers money into overhauling our national refineries with no commensurate results. Between 2012 and now, about $9.5 billion has been spent on Turn Around Maintenance (TAM), Greenfield Refinery Projects and even public investments in private refineries, yet Nigeria still imports almost 100 per cent of its refined petroleum product needs.\u201d\n\nAs a way forward, the NLC advised that the \u201cFederal Government should re-engage Organided Labour in discussions in order to find acceptable solutions to the current quagmire in the downstream petroleum sub-sector.\u201d\n\nIt urged the government to show \u201ccommitment to overhauling our local refineries as a lasting panacea to mass importation of refined petroleum products.\u201d\n\nThe congress also suggested that \u201cgovernments at all levels should take immediate steps to improve governance and public accountability in order to regain the confidence of Nigerians that the cardinal constitutional mandate of guaranteeing the welfare and security of Nigerians has not been traded off.\u201d\n\nIt explained that the protests on Thursday are \u201conly geared at alerting the government to the sufferings that Nigerians are going through and the additional insufferable trauma that Nigerians would be subjected to if the government goes ahead with the hike in the price of refined petroleum products.\u201d\n\nBut it warned, \u201cthat workers would have no other choice than to down tools once the government goes ahead to force another round of petrol price increment.\u201d",

          "title": "\u2018How I became first serving police SAN\u2019",
          "text": "Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Simon Asamber Lough made history on December 8, 2021 when he became the first police officer in Nigeria to be admitted to the Inner Bar as a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN). He enlisted in the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) as a Cadet Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) in 2000 and was called to Bar the following year. In this interview with ERIC IKHILAE , he spoke about his career, how he got the SAN rank on his first application and the problems with the nation\u2019s criminal justice system.\n\nWhat informed your choice of law as a field of study?\n\nWhen I was growing up, I read much of the Bible. That was my foundation in life. There was a book called \u2018My Book of Bible Studies,\u2019 with a lot of pictorial illustrations. I read that book from A to Z.\n\nI liked the roles Moses, Joshua and Elijah played in the Bible. By then, I was in primary school. I was yet to decide on anything. When I went to secondary school, I was groomed to be an accountant, because I was very good in mathematics. I represented the then Gongola State in mathematics competitions.\n\nSo, my school\u2019s principal encouraged me by always saying one day, you could become a bank manager or even grow to become the Governor of the Central Bank.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nBut, my love for the roles Moses, Joshua and Elijah played, as saviours, who were brought in to salvage situations, I thought as a bank manager, I may not be able to play such a role in life.\n\nFor me, banking as a field appeared too restricted. So, along the line, the idea of law came along. But, the problem was that I was not interested in English Literature. I only became interested when I learnt it was impossible to read Law without first passing English Literature in secondary school.\n\nI concluded that for me to play those roles like Moses, Joshua and Elijah, I had to read Law. I also concluded that it was through law that you could do justice to people the way I want.\n\nAt that time, Gani Fawehinmi (SAN), now late, was just coming up. I became fascinated by his style of activism as a lawyer, and I said this is the type of role I want to play. I wanted to be involved in advocacy for people for free, to ensure that you do justice to people. This was what informed my decision to read law.\n\nWhat about the choice of policing as a profession?\n\nThe person who inspired me to become a policeman was a former Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Ogbonna Onovo. He came to our school when I was in secondary school. I was in form five. He was then a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP). He dressed very neat. That is the neatest policeman I have ever seen. He remained neat until he retired. When he visited our school and addressed us, I made up my mind that day that I was going to become a policeman.\n\nWhat has the experience been so far?\n\nI have served in many departments since I passed out of the Police Academy. But, in the Operations Department, we used to confront armed robbers and exchanged fire with them.\n\nWhen you arrest them, you hand them over to those who will prosecute them. But, at a point, I noticed that these same armed robbers that we arrested were back in the society, they had been released.\n\nThere was one particular incident that made me feel that this practice had to stop. We arrested a gang of armed robbers in Area Eight, Abuja. They attacked one lady and raped her two daughters.\n\nWhen we were alerted, we went there, confronted them and killed two of them there. The others were arrested and handed over to those who should prosecute.\n\nAfter some time, I went to do something in Wuse (Abuja) and somebody started shouting, \u201cOga! Oga! Oga!\u201d I was surprised. I wondered who was calling me oga.\n\nI could not recognise him, but he knew me. I moved closer to him and asked what he wanted, and he said: \u201cOga, were you not among those who arrested us at Area Eight? Have you forgotten?\u201d.\n\nWhen I asked how he got out, he said they were arraigned in court, remanded in Suleija Prison (Niger State) and, after some time, they were granted bail.\n\nHe added that the prosecutor had stopped coming to court. He said he saw me and felt he should greet me. This was a person we arrested while committing armed robbery. I felt bad.\n\nSo, when I got to the Legal Department, I made up my mind that I must ensure that people get justice. I could not just imagine how the lady, whose daughters were raped, would feel if she runs into that same man that called me in Wuse.\n\nI felt for her and other victims of crimes. At that point, I made up my mind that once I charge an armed robber to court, I will ensure you are diligently prosecuted until justice is served.\n\nThat is why in all the armed robbery cases I prosecuted, the defendants were convicted. I have also done cases of murder and have secured a number of convictions.\n\nWhich of the cases would you say tasked you most?\n\nI can recall many. There was one in which some priests were killed in Benue State. I prosecuted those involved. It took us just eight months. The current Chief Judge of Benue State was the presiding judge. After delivering judgment, the judge confessed that that was the fastest case ever prosecuted in his court and for all his years as a judge.\n\nThere was also the case of a notorious pastor, who raped a lady. I also prosecuted him and secured conviction. I also prosecuted those behind the mass killing in Ife (Osun State) where over 40 persons were killed. I secured conviction. I have done many other cases in Bayelsa, Abia, Sokoto, among other places.\n\nWhat would you consider as the major challenges as a police prosecutor?\n\nOne of our major challenges is the reluctance of victims to attend court to give evidence in the course of prosecution. A person will be robbed, his property would be recovered, but when he/she is invited to give evidence, to tell the court what happened, they will be so sceptical. And, I used to pay their transport with my money. But, for them to come to court testify, and for the court to know that they are the victims and the owners of the recovered property, they will be reluctant and sceptical.\n\nCould it be that they are afraid?\n\nSure. Some of them claim to be afraid. But, I tell them these people (the defendants) are in prison, you have nothing to be scared of, since most of the armed robbery cases are not bailable. After much persuasion, some will agree to come to court\n\nI recall an armed robbery incident at an Anglican Church in Wuse Zone Five. Members were attending a conference and they were robbed. Four of the robbers were arrested, but I had to plead with them (the victims) before only two, including a naval officer (whose uniform and other personal items were stolen) agreed to give evidence in court. Out of the about 15 people that were robbed, only two agreed to come to court.\n\nDon\u2019t you think this requires that people should be more sensitised about their civic responsibilities?\n\nI agree. I think we should always see it as our civic responsibility to give evidence if we have been robbed or become victims of any other crime.\n\nWithout you coming to court to give evidence, how do you think the court would be convinced that the crime was actually committed or that the incident actually took place? Particularly in the case of robbery, the victim must come to court to give evidence, to tell the court that, yes, this was what happened.\n\nHow do you respond to the argument that poor investigation affects the success of criminal prosecution?\n\nActually, if a case is not properly investigated it will be difficult to secure conviction. So, as an intelligent prosecutor, when you go through a case file and you see that there are some gaps left, it is your duty to advise the Investigating Police Officer (IPO) on what gaps to close. That means, the IPO would have to conduct further investigation.\n\nFor instance, if a defendant denies being present at the place where the crime was committed, he/she has raised a defence. It is the responsibility of the IPO to investigate and confirm whether that alibi is true of false.\n\nIn most cases that I prosecuted, before I charged anybody to court, I must be sure that there were enough evidence linking the defendant to the offence. If the evidence is not enough, I would advise the IPO to investigate further. That is why, in most cases that I prosecuted, all of the defendants were convicted.\n\nYou should also know that investigation involves a lot of things, including finance, training and cooperation from the members of the public. The major problem has been the uncooperative attitude of members of the public. Even if you are well trained and financed, if the victims are not willing to cooperate and provide the necessary information, there is little you can do.\n\nHow do you handle rape cases where victims are always scared of stigmatisation?\n\nIn most rape cases that I prosecuted, the victims were always reluctant to come forward, because they didn\u2019t want people to know what happened to them. But, what I have always done is to assure them that we will make sure that there is nobody in the court. The law made provision for the court to be cleared, leaving only the prosecutor, the defendants, their lawyers and any other necessary party. So, we rely on such legal provisions to ensure that rape victims are protected from unnecessary and harmful publicity.\n\nWhat do you think accounts for delay in trials?\n\nThere are lot of things involved in that. Sometimes the law itself contributes to delay. There is a procedure called trial-within-trial in law. Section 28 and 29 of the Evidence Act say if somebody makes a confessional statement, before the statement is admitted, the court must be satisfied that it was voluntarily made by the maker. So, to ensure that such statements are voluntarily made, the court normally conducts a mini-trial, called trial-within-trial if a defendant denies voluntarily making the said statement.\n\nDid you experience such mini-trials in the cases you prosecuted?\n\nYes, there was a case I prosecuted. It involved eight defendants, and, because the defence counsel wanted to delay, they challenged the voluntariness of their clients\u2019 statements and we had to conduct trial-within-trial eight times for each of the defendants. So, an incident like this causes a lot of delay. Other causes of delay could be from the court, where the judge is indisposed or travelled for any reason. The court could also not be conducive for businesses on some occasions, where there is power outage. It could also be from the defence counsel, where he/she is trying to play pranks and deploy some dilatory tactics.\n\nSometimes, it could be from the prison, where prison officials fail to produce the defendants who are in custody or where the defendant is sick, he/she would have to be made well before he/she could be brought to court for trial. It could also be on the part of the prosecutor, where his/her witnesses are not available. So, delay in criminal trial has so many dimensions. So many factors are responsible. It cannot be blamed on a party.\n\nHow do we address the problem of delay?\n\nThe major cause of delay on the part of the prosecution is the inability to produce witnesses when necessary. As a prosecutor who does not want his case delayed, the moment a case file is handed to you, you initiate communication with the witnesses. We call it witness tracking.\n\nSo, once you track your witnesses, and they are always ready and with you, there is no way the trial will be delayed. But when you fail to track them and the matter begins to drag, they will lose interest and when you call them they will not respond.\n\nIn developed societies, the docket of each court is not always as heavy as we have here. The number of cases assigned to each judge in those societies is not as much as we do here. There are some instances where a judge will have about 500 cases on his/her docket. How do you expect such a judge to be expeditious? Such a judge is expected to hear each of the cases, write ruling where required and write judgment. So, you can see that even the number of cases assigned to the judges accounts for delay. Where a court has five cases in a day, it could cope, but where it has 15 or more, it becomes a problem to go through all the cases in a single day and still be expected to resume the next day.\n\nHow did you record the feat of getting the SAN rank at your first try?\n\nWhen you want something, you must prepare for it very well. I was qualified long ago. But, when I made up my mind to apply, I prayed to God and sought His permission on when to apply. So, when God asked me to apply, I picked the form and ensured that all that were needed were in place.\n\nThere are certain basic requirements that you must meet. You must pay your practising fees as and when due for 10 years without break. You must pay your branch dues as and when due for 10 years without a break.\n\nYou must have at least 20 cases which you did at the High Court from the beginning to the end, within 10 years. You must also have at least five at the Court of Appeal and four at the Supreme Court within the same 10 years. So, everything is within 10 years.\n\nSome people don\u2019t check their cases properly, some cases have expired, yet they don\u2019t know. But, in my case, because I have done so many cases, I was having over 100 judgments at the High Court; 32 judgments at the Court of Appeal and seven at the Supreme Court. So, I did not have any problem when I applied.\n\nWhen I went to submit my works, they were a pick-up load, and people were wondering how many people\u2019s works they were.\n\nI packaged about 50 High Court cases. For the Court of Appeal judgments, I wanted to package 32, but it was getting too voluminous. So, I said when they said five, at least 22 should be sufficient.\n\nBefore then, I had read the rules very well and understood what the requirements were and how to present your application. In fact, I read them (the rules) more than 10 times.\n\nSo, when I was to submit, I arranged my works very well so that they were easy for those who were to scrutinise them.\n\nMy application went through the first and second filtration with ease, without any query.\n\nAt that stage, many people had queries and they had to go back to face a panel. Some were later cleared and some were not.\n\nWhat other thing do you think worked for you?\n\nAnother important element has to do with your reputation. Your integrity is very important. It attracts 25 marks. For me, I have handled so many cases, with so many temptations. If I had succumbed to any of the temptations, like people coming to bribe you, it would have counted against me on such occasion. People will bring money to bribe me, but I will tell them that my conscience and God are the two things that guide me, not their money. That was what saved me.\n\nYou know, I read law to do justice. That has always been at the back of my mind. People will bring money; big, big money and say \u2018See, how do we handle this case?\u2019 But, I will tell them to go with their money, that I was not interested.\n\nAfter the release of the first list and I went for the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) interview, one of the interviewers had held watching brief in one of the cases I prosecuted.\n\nIn that case, the defence counsel offered me a bribe of N10 million. His client defrauded somebody of $4.6million. The defence counsel followed me to my hotel after the day\u2019s proceedings and requested me to give his client soft landing.\n\nI told the lawyer to take the money he brought and add more to pay the victim of the crime, then ask the complainant to write the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) about the development, then we will know how to proceed from there.\n\nEventually we concluded the case and the defendant was convicted and sentenced to two 10-year terms, to run consecutively, meaning that he will spend 20 years in prison.\n\nSo, when I went for the NBA interview and the lawyer saw me, he told the Chairman of the panel that he knew me very well. I was taken aback. He said, \u201cYou see this Simon Lough, even the devil cannot bribe him.\u201d\n\nHe proceeded to recall what happened in that case and moved that I should be allowed to take a bow and go.\n\nWhen he finished, another member said we should not only allow Simon Lough to go, we should encourage him not to change, because people like him are not many in the society.\n\nSo, in essence, what I am saying is that in anything we do, our integrity matters. Whatever you are doing, you must think of tomorrow, it matters.\n\nHow do you advise your colleagues and juniors who are willing to attain this height?\n\nMy advice for my colleagues in the police and those outside is that they must work very hard if they want to attain the peak of their professions.\n\nYou must work very hard, you must be focused, you must be consistent in what you are doing and you must not derail.\n\nAbove all, you must have the fear of God in your mind. You should know that somebody up there is watching. The man up there is watching you.\n\nIf He sees you dong well, He knows what to do, and if you are not doing well, He also knows what to do.",

          "title": "BREAKING: Buhari approves suspension of subsidy removal",
          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has approved the suspension of the removal of fuel subsidy that was earlier scheduled for June 2022, until further notice.\n\nThe Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, made the disclosure after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in the State House, Abuja.\n\nThe Organised Labour comprising the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) have begun mobilisation nationwide for a total shutdown of the country effective from January 28 to protest the subsidy removal, saying it will further worsen the living standards and destroy livelihoods of Nigerians, especially the poor.\n\nAddressing the State House Correspondents, the minister said the executive will propose 18 months extension to National Assembly for the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) that was meant to kickstart this February.\n\nPresident Buhari had on 16th August 2021 signed the Petroleum Industry Bill into law.\n\nBuhari\u2019s assent to the bill was in furtherance to the passage of the Bill by both the Senate and the House of Representatives earlier in July 2021.\n\nThe PIA is expected to grow investors\u2019 confidence in Nigeria\u2019s Petroleum Industry and create more employment opportunities for the populace in the host communities.\n\nSylva explained that the suspension is to give all the stakeholders time to ensure that the implementation is carried out in a manner that guarantees that all necessary modalities are in place to cushion the effect of the PMS subsidy removal.\n\nSylva said \u2018President Muhammadu Buhari has agreed to an extension of the statutory period for the implementation of the removal of subsidy on petrol (Premium Motor Spirit, PMS) in accordance with extant laws.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u2018However, following extensive consultations with all key stakeholders within and outside the government, it has been agreed that the implementation period for the removal of the subsidy should be extended.\n\n\u2018This extension will give all the stakeholders time to ensure that the implementation is carried out in a manner that guarantees that all necessary modalities are in place to cushion the effect of the PMS subsidy removal in line with prevailing economic realities.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn the likely effects of the subsidy removal on the livelihoods of the poor, Sylva said: \u2018The President assures that his administration will continue to put in place all necessary measures to protect the livelihoods of all Nigerians, especially the most vulnerable.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn the fuel queues that have resurfaced, he advised Nigerians to stop hoarding fuel nor engage in panic buying as the government has no plans to remove subsidy, Sylva said: \u2018We don\u2019t intend to remove subsidy now. That is why we are making this announcement.\u2019\n\nOn the possible legal implications after the assent to the PIA by President Buhari, the minister said: \u2018We also see the legal implications. There is six months provision in the PIA which will expire in February and that is why we are coming out to say that before the expiration of this time, as I said earlier, we will engage the legislature. We believe that this will go to the legislature, we are applying for some amendment of the law so that we would still be within the law.\n\n\u2018We are proposing an 18months extension but what the National Assembly is going to approve is up to them. We would approve an 18 months extension and then it is up to the National Assembly to look at it and pass the amendment as they see it.\u2019\n\nAsked if the suspension has something to do with the 2023 elections, he said: \u2018Of course not. As I told you, first it\u2019s just the human face of the government, Mr President especially wants certain structures to be in place. And he insisted if we want to remove subsidy, we must make sure that we put every measure in place to protect the suffering masses of Nigeria. That is the President\u2019s insistence. So we are now taking steps to ensure that these processes are in place. And this now gets into the labour engagement that you are talking about. We are already talking with labour. And our discussion with labour is also around these palliatives and mitigations. So all these will have to come together. That\u2019s why we decided at this time, especially since we are running against time, with the legal timeframe approaching very quickly, we thought we should come to you and let you know that we are taking steps to amend the law and to ensure that we are within the law.\u2019\n\nOn the possibility of gradual increase, which is not on the table right now, the minister said: \u2018Gradual or increment in whatever guise is not on the table.\n\n\u2018We are going to see how to rejig the law, this is not going to be the only amendment to the PIA. A few months ago, the President already proposed an amendment to the law.\u2019",

This can play a key role in boosting our efforts towards enhancing security across the nation.\n\n\u2018It will enable our security institutions to effectively deploy robotics, autonomous vehicles, augmented and virtual reality to address any security challenges that we face,\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari explained that the National 5G Policy includes a deployment plan to ensure that major cities across the country benefit from the technologies.\n\nHe added that the policy, which is in line with the commitment of this administration to supporting the digital economy as an enabler for the diversification of our national economy, also seeks to make 5G a major driver of the economy, a catalyst for smart cities in the country and a platform for the creation of jobs that support the digital economy.\n\nHe assured investors that the Federal Government would continue to provide an enabling environment for their businesses to be very successful as Nigeria begins the roll-out of the technology.\n\nPresident Buhari directed the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami, to supervise the implementation of the policy, being done by the Nigerian Communications Commission with the support of other government institutions.\n\nThe president also used the occasion to provide a rundown of how his administration has created an enabling environment for investments to thrive in Nigeria\u2019s digital economy.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHe recounted that the journey to the launch of the 5G National Policy started with the launch of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy in November 2019 as well as the launch of a number of policies to strengthen the digital economy, including the Nigerian National Broadband Plan and the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in the Nigerian Telecommunications Sector.\n\nThe president noted that under his watch the agreement of the National Economic Council to peg the cost of the Right of Way at N145 per linear metre which was made in 2013, was only implemented in late 2019, after the intervention of the Federal Government.\n\nAccording to the president, the Information and Communications Technology sector played a prime role in enabling Nigeria\u2019s economy to swiftly exit the recession that was triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u2018The GDP Report of the National Bureau of Statistics showed that the ICT sector was the fastest growing sector in the fourth quarter of 2020 and entire year 2020, recording double-digit growth rates of 14.70 per cent and 12.90 per cent respectively.\n\n\u2018The sector also recorded a 17.92 per cent contribution to our GDP in the second quarter of last year- this was its highest ever contribution. All these impressive and significant achievements have justified our efforts to support the growth of our digital economy.\u2019\n\nDescribing the process of developing the National 5G Policy as \u2018painstaking, inclusive and focused,\u2019 the president recalled that 5G trials commenced in some selected locations in November 2019.\n\n\u2018Multi-sectoral stakeholders then deliberated on the report of the trials to ensure that health, security and other concerns were effectively addressed in developing a policy that suits our country.\n\n\u2018The National 5G Policy will position Nigeria to harness the potentials of 5G technologies to further develop the economy and improve the indices of well-being in the nation,\u2019 he said.\n\nPantami in his remarks affirmed the sector has recorded unprecedented achievements with increased remittances to the Federation Account, resolution of lingering issues in the industry and successful auctioning of the 3.5 gigahertz (GHz) spectrum for the deployment of 5G technology.\n\nHe thanked the president for the consistent support to the sector, announcing that within two years the Federal Government completed 1,667 ICT related projects.\n\n\u2018As at August 2021, the sector remitted over N1 trillion to the Federation Account and this is unprecedented because the usual remittances are around 200 billion annually and this has been increased substantially,\u2019 he said.\n\nOn the spectrum auction for the 5G, Prof Pantami explained that from the reserve price of N75 billion per spectrum, each spectrum was assigned to the winners at the price of over N250 billion per spectrum.\n\nThe Minister expressed confidence that given the experiences from other countries and available research, Nigeria would derive maximum benefits from the deployment of 5G technology.",

Who denied you? There and then, I made a decision. I said look, you will see Moshood definitely. I overruled whoever said you couldn\u2019t see him. So, I now called my Chief Security Officer (CSO), I said, please make arrangement for this team to see Abiola, that is one point.\u201d\n\nBut in his reaction, Olajide said: \u201cAbdulsalami has told us apparently what he knew about the transition of MKO Abiola. It is left for us to distil the information he has given.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t believe his entire story about Abiola\u2019s death. If it is true that Abiola was ill, that when he instructed them to bring him to come and meet Ambassador Pickerkng, a sick man would either be restricted to a sickbed in prison or in the hospital.\n\n\u201cSo, for me, I don\u2019t believe him and I am sure most Nigerians will not believe the story.

          "text": "By Omodele Adigun\n\nIn order to keep the economy afloat in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Development Bank of Nigeria (DBN) have so far expended over N5.4 trillion between 2020 and 2021 just as Bank of Industry (BoI) has, in its vault , N599 billion loans ready for disbursement, investigation has shown.\n\nPut together, if BoI finally disburses the loans to its beneficiaries, the three development financial institutions will have spent N6.030,410 trillion within one year just to contain the global pandemic.\n\nGiving insight into the apex bank\u2019s interventions, its Governor, Godwin Emefiele, disclosed at the 14th annual conference of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) in Abuja that \u201cmobilization of key stakeholders in the Nigerian economy, through the CACOVID alliance, led to the provision of over N23 billion in relief materials to affected households, and the set-up of 39 isolation centres across the country; loans granted to the private sector rose by N3 trillion between July 2020 and July 2021 because of continued implementation of our Loan-to-Deposit Ratio (LDR) policy; deployment of over N756 billion to 3.7 million farmers cultivating over 4.6 million hectares of farmland under the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP); deployment of N440 billion to 711,706 beneficiaries under the Agribusiness/Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS) and the Targeted Credit Facility (TCF) being run by the NIRSAL Microfinance Bank; disbursement of N98.41 billion in loans to support 103 healthcare projects, of which 26 are pharmaceutical companies and 77 are for healthcare institutions. These funds are helping to expand and strengthen the capacity of our healthcare institutions and the provision of N923 billion in loans to support 251 real sector projects, which has helped in boosting local manufacturing and production across critical sectors.\u201d\n\nAs for Development Bank of Nigeria (DBN), its intervention in 2020 alone stood at N191.9 billion via disbursement to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), representing 89 per cent increase when compared to N101.5 billion recorded in 2019. This is contained in a document from the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning on the performance of some key agencies and social investment and poverty alleviation by the Federal Government.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nIn his recent interview with African Banker, the Managing Director/ CEO of BoI, Mr Olukayode Pitan, explained various interventions by the bank to cage the pandemic from ruining the economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs the pandemic began to take its toll on the Nigerian economy, the bank sought partnerships with the Federal Government to manage programmes that would alleviate its negative effects. Some of these programmes included the N75billion MSME Survival Fund: The bank is currently managing the execution of the Nigeria Economic Sustainability Plan MSME Fund (NESP-F) aimed at reviving and re-establishing MSMEs in Nigeria in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. A component of the NESP-F is the N75billion MSME Survival Fund, which comprises a N60billion payroll support programme and Artisan Transport Grant, and a N15billion Guaranteed Off-take Scheme. The fund is to be disbursed as grants to support vulnerable MSMES in meeting their staff obligations and to secure jobs within the MSME space from the adverse effects of the pandemic. The scheme is aimed at securing over 1.7million jobs.\n\n\u201cThe bank was also selected to manage the N50billion export expansion fund, which is expected to develop and promote export initiatives. This includes providing financial support to organisations in the non-oil export value chain negatively affected by COVID-19, as well as developing export opportunities and programmes that the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) may identify. The fund also serves as a source of supplementary funding for dealing with high costs of production, marketing and distribution, arising mainly from infrastructure deficiencies and other ancillary factors beyond the control of exporters.\n\n\u201cIn March 2020, BoI successfully closed a \u20ac1billion syndicated guaranteed loan facility. The purpose of the deal has been to enhance the capacity of BoI to effectively support micro, small, medium, and large enterprises across key sectors of the Nigerian economy with affordable loans of medium to long-term tenor, alongside moratorium benefits. It is expected that this support will help revitalise Nigeria\u2019s industrial sector. In addition, we improved our capacity to support Nigerian enterprises by raising about $2.1billion from the international debt capital market in 2020.\u201d",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) yesterday invited reserve bidders for the 2020 marginal fields programme completed in 2021, after some initial bid winners failed to pay up their signature bonuses within the stipulated time.\n\nA public notice signed by the Commission\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Gbenga Komolafe, indicated that a number of the winners of the assets could not pay the fee, prompting the organisation to rework the process.\n\nThe commission stated that all offers made to the initial bid winners had lapsed, explaining that by allowing interested reserve bidders to take part in the rest of the process, it will expand the participation of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cNotice is hereby given to the general public, and in particular, all recipients of the letter of notification of potential awardee status in the 2020 marginal field bid round that the 45 calendar days allowed for payment of the requisite signature bonus has since lapsed,\u201d the notice showed.\n\nLast week, the NURPC disclosed that the bid round concluded in 2021 had so far yielded about N174.944 billion, with owners of 30 fields having partially paid and two fields stalled by court cases.\n\nThe new commission had further stated that 20 companies which won the bids had partially paid up, from among those who won the 57 oilfields.\n\nIn May 2021, the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) which has now transmuted into the NURPC with the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), concluded the oilfield bid round, the first successful exercise since 2003 when 24 assets were put on offer.\n\nThe process which culminated in the presentation of letters to the bid winners in Abuja by the industry regulator, started in June 2020, with 57 marginal fields spanning land, swamp and offshore put up for lease by the federal government.\n\nMarginal fields are smaller oil blocks typically developed by indigenous companies and have remained unproduced for a period of over 10 years.\n\nSome of the companies which emerged winners at the time, included: Matrix Energy, AA Rano, Andova Plc, Duport Midstream, Genesis Technical, Twin Summit, Bono Energy, Deep Offshore Integrated, Oodua Oil, MRS and Petrogas.\n\nA few others that succeeded in crossing the hurdle and had fully satisfied all conditions were: North Oils and Gas, Pierport, Metropole, Pioneer Global, Shepherd Hill, Akata, NIPCO, Aida, YY Connect, Accord Oil, Pathway Oil, Tempo Oil, Virgin Forest among others.\n\nAt the time, it was also a big win for local oil and gas companies in the country, which had a good outing during the ceremony as 100 per cent of the beneficiaries of the exercise were indigenous entities.\n\nBefore then, Nigeria last conducted marginal field bid rounds in 2003, with 16 of the fields contributing just two per cent to the national oil and gas reserves.\n\nBut in the notice, Komolafe promised that all the reserved bidders would be contacted in a short while to show their interest in paying the signature bonuses.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, in line with the rules and guidelines governing the 2020 marginal field bid round and the notification of potential award letters, all offers made to potential awardees who have failed to pay the signature bonus for their respective equity participation have expired by operation of law.\n\n\u201cAnd as such, interests have reverted to the bid basket due to effluxion of time for payment of the applicable signature bonus,\u201d he stated.\n\nFurthermore, the commission noted that the equity of the initial bid winners would be pro-rated, indicating that they would only participate to the extent of their payments.\n\n\u201cThe commission accepts no responsibility or liability in respect of any action or activity by any such potential awardee, their partners, associates, representatives or privies in further pursuit of any consideration or award under the said MFBR.\n\n\u201cParticipating interest for fields where the potential awardees have failed to pay all the required signature bonus will be pro-rated and the portion not paid for has automatically reverted to the bid basket.\n\n\u201cThis will be offered to reserve bidders, in line with paragraph 9 (III) of the MFBR guidelines. This is to ensure maximum participation of a wide cross section of Nigerians,\u201d NURPC stated.\n\nIn addition, the commission explained that eligible reserve bidders will be contacted shortly to provide proof of funds for payment of the applicable signature bonus, as a basis for the issuance of potential award letters for the equity participation taken back into the bid basket.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Nigeria condemns coup\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja with agency report\n\nThe military on Monday announced a take-over of government in Burkina Faso, suspending the Constitution and ousting the country\u2019s democratically elected president hours after mutinous soldiers surrounded his home.\n\nPresident Roch Marc Christian Kabor\u00e9, 64, who had faced growing criticism from civilians and the military alike over his government\u2019s inability to beat back the Islamist insurgents creating havoc in this nation of 21 million people, had led Burkina Faso, a poor, landlocked country in Western Africa, since 2015.\n\nThe country had remained largely peaceful until 2015. But that year, militant groups launched a violent campaign as part of a broader upheaval in the Sahel, the vast stretch of land just south of the Sahara.\n\nThe violence has destabilized large parts of the country and has led to the displacement of 1.4 million people and reported 2,000 deaths just last year alone.\n\nThis upheaved has led to mounting public frustration with Mr. Kabor\u00e9, as solution seemed to be beyond him.\n\nThis perhaps led to the coup d\u2019etat adding to worries over military interregnum into governance in the West African region as in the past year, there has been coups in Guinea, Sudan, Chad and Mali.\n\nAccording to agency report, the coup in Burkina Faso was announced on state television late Monday afternoon by a junior army officer who said the army had seized power in response to the \u201cexasperation of the people.\u201d\n\nBeside him sat Lt. Col. Paul-Henri Damiba, a senior military officer who was introduced to the people of Burkina Faso as their new head of state.\n\nThe military said the nation\u2019s land and air borders would be closed, and a nightly curfew imposed until further notice.\n\nThere was no mention of Mr. Kabor\u00e9\u2019s whereabouts and no indication that he had agreed to step down. \u201cThe authorities have been captured without bloodshed and are being kept in a secure place,\u201d the soldier said.\n\nThe military\u2019s announcement came after a turbulent day in the country. Soldiers had on Sunday seized several military bases and the riot police clashed with civilian protesters. In the evening, shots were heard near the president\u2019s home, lasting into the early hours of Monday, setting off hours of uncertainty amid reports that the military was pressuring the president to resign.\n\nIn the afternoon, a tweet had appeared on President Kabor\u00e9\u2019s account that asked people to stand fast behind their tottering democracy. \u201cOur country is going through a difficult time,\u201d he wrote, urging mutinying soldiers to lay down their arms.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerian government has condemned the coup d\u2019etat in Burkina Faso, calling for the immediate release of President Marc Christian Kabore and other members of his government being detained by the military.\n\nThe Nigerian government also demanded for the immediate return to the status quo ante.\n\nA statement on Monday by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mrs. Francisca Omayuli read:\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government of Nigeria has received with grave concern, reports of a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in the Republic of Burkina Faso.\n\n\u201cNigeria strongly condemns the overthrow of the democratically elected government of President Roch Marc Kabore and his detention.\n\n\u201cThis unfortunate development not only subverts the constitutional order of the country, but also seeks to further destabilise the peace efforts in the ECOWAS sub-region.\n\n\u201cThis unconstitutional change of government is unacceptable. Nigeria, therefore, calls for the immediate release of President Marc Christian Kabore and other members of his government being detained, as well as an immediate return to the status quo ante.\u201d\n\nThe Economic Community of West African States is expected to also condemn the military take over as with some other countries which had gone the same way.\n\nSanctions are expected to be announced by the regional body to force the military to quickly hand back power to civilian authorities.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Leaked Phone Calls Expose How Serial Fraudster, Fred Ajudua, Connives With Police Authorities, Judges To Break Law, Keeps 30 AK-47 Rifles In Armoury",
          "text": "Suspected serial fraudster, Fred Ajudua, who is undergoing trial for defrauding a former Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Ishaya Bamaiyi, of $8.4million, has been exposed in leaked phone calls fraternising with police authorities and some top magistrates.\n\nSaharaReporters obtained call recordings confirming how Ajudua confessed that he had an armoury of over 30 AK-47 rifles and other weapons.\n\nFred Ajudua\n\nHe also confessed that he had gunmen that he used for any purpose, from self-defence to assassination.\n\nAjudua also alleged that he bribed the Delta State Commissioner of Police with N3million to release one AK-47 they seized from one of his men, Odafe Chime, who was arrested in a communal war with Ibusa.\n\nFurther in the leaked calls, Ajudua had a phone conversation with Justice Onome Umukoro whom he reportedly influenced to remand Mr Larry Onyezie' and Emmanuel Halim in the Ogwashi Uku Correctional facility.\n\nAjudua as far back as October 2003 was linked to 12 fraud cases including an advance fee fraud of 1.6 million Euros and another of $1.5million, both committed in 2001.\n\nHe was accused of collecting money from Nelson Allen, a Canadian, who lost $250,000.\n\nA German was said to have lost $350,000 to him.\n\nHe was said to have tricked more than $1.69million out of two Dutch nationals between 1999 and 2000.\n\nOn July 26, 2005, the German woman, Frieda Springer-Beck, agreed to an out-of-court settlement after series of inconclusive court appearances dating back to 1993.\n\n\u201cFred Ajudua confessed in the audio that he had over 30 AK-47 rifles and other weapons. He confessed to have planted the pump-action gun which he used in a trumped-up charge against one Evangelist Emma Chime to send him to correctional centre,\u201d a top source who shared the audios with SaharaReporters revealed.\n\n\u201cThis audio was recorded when Ajudua, his hit men and police headed by AIG Shola were relating together.\n\n\"One of Fred Ajudua's hit men, Azikiwe Nwabuwa, made this call to Pastor Jude Adiefe; hence we recorded it. He also confessed that he bribed the Delta CP N3million to release one AK-47 they seized from One Odafe Chime who was arrested in a communal war with Ibusa.\n\n\u201cAnother audio was his phone discussion with Justice Onome Umukoro whom Ajudua paid to remand Mr Larry Onyezie' and Emmanuel Halim to Ogwashi Uku Correctional facility despite having obtained an order of ceteriori from Hon.

          "text": "Suspected serial fraudster, Fred Ajudua, who is undergoing trial for defrauding a former Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Ishaya Bamaiyi, of $8.4million, has been exposed in leaked phone calls fraternising with police authorities and some top magistrates.\n\nSaharaReporters obtained call recordings confirming how Ajudua confessed that he had an armoury of over 30 AK-47 rifles and other weapons.\n\nFred Ajudua\n\nHe also confessed that he had gunmen that he used for any purpose, from self-defence to assassination.\n\nAjudua also alleged that he bribed the Delta State Commissioner of Police with N3million to release one AK-47 they seized from one of his men, Odafe Chime, who was arrested in a communal war with Ibusa.\n\nFurther in the leaked calls, Ajudua had a phone conversation with Justice Onome Umukoro whom he reportedly influenced to remand Mr Larry Onyezie' and Emmanuel Halim in the Ogwashi Uku Correctional facility.\n\nAjudua as far back as October 2003 was linked to 12 fraud cases including an advance fee fraud of 1.6 million Euros and another of $1.5million, both committed in 2001.\n\nHe was accused of collecting money from Nelson Allen, a Canadian, who lost $250,000.\n\nA German was said to have lost $350,000 to him.\n\nHe was said to have tricked more than $1.69million out of two Dutch nationals between 1999 and 2000.\n\nOn July 26, 2005, the German woman, Frieda Springer-Beck, agreed to an out-of-court settlement after series of inconclusive court appearances dating back to 1993.\n\n\u201cFred Ajudua confessed in the audio that he had over 30 AK-47 rifles and other weapons. He confessed to have planted the pump-action gun which he used in a trumped-up charge against one Evangelist Emma Chime to send him to correctional centre,\u201d a top source who shared the audios with SaharaReporters revealed.\n\n\u201cThis audio was recorded when Ajudua, his hit men and police headed by AIG Shola were relating together.\n\n\"One of Fred Ajudua's hit men, Azikiwe Nwabuwa, made this call to Pastor Jude Adiefe; hence we recorded it. He also confessed that he bribed the Delta CP N3million to release one AK-47 they seized from One Odafe Chime who was arrested in a communal war with Ibusa.\n\n\u201cAnother audio was his phone discussion with Justice Onome Umukoro whom Ajudua paid to remand Mr Larry Onyezie' and Emmanuel Halim to Ogwashi Uku Correctional facility despite having obtained an order of ceteriori from Hon. Justice M. I. Imovie's court.\n\n\u201cThe order quashed the proceeding of Ibusa Magistrate Court in charge number MIB/29/2020 and charge number MIB/29c/2020 with CN Ugeh as the presiding magistrate.

          "title": "Norebase wants to be the node that fuses Africa into a country",
          "text": "In 2019, a few months after the African Continental Free Trade Area Agreement (AfCFTA) was signed, some African tech and creative industry players were hosted by CcHUB in Kigali, Rwanda, to discuss how the tech and creative ecosystem could leverage the newly signed agreement.\n\nIn that room, among 80 participants from 30 countries, was Tola Onayemi, a young lawyer who was in the middle of everything. Onayemi was the assistant chief negotiator and head of trade remedies at the Nigerian Office for Trade Negotiations. So, at the time of the meeting, he was at the forefront\u2014leading the technical negotiations of the AfCFTA on behalf of Nigeria.\n\nAt the core of the discussion was trade facilitation issues and everybody in the room, big and important in their own right, knew Onayemi as the go-to kid for the subject matter; he was the exact intersection between tech, law, and trade\u2014the three parts that form a successful cross-border business.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nHaving drafted the Nigerian Ease of Doing Business Policy and advised the Nigerian vice president on industry, trade, and investment before moving to lead the AfCFTA, Onayemi had an idea what the continent needed\u2014Africa had to be a \u201ccountry\u201d to win in the global market.\n\nAfter the Kigali meet-up, COVID-19 hit and the momentum died down. But around late 2020 when countries began to ease the lockdown and open their borders, founders began to reach out to Onayemi to help them in their expansion efforts. He handled a couple of these as ad-hoc services and then began to see his idea of \u201cCountry Africa\u201d unfolding like a morning flower\u2014slow but significant.\n\n\u201cPeople would reach out to me and say, \u2018You\u2019re a lawyer and you are also knowledgeable about trade and tech; you\u2019re the perfect advisor and middle person to help us get into any market.\u2019 So I helped them expand,\u201d Onayemi told TechCabal. \u201cAnd then over time, I just realised there\u2019s something here. So, I started discussing it with Tope Obanla, my co-founder, to see if there\u2019s something here we could build.\u201d\n\nFast forward to June 2021, Onayemi and Obanla were finally ready to roll Africa into a country with their tradetech startup Norebase, a one-stop-shop digital platform for African businesses to expand, file trademarks and patent an Intellectual property (IP) across the continent.\n\nTola Onayemi, co-founder and CEO at Norebase. Image credit: Terna Iwar\n\nThe startup handles everything it takes for a business to launch in a new African country. It\u2019s a 360 degree business launchpad: business registrations, opening of business bank accounts, compliances, license acquisition, and further legal requirements\u2014all from one dashboard.\n\nExpansion across Africa can be tedious. Even though there are similar problems across the continent\u2019s countries, there are just too many impediments that frustrate the process. There are issues of legal frameworks, language barriers, smug policies, cultural disparities, and other nuances.\n\nAlthough most of these impediments can\u2019t be erased overnight, Norebase is building a node that at least takes the burden of scaling these brickwalls off the shoulders of business owners.\n\nAt the core, the company is helping African companies expand, but as they take on more businesses they realise they need to do more than just help companies to start in a new market.\n\n\u201cNow, we don\u2019t just want to help businesses launch in a new market; we want to also help them operate and scale across Africa quickly and safely without experiencing all the fractions of doing so,\u201d said Onayemi, who was also the founding legal partner at Future Africa, an Africa-focused early-stage venture fund.\n\nEssentially, Norebase wants to be the partner a business would need to operate in a new African market. All it takes are a few clicks away.\n\nOnayemi believes expansion for most African businesses isn\u2019t a want but a need. Most African countries don\u2019t really have a population size that has the disposable income to fuel a unicorn or a wildly successful business. Hence the expansion into more markets.\n\nTola Onayemi by Terna Iwar\n\n\u201cYou have to be in several markets because there\u2019s a disposable income gap in most markets. In Nigeria, for instance, after you do Lagos, Abuja, and Port-Harcourt, you are kind of stuck thinking of the next place to find your audience. What happens if you can\u2019t find it? Then you\u2019ll start looking into Accra or Nairobi.\u201d\n\nOnayemi also thinks African businesses need to expand to reduce their vulnerability and derisk against unfavourable regulations that may throw them off course. \u201cIt\u2019s a survival strategy and a way to edge against unfavourable markets. For instance, what happens when Nigeria says no more cryptocurrency or motorcycles?\u201d\n\nBig companies that have expanded into different markets have in-house expansion teams and keep their learnings private. This means that other companies, especially smaller startups that are operating on a lean budget, would have to go through the same mistakes before getting it right. Norebase is solving the problem of trial and error due to the information silo.\n\nLike every other company playing in the African market, Norebase has both online and offline solutions. Its online expansion solution covers Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa and Kenya. In addition to these four countries, its offline offer is extended to Senegal, Egypt, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and more. Onayemi said, while you can only access their expansion offering to select counties for now, you can file trademark and IP across the 55 countries in Africa.\n\nThe company makes money by charging a base fee, depending on the country of expansion. Onayemi said they are constantly making price savings for their customers. As a venture-backed impact company, Norebase\u2019s objective is to first ensure that businesses get into new markets.\n\n\u201cWhat you see happening is that we\u2019re actually constantly pushing down prices so, for instance, our price for Kenya between March and December last year was cut by almost 70%.\u201d\n\nOnayemi said the goal of their pricing strategy is to get to a point where incorporating in any African country will only cost $500. The startup has helped companies like Patricia and Brass, among others, to expand into new markets.\n\nNorebase is tackling a big problem involving multiple government bureaucracies and it wishes to create an environment where founders aren\u2019t restricted to their native countries. Imagine a Kenyan choosing to build in Egypt and the other way round without bothering about running into walls. If AfCFTA wants to create a single African market, think of Norebase as a tool that will power its efficiency. Onayemi believes this will encourage African governments to create policies that support their local businesses.\n\nFor Norbase, the ambition is big and almost sounds impossible because of the precedence set by the present intra-African business and information exchange. But the startup is filled with relentless individuals with an unmatched focus to make this work.\n\n\u201cIn order to accomplish our audacious target, we\u2019re keen on building a culture that attracts talents from the biggest companies in the world,\u201d Onayemi said. \u201cWe hire people with a leadership mindset. People who are founders in their own right.\u201d\n\nAccording to Onayemi, he and his team are building the most significant company in Africa, and when they succeed, the whole African tech and business ecosystem wins. Besides him being a trade leader, his co-founder is an ex-Goldman Sachs associate and a senior engineer at Microsoft.\n\nIn conclusion, even though he didn\u2019t specifically say what they are, Onayemi hinted that the company is launching new products that will \u201cchange the game\u201d, especially fintech startups. The phrase \u201cchange the game\u201d sounds like a founder pitching investors, but it\u2019s Onayemi and his antecedent is enough to take him to be serious and anticipate these products.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Tesla\u2019s African expansion is imminent but is it reasonable to drive one in Lagos?",
          "text": "Every time a picture of an electric vehicle being driven on African soil shows up on social media, a popular recurring sarcastic comment from many Nigerians is that electric cars generally shouldn\u2019t be used on the continent yet.\n\nThis belief was evident in the responses to a recent picture of a Tesla being towed off Lagos\u2019s Third Mainland Bridge. The popular speculation was that the car ran out of power\u2014since, unlike its fossil fuel-powered sibling, it can\u2019t simply be refuelled. Contrary to these speculations, the real cause was a tire blowout.\n\nGranted these remarks hold some merit as many African countries do not have the supporting infrastructure, and very few electric cars are sold in Africa. Tesla, the most renowned electric vehicle (EV) brand globally, sells its vehicles in about 40 countries across 5 continents, except Africa and Antarctica. Other big players in the EV space adopt a similar approach.\n\nBut there are signs this will be changing soon. In November 2020, Hyundai unveiled its first Nigerian electric car named Hyundai Kona. Tesla made its first move on the African continent in October 2021 by installing 4150 kW Supercharging stations at the Tangier Al Houara Hilton Resort and the Onomo Hotel in Casablanca, Morocco. In South Africa, tech company Rubicon recently became the official Tesla partner in the country. The agreement currently only covers the company selling Tesla charging infrastructure.\n\nBased on precedents, establishing charging networks is usually the first step Tesla takes before directly selling cars into a market, setting up showrooms and rolling out service centres. The use of charging stations gives a sense of the general demand for Tesla cars.\n\nTesla, which is currently the market leader, sold almost a million electric cars in 2021. But competition in the EV space is heating up as veteran carmakers, General Motors and Volkswagen, both sold over 200,000 EVs each last year. 118-year-old Ford last year entered the EV race with a rather ambitious target of producing 600,000 EVs by the end of 2023. Rivian\u2014at 9 years\u2014also joined in the race with a market cap of $94 billion, despite having not sold a single car yet.\n\nAnswering the big question\n\nWhile all these moves hint that the expansion of electric car companies to Africa is inevitable, it doesn\u2019t answer the question on many people\u2019s minds: Can electric cars thrive on the African continent?\n\nAlkesh Thavrani, Chief Business Development Officer at fintech startup Bitsika, who owns and drives a Tesla model X around Lagos and neighbouring cities, believes his experience is a testament that electric cars can thrive in Africa.\n\nThavrani\u2019s Tesla Model X, which costs $90,000, was bought in 2019. The addition of shipping and customs fees (about 70% of the value of the car) brought the cost to about $150,000. The car came with a charger (220-volt outlet adapter) and additionally purchased a home wall charger which cost about $500\u2013600.\n\nA front view of the Tesla Model X with one set of doors opened\n\nThavrani drives the Tesla to his office and other functions during the week and typically returns to full charge overnight.\n\n\u201cYou plug it in at night and by morning you have a full battery, just like you do to your phone,\u201d Oluwatobi Ismail, a Nigerian automotive engineer who runs Smile motors which services the Tesla, said.\n\nBreaking down the charging speed and capacity of the different chargers, he explained that the level one, which is the slowest taking from 18\u201340 hours to charge to full capacity when empty, provides about 120 volts. The next is the level two, which provides between 208-240 volts, restoring an empty battery life to full in about 8 hours. The fastest is the level three (supercharger) which handles 400 to 900 volts and charges the battery to full capacity in about 30 minutes.\n\nThe car charging port\n\nThe Tesla wall Connector installed in Thavrani\u2019s house\n\nBattery life and mileage of the car\n\n\u201cAt full charge, the car can go about 500 km,\u201d Ismail said. It\u2019s slightly less if the air conditioner/heater is used. For context, a trip from Lagos to Ibadan is about 125km. This means the Tesla Model X can complete a round trip on one full charge. He points out that there\u2019s also a mobile charger that can be taken around in the car in case plans change.\n\nNigerian roads are notorious for traffic jams, so what happens when the car is stuck in traffic? Fortunately, Tesla cars are equipped with regenerative braking, a feature that uses the excess energy produced by a moving vehicle to charge the batteries, thus slowing down the car. Depending on the speed at which the vehicle moves, it can gain back as high as 80% of the energy generated via regenerative braking.\n\nWhat happens when the battery reaches zero? It\u2019s possible that the car will still drive for a few more kilometers. Different Tesla car owners have reported driving about 16-32km at 0% before their cars come to a final halt\u2014Tesla strongly advises against doing this.\n\nThis is possible because just like your smartphone, battery life percentage is an estimation of how much battery is left based on the rate at which the voltage is discharged\u2014the pressure of voltage output is strong when the battery is full and weaker when it\u2019s low. In addition, there are other factors that influence the estimate, this explains why your phone sometimes lasts longer on 1%.\n\n\u201cTo put things in perspective, driving from Yaba to Ikoyi is less than 15km. Now with all these in place, you have to be reckless to be stranded due to no battery power,\u201d Ismail said.\n\nCost charging and maintenance\n\nThe maximum household rate of power in Lagos is about \u20a632/kWh according to Ikeja distribution company. To estimate how much it costs to charge a Tesla Model X\u2019s battery, we multiply it by the size of the battery: 100 KW. This means the cost of charging the battery fully is \u20a63,200 (~$6). This can take the car for a week or two or even a month depending on your driving habits. For Thavrani, when he\u2019s not travelling long distances, he can go a week or two without needing to charge the car\n\nHow does this stack up against a fossil fuel-powered car?\n\n\u201cNow if you\u2019re driving a similar fossil fuel-powered car as thirsty as this, you\u2019ll be spending at least \u20a615,000 per week on fuel. The tires will wear out faster because it\u2019ll be heavier than this and your car won\u2019t be as fast as this,\u201d Ismail said.\n\nIn terms of maintenance, what Ismail has mostly done is inspection so far. \u201cWe typically just check the air filters, oil, and shock absorbers. We haven\u2019t had to replace anything apart from tires.\u201d\n\nNotably, the car doesn\u2019t come with spare tires, which Babatunde claims is a common trend in many other new cars. The cost of replacing the Tesla\u2019s tire (20-inch rims) is about \u20a6110,000 (~$200) for each tire.\n\nWhen I asked if that wasn\u2019t too expensive, Ismail insisted he thinks it\u2019s fair. He recently bought a tire for \u20a6330,000 (~$600) for an SUV. \u201cThese days I don\u2019t think any tire would cost less than \u20a620,000 (~$36.4) and that\u2019s a cheap brand,\u201d he said.\n\nTobi Ismail driving the Telsa\n\nDealing with accidents and bad roads\n\nAnyone who drives in Lagos knows that it\u2019s nearly impossible to not be hit and scratched by other cars. In the case of Thavrani\u2019s Tesla, most of the incidents have been scratches and dents, which are fixed all at once after they pile up.\n\nMany Lagos roads are notorious for being in bad conditions but Thavrani has found a way to navigate through these bad roads. How? By cleverly adjusting the ride height of the car, a feature that allows the driver to increase or reduce the height of the car from the floor. Bad roads also mean that he\u2019s not able to use the auto-pilot feature except on roads with clearly defined lanes like the Third mainland bridge or Bourdillon, Ikoyi.\n\nAbout a year ago, there was a major incident that affected the car suspension\u2014the system of tires, tire air, springs, shock absorbers and linkages that connects a vehicle to its wheels and allow relative motion between the two. How easy was that to fix?\n\n\u201cFixing is straightforward but we don\u2019t have Tesla parts in Ladipo market [a popular market for buying vehicle parts in Lagos] so we had to order parts from Tesla US,\u201d Ismail said. The process of ordering could often be a hassle, he added.\n\nCompared to a similar fossil fuel car, Babatunde believes it\u2019s cheaper to maintain a Tesla.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll say it\u2019s cheaper to maintain. For a car like this that costs about $90,000, we\u2019d change oil at least two times because it\u2019ll have a V8 engine, each time will cost \u20a650,000 (~$90). You\u2019ll change transmission fluid every 2,000km, along the way you\u2019ll have to change the valves and water pump.\u201d\n\nAnother thing that counts in favour of the Tesla is that it has fewer moving parts (about 150 parts) compared to a fossil fuel-powered car which has 30,000 parts if you count all parts down to the nuts and bolts. If you consider large parts such as the engine as one part, it comes down to about 1,800 separate parts.\n\nThe trunk of the Tesla Model X is used as storage space because it doesn\u2019t have an internal combustion engine.\n\n\u201cIn a regular car\u2019s engine you have about 200 moving parts, so if you take this out because it doesn\u2019t exist in a Tesla, that\u2019s 200 less things that can break. When you look at your automatic transmission, that\u2019s another 800 less things that can break. So you\u2019ve reduced your problems by like 1,000,\u201d Ismail said.\n\nWhen I asked him between the Tesla (Electric Vehicles) and fossil fuel-powered cars, which would he recommend, with a straight face before bursting into laughter, he said, \u201cBased on my profession I\u2019ll recommend fossil fuel-powered cars because there are more things to fix and I have to eat.\u201d\n\nA general source of concern for many people about electric cars is the credibility of the technology supporting electric cars, as they aren\u2019t familiar with it. Ismail thinks the technology is nothing new.\n\n\u201cThis technology has been around for a long time. It\u2019s been tried, tested and trusted,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same technology you have in your hybrid vehicles. Those cars have been around since 2005. They\u2019ve worked so well that\u2019s why they\u2019ve been able to be upgraded into fully electric vehicles. All they\u2019ve done is make the battery bigger.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Ismael Belkhayat on his way to building Morocco's first unicorn",
          "text": "Last November, during the Ironman marathon race in Turkey, Ismael Belkhayat\u2014just a few steps to the finish line\u2014excitedly took a minute to kiss his family, then, joyously sang and danced through the finish line.\n\nIronman is one curious endurance competition: there\u2019s no award for finishing ahead of others; everybody who finishes is recognised as a winner. For Belkhayat, who has since adopted Ironman as his alias, competing at the sport can be likened to building a business. It takes guts, grit, and, most importantly, making strategic decisions on how to ration your strengths.\n\nBelkhayat is not an athlete. He only heard about the race a few months before it commenced and decided to participate; that\u2019s all that mattered to him\u2014knowing what you want and going out to get it.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThis was the attitude that inspired him, 8 years ago, to quit his strategy consulting job at Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to become a tech entrepreneur\u2014something he knew little or nothing about.\n\nThree startups later, this shy kid from the streets of Casablanca has not only become one of Morocco\u2019s most revered entrepreneurs but also a notable name in the North African tech ecosystem.\n\nTen years ago, running the Ironman race or founding a startup wouldn\u2019t have crossed Belkhayat\u2019s mind. He was just another man who was going to follow the conventional playbook of life: go to school, finish with good grades, get a well-paying job, and start a family. Even though he\u2019s always had a sharp mind, he never thought he could be the outlier he is today.\n\nThe birth of a serial founder\n\n\u201cI was 27 years old and it felt like I\u2019d been snoozing all my life. I woke up from my slumber when the guys at BCG told me I\u2019d have to work another 10 years to become a partner,\u201d Belkhayat told TechCabal.\n\nBelkhayat grew up in Morocco, where he had his early education before moving to Paris on a state-sponsored education trip when he was 17. After graduating from the university prep school in Paris, he won a scholarship from the Moroccan government that helped him through his education at Cornell University in the US. He then joined BCG\u2019s Paris office and was later transferred to Morocco to help set up the company\u2019s practice in the Maghreb country.\n\nAfter working for BCG for over 4 years, that 10 years time frame given by his senior colleagues jolted him into finding a new meaning to life and his career, so he turned to tech entrepreneurship. The same year he left BCG, he founded VotreChauffeur, a ride-hailing startup operating in Casablanca and a few other Moroccan cities.\n\nThe startup quickly became a household name in the country and, after about four years, was acquired for an undisclosed amount by Avis Car Rental. Belkhayat continues to serve as a board member in the company.\n\nOne thing Belkhayat prides himself in is the ability to quickly focus on the next important thing rather than wallow in the glory or loss of the past. While still running his first startup, he founded another one, Sarouty, a marketplace that facilitates real estate deals in Morocco. Sarouty helps people to discover, buy or rent land and houses across Morocco.\n\nBelkhayat\u2019s core mantra is to grow as fast as possible and overwhelm the competition between the first 2 years in business. So, like his first business, Sarouty quickly became the leading real estate platform in the country. It partnered with PropertyFinder Group, a Dubai-based multinational proptech startup, to scale its tech and expand to more cities. Due to the potential of the business, PropertyFinder opted for acquisition instead of partnership and named Sarouty as its Moroccan operation. Belkhayat then exited to act in the capacity of board member.\n\nWhat\u2019s next after two exits?\n\nThe next idea came during a trip; Belkhayat had chosen to accompany his wife Sophia Alj, ex-strategy consultant at McKinsey, during a business trip. Alj was going to travel across Africa\u2014South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Ivory Coast, etc.\u2014to help in the digital transformation of some FMCGs in these countries.\n\nSophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat, Chari\u2019s co-founders\n\nDuring the trip, Ironman and his wife noticed one common thing across these countries: their mom-and-pop shops struggled to access FMCG products. But what was more fascinating was the rise of an entirely new tech sector building to solve this particular problem at scale.\n\n\u201cWe heard about TradeDepot in Nigeria, Sokowatch in Kenya, and MaxAB in Egypt. And we just thought maybe we could do the same in Morocco,\u201d said Belkhayat.\n\nThe idea stuck and, upon returning to the North-African country, the duo started looking into the local informal retail market. With Alj\u2019s experience in helping FMCGs go digital and Belkhayat\u2019s previous experience in logistics and marketplace, it didn\u2019t take long to figure out the basic things needed to start their next venture.\n\nIn 2020, the couple co-founded Chari, a B2B e-commerce platform for informal retailers in Morocco. They now intend to expand into more French-speaking African countries.\n\nChari and its journey to dominance\n\nChari is currently present in Morocco and Tunisia and has earmarked francophone countries like Senegal, Ivory Coast, Togo, and Mauritania for expansion in the coming years. The startup took part in the Y Combinator\u2019s 2020 Summer batch and raised over $5 million in seed funding last year, despite how difficult it is to raise foreign investment in the region.\n\nLast year the company launched a fintech product to solve a recurring problem merchants faced. Due to the cash-based culture in Morocco, most merchants keep their inventory and sales records with pen and paper; this meant Chari, likewise, was constrained to receiving payments in cash and upon delivery.\n\nIt also meant that Chari was exposed to the insecurity of the cash-based model and that its purpose of digitising the value chain was somehow defeated. The solution? Build a digital payment network. And that is what the startup decided to do.\n\nChari\u2019s warehouse\n\nTo accomplish this, Chari made 3 acquisitions last year, one of them being Karny.ma, a bookkeeping startup that helps over 40,000 stores manage credit arrangements with customers. This acquisition gave Chari access to data on how grocery stores extend credit to their customers. This data, according to Belkhayat, would direct how Chari would structure its buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) services to them.\n\nOn Thursday, the startup announced that it has closed a bridge round led by Saudi-based venture capital fund Khwarizmi Ventures (KV), AirAngels (Airbnb alumni Investors), and Afri Mobility, the venture capital arm of AKWA Group.\n\nBelkhayat said the money will be used to test their BNPL services, and upon successful results, Chari will acquire a local credit company that will enable shop owners to lend money to their end users.\n\nAccording to Belkhayat, Chari currently transacts about $2.5 million monthly. The company has signed over 15,000 merchants with almost half of the number using the platform daily. (There are about 200,000 grocery stores in Morocco.)\n\nGrowing 20% month-on-month, Chari now cumulatively and actively serves over 50,000 users, and its recent raise caps the startup at $100 million.\n\nBelkhayat the strategist\n\nBased on lessons from his previous startups, Belkhayat carved a different operational strategy for Chari, a strategy that rounds up its liability to almost zero. Unlike other e-commerce businesses that own warehouses and logistic vehicles, Chari rents them and partners with truck owners.\n\nThis is how it works: Belkhayat says many vacant warehouses across Morocco can be rented on a per-metre-square basis for cheaper prices\u2014so why buy or build another one? Similarly, he sees no reason to buy delivery vehicles when several truck owners and drivers are looking for gigs.\n\nPrivate truck owners download the Chari app and receive orders every now and then, according to their location. They go to pick up the order and deliver the goods to the merchants. The app provides drivers with seamless road-mapping so they can deliver the goods on time.\n\nChari\u2019s only asset is its app that helps merchants place orders and match drivers for delivery. The stored goods, which could become a liability should there be damages, are insured.\n\nA group of Chari dispatchers\n\nAs much as Belkhayat believes in incentivising users, he also believes in reversed incentives. This means that, if you can be rewarded for achieving something, the reverse should be the case for not meeting up.\n\nThis philosophy was imported from VoutreChaffeur where riders pay according to users\u2019 feedback. A driver pays less finder\u2019s fee when rated 4-5 stars after a trip and pays more if rated below that. At Chari, when a driver delivers successfully and on time, they receive a bonus but would lose money when it\u2019s otherwise.\n\nOn the surface, this might sound problematic, but Belkhayat believes that is the best strategy to ensure quality assurance and create a win-win situation for all stakeholders. Everybody\u2019s happiness is based on the drivers\u2019 service delivery. The drivers are incentivised by bonuses and then, reversely, by the thought of losing money. So far the company has recorded 96% on-time delivery.\n\nE-commerce in Morocco\n\nThe e-commerce space can be divided into 3 sectors. The first one is business-to-business (B2B) where Chari operates; the second is business-to-consumer (B2C); and the last one is quick commerce where deliveries are fulfilled between 10\u201315 minutes.\n\nB2B is a huge market today especially on the grocery side of things. The 200,000 grocery stores in Morocco currently order, on average, about $100,000 worth of goods per day. This puts the total addressable market for grocery products at about $7.3 billion. When you consider that this is excluding tobacco and electronics, it shows that the B2B e-commerce space is huge.\n\nChari\u2019s team at work\n\nMorocco\u2019s B2C sector already has a strong market leader, Jumia, that was reported to be holding about 95% of the market share. So, \u201cthere is no reason why you would move to the B2C space, which Jumia has dominated. However, quick commerce could be an opportunity for us,\u201d said Belkhayat\n\nQuick e-commerce platforms like Glovo, a Spanish swift-delivery startup, are already playing in this sector, and are partners with Chari. Belkhayat says Chari helps Glovo with supplying its dark stores in Morocco. That means Glovo buys from Chari to deliver to their end client.\n\nWith these moves, it\u2019s safe to say Chari is holding down the B2B sector of the Moroccan e-commerce sector and wishes to be an operating system for this sector.\n\nEven though Belkhayat is bullish on expanding in many African countries in the coming months, there are countries he won\u2019t go to.\n\n\u201cBesides the fact that we intend to operate in francophone countries, countries that have heavily funded startups\u2014like Nigeria\u2019s Alerzo and TradeDepot; Kenya\u2019s Sokowatch and MarketForce; and Egypt\u2019s maxAB that acquired a Moroccan competitor Waystocap\u2014aren\u2019t where we intend to play in,\u201d said Belkhayat, jokingly.\n\nThis playful comment explains Belkhayat\u2019s business philosophy: why should you move to become just one of them when you can actually be a king in your area? This might sound like cowardice, but it\u2019s actually about picking the battles you can win. On a more ambitious note, expanding into the francophone region is a plan to gain dominance.\n\n\u201cI know these guys won\u2019t go to the francophone region soon because they don\u2019t speak French, and even when they come, they will probably come in 5 years. In the meantime, Chari would have placed entrance barriers, and they would probably try to buy us out instead of competing and this could be a good exit strategy for us,\u201d Belkayat said, again, jokingly.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Topship goes from being an Instagram business to a YCombinator company",
          "text": "\u201cOur overarching goal is to make shipping in and out of Africa as easy as booking an Uber or Airbnb,\u201d Moses Enenwali, founder and CEO of Topship, a Nigerian logistics startup digitising Africa\u2019s shipping experience, told TechCabal over a call.\n\nThat\u2019s an ambitious statement from a company that was operating only on Instagram just 18 months ago.\n\nOn January 14, the company announced that it got into the 2022 Winter Batch of Y Combinator (YC) and has updated its LinkedIn profile name to include \u201c(YC W22)\u201d\u2014a signature identity tag for YC companies.\n\nYC brings validation to companies it backs and, besides, the accelerator\u2019s usual $125K investment\u2014now $500K\u2014the programme exposes startups to global attention, high-level strategic advice, and a lifetime of high-networth connections.\n\nBut how did an Instagram business pivot into becoming a tech startup and then get into YC, the world\u2019s biggest accelerator programme with a 1.5% acceptance rate?\n\nFor Enenwali, it\u2019s the culmination of years of toiling as an employee and months of aggressive legwork as a founder.\n\nThe journey began in 2014 after Enenwali returned to Nigeria from the UK and went straight into the busy world of consulting at Ernst & Young, where he would work for almost a year and a half before moving on to Africa Courier Express (ACE), a Lagos-based logistics business founded by a co-founder of Jumia and Lidya, Tunde Kehinde. At ACE, Enenwali was a senior client manager.\n\nThough the role was his first professional job in logistics, it wasn\u2019t his first experience in the sector. Back in university, Enenwali had run a side business called Timewall Company, where he imported and distributed coffee beans sourced from Plateau State, Nigeria, in the UK.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAfter ACE, he joined another logistics startup Sendbox, a YC-backed Nigerian company that provides deliveries for e-commerce and social commerce sellers locally and internationally. Enenwali spent over 4 years at Sendbox and wore a lot of hats including growth, product, and partnerships. By the time he quit to focus on building Topship, he was already fully exposed to the fragmented nature of shipping to and from Africa.\n\n\u201cI spoke to a lot of people and realised that not a single person has had a delightful shipping experience [to and fro Africa]. The complaints were majorly around transparency, loss or damage of orders, difficulty of accessing shipping services, ridiculous pricing, and heavy customs duties,\u201d said Enenwali.\n\nSo, in June 2020, Enenwali started Topship as a one-man shop, opened an Instagram account and started helping people to move parcels locally. Then he started reaching out to merchants shipping within and beyond Africa. He\u2019d also visit merchants physically to prospect them.\n\nCOVID disrupted a lot of things and logistics was one of the industries that took the heaviest blow. So, leveraging on this gap to give people good shipping deals was Enenwali\u2019s trump card.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult enterprise but not an impossible one,\u201d he said.\n\nBecoming a tech startup\n\nTopship continued to gain traction under the radar; satisfied customers referred their friends and acquaintances to this new Instagram platform helping folks to ship seamlessly.\n\nThis continued until March last year when Enenwali had a clear grasp of the business\u2019s use case and thought he could build a Flexport for Africans. But to be Africa\u2019s Flexport, Topship had to be a full technology company, so Enenwali decided to build software that handles the end-to-end process. The company then raised $300K pre-seed, brought in Junaid Babatunde as co-founder and CTO, and built a small team that would accelerate its digital transformation.\n\nTopship now has a web app that allows merchants and individuals to book a door-to-door shipment. It has also extended its shipping offerings from only parcels to include cargos and freight to and from anywhere in the world.\n\nSince launching, Enenwali said the company has onboarded over 1,800 users, and 700 of them are active businesses that have been vetted and verified. These businesses regularly use Topship for their local and international shipment. The remaining users are mostly individual users who only do one-time shipping, or ship at intervals. Enenwali also mentioned that the company has completed 7,000 shipments and is currently maintaining a 100% year-on-year growth rate.\n\nOn revenue, Enenwali said the company has 3 sources of income: it sells shipping insurance to its users; charges a markup fee on every transaction; and also charges for clearing customs when applicable.\n\nTopship is not the only African tech startup trying to digitise the shipping experience: there are a couple of them including Kenyan\u2019s Sote, Nigerian MVX, OnePort 365, the CEO\u2019s former employer Sendbox, and more. But Enenwali doesn\u2019t see them as competitors; to him they are potential partners. He believes this legacy sector is one big broken giant that would take a whole village to fix. So, everybody building in that space is contributing to the underlying infrastructure needed for mass adoption.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not competing against any startup because, trust me, nobody has it all figured out. We\u2019re all competing against the current traditional system of moving goods to and from Africa,\u201d Enenweli said when asked about competition. \u201cWe are currently building an infrastructure and, once we\u2019re done, tech startups that are trying to solve the same problem would be able to plug into what we\u2019ve built and serve their users.\u201d\n\nThe Topship team understands that to bring their big plan to fruition, it has to engage a lot of third parties at every stop in the value chain. There\u2019s a lot of manual heavy lifting going on behind the scenes that needs to be handled by partners. Enenwali confirmed that to create a trustworthy end-to-end seamless experience, they have partnered with a lot of stakeholders across the world and, now, its users can ship globally.\n\nThough the company keeps experimenting and arriving at different iterations of its solution, the CEO believes that if Flexport can do it, Topship, too, can.\n\nFlexport, the San Francisco-based shipping giant, was part of the YC 2014 Winter Batch and went on to raise $20 million after graduation. In 2020, it generated $1.7 billion in revenue.\n\nIt\u2019s obvious Topship is really going all-in on its adoption of the Flexport model; it\u2019s already a tech-enabled business and in YC, just like Flexport. But will it scale and raise $20 million? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, what\u2019s certain is Enenwali\u2019s passion and confidence about fixing the broken shipping chain for Africans.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does a lawyer with a cushy government job decide to go into the stressful world of the startup founder?\n\nYour guess is as good as ours, and Techpoint Africa decided it was time to find some answers.\n\nIn 2015, after a stint in the Office of the Legal Adviser at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Tola Onayemi accepted the position of Technical Adviser to the Office of the Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on Industry, Trade & Investment.\n\nThis position led him to serve as Nigeria\u2019s lead negotiator for the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnayemi told us, \u201cThere had been a mandate to negotiate the AfCFTA, but no one had really used it; it had just existed. But given the late Ambassador Chiedu\u2019s [Osakwe] experience, Nigeria started centring the conversation, and in a year, Nigeria had pushed through the AfCFTA. And I worked on that.\u201d\n\nOn a clear, sunny day on July 7, 2019, Nigeria signed the AfCFTA in Niamey, Niger.\n\nFor members of Nigeria\u2019s tech community, signing the AfCFTA resulted in discussions on what it meant for them.\n\nIn August 2019, Onayemi was invited to Kigali to attend the creation of the Africa Technology and Creative Group (ATCG) by the Co-creation Hub (CcHub). Apart from his experience with negotiating the AfCFTA, he had previously advised his classmates who had gone into tech and other clients.\n\n\u201cWe had these very robust conversations, and we started thinking, what are the things that need to happen for tech to take strong advantage of the AfCFTA, and we came up with a bunch of ideas. One of the ideas was the cross-recognition of corporate documents.\n\n\u201cIs there a world where there can be a central registry where I can take my incorporation documents from Nigeria to South Africa, and they are recognised automatically, so I don\u2019t have to start the process all over again? Or how do we use hubs to create a support system of people trying to expand across the continent?\u201d\n\nThis was when the conversation to build Norebase started.\n\nEverything comes together neatly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTola Onayemi, Co founder: Norebase. Source: Instagram\n\nWhat happened between August 2019 and December 2020?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the most part, nothing. 2020 was the year of the pandemic, and with the coronavirus bringing nations and businesses to a standstill, Onayemi\u2019s ideas went on the back burner.\n\nBut, he soon became restless, and by December 2020, thoughts of helping to implement the AfCFTA had begun to fill his head once more. Like he told us, a policy without an implementation framework is akin to a joke.\n\nThe first challenge, however, was deciding what to do.\n\n\u201cThere were a bunch of options, but we wanted to identify something that we could build in the private sector to scale and work. And so we started bouncing a bunch of ideas around and one that kept resurfacing was this idea of a central digital platform that helps businesses to start, scale, and operate across Africa.\u201d\n\nAfter speaking to friends, his co-founder (Tope), and getting data from the data analytics company they hired, it became clear that there was something to build upon.\n\nFrom helping companies get incorporated, it became a platform to help businesses move past the incorporation stage and right into the thick of operations and expansion.\n\nInterestingly, Onayemi told Techpoint that things moved very fast from the very beginning with them already handling clients, even at the ideating and data-gathering stage.\n\n\u201cFor us, there were a bunch of validating signals. One of them was being able to build out a formidable team interested in African prosperity. It was like having customers who were all in. The entire team came together and said, there\u2019s a demand here, and we are building for it\n\n\u201cAnother was that the demand for this solution was high and would only increase. Every potential client we interacted with only validated this point. So, the real question was, what\u2019s the best model you use to build it in a way that makes it sustainable as a tech business?\u201d\n\nThe concept of Norebase\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nTo help understand, Onayemi painted a picture comparing the US market and the African context.\n\n\u201cAs a businessperson based in the US, you can easily stay in San Francisco alone and build a unicorn. You can stay in one place and have access to lots of disposable income. With most African businesses, you would have to cherry-pick from 54 markets because the disposable income in individual African countries can be low.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, expansion is a survival issue for most African businesses. As of 2020, nine of the ten countries on the world\u2019s poorest countries list were African.\n\nEssentially, the total addressable market size is quite small, even for countries like Nigeria. Although Africa\u2019s projected population growth level is often touted as a blessing, there\u2019re still other attendant issues many developing countries face: poor infrastructure, bad governance, and bureaucracy, among others.\n\nHe also explains that in most of these countries, the problems startups face are pretty similar, with issues such as regulators moving \u201cinteresting\u201d, as he put it.\n\n\u201cThe effect being that businesses have to start their business registration process anew each time, which can be long and tedious. But the thing is, when people try to expand or even set up in their own markets, one of three things happen. Either they find out that registration is very expensive, or that it\u2019s very complicated to understand, or that there\u2019s a trust deficit.\n\n\u201cWhat Norebsase is doing for you is simple \u2014 we are providing you with the digital infrastructure for you to register, start, and scale your business in any African country. The idea is to build a digital infrastructure that ensures that anybody can actually just get into either their own market or another market without too much of a hassle.\u201d\n\nAt the core of this is the need for companies to focus on their business rather than be bogged down by the fine print and extraneous details.\n\n\u201cSo imagine a world where you had previously expanded to Ghana and now need to expand to South Africa, and it is achievable with just one click. In two minutes, you have started the process to have a company in South Africa! That\u2019s where we are going.\u201d\n\nDealing with African \u201canyhowness\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut how do you deal with similar yet different markets?\n\nOnayemi postulates a game theory where countries have to compete for startup attention.\n\n\u201cImagine a world where you say, I\u2019m in Nigeria, but I don\u2019t want to incorporate in Nigeria. I want to go to Kenya. What that does is, you create an incentive where countries now have to compete for who has the better environment.\u201d\n\nThe end goal, with the help of the AfCFTA as a cushion and pressure, is to make starting and scaling so easy that countries have no choice but to change. Some might call this audacious, especially considering the African context, but it would definitely be interesting to watch how this plays out.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that building for the African market is quite different in the sense of having to sometimes do everything yourself.\n\n\u201cIf you are building in the US, you can focus on a small facet of the need as others focus on complementary parts because it is a system that works. But what has been our experience so far is that we have to provide an end to end experience for our users as no one else is fulfilling the need. Our users that have registered in some countries still have to stall operations for varying reasons.\u201d\n\nHe also touched on a lawyer\u2019s usual gamble: understanding the rules so well that you find exceptions to them.\n\n\u201cSo the way we basically approach it in each country today is to say, \u2018What is the minimum rule in this country? What are the exceptions?\u2019 And then build around those to ensure that our users do not have to worry about the intricate details.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, he said that an often forgotten side-effect with the current mode of expansion is that helpful information is either lost or rarely available.\n\n\u201cOne big advantage is that we can aggregate learning. So, for instance, we can say, the biggest issue with expanding in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire is xxx, and you can solve it and apply it to several people at once and then it\u2019s now a learning that you can apply at scale.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s see the numbers, though. Or maybe not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnayemi speaking at the SOAS Khartoum conference in 2019. Source: Instagram\n\nSo, how much does it cost to set up in different countries?\n\nWell, according to Onayemi, it depends on the market. Nigeria is pretty cheap, but countries like Ghana and Kenya are a bit steep, with C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire a bit higher.\n\nThe price also depends on what the customer wants.\n\n\u201cSo the way to think of it is that there\u2019s a basic business registration product, and there are a bunch of add-ons that you can also buy.\u201d\n\nHe also said that over time, they\u2019ve tried to introduce price reductions. Once they get a price cut, they implement it.\n\nWe can\u2019t tell you the price, though. You\u2019ll have to see for yourself.\n\nWhat we can tell you is what you get. In Kenya, for example, you get a company secretary that provides legal services to you for a year. You also receive a registered mailing address, among other things.\n\nIn Onayemi\u2019s words, \u201cIt\u2019s basically a buy-what-you-want service.\u201d\n\nCurrent challenges; future plays\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Instagram\n\nOne of the biggest problems right now is data.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we see frequently is that people want to expand, but they don\u2019t have the requisite data to determine where they should go. We get asked questions ranging from \u201cWhat is the best country to expand to?\u201d to \u201cHow do I know this country can afford my product?\u201d These questions, we believe, should be answered through market research, which is not a service we provide.\u201d\n\nBut there are also policy inconsistencies and trying to choose the best markets based on that. Onayemi, however, sees this as even more reason to expand \u201cand build antifragility into your business.\u201d\n\nHe also believes this would improve with time because the more options businesses have, the better choices they can make, creating a sort of competition to do better among them. In his words, essentially, countries would market themselves.\n\nFor him, the different cycles of how this would play out would start with people expanding to different markets (current situation), people staying in one market and then expanding into different markets, and, finally, Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs), where you have a company that\u2019s not registered in any African market, but with which you can do business in Africa.\n\n\u201cSomeone can say, \u2018Okay listen, I am a business incorporated in maybe the cloud or whatever it is, and I\u2019m supplying a Nigerian businessperson with a service.\u2019 It\u2019s not based in Nigeria; it\u2019s not based anywhere. That changes the entire dynamics of what businesses are or what companies can do.\u201d\n\nWhy DAOs? He believes that giving people the power to make decisions would ultimately lead to higher decision-making capabilities because there\u2019s no third party to make decisions for them. It forces people to scrutinise their decision-making.\n\n\u201cDo I think that there should be centralised regulations? Yes, but we need to strike a balance between how much we strip people of decision-making abilities and how much we just trust that they can make the best decisions for themselves.\u201d\n\nCurrently, Norebase is introducing new features like payment in local currencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello,\n\nLet\u2019s talk about this not-so-new kid on the block.\n\nUber\u2019s gamble on Nigerian motorbikes\n\nThe gist: On Monday, Uber launched UberMoto, its motorbike on-demand service in Ibadan, Nigeria, to join competitors like SafeBoda, MAX.ng, and Gokada.\n\nThe global mobility company has been operating in Nigeria for eight years. Besides heralding the beginning of app-based on-demand car-hailing in the country, it has witnessed the entrance of popular competitors like Estonia mobility startup, Bolt(formerly Taxify) and inDriver, including other local entrants; it also saw how Chinese-owned OPay gave the model a try with OCar, although it didn\u2019t scale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithin the same time, Uber has expanded into five states in the country. The latest is Ibadan and Portharcourt in October 2021. However, despite its slow but calculated expansion rate, it took Uber this long to bring any other vertical asides car-hailing into the country.\n\nMakes me wonder why. A possible reason is if the company planned to do something totally different? Come to think of it; the best time would have been when Lagos was still a hotspot for on-demand motorcycle services. But that would also mean partaking in the loss suffered following the Okada ban in February 2021.\n\nFour weeks ago, it was in the news that Uber partnered with Opibus to deploy 3000 electric motorcycles across the continent. Could this be the plan for Ibadan?\n\nFrom Uber\u2019s country manager, Tope Akinwumi\u2019s comment about the launch, the plan is to provide a cost-effective and quicker transportation option. But there was no mention of electric vehicles.\n\nAlthough UberMoto\u2019s model was not clearly stated, it is most likely going to run like Uber car service, where it taps into the current network of riders, screens and does background checks on interested riders before onboarding them.\n\nMy concerns: If the late-mover disadvantage exists, Uber might have to resort to giving heavy discounts to attract and retain customers, which might be unsustainable in the long run. While UberMoto would rest on Uber\u2019s image, which by the way, is pretty new to Ibadan, we can\u2019t say it will be Uber\u2019s top priority to make it work.\n\nFun fact: Thailand was UberMoto\u2019s first market in 2014. Sadly, this service was halted two years later due to government regulations. In 2018, it was Uganda\u2019s turn to have UberBoda, the first in Africa.\n\nIt\u2019s clearly too early to guess UberMoto\u2019s fate; after all, Ugandan SafeBoda seems to be having a relatively good run in the market. Only time will tell if this was a smart decision. What do you think?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nRecently, two crypto platforms planned to introduce some new features that caught my attention. It led me to read more about buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) in crypto and taxing crypto transactions.\n\nHow are your new year resolutions going?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nThis Saturday was Techpoint Build 2021, and it was the thing!!!!! From the Speaker line-up, which in our Chief Servant, M\u00fay\u00ecw\u00e1 M\u00e1t\u00f9l\u00fak\u00f2 words, was \u201cmad!!!\u201d to the different sessions on the next frontier in healthtech, fintech, edtech, and fintech to the massive turnout. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve seen that many people at an event \u2014 granted, I\u2019m a homebody, but still.\n\nIn this newsletter, I will be doing a quick recap for those who \u2014 unfortunately \u2014 missed it. I\u2019m nice that way.\n\nSome Techpoint Build 2021 nuggets for you\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the keynote speaker: This year\u2019s keynote speaker for Techpoint Build was Adia Sowho, MTN Nigeria\u2019s CMO. The theme for this event was \u201cThe next frontier\u201d, and while she touched on several things, she said something that caused my data privacy-o-meter to hit the roof.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe tend to import philosophies into the products we build in Africa even though we\u2019re behind in many things. For instance, data privacy. Create data that not only supports your decision making but also of those around you.\u201d Something to chew on, I\u2019ll say.\n\nWhat COVID-19 can do does not exist: It\u2019s not what you are thinking; this is a good thing. During Emmanuel Paul\u2019s session with Ifeanyi Duru, VP at Monnify, the evolution of the digital payment sector was on the front burner and how almost every startup has payments integrated now. All thanks to the coronavirus, of course\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIfeanyi Duru, Monnify VP, speaking at Techpoint Build 2021\n\nNot just digital payments, though: In Oluwanifemi\u2019s session with Ifeoluwa Dare-Johnson, CEO Healthtracka; Ikpeme Neto, CEO Wellahealth; and Abimbola Adebakin, CEO Advantage Health Africa, COVID-19\u2019s role in people\u2019s perception of public health was discussed. Some emphasis was also laid on the importance of private-public collaborations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealthetech panel at Techpoint Build 2021. L-R: Oluwanifemi Kolawole, Senior Reporter, Techpoint Africa; Ifeoluwa Dare-Johnson, CEO, Healthtracka; Ikpeme Neto, CEO, Wellahealth; and Abimbola Adebakin, CEO, Advantage Health Africa.\n\nThere\u2019s still a bit to unpack, but Precious will be doing a more rounded job in the coming week. From Bolu\u2019s talk with Ruth Iselema, CEO Bitmama, to Tayo Aina\u2019s session with Akinnuga Abayomi COO, Tramango to Faiz Bashir, CEO Flexisaf\u2019s overview on edtech, there were a lot of insights and take-homes.\n\nPitchstorm\u2026 and the winner is: Another exciting part of the event was the Pitchstorm competition, showcasing a host of amazing startups riding the next frontier wave. With seven semi-finalists pitching at Techpoint Build 2021, Ghanaian company, WorldTech Consult emerged the winner, carting home $10,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorldTech Consult, Pitchstorm 3.0 winner\n\nBut they weren\u2019t the only winners. To crown Techpoint Build 2021 activities, Techpoint Awards 2021 was held on Sunday, January 23, 2022, recognising some of the startups pushing boundaries in the ecosystem.\n\nNomination-only: Judged by an independent panel, this category saw startups like Paga win the Financial Inclusion Startup of the year, Patricia win Crypto exchange of the year, Thepeer win Newbie of the year, God is Good Logistics win Mobility and Logistics startup of the year, among others\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThepeer wins Newbie of the year\n\nEditorial choice: This category was judged by Techpoint\u2019s Editorial team based on nominations from our audience. We saw Piggyevst win Startup of the year and Ingressive Capital judged as the most outstanding VC in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAudience choice: Winners in this category were chosen by our readers and saw Fisayo Fosudo named Tech Influencer of the year and Abeg named App of the year. Here\u2019s a complete list of all the winners and, if you\u2019re interested, a breakdown of how we chose them.\n\nIt\u2019s a wrap: I thoroughly enjoyed Techpoint Build 2021 \u2014 first time at a Build event \u2014 and if you attended the event, I\u2019m sure you did too. Watch out for videos on our YouTube channel soon and anticipate Techpoint Build 2022. Thank you to the fantastic people \u2014 attendees, sponsors, speakers, panellists, among so many others \u2014 who made this a success.\n\nArigat\u014d Gozaimasu!!!\n\nLast week on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading\n\nI squeezed in some time to listen to some music this weekend. I only listened to movie soundtrack playlists, though: The Batman and the Lord of the Rings \u2014 all-time favourite book\n\nAFCON bants aside, here\u2019s some news on one of Ghana\u2019s latest policy moves\n\nWondering what the Pan-African Payment Settlement System (PAPSS) is?

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Tuesday, swore in 14 new permanent secretaries, urging them on the delivery of efficient and quality services to Edo people.\n\nObaseki, at the swearing-in of the new permanent secretaries, comprising nine males and five females at the Government House, Benin City, said the government will switch over from analogue to e-governance, effective from February 01, 2022.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cYou are the chief accounting officers of your ministries. The fact that you are in government for a while does not mean that your activities while in government will not be looked at; you have to be very cautious of the decisions you make.\n\n\u201cMost Nigerians don\u2019t know that even after you retire, you are still liable and culpable for your activities during your time in office. I am pleased to inform you that you will be inheriting a vastly improved system of governance; we will continue to work on our systems so that you can deliver effectively to our people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will continue to build human capacity, and train and retrain our civil and public servants. We are equipping and investing in the John Odigie-Oyegun Public Service Academy to make it second to none in this part of the world,\u201d the governor noted.\n\nOn the administration\u2019s plans to launch its e-governance platform, the governor stated: \u201cEffective February 1, 2022, I, the governor, would switch over to e-governance platform, which effectively means I will now approve memos and send mails to you via the e-platform.\n\n\u201cWe have introduced the Edo State Civil/Public Service Transformation and Enhancement Programme (EdoSTEP), through which we are pursuing a deliberate programme to identify weak points in the civil service and strengthen them.\n\n\u201cThat explains why we have had to bring people from outside to come in to help us strengthen the areas of weaknesses that we have seen in the civil and public service; we will continue to do so because we have seen that the civil service as it is today needs a lot of strengthening,\u201d he added.\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cSo far, we are very glad with the accomplishments that we have made today in the EdoSTEP programme. Under this programme, we have found out that the number of vacancies in the civil service is quite enormous.\n\n\u201cFirst, we started with the hiring of 1,600 graduates into the service at the bottom level, but they don\u2019t have the experience and skill to take us to where we want. We will now continue hiring from the top and also see how we can train the middle corps that we have in the civil service and give them the tools for effective delivery.\n\n\u201cWe are working extremely hard to bring back the civil and public service to those days when it was respected. To the new permanent secretaries, I will like to admonish you, you all have been appointed based on merit, not by any godfather.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not seek popularity; you are not politicians, leave that to us. Ensure you do things the way it ought to be done,\u201d he charged.\n\nThe newly sworn-in permanent secretaries include Mr. Anelu Osemen, Mrs. Felicia Edwards, Mrs. Grace Aihie, Mr. Egwakhide Gilbert, Mr. Iserhienrhien Efe and Mr. Aikhuomobhogbe Uidia.\n\nOthers are Mr. Asibor Lucky, Mrs. Igbinobaro Joy, Mr. Washington Abbe, Mr. Asemota Uyi, Mr. Toritseju Onaiwu, Mrs. Ifueko Alufokhai, Mr. Osikhena Ojior and Mrs. Barbara Osobajo.\n\nOsemen, on behalf of the new permanent secretaries, pledged to reciprocate the confidence reposed on them, contributing effectively to the progress and development of the state.\n\n...",

          "title": "I\u2019m confident you\u2019ll not disappoint \u2013 Obasi appeals to African youths to take action against climate change",
          "text": "Founder of Our Tomorrow NGO, Prince Emeka Obasi Jnr, has called on the youths Africa to join him in his quest to ensure that the continent is saved from the ravages of climate change, noting that he is confident that they would heed the call.\n\nObasi who spoke at a press conference organized to officially unveil his NGO dedicated to creating awareness about climate change and its impact and demanding action from policy makers, at the University of Lagos on Tuesday, noted that that he decided to embark on the journey to due to lack of appreciation of the danger climate change poses to the continent.\n\n\u201cWhereas it is common knowledge that Africa is confronted by the twin challenge of insecurity and poverty, not many appreciate the extent of the danger climate change poses to the continued survival of the continent, and its role in the already escalating insecurity and food shortage in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOf course, climate change is the most consequential issue of the 21st century. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that costs associated with climate-change adaptation across Africa could hit $50 billion annually by 2050, even if the global temperature does not rise more than 2 degrees Celsius. Africa stands out disproportionately as the most vulnerable region in the world and this vulnerability is driven by the low levels of socioeconomic growth.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian born British undergraduate, noted, however, that despite the many challenges climate change poses to the continent, there is a bight side as according to him, it provides several opportunities for African countries to harness their huge resource potential to achieve Sustainable Development goal targets.\n\n\u201cAddressing climate change in Africa will create significant market opportunities, especially for the private sector and institutional investors,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo, yes, part of the reason I\u2019m embarking on this journey is that I am also optimistic about the future of our continent. I look at the numbers; the millions of young Africans doing exploits globally, and particularly because the vast majority of Africa\u2019s population consist of young people. Yes, the challenge of climate change is enormous, but I\u2019m confident that we have what it takes as the youths of Africa to galvanize action towards averting the climate crisis that now stares us in the face.\u201d\n\nBut he emphasized that there must be conscious efforts by all stakeholders to turn the threat of climate change into a force for good, otherwise the continent will face severe consequences.\n\n\u201cBut positive change doesn\u2019t just happen, it does when people take conscious steps to bring it about. Despite all the positives inherent in our circumstance, if we fail to take action, we could have trouble on our hands,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cTake for example, Lagos where we all are today. It is a coastal city with a population of 21 million and is predicted to see 90cm of sea level rise by the year 2100 as a result of global warming. According to certain scientific projections, Lagos could become uninhabitable by the end of this century as sea levels rise. Tell me, what would be the fate of our children when and if this day comes?\n\n\u201cIt is heart warming, however, that the state government is taking action, and I commend the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration for unveiling a five-year Climate Action Plan (CAP) 2020-2025. The goal as stated by him, is to achieve an emission-neutral city by 2050. This would be truly awesome.\n\n\u201cBut the case of Lagos state is not unique. It typifies the acute environmental problems facing many parts of Nigeria. There is increasing desertification in the North, which has had very huge impact on security in the country; erosion in the East, oil spillage in the south/south, among others. The scenario is similar in other parts of Africa. Global warming is expected to melt Africa\u2019s remaining glaciers in the next few decades, and the reduction in water essential to agricultural production will cause food insecurity, poverty and population displacement. The question is, what effort is being made by these other states and indeed the federal government to avoid this predicted evil day?\u201d\n\nObasi who said he travelled to Rivers State last week to visualize the impact of climate change on the environment, regretted that the people of the state, particularly the people of Ogoni land continues to suffer from environmental problems resulting from oil exploration decades earlier.\n\n\u201cLast week I travelled to Rivers state to visualize, assess and raise awareness about the effects of environmental degradation in the state. Rivers state has experienced persistent soot in recent years and I witnessed this first hand. I went down to a town called K-Dere, Gokana LGA in Ogoni and there I witnessed the devastation of the environment caused by oil exploration several years earlier. Many of us have heard about the soot because it\u2019s trending news, but what if told you that here, rain water is literally black in colour and occasionally oil spills into farmlands.\n\n\u201cThe people of K-Dere complained bitterly about their situation and the lack of government action to address their situation. Their livelihood which revolve around fishing and farming has been largely destroyed. I want to use this platform to call on the federal government and the state government to help the people there. The Ogoni clean up should be done.\n\n\u201cRegarding the Port Harcourt soot, it is good that Governor Nyesom Wike has begun to take action against illegal refineries, and we got the assurances of the state commissioner for information, Mr Paulinus Nsirim, that the government will not rest until the problem is brought to an end.\n\n\u201cBut the quest for safer environment requires the effort and commitment of all stakeholders and governments in every part of the continent. Isolated actions won\u2019t go far enough, and this is why it is important that we all become involved. My intention is to help make every African youth an effective voice for a safer environment. I have resolved to contribute my own quota towards the global push to create a more sustainable, safer, cleaner and healthier environment for the future through this NGO. Our Tomorrow will become an active player in the climate change ecosystem. I am committed to getting the youths of Africa to commit to this noble endeavour.\u201d\n\nThe activist said his target is to mobilise the youths of Africa to achieve a critical mass of climate change advocates, whose voices will resonate loudly and clearly and catalyse positive action.\n\n\u201cWe will use the awesome power of social media to create this unstoppable army and empower their voices in every country in Africa,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is important that young people become involved in the global effort to ensure that the Earth is in fit and proper condition to make a worthwhile inheritance. Therefore, the effort to improve the environment should be championed by the youths because the world of tomorrow belongs to us.\n\n\u201cThroughout history, every generation of African youths have had to rise up to their challenges. Our grandfathers including people like Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nkrumah, Obafemi Awolowo, Ahmadu Bello, Julius Nyerere and Nelson Mandela fought for independence of our people against colonialism. Our fathers have waged a different type of war projecting the image of Africa by excelling in their various endeavours.\n\n\u201cFor me, I believe that saving Africa from the ravages of climate change is the great challenge of our generation. I\u2019m elated to lead that fight, I\u2019m counting on you as proud African youths to join. I am confident that you will not disappoint.\u201d",

A Inegbenoise, told the court that Nwoko had reported the matter through a written petition from his lawyer to the FCT Police Command for proper investigation on January 20, 2021.\n\nInegbenoise pleaded with the court to allow Jaruma to remain in police custody pending investigation.\n\nHowever, her lawyer, Mr James Odibe, in an oral application for bail, urged the court to grant the defendant bail on self-recognition or in the alternative, in the most liberal terms.\n\nIn his ruling, the judge, Ismailia Abdullahi, ruled that the defendant be remanded in Suleja Correctional Centre pending the bail hearing on Friday. He further adjourned the matter till February 23, 2021 for trial.\n\nIn an Instagram post on December 9, 2021, the sex therapist made a video expressing her disappointment over the accusations Nwoko made against his ex-wife, Charani.

I am not recommending any candidature under this constitution until it is changed.\n\nHowever, MURIC said it was shocking that Afenifere has remained taciturn two weeks after Tinubu declared his intention to run for the post of president by 2023.\n\nThe Islamic group\u2019s statement read in part, \u201cAfenifere is making a great mistake by distancing itself from Tinubu simply because the latter supported President Muhammadu Buhari. Afenifere is playing parochial politics. There is no scintilla of doubt that regional politics is parochial politics. It is myopic and unpatriotic. A visionary group will extend its horizon. That is what Tinubu has done and his nationalistic mien has earned him nationwide acceptance. You cannot remain locked up in your shell and expect the whole country to embrace you. Afenifere should wise up.\n\n\u201cAfenifere has one or two lessons to learn from the Igbo. Unlike Afenifere\u2019s cold attitude towards the only Yoruba man who has shown interest in the presidency (at least publicly), the Igbo socio-cultural group, the Ohaneze, has pledged to support two Igbo men (Anyim Pius Anyim and Dave Umahi) who have expressed interest in the presidency with 10 billion naira. That is the spirit.\n\n\u201cWe call on Afenifere to sharpen its political instinct. An adage says one good turn deserves another. The Yoruba socio-cultural group should neither reject its best candidate nor remain neutral at a time others are embracing their own.\u201d",

Someone who can get the job running based on a track record of the understanding of the complexities of how the presidential system work especially in a democracy.\n\n\u201cIn a democracy, all persons who feel they have the something to contribute, have the passion and are burning must first of all not be bullied and must be allowed to try their luck.\u201d",

          "text": "Boris Johnson is under renewed pressure after Downing Street admitted staff gathered inside No 10 during the first Covid lockdown to mark his birthday.\n\nITV News reported that up to 30 people attended the June 2020 event, sang Happy Birthday and were served cake.\n\nNo 10 said staff had \u201cgathered briefly\u201d to \u201cwish the prime minister a happy birthday\u201d, adding that he had been there \u201cfor less than 10 minutes\u201d.\n\nBut a number of MPs have expressed criticism over this latest revelation.\n\nRules at the time \u2013 19 June 2020 \u2013 banned most indoor gatherings involving more than two people.\n\nITV News said the birthday event had taken place in the Cabinet Room just after 14:00 BST that day, adding that it had been arranged as a surprise for Mr Johnson by his then fiancee, Carrie Symonds, after he returned from an official trip to a school in Hertfordshire.\n\nEnvironment Secretary George Eustice denied ITV\u2019s claim that 30 people had gathered in the Cabinet Room, saying the number of staff present was \u201ccloser to 10\u201d and it \u201cwas literally just a birthday cake brought in at the end of the day\u201d.\n\nThe BBC has learned that Sue Gray, the senior civil servant compiling a report into gatherings on government premises during Covid restrictions, already knew about the 19 June event.\n\nHer findings are expected to be published later this week.\n\nBut in the meantime, a number of MPs have denounced the latest revelation.\n\nLabour\u2019s shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said Mr Johnson should reflect on his ability to live by the rules he made himself.\n\nHe accused the PM of breaching the trust of the British people and called for him to resign.\n\nFormer Conservative Party chair Baroness Warsi told the BBC News Channel it was time for Mr Johnson to \u201cthink long and hard about what is in the best interest of this country\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe question he should be asking himself every morning is, \u2018Is me staying in office allowing me to run this office in a way in which is making the country better, or am I a distraction?'\u201d she added.\n\nConservative MP Andrew Bridgen told Newsnight that the revelations of a gathering at No 10 to celebrate the prime minister\u2019s birthday during the first coronavirus lockdown, \u201ccould well be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back\u201d.\n\nIn a tweet, the former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davison revealed that her partner also has a birthday on 19 June but added: \u201cWe marked it in 2020 by inviting one other household to sit outside, socially distanced, in our garden.\u201d\n\nAnd Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer repeated his call for Boris Johnson to stand down, saying: \u201cThe prime minister is a national distraction and he\u2019s got to go\u201d.\n\nBut the PM did receive some support from Cabinet colleagues.\n\nCulture Secretary Nadine Dorries said in a tweet: \u201cSo, when people in an office buy a cake in the middle of the afternoon for someone else they are working in the office with and stop for 10 minutes to sing happy birthday and then go back to their desks, this is now called a party?\u201d\n\nThe fact that Mr Johnson had been publicly presented with a birthday cake during the school visit a few hours earlier provides all of Wednesday\u2019s newspapers with a picture of the prime minister for many of them to use on their front pages \u2013 even if it is not of the cake in question.\n\nSome Tory MPs, including the party\u2019s Scottish leader Douglas Ross, have also called on Mr Johnson to go, but many more say they are waiting for Ms Gray\u2019s findings before making a judgement.\n\nAt total of 54 MPs must write to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, declaring no confidence in the PM, to trigger a leadership contest.\n\nJo Goodman, co-founder of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, said the Downing Street birthday gathering \u201cwas the day before what would have been my dad\u2019s 73rd birthday, shortly after he had passed away from Covid-19.\n\n\u201cIt was a horrible time for my family, but we stuck to the rules, not even being able to hug to comfort each other.\u201d\n\nShe added it was \u201ccompletely sickening\u201d that No 10 staff had gathered indoors to eat cake for the PM\u2019s birthday, saying: \u201cWhile dozens sang Happy Birthday to him, families couldn\u2019t even sing in memory at their loved ones\u2019 funerals.\u201d",

          "text": "US President Joe Biden has said there is \u201ctotal unanimity\u201d with European leaders over Russia\u2019s troop build-up on the border with Ukraine.\n\nDuring crisis talks on Monday, Western powers agreed to \u201cswift\u201d and \u201cunprecedented\u201d sanctions against Russia if it were to invade.\n\nThe US has also put 8,500 thousands of troops on alert.\n\nRussia denies plans of an incursion, despite deploying some 100,000 soldiers on Ukraine\u2019s border.\n\nJoining the US and UK on the call were the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the EU. The head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg also dialled in.\n\n\u201cI had a very, very, very good meeting \u2013 total unanimity with all the European leaders,\u201d Mr Biden said afterwards.\n\nA Downing Street spokesperson said the leaders \u201cagreed on the importance of international unity in the face of growing Russian hostility\u201d.\n\nShould a further Russian incursion into Ukraine happen, they agreed that \u201callies must enact swift retributive responses including an unprecedented package of sanctions\u201d.\n\nThe aim of the 80-minute video call between the allies was to agree on a common strategy against Russia\u2019s actions, after some disagreements over how Western nations were responding.\n\nOn Monday, UK PM Boris Johnson warned that \u201cgloomy\u201d intelligence suggests Russia is planning a lightning raid on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and the UK started withdrawing some staff from its embassy there.\n\nThe US took a similar move, by ordering relatives of its embassy staff to leave.\n\nBut EU staff are to stay in place for now, with foreign policy chief Josep Borrell saying he would not \u201cdramatise\u201d the tensions.\n\nThere have also been differences on the support given to Ukraine \u2013 the US and UK are among the nations to have sent military aid. However Germany refused Ukraine\u2019s request for defensive weapons, and will instead send medical aid, German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht told local media.\n\nThe Pentagon has said some 8,500 combat-ready US troops are on alert to deploy at short notice.\n\nBut they would only be deployed if the Nato military alliance decides to activate a rapid-reaction force, \u201cor if other situations develop\u201d, said Pentagon press secretary John Kirby.\n\nThere are no plans to deploy to Ukraine itself, he added.\n\nSome Nato members, including Denmark, Spain, France and the Netherlands, are already planning to send fighter jets and warships to eastern Europe to bolster defences in the region.\n\nOver the weekend, some 90 tonnes of US \u201clethal aid\u201d including ammunition for \u201cfront-line defenders\u201d arrived in Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin has said it sees Nato as a security threat, and is demanding legal guarantees that the alliance will not expand further east, including into neighbouring Ukraine. But the US has said the issue at stake is Russian aggression, not Nato expansion.\n\nFor months now, the Ukrainians have been preparing a territorial defence force of volunteers. They are training for a possible defence of Kyiv.\n\nOne woman member, Marta Yuzkiv, a doctor in her 50s, told the BBC: \u201cOf course I am worried. I am a peaceful woman, I don\u2019t want to have a war started. But in any case, in case it\u2019s started, I should be ready to defend the country.\u201d\n\nAndrei Volkov, an IT consultant in Kyiv, called the situation \u201cdangerous\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe situation is extremely tense, I think something might happen,\u201d he said, adding that he was making \u201ccontingency plans\u201d.\n\n\u201cGoing to western Ukraine I suppose, going somewhere where it\u2019s going to be safe.\u201d\n\nRussia has seized Ukrainian territory before, when it annexed Crimea in 2014. After Russian forces seized control, Crimea voted to join Russia in a referendum the West and Ukraine deemed illegal.\n\nRussian-backed rebels also control areas of eastern Ukraine near Russia\u2019s borders. That conflict has cost an estimated 14,000 lives, with a 2015 peace deal a long way from being fulfilled.",
