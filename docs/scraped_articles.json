          "text": "The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has said he is sending an anti-open grazing bill to the State Assembly to give legal backing to the ban on open grazing in the state and to protect farmers and other residents from marauding herdsmen.\n\nSpeaking at the inauguration of the Isaiah Odoli/Omerelu streets in New GRA Phase 1 in the Obio-Akpor Local Government Area on Wednesday, Wike, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media, Kekvin Ebiri, said in addition to protecting farmlands in Rivers State, as well as women and youths, the bill was part of the resolution made by the Southern Governors Forum.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go to the farm anymore; those who rear cattle will not allow your crops to grow. Let me say clearly, now that the House of Assembly has come back, we have to submit the bill on anti-open grazing as we agreed in the Southern Governors Forum.\n\n\u201cWe must do it to protect our farms, protect our women and protect our youths so that nobody will go and kill them,\u201d the governor stated\n\nWike asserted that Nigerians, who had considered the All Progressives Congress as a better alternative to the Peoples Democratic Party in 2015, must be regretting the deplorable condition of the country under the APC.\n\n\u201cThe exchange rate has now got to N510 to a dollar. When they took over, it was N150 to a dollar. They said they\u2019ll give employment. Do we have employment today? Are your children employed?\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to Wike, the country is now on life support and requires prayers from well-meaning Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSince APC came into power, you can now see what Nigeria has turned to. Each day you wake up, you hear people are being killed. If you watch television and read the news in newspapers, you will hear so and so numbers are killed or kidnapped in so and so state,\u201d Wike added.\n\nHe also stated that the APC-led Federal Government had not done anything in Rivers State.\n\nHe described as untrue the claim by the Federal Government that it was jointly executing the Bonny-Bodo Road.\n\nWike said, \u201cThat road was supposed to be done by NLNG and the Federal Government. NLNG brought their N60bn, but the Federal Government did not bring any kobo.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "THE Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, has thanked President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan; and Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, for stopping an investigation of commercial agreements and external borrowings by the Federal Government.\n\nAmaechi also blamed the National Assembly for the delay being suffered by the Ibadan-Kano rail line project over the probe by the House.\n\nThe minister, who featured on Politics Today, a current affairs programme on Channels Television, on Wednesday, alleged that Chinese officials had expressed doubts over the possibility of Nigeria repaying the loan with which the project was to be funded due to the alarm raised by the House committee carrying out the investigation.\n\nThe House had in plenary on May 12, 2020, criticised Nigeria\u2019s loan agreements with China, calling for a review of the deals and cancellation of the latest ones under the Muhammadu Buhari-led regime.\n\nThe House Committee on Treaties, Protocols and Agreements chaired by Mr Nicholas Ossai, which was mandated to conduct the investigation, had raised the alarm over \u201cdangerous\u201d clauses in loans and commercial agreements with international bodies and other countries, especially China.\n\nThe committee, after grilling Amaechi at its first and second hearings, had invited several other ministers and top officials of the Federal Government to the third hearing on the said date.\n\nOn Wednesday, Amaechi recalled warning that the probe would discourage the Chinese government from going further to grant the loan.\n\nResponding to a question on Nigerians\u2019 concern about the loans and if the government still wants to take more to execute rail projects, the minister said, \u201cWhen you hear the Federal Ministry of Transport announce the award of a contract, we have yet to get the loan.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cLet me tell you the loans we have got; the government of President Goodluck Jonathan borrowed $500m to execute Abuja-Kaduna. We did not borrow the money.\n\n\u201cBut when we came, we had to, through the budget, complete Abuja-Kaduna. We completed Itakpe-Warri from our pocket, from the budget. We will commence work by this month end on the Kaduna-Kano rail line.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

To create a more intimate atmosphere, bring lighting to a lower level via table lamps and short floor lamps. Angle multi-directional wall lights or spotlights towards objects in your home that you love and want to show off. Do not point them at blank walls or the ground.\n\n\n\nMood and Task Lighting: Extra task and mood lighting is often where design schemes fall short. Homeowners assume that the central light or wall lights are enough at full power, instead of thinking about the layering effect. Soft fabric shades on table lamps and floor lamps help to diffuse light, making it softer and perfect for the background.

You can also use LEDs to give a soft highlighting glow to areas of interest.\n\n\n\nLight Up the Candles: Candles are the last piece of the puzzle when creating a relaxing and intimate atmosphere.

          "text": "To reduce, and feasibly eradicate violence against women and children in Lagos, and by extension Nigeria, the media must adopt basic principles of journalism of objectivity, honesty, accuracy and accountability.\n\nThis was the submission of participants at a four-day media dialogue and training to improve gender sensitivity in reportage and advocacy, to eliminate violence against women and girls in Lagos.\n\nOrganised by EU-UN Spotlight Initiative Nigeria, the dialogue, according to Khadijah Ibrahim Nuhu, focused on increasing media network participation, involving in solutions journalism, engaging in gender inequality discourse, and impacting changing positive norms.\n\n\n\nAlkasim Abdulkadir, one of the facilitators, while presenting his paper titled: \u201cEtiquette in Reporting Gender\u201d noted that Gender-based violence (GBV) or violence against women and girls (VAWG), is a global pandemic that affects 1 in 3 women in their lifetime.\n\nAccording to him, going by 2019 statistics, 35 per cent of women globally have experienced either physical or sexual violence from intimate partners or non-partners, seven per cent of women have been sexually assaulted by someone other than their partners while six per cent have experienced violence during pregnancy.\n\nWhile stressing the importance of using data when reporting GBV issues, as this will help in policy, Abdulkadir urged media practitioners not to fabricate data, as there are relevant agencies that can give this information, and also do away with sensationalism when reporting the subject matter.\n\nOn her part, Aisha Salaudeen, another facilitator, who spoke on \u201cGender and child-sensitive reporting,\u201d defined gender reporting simply as including all genders in our reporting.\n\nAccording to her: \u201cIt is the practice of creating, reporting or producing media-related content (TV, radio, digital etc.) in a manner that is sensitive to gender inequality and portrays women and men fairly.\u201d\n\nShe added that since the media plays a very significant role in shaping public perceptions about women and men, it is important that reporting avoids any form of gender stereotypes, which often limit and trivialise females and males, as well as presenting an inaccurate view of the world and its possibilities.\n\nWhile sourcing stories, she urged journalists to ask an equal number of women and men for their opinions on subject matters, cover issues that are important to women and their lives, and seek the expertise of women in reports.\n\nTo properly mirror society and be factual and accurate in representing the world, she charged journalists to include children in their reports.\n\nShe, however, noted that children are young, vulnerable, and quite impressionable. As a result, journalists must respect them and treat them with dignity in reporting them.\n\nEarlier, the coordinator of the Spotlight Initiative, UNICEF Lagos, Foluke Omoworare, who represented UNICEF Child Protection Specialist, Denise Onoise, noted that the perpetrators of child molestation are often times people who are known to the children and are sometimes close family members.\n\nQuoting statistics on the prevalence of GBV in Lagos, Omoworare revealed that one in four girls has experienced sexual violence and women and girls with disabilities fall into the category of those with higher likelihoods of being sexually molested.\n\n\u201cViolence is rarely an isolated incident and the majority of children surveyed experienced violence in their home. For children, perpetrators are people that are known to them, (parents, caregiver, teacher, neighbours),\u201d she said.\n\nSpeaking on factors that fuel Violence against women and girls, Omoworare identified some to include \u201csocial norms, early child marriage, weak enforcement of the law, and the reluctance of response services to getting involved in family affairs.\u201d\n\nShe, however, stated that to combat some of these factors, the Lagos State Ministry of Youth and Social Development works collaboratively and effectively with partners in a different capacity to ensure violence is reduced to the barest minimum in society.\n\n\n\nAllying with Omoworare\u2019s stand on factors that fuel the abuse of women and girls, Director, National Orientation Agency, Lagos, Waheed Ishola also identified reasons to include, \u201cpoverty, missing parental care, the quest for money, fame and political position by women and indecent dressing among adolescent girls.\u201d\n\nOthers include: \u201cNeglect of family values, the inability of men to manage their home, illicit drug/substance abuse, ritualistic purposes, and fear of stigmatisation.\u201d\n\nIshola noted that the NOA as one of the implementing partners of the Spotlight Initiative is doing extensive work aimed at eliminating violence against women, working with people in local communities, through the Community Dialogue Sessions.\n\nHe urged the media to assist in addressing the negative socio-cultural norms attached to reporting cases of violence.\n\nEarlier, Muhammad Okorie, Officer in Charge of UNICEF Lagos., noted that violence against women is a global issue, adding that, this trend is a threat to women achieving their full potential.\n\n\u201cBefore 25 years, a girl must have been violated either sexually or physically. If we do not end violence against women, we can reduce it to the nearest minimum.\n\n\u201cThe meeting is to ensure that we end VAWG. The media has a vantage position to reach a larger audience since they have more access through their report to speak to stakeholders,\u201d Okorie stated.\n\nOlasunmbo Daniel, an Assistant Director of Ministry of Youth and Social Development, said the ministry works collaboratively and effectively with partners in a different capacity to ensure violence is reduced to the barest minimum in society.\n\nIn implementing the Spotlight Initiative, Daniel said the progress report for Lagos State include; capacity building and strengthening of 156 Child Protection Stakeholders; Social Welfare Officers, Health Officers, Education Officers, Legal Officers, Police Officers, Civil Society Organisations, volunteers which have been carried out at different times, in the last two years.\n\nParticipants at the workshop, who were drawn from media organisations across Lagos State, expressed delight at the exposure which the training has accorded them, stating that they will, in turn, carry on the torch of eliminating violence against women, a trend which has hindered women from blossoming and attaining their full potential in all fields of endeavour.",

          "text": "The police in Bauchi State have arrested a housewife with her 18-year-old daughter as well as husband, for maltreating her step children, including a three-year-old, subjecting them to severe beatings and starvation.\n\nThe trio were arrested by police operatives from the Township Police Station in Bauchi where a case of maltreatment was reported against them by a non-governmental organisation, Syndicate In Supporting Women And Children Initiative (SISWACHI).\n\nExplaining what led to the arrest of the three persons, a rights activist and Executive Director, SISWACHI, Hajiya Binta Adamu Ibrahim, told journalists in Bauchi on Wednesday evening that following a viral video of the malnourished children on the social media, she was directed by the organisation\u2019s headquarters in Abuja to intervene in the matter in order to ensure justice is done for the victims.\n\nAccording to Hajiya Ibrahim, SISWACHI had been dealing with sexual and gender-based violence cases, lamenting, however, that the case of torturing of the minors, a five-year-old and a three-year-old respectively, was an odd case.\n\nShe informed that following the directive from its headquarters, the NGO reported the police at the Township Police Station, adding that the police promptly effected the three persons.\n\nShe added that considering the severity of the torture on the children, SISWACHI took the children, who she said were a living skeletons as of the time of her organisation\u2019s intervention, to Tashan Babiye Hospital in the Bauchi State capital for them to be given proper medical treatment.\n\nNarrating her children\u2019s ordeals in the hands of their step mother and sister, their mother, Habiba Sani Khalid, lamented that they were subjected to starvation and torture.\n\nKhalid, who had been divorced from the father of the children, told journalists at Tashan Babiye Hospital where she was staying with the children, that her youngest child, Sumaiya Yakubu, a three-year-old, almost died of torture by her stepmother.\n\nShe alleged that her children were not only starved but also beaten unnecessarily by their stepmother, alleging further that her daughter was tortured with fire by her 18-year-old elder half sister in the presence of her mother.\n\nAccording to Khalid, \u201cThe elder half sister used to lit fire wood and put it on the girl\u2019s back when she was asked to clean herself after defecation.\n\n\u201cShe did that in the presence of her mother and father. That has continued until the matter was later exposed,\u201d she alleged.\n\nShe added that the stepmother often beat both Sumaiya and her five-year-old elder brother, Abubakar Yakubu, indiscriminately even as she denied them food as and when due.\n\nThe traumatised mother informed that her former husband later called her to come and take the children away and eventually sent the three-year-old daughter to her when she refused to go and take them from their father\u2019s house.\n\n\u201cTheir father later called me on phone and asked me to come and pick my children. He said if I didn\u2019t carry them, he wouldn\u2019t bother about their plights because he has other children he cares for.\n\n\u201cI declined to go and pick the children, so he eventually sent the girl to me. I realized that she was staggering. She asked me for food. I also saw wounds of beatings and burns on her body. She was asked what happened to her and she narrated her ordeals,\u201d Khalid said.\n\nShe informed that it was one of her relatives who also saw the girl\u2019s condition that recorded and posted her pictures on social media, adding that, \u201cit went viral and attracted the attention of human rights organizations who came to Bauchi to bring us succour.\u201d\n\nThe doctor treating the children at the hospital, Dr Mark A. Garba, disclosed that as of the time they were brought to the hospital, they were malnourished and highly dehydrated.\n\nHe, however, said the children\u2019s that conditions had highly improved now.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bauchi State Police Command\u2019s Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Ahmed Mohammed Wakili, confirmed the incident and arrest of the stepmother, her daughter and husband to journalists.\n\nHe added that the culprits have been charged to court.",

          "title": "FG: Road accidents claimed more lives in January than COVID-19, malaria",
          "text": "By Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja\n\nThe federal government has expressed worries over the increasing number of car crashes on the nation\u2019s highways, saying road accidents claimed more lives in January 2021, than the combination of COVID-19 and malaria.\n\nMinister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola (SAN), disclosed this on Wednesday while briefing Sate House Correspondents at the end of the week\u2019s virtual Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, chaired by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nFashola said the concern was contained in a note he presented to the Council on the need to be conscious of the increased number of road traffic crashes on federal highways, saying that the majority of accidents are not caused by bad roads.\n\nHe said the Lagos-Ibadan Highway, the Abuja-Kano Highway, and Abuja-Keffi-Lafia Highway, have the highest cumulative number of road accidents, saying that for the month of February, more people died of road accidents than COVID-19 and malaria combined.\n\n\u201cBecause of the importance, Council was of the considered view that I brief about the need to take notice of the increased number of road traffic crashes on federal highways because every month we get reports from the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), who are usually one of the first arrivals at crash sites on the highways.\n\n\u201cThose reports are addressed to the Presidency through the Secretary to Government of the Federation, where the FRSC is domiciled, but they are copied to my office and we pay attention to these things and we notice unusually high numbers in January 2021, which we compared with January 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\n\u201cWe saw that in January 2021, the number of people who died from road crashes exceeded the combined number of people who died from malaria and COVID-19 in the same month and while malaria and COVID were receiving national concerted attention, we considered it necessary to bring this to the attention of government as part of our strategy for protecting lives and property,\u201d he explained.\n\nFashola said three federal highways including Lagos-Ibadan, Abuja-Keffi-Lafia and Abuja-Kano highways were identified as the ones with the most number of casualties.\n\n\u201cSo, we identified the need for various actions to be taken from municipal, local government level to state and national level and I acknowledge the fact that after this memo was listed, I got the notice of a Presidential Committee, the National Road Safety Advisory Council, which will be inaugurated Thursday by the Office of the Vice President.\n\n\u201cThis is one-step in the right direction under the aegis of the National Economic Council (NEC). Therefore, that should bring all the 36 States together. We can take this conversation there.\n\n\u201cWe highlighted the fact that my office has asked the FRSC to focus on three roads: the Lagos-Ibadan Highway, the Abuja-Kano Highway, and Abuja-Keffi-Lafia Highway, which show from the data we studied that they had the cumulative highest number of accidents. If we reduce accidents in those three main highways, we would have really dented the number,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Minister of works also enumerated some of the measures already being put in place to address the problem.\n\nHe said drivers are responsible for 70 percent of the causes of the road crashes on Nigeria\u2019s highways.\n\n\u201cSo, we started the process in April. We should collate the figure by the end of June, hopefully, into July. This includes installation of road traffic signs and more patrol. We are also looking at putting speed metres on the highway. There is a combination of factors and we are also trying to educate drivers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe saw that the biggest factor for these accidents; from over speeding, loss of control, wrongful overtaking, brake failure, tyre blow-out points to the role of the driver. Consistently over the years and this data is available, the impact of bad roads and accidents was less than two percent.\n\n\u201cThese factors I have mentioned; over speeding, loss of control, wrongful overtaking cumulate to over 70 percent. If we reduce this, we bring the numbers down. So, I think our focus as a government is that we\u2019ve agreed that the driver has a role to play, starting from education and certification. So, this is going to be a multi-disciplinary activity from the Ministry of Education, Ministries of Information, FRSC, state and local governments in terms of how they test and certify drivers,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "\u2022Says reforms needed to reduce inflation, accelerate recovery\n\n\u2022Blames lack of economic opportunities for insecurity, criminality in Nigeria\n\n\u2022Moderation in food prices slows inflation to 17.93%\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe World Bank has stated that inflationary pressure in Nigeria has pushed about seven million Nigerians below the poverty line in 2020 alone.\n\nThe World Bank gave the data in its latest Nigeria Development Update (NDU), released yesterday, a few days after President Muhammadu Buhari in his Democracy Day broadcast claimed on Saturday that his administration had lifted 10.5 million Nigerians out of poverty in the past two years.\n\nThe bank\u2019s Country Director for Nigeria, Mr. Shubham Chaudhuri, while speaking on \u2018The Arise Xchange,\u2019 a programme of ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, also said lack of economic opportunities was contributing to the rising crime cases and insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nThe multilateral institution also reiterated the need for the federal government to set policy foundations for a strong recovery as well as to tame inflation.\n\nThe report was released on a day the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) announced that Nigeria\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures inflation dropped to 17.93 per cent (year-on-year) in May compared to 18.12 per cent in the preceding month.\n\nBesides, the World Bank also attributed the deteriorating security situation in Nigeria and rising criminality to a lack of economic opportunities in the country.\n\nThe NDU, titled: \u201cResilience through Reforms,\u201d stated that in 2020, the Nigerian economy experienced a shallower contraction of 1.8 per cent than had been projected at the beginning of the pandemic (3.2 per cent).\n\nIt said: \u201cAlthough the economy started to grow again, prices are increasing rapidly, severely impacting Nigerian households. As of April 2021, the inflation rate was the highest in four years. Food prices accounted for over 60 per cent of the total increase in inflation. Rising prices have pushed an estimated seven million Nigerians below the poverty line in 2020 alone.\u201d\n\nThe report acknowledged notable government\u2019s policy reforms aimed at mitigating the impact of the crisis and supporting the recovery, including steps taken towards reducing gasoline subsidies and adjusting electricity tariffs towards more cost-reflective levels, both aimed at expanding the fiscal space for pro-poor spending.\n\nIn addition, the report highlighted that both the federal and state governments cut non-essential spending and redirected resources towards the COVID-19 response.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, public-sector transparency has improved, in particular around the operations of the oil and gas sector,\u201d it added.\n\nThe report, however, said despite the more favourable external environment, with recovering oil prices and growth in advanced economies, a failure to sustain and deepen reforms would threaten both macroeconomic sustainability and policy credibility, thereby limiting the government\u2019s ability to address gaps in human and physical capital, which is needed to attract private investment.\n\n\u201cNigeria faces interlinked challenges in relation to inflation, limited job opportunities, and insecurity,\u201d Chaudhuri, said during the virtual presentation of the NDU.\n\n\u201dWhile the government has made efforts to reduce the effect of these by advancing long-delayed policy reforms, it is clear that these reforms will have to be sustained and deepened for Nigeria to realise its development potential,\u201d he added.\n\nThe latest Nigeria Development Update proposed a near-term policy option organised around three priority objectives: reduce inflation by implementing policies that support macroeconomic stability, inclusive growth, and job creation; protect poor households from the impacts of inflation, and facilitate access to financing for small and medium enterprises in key sectors to mitigate the effects of inflation and accelerate the recovery.\n\n\u201cGiven the urgency to reduce inflation amidst the pandemic, a policy consensus and expedite reform implementation on exchange-rate management, monetary policy, trade policy, fiscal policy and social protection would help save lives, protect livelihoods, and ensure a faster and sustained recovery,\u201d World Bank Lead Economist for Nigeria and co-author of the report, Marco Hernandez said.\n\nIn addition to assessing Nigeria\u2019s economic situation, the NDU discussed how the COVID-19 crisis has affected employment, how inflation is exacerbating poverty in Nigeria, how reforming the power sector can ignite economic growth and how Nigeria can mobilise revenues in a time of crisis.\n\nLack of Economic Opportunities Fuelling Insecurity, Criminality in Nigeria, Says W\u2019Bank\n\nWhile speaking on \u2018The Arise Xchange,\u2019 a programme of ARISE NEWS Channel, Chaudhuri said lack of economic opportunities was contributing to the rising crime cases and insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, due to the level of poverty, many people will try to find a way to getting by however they can, and if criminality offers an option, then they will embrace it.\n\nThis, he stated, in turn, makes it difficult for businesses to operate and has a multiplier effect on the country\u2019s economic growth potential.\n\nResponding to a question on at what point he thinks the country would begin to lift its citizens out of poverty, he said: \u201cThe simple and complicated answer to that question is as soon as Nigeria chooses to. It really is Nigeria\u2019s choice. The potential is there and the resources can be directed towards that effort.\n\n\u201cUltimately, it would be the private sector that would create the jobs by investing and it is the government that invests in the people by making sure that every Nigerian child has education and the right healthcare. So, these are the things that lead to sustained poverty reduction. In any way, these are simple things in terms of what needs to be done and what is often complicated is generating the consensus around them and actually implementing it.\n\n\u201cSo, we believe Nigeria has the potential to lift 100 million of its citizens out of poverty by 2030 as President Buhari has said. But that decision has to be Nigeria\u2019s choice right now.\u201d\n\nHe, however, commended Nigeria\u2019s fiscal and monetary authorities for undertaking \u201cbold reforms in the face of vocal opposition.\u201d\n\nHe cited the reforms to include the central bank\u2019s recent adoption of the NAFEX rate, which is the rate at the Investors and Exporters\u2019 Window.\n\n\u201cWe believe that would help to boost investor\u2019s confidence, boost the competitiveness of the economy and if combined with other measures, would add more flexibility on the rate. That I think would set the foundation for a strong economic recovery.\n\n\u201cIn collaboration with everything, the fiscal authorities are doing both in terms of mobilising domestic revenue and rationalising expenditure at a time when much-needed resources are needed to combat the pandemic, that coordination would be critical,\u201d he said.\n\nChaudhuri also stressed the need for establishing a more systematic coordination mechanism between fiscal and monetary policy managers, as is being done in a range of countries around the world.\n\nHe stated that in such coordination, communication would be critical.\n\n\u201cWe are in a situation that is unprecedented across the world and it would require support from all members of the society. That is why we believe that communication is essential in anything that the government does,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his contribution, World Bank Lead Economist for Nigeria and co-author of the NDU, Marco Hernandez said: \u201cTo achieve Nigeria\u2019s potential is not up to one government.\u201d\n\nThis, according to the economist, will require sustained action from subsequent governments.\n\n\u201cSo, it is important that the citizens take part so that they can monitor progress and make suggestion going forward,\u201d he added.\n\nModeration in Food Prices Slows Inflation to 17.93%\n\nMeanwhile, the CPI, which measures inflation, dropped to 17.93 per cent (year-on-year) in May compared to 18.12 per cent in the preceding month, according to the NBS.\n\nThe 0.19 per cent decline in the headline index, makes it the second consecutive month that the rate has sustained its downward trajectory after 18 months of inflationary pressures on the economy.\n\nAccording to the CPI figures for May, food inflation dropped to 22.28 per cent from 22.72 per cent in April.\n\nPrice moderation was recorded in bread, cereals, milk, cheese, eggs, fish, soft drinks, coffee, tea and cocoa, fruits, meat, oils and fats and vegetables.\n\nOn a month-on-month basis, the food sub-index declined to 1.05 per cent in May from 0.99 per cent recorded in the preceding month.\n\nOn the other hand, core inflation, which excludes the prices of volatile agricultural produce rose to 13.15 per cent from 12.72 per cent in the review period.\n\nOn a month-on-month basis, the core sub-index increased by 1.24 per cent, the NBS stated.\n\nThe highest increases were recorded in prices of pharmaceutical products, garments, shoes and other footwear, hairdressing salons and personal grooming establishments.\n\nOthers are furniture and furnishing, carpet and other floor covering, motor cars, hospital services, fuels and lubricants for personal transport equipment, cleaning, repair and hire of clothing, other services in respect of personal transport equipment, gas, household textile and non-durable household goods.\n\nThe NBS said core inflation was highest in Kogi with 25.13 per cent; Bauchi, 23.02 per cent and Sokoto 20.11 per cent. Katsina, with 15.69 per cent; Imo, 15.52 per cent and Delta, 14.85 per cent recorded the slowest rise in headline year-on-year inflation.\n\nSimilarly, food inflation was highest in Kogi 32.82 per cent, Kwara 26.02 per cent and Enugu 25.43 per cent.

          "text": "James Emejo\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday said efforts are ongoing to reduce the country\u2019s import bill by about 35 per cent.\n\nHe said President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s insistence about five years ago on the diversification of the country\u2019s economic base had already started to yield positive results.\n\nThe CBN governor, while receiving a delegation from the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG), led by its governor, Mr. Buah Saidy, on a two-day working visit to the country, stated that the country currently has the potential to export and earn foreign currency from the production of urea for local production of fertiliser as well as petroleum product as soon as the Dangote refineries goes into operation by the first quarter of next year.\n\nThis, he said would help to reduce importation by about 35 per cent.\n\nHe said a country with a population of over 200 million should have food security, pointing out that this was why the CBN was aggressively looking into the area of food and, \u201cwhere we can use our own available raw materials to produce what we need in our country\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd we believe with time Nigeria will really be a greater country than it is today. We don\u2019t think we are great yet because we have a high import dependence in the country and we are doing everything possible to reduce imports.\n\n\u201cBut like you know, when we are able to reduce imports, encourage exports and encourage consumption spending and investment, those are some of the parameters that will ultimately boost our economy so that we can continue to see rapid growth in our GDP and see prosperity for our people.\u201d\n\nHe also told the visiting team that the apex bank has vast experiences in IT and cybersecurity, adding that its infrastructure had been proven to be impregnable to hackers.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere were some protests sometime last year and when the protest was going on we saw that people were trying to hack into systems and they tried to hack into the CBN systems.\n\n\u201cI got a message that the CBN system had been hacked into and I said the CBN system cannot be hacked into. I called our director in charge of IT and she responded that we have enough firewall that prevented the hack into our system. So those are the kinds of experiences we can share with you though expensive but will share then with you and think of how to work together to collaborate with yours.\u201d\n\nHowever, Saidy, who also said the CBG was having a difficult time regulating the banks in the Gambia especially in the areas of meting out sanctions to erring financial institutions had further sought to know the magic which the CBN had adopted to sanction banks\u2019 executives without repercussions.\n\nResponding, however, Emefiele attributed the successes to the support which the apex bank had enjoyed from the National Assembly.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the issue of the CBN independence, I thank you for the kind words. But I think the point is that we thank our own parliament. Our parliament has been extremely supportive of the CBN.\n\n\u201cThey put in place a central bank Act that grants independence to the CBN and we have our Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act that also grants a lot of power and authority for the CBN to bite when we find people who want to take advantage of the system for their own personal benefit and we don\u2019t breed any nonsense about people who try to take advantage of our system for their personal benefits.\n\n\u201cEverything must be done keeping in mind the overall national goals and objectives and that is why the CBN will act very fast on any economic agent that tries to undermine our policies and that\u2019s why we are very firm on them.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWorking with your parliamentary I believe you can have laws that can give you the kind of independence that you need in any, practically most of the central banks in the world today have independence that gives them the power to be able to manage monetary policy in a way that is beneficial to their countries and economy.\u201d\n\nEmefiele also said the apex bank was doing everything possible, apart from looking at currency adjustment when necessary, to confront issues of supply management and ensure that economy grows.\n\nHe said the CBN had adopted demand management strategies that will help to curtail imports and ensure that some of those goods that can be produced locally are not imported.\n\nMeanwhile, there are strong indications that CBN may seal an agreement with the Central Bank of the Gambia (CBG) to undertake the printing of legal tender for the latter.\n\nThis followed a request by the CBG for a possible collaboration as it seeks to address acute currency shortages in the country.\n\nAlready, Emefiele, while receiving a delegation, assured that the CBN has extremely competitive advantage to manage the currency printing job for The Gambia.\n\nHe said the Nigerian Security Printing and Minting Plc which was established in the early 1960s had been printing currency for the country, adding that the facility has a lot of idle capacity to satisfy the demand of the CBG.\n\nAmong other considerations, Saidy had informed the CBN governor that it is currently costly and unsustainable for the Gambia to continue to rely on its printer \u2013 De La Rue of London \u2013 for its currency needs.\n\nHe added that the distance coupled with some logistics and resource constraints had partly led to a current situation whereby the country had witnessed acute shortage of currency with the attendant implications for the economy.\n\nEmefiele, nevertheless, said: \u201cI note your point on currency management. The Nigerian mint was set up in the early 1960s and we\u2019ve been producing our currency since the early 60s and we have a lot of idle capacity to ensure that instead of you going to Europe or other countries, you will be able to benefit from our ideas.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cOur colleagues will take you to the security printing facility. Our colleagues that came in from Liberia two months ago were fascinated by the kind of facilities, we have at our Nigerian security printing and minting facility and I am sure that you will also enjoy them.\n\n\u201cAnd I am sure they will follow you back to the Gambia to see how they can help you to structure your economic order quantities so we can also be of assistance in printing your currency.\n\n\u201cAnd I can assure you that we can be extremely competitive if only from the stand point of logistics and freight from Europe but it\u2019s just going to be a few hours from here to the Gambia and the rest of them.\u201d\n\nThe CBG governor had further explained that it costs the bank about \u00a370,000 to lift printed currencies from Sri Lanka to the Gambia.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe also need assistance in currency management. Right now we have a situation where we are running very low on currency and at some point I get scared because we cannot at the central bank run out of currency completely as that will be a disaster.\n\n\u201cSo we want to learn from your estimate. We have a model but we have not looked at it yet \u2013 given to us by our printers \u2013 De La Rue. How they estimate the currency need of the country on yearly basis.\n\n\u201cBut I think it has some defects otherwise, the acute shortage we have currently would not have happened.\u201d\n\nSaidy said: \u201cWe placed an order for three years of currency to be printed but again, the contract with De La Rue since independence they have been printing our currency.\n\n\u201cYesterday in my interaction with the Deputy Governor, Mr. Kingsley Obiora, we realise that you print your own currency and I asked about security and he assured me that you have top of the line security features.\n\n\u201cSo this is another area I would want us to exchange ideas and have discussions on how possibly if we decide to go with you we can collaborate with your assistance to be printing our currency.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cAgain, it is closer, De La Rue is in London but they do the printing in Malta and also Sri Lanka. The last one was done in Sri Lanka.\n\n\u201cLifting those things all the way to the Gambia is costly because we had to do some emergency order and that cost was going to be on CBG but with negotiations and assuming then that we will give them this contract of three years of printing our currency, they now paid for the flight \u2013 about \u00a370,000 to lift those currencies to the Gambia.\u201d\n\nHe also said the CBG was in the country to benefit from the CBN\u2019s vast experiences on how it had successfully regulated the financial system and sought assistance in the areas of information technology, modernisation, cybersecurity, forex shipping and management, among others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Army chief says synergy now better among service chiefs\n\nDeji Elumoye and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday called for unity among West African States and those in the Sahel to deal with security challenges in their respective nations.\n\nAlso, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya, has said service chiefs now work in synergy, debunking insinuation that they failed in curbing the worsening insecurity in the country due to inter-agency rivalry.\n\nBuhari, while receiving the new Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for West Africa and the Sahel, Mahamat Annadif, at the State House, Abuja, said the security challenges were enormous and, there, required concerted efforts to tackle them.\n\nThe president, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, said: \u201cYou are our neighbour. You have vast experience on matters affecting the Sahel, having served for five years in Mali. I hope you will get the countries to work together to confront the issues affecting them.\n\n\u201cI hope under the auspices of UNOWAS, you will help get the problems sorted out. Most of them have to do with the instability in Libya, and it affects all of us.\u201d\n\nWhile describing the security challenges as \u201cenormous,\u201d Buhari added that the Boko Haram insurgency has ravished the lives and resources of Nigerians and inhabitants of some neighbouring countries while large swathes of Mali remain occupied by militants.\n\nHe promised Nigeria\u2019s support to Annadif to aid his new assignment.\n\nIn his remarks, Annadif said he was visiting shortly after his appointment because he recognised Nigeria\u2019s crucial role in West Africa.\n\nHe said the problems of the Sahel region were not new to him, which is why more than ever, he would depend on the help of Nigeria to succeed.\n\nSynergy Now Better among Service Chiefs, Says COAS\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya, has debunked the insinuation that the service chiefs failed to curb the worsening insecurity in the country due to lack of synergy among them.\n\nYahaya, who spoke while fielding questions from members of the House of Representatives Committees on Defence and Army at his screening, said there was synergy among the service chiefs.\n\nBuhari had appointed Yahaya to replace former COAS, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, who died in a plane crash in Kaduna.\n\nThe president consequently wrote to both chambers of the National Assembly, urging them to confirm Yahaya\u2019s appointment.\n\nAddressing the lawmakers, Yahaya said the job of securing the country was not a one man\u2019s job, adding that the service chiefs have always operated together, hence the composition of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Police, DSS and Civil Defence.\n\nHe said: \u201dAs we know, internal security is intelligence-driven operation. So we need others, including communities, including traditional rulers and all others who can provide information. We work together. At the army headquarters level here, all the service chiefs now luckily we were all mates in the academy. So there\u2019s not much gap. The CDS (Chief of Defence Staff) is a member of 34 regular course; we met him there.\n\nSo, at one time or the other, all of us were members of that academy together. The chief of naval staff and I were one time members of battalion. So, the synergy cannot be anything better now that we\u2019re brought up together; we have trained together.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on his plans to curb the worsening insecurity, the COAS said he would use his experience in the field over the years to make Nigeria safer.\n\nHe added: \u201dI joined the military 36 years ago, so, I brought along with me 36 years of military experience. I\u2019m abreast with the security requirements. I was involved in several security operations. The challenges we are facing now, all are characterised by these areas I mentioned, where I have first-hand information and have commanded troops and I administered them in achieving what we\u2019ve done.\n\n\u201cI believe I have the requisite requirements by the grace of God to now provide my services in this office of the Chief of Army Staff, if confirmed. What I brought is a wealth of experience and commitment. So I\u2019m committed and determined to provide my best and also having known what\u2019s required to achieve results.\u201d\n\nHe also appealed to all citizens for their support, adding that with the support of the people, Nigeria will win the fight against insecurity.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman, House Committee on Defence, Hon. Babajimi Benson, had said the insecurity bedeviling the country had cost it a lot both financially and in terms of human lives.\n\nHe tasked the COAS to bring to strive to end it.\n\nBenson said: \u2018This exercise comes at a very challenging time in the history of our dear country, Nigeria.\n\nOur nation has been besieged by several security issues across all the geopolitical zones with banditry, militancy and self-secessionists stretching our military to the extreme. The worst is the lingering insurgency in the North-east. This war has cost the country a lot both financially and in terms of human lives. This must stop. The Armed Forces of Nigeria needs to adopt innovative measures to curb the killings and wanton destruction of property as a result of these cases of insecurity.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, hope that, if confirmed, the new chief of army staff will do everything possible, working with other service chiefs, to bring this to an end.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "An Ikeja high court has convicted Francis Atuche, a former managing director of the defunct Bank PHB, of N25.7 billion fraud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a sitting that lasted over 11 hours on Wednesday, Lateefat Okunnu, the judge, also convicted Ugo Anyanwu, a former chief financial officer (CFO) of the bank.\n\nThe judge held that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) proved its case \u2014 which dates back over 10 years \u2014 beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nOkunnu, however, discharged Elizabeth, Atuche\u2019s wife, who was standing trial alongside the duo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe first defendant (Atuche) and the third defendant (Anyanwu) are found guilty of counts one to 11, 14 to 20, 23 and 24 of the charges contained in the information, and are convicted of conspiracy and stealing,\u201d the judge said.\n\n\u201cOn counts 12, 13, 21, 22 and 26, I pronounce the first to third defendants not guilty as the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n\u201cOn counts 25 and 27, the second defendant (Elizabeth) is found not guilty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBy stealing from the bank, they stole from innocent customers of the bank. I hereby make an order of restitution against the first and third defendants to refund the sums stated in counts one to 11, 14 and 24.\n\n\u201cThe sums are to paid to the relevant agencies that recovered the funds on behalf of the bank.\n\n\u201cThe first defendant is hereby sentenced to six years\u2019 imprisonment on counts one to 11, 14 to 20, 23 and 24. The third defendant is hereby sentenced to four years\u2019 imprisonment on counts one to 11, 14 to 20, 23 and 24.\u201d\n\nAccording to NAN, the judge, however, held that the sentences would run concurrently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOkunnu noted that both convicts defrauded the bank using well-recognised stockbrokers to transfer money under the guise of loans and shares.\n\n\u201cIt was a well-planned, well-executed scheme but the bubble burst when the Central Bank of Nigeria intervened,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe first defendant (Atuche) was diversionary and evasive on the witness stand; sometimes confrontational and rude. The third defendant (Anyanwu) was also combative and rude under cross-examination.\u201d\n\nOn Atuche\u2019s wife, the judge said there was no proof that the two companies affiliated to Elizabeth fraudulently received N2 billion worth of Bank PHB shares.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNothing was proved beyond reasonable doubt that she silently or knowingly endorsed the perpetuation of fraud. Rather, it was the first defendant (Atuche).

          "title": "In-house vs. Agency: What tech startups can learn from the biggest question of the corporate world",
          "text": "From the birth of management consulting in the aftermath of the 1921 Depression to the golden era of advertising in the 1950s, followed by strategy, IT, and accounting consultants in the three decades that followed, large corporation leaders have, for a long time, had options on human resource, with external expertise sometimes a competition to internal competence, and other times a complement.\n\nHowever, the trend of firm/agency adoption has been trailed by criticism as consultants debate, among other things, the decision to\u2026 yes, hire consultants, leaving business leaders with a lot to think about, and sometimes the confusion on which approach to take. While there are similarities in their dilemmas, tech startup founders do not have as much luxury and are by nature, designed to achieve more with less. Perhaps the most difficult of the questions is on what is truly more, or less.\n\nStartup founders understandably tend towards the desire to have as much as possible done internally, especially on verticals like brand, marketing, advertising, and media (or one could just say \u2018marketing\u2019, for ease). This desire is inspired by, among other factors, 1. the need to be agile; 2. the need to be understood; 3. the need to be lean; 4. the need to invest in internal competence; and 5. the need for control.\n\nThere are a few downsides to keep in mind, however, but we will (subsequently) discuss alternative approaches to maximizing the pros.\n\nRestricted flow of ideas due to the monotony of challenge in-house. Rigidity of human resources as you cannot just \u201cchange hands to switch things up\u201d, like you could ask an agency to switch people working on your account (or even change the agency altogether). Difficulty in attracting top talent as a good percentage are more likely to choose being in the company of their like-minds for exchange of ideas, among other things.\n\nWhile a lot of these ring true, the motivations for internal teams remain strong, and rightly so. Below are a few things startup founders surely want to ponder upon as they work towards success with these objectives while avoiding some of the issues raised above.\n\nOn operations \u2014 the need to be agile\n\nStartups are rightly concerned about the speed and flexibility they can expect from agencies.\n\nBeyond clearly discussing these expectations, which is very important, it helps to design a system where the agency professionals devoted to the project are clearly known and there is a communication system that is transparent, with collaborators from both sides being able to interact through platforms that make new teams out of the collaboration. Think about it like a Joint Task Force.\n\nOn quality \u2014 the need to be understood\n\nFounders trust their ability to get their teams on board with the bigger picture, values and more. They are sometimes unsure how to extend this for external teams.\n\nFirst, it is important to remember that while the internal perspective may be the most important, it is only one side to the full view. Agencies are able to see the company from without and escape the trappings of confirmation biases, and a lot more.\n\nAs a collaboration appears like a better balance of perspectives, it helps to ensure that there are key internal stakeholders on the project team, with at least one of them being well versed in the field of expertise being outsourced. They help to provide that \u201cfrom-within\u201d influence. Usually, there is a co-founder or top executive deeply involved in these conversations, as they set the direction for major decisions.\n\nOn budget \u2014 the need to be lean\n\nNeedless to state that startups need to cut costs and spend wisely to extend their runways.\n\nMany startups decide to go fully in-house as a way to cut costs but the only way that results in lower costs is if they set up teams with people with far lower capacities compared to agency professionals. It\u2019s either that or they are breaking the bank to match up, as they make up for the tendency of this top talent to prefer teams of their peers, if pay was the same. There is hardly any true saving of costs in this regard, especially when you also add how agencies are able to spread their payroll across multiple talents and hence be relatively cheaper in fees for the client.\n\nA better way to save money is to combine an internal team of a few seasoned experts, some mid-level talents or interns with an experienced team (external) that is tasked with setting the foundation and helping to fully onboard (or sometimes train) the internal team. A continuous but cheaper path to continuity may involve the internal team doing the day-to-day work while using the guardianship of the external agency.\n\nOn talent \u2014 the need to invest in internal competence\n\nStartups are thinking about breaking that bank as a long-term investment in talent development.\n\nWhile this is a great approach when there is the budget for it, perhaps the best gift for an in-house team is to not close them up, no matter high the quality of talent within, but to rather open them up to the exchange of ideas achievable with collaboration from external teams who readily come with more diversity in experience.\n\nOn trust \u2014 the need for control (or commitment)\n\nMany startup founders have experienced being treated as \u201cone of many clients\u201d, feeling helpless and being unable to control timeline and delivery issues.\n\nThe thought here is to simply shop carefully, and speak to other startup founders who have worked with agencies to determine which ones have the best systems that ensure that despite the inability to directly manage the condition of things, as external engagements go, they can be trusted to commit to the goals of the clients. This calls for a thorough process of choosing the agencies and firms to work with, but just like hiring staff, the work is always hard but worth it.\n\nOne more place to look at is in the contracts and SLAs, ensuring that expectations are clearly stated as well as clear systems to check and review the progress of work week in week out, or bi-monthly.\n\nThere are hardly any definite answers, surely not from the traditional \u201ccorporate world\u201d. What we have to work with are lessons and talking points to thoroughly think around as each team finds its own fit.\n\nIn the end, it may be more about how best to combine both than which side to commit to.\n\nVictor Fatanmi is the Managing Partner at FourthCanvas, a brand strategy and design agency focused on African tech ecosystems.\n\nShare this article",

Armed with our new motto \u2013 \u201cEveryone is invited\u201d \u2013 we are telling more pan-African stories and covering more regions on the continent.\n\nAnd speaking of stories, we decided to give them a better, cooler home. The result of that decision is what you are currently reading this on \u2013 our new website!\n\nWe\u2019ve been at this since 2013 and so far we\u2019ve been able to bring much-needed attention to Africa\u2019s nascent startup and innovation scene. From local startup news to funding rounds across Africa, we\u2019ve kept you up to date with all of it but most importantly, we\u2019ve shown you how technology is positively impacting Africa.\n\nSo what\u2019s new?\n\nSometimes you just want to rest your eyes from the brightness of your devices and a lot of platforms give you that option these days. Well, the new TC website is not left out. You can flip the switch and enjoy your favourite stories in dark mode or light mode!\n\nDark mode\n\nLight Mode\n\nTC Insights:\n\nOur TechCabal Insights team is always bringing you the best in actionable data and research. Now, you can easily find reports created by the TC Insights team under the reports section of our new website!\n\nTC Reports\n\nWe\u2019ve also included a page that houses all our video content. In the past, you could only watch videos on our Youtube page. Now you can watch TC Live or Building From Ground Up episodes directly on our new website.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all, our flagships are now super easy to find:\n\nAbout the flagships\n\nFrom telling human angle stories of how Africans use technologies to reporting big tech and exploring everyday trends as seen on social media, our stories are grouped into a diverse range of interests and consistently shared in different categories.\n\nMy Life In Tech\n\nWhat does it mean to have a career in tech?

          "text": "Mazi Mobility, a mobility-as-a-service (Maas) startup founded by Jesse Forrester, recently launched its flagship electric motorcycle fleet in Nairobi, Kenya. Mazi Mobility is backed by global Venture Builder, Satgana.\n\nMazi uses motorcycles, locally known as \u2018bodas\u2019, to accelerate the transition to efficient, affordable and clean transport in the city. The startup also introduced battery swapping stations that provide on-demand energy, reducing transportation costs by 50%. The MK3 offers a choice between a single and dual battery, capable of up to 70km and 140km of range, respectively. Mazi is taking a multi-stakeholder approach to drive the e-mobility sector forward. They are working with boda operators, technical institutions and manufacturers to ensure the successful implementation of their service.\n\n\u201cMazi is not just an EV company, we are advocates for a sustainable mass mobility change,\u201d says Jesse Forrester, Co-Founder and CEO at Mazi Mobility.\n\n\u201cAt Mazi, we believe that Africans should be able to move efficiently, and affordably across cities at less than the price of personal vehicle ownership while reducing CO2 emissions. What industry is better to see this change than the boda one? Mazi is taking a long approach to mobility, we don\u2019t want to just have the same status quo but with electric vehicles. At Mazi we move people, data and things. Twende Kazi na Mazi!\u201d\n\nSupporting Mazi on their journey is Satgana, a global Venture Builder on a mission to launch and fund responsible startups aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nSatgana backs purpose-driven entrepreneurs who at the core of their business model want to address the social and environmental pillars of the SDGs. They become hands-on partners, supporting their startups with strategy, technology, investor readiness, and impact management.\n\nAs an e-mobility startup, Mazi Mobility fulfils one or more of the UN\u2019s SDGs including SDG#8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG#11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and SDG#13 (Climate Action).\n\nIn a conversation with Konstantin Behr, Venture Builder at Satgana, he shared with TechCabal what he looks out for in prospective founders:\n\n\u201cFrom the get-go, we analyse how impact-driven a founder is\u2013 that helps us determine if we\u2019re a right fit for them and vice versa.\n\nI am very passionate about the African continent and having been working in the ecosystem for the last 3 years, I have seen amazing growth in startups and increasing interest from foreign investors. Mazi Mobility is our first venture in Africa.\u201d\n\nWhile most Venture Builders hire founders to execute their ideas and strategic plans for a product or business, Satgana\u2019s approach is unique and colors outside the box.\n\nSatgana aims to build and invest into startups alongside purpose-driven entrepreneurs, wherever they are, by using innovation-led and market-based approaches to solve the greatest social and environmental challenges of our time. And alongside Mazi, they hope to write a new chapter in the history of e-mobility in Africa.\n\nFounder and CEO at Satgana, Romain Diaz, elaborated on the launch of their first portfolio venture saying,\n\n\u201cThe urgent need to decarbonise our economies places transportation at the cusp of a fundamental shift towards electric solutions and mobility in Africa is ripe for disruption. As such, Satgana is beyond excited to be involved in the launch of Mazi and truly believes in the founding team\u2019s ability to make it happen. Since day-1, we have been impressed by Jesse\u2019s vision and execution capability. As a Venture Builder, we are humbled to be able to support Mazi in its mission to make urban transportation sustainable while empowering low-income drivers.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Nigerian logistics giant, GIG Logistics (GIGL), recently introduced four all-electric cargo vans into its Lagos fleet, in partnership with indigenous automaker, JET Motor Company (JET).\n\nSpeaking during a press conference held at GIGL\u2019s Lagos digital hub last Friday, GIGL Director of Operations, Ocholi Etu, revealed that the partnership \u201cstarted about two years ago, when we approached JET to provide us with a fleet of all-electric cargo vans, for last-mile delivery across Nigeria.\u201d\n\nGIGL Director of Operations, Ocholi Etu, speaking at the press conference\n\nBack in 2020, about 15 months earlier, JET announced raising $9m solely to fund research and development into building the \u2018Tesla of Africa\u2019. Before that, the almost four-year-old automaker had already established its petrol-powered JET Mover line with a respectable customer base.\n\nHowever, the company\u2019s Director of Sales and Marketing, Rupani Sanjay, maintained at the time that the end goal was Africa-centric electric vehicles (EV), hence the capital raise (which was completed in 2019). The original plan was to launch the \u2018JET EV\u2019 cargo line in Q3 2020. Plans were, however, set back a couple of months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigeria is ridden with epileptic power supply and other infrastructural challenges that make electric vehicles basically impractical and, as some would argue, near-pointless in the market.\n\n\u201cThat is why we are kicking things off with the four electric vans over an intra-city route,\u201d JET Strategy Lead/Chief Financial Officer, Joseph Wemimo, clarifies.\n\nL-R: Ocholi Etu, Joseph Wemimo, and Rupani Sanjay (second from right) signing the Memorandum of Understanding\n\nBoth parties will be pacing themselves, even as JET is expected to provide GIGL with at least 46 more JET EV vans over the next two years.\n\nIn the meantime, they appear to have a lot of things figured out. For example, each JET EV van ships with a 107.8 kWh lithium-ion battery, which Wemimo says can cover a distance of about 240 km on a single charge.\n\nA peek under the bonnet of GIGL\u2019s JET EV van\n\n\u201cIn fact, they can actually cover over 300 km on a full charge,\u201d Wemimo points out, \u201cbut in our research, after considering traffic and load capacity, among other factors, we found that they can do a minimum of 240 km easily.\u201d\n\nA closeup of the charging station at GIGL\u2019s digital hub, Lagos. The facility can charge two vehicles at a time, to full capacity, all within two hours\n\nOther environment-specific features include shock absorbers that are \u201cstronger than average, higher ground clearance, bigger tires\u201d and other specifications carried over from the JET Mover line, which, as Sanjay explained to Techpoint Africa last year, is a product of over three years of research, testing, and iterative development, inspired by a mix of the best design and technology practices from Europe and Asia, and tropicalised for Africa.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to create a global product that is built to last. We were obsessed with getting it right because, if our vehicles can work well on Nigerian and African roads, they can succeed anywhere in the world,\u201d Sanjay explained at the time.\n\nWith regards to the effect Lagos\u2019 notorious traffic could have on battery life, Wemimo has this to say:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have optimised the batteries to discharge at the rate of only 2% while idling. So even if you spend 10 hours in traffic, you can still easily cover 240km if the battery is fully charged.\u201d\n\nFor perspective, 300km is the driving distance from Lagos to Benin. For even more perspective, a fully charged van that leaves GIGL\u2019s Lagos digital hub in Gbagada \u2014 currently the only location with charging stations \u2014 sets out for the GIGL outlet along Ilupeju, makes a stop at GIGL Jibowu before heading out for the GIGL outlet along the Lekki-Ajah expressway, and then back to the digital hub, would have covered only about 83km \u2014 roughly one-third of its single-charge capacity.\n\nGoogle Maps estimation of the hypothetical route\n\n\u201cThe plan is to continue establishing more charging stations across Lagos, but this is dependent on demand,\u201d Wemimo explains.\n\n\u201cOur end goal is for GIGL to be fully carbon-neutral,\u201d Etu adds, \u201cmeaning that every vehicle that we use will be fully electric. And hopefully, with support from the government for more charging stations along, say, Sagamu or Ijebu-Ode expressway, we can take it beyond Lagos.\n\n\u201cWhy do they need government support?\u201d you may ask. Wemimo explains:\n\n\u201cIf you look at developed markets like Norway, where the government plans to completely phase out petrol and diesel cars by 2025, there are various incentives \u2014 including tax waivers, cash incentives, and investments \u2014 to encourage mass consumer adoption and innovation in the EV space.\u201d\n\nL-R: Rupani Sanjay and Joseph Wemimo, JET Director of Sales & Marketing and Strategy Lead, respectively\n\nIn the same vein, Sanjay claims that at its current capacity, JET\u2019s Lagos-based assembly plant can produce five to seven vehicles a day \u2014 and about 5,000 annually \u2014 on demand.\n\n\u201cBut in the end, it doesn\u2019t matter how many units we can produce daily if there isn\u2019t enough demand, incentivised by government policies.\u201d\n\nTo clarify, even in South Africa, which is considered Africa\u2019s most developed EV market, only 1,000 out of every 12 million vehicles on the road are said to be electric-powered. Moreover, Cape Verde appears to be the only African country whose government is actively looking (PDF) to phase out electric vehicles within the near future. Compare this with Asia, Europe, and the Americas, where at least 17 countries have similar policies.\n\nNevertheless, GIGL and JET are soldiering on at a deliberate pace.\n\n\u201cWe cannot wait for infrastructure and policy to become favourable. We are moving ahead of the country, and hopefully, the country will catch up with us,\u201d Etu remarks.\n\nWithin the next five to seven years, GIGL hopes to convert over 60% to 70% of its fleet to fully electric vehicles. Furthermore, JET is contractually obligated to offer GIGL one year of free after-sales support and training for internal technicians to aid the transition.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanjay emphasises that JET is open to partnering with more brands and organisations besides GIGL.\n\n\u201cWhile our EV segment currently focuses on the cargo version for intra-city logistics, we are open to partnerships with everyone in Lagos and across Nigeria: private tour companies, medical services, schools, government, and even the military.\u201d\n\nRecommend Watch\n\nNigeria\u2019s Siltech produces electric vehicles, for a cleaner Africa",
          "summary": "Nigerian logistics giant, GIG Logistics (GIGL), recently introduced four all-electric cargo vans into its Lagos fleet, in partnership with indigenous automaker, JET Motor Company (JET).\nThe original plan was to launch the \u2018JET EV\u2019 cargo line in Q3 2020.\nAdvertisementNigeria is ridden with epileptic power supply and other infrastructural challenges that make electric vehicles basically impractical and, as some would argue, near-pointless in the market.\nMoreover, Cape Verde appears to be the only African country whose government is actively looking (PDF) to phase out electric vehicles within the near future.\nWithin the next five to seven years, GIGL hopes to convert over 60% to 70% of its fleet to fully electric vehicles.",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nNigeria\u2019s telecommunications workers to go on strike\n\nHelium Health launches in Kenya\n\nMarketForce acquires Digiduka\n\nPlanned strike by Nigeria\u2019s telecommunications workers.\n\nThe Private Telecommunications and Communications Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PTECSSAN) has announced a three-day warning strike starting today, Wednesday, June 16.\n\nAccording to The Punch, the PTECSSAN President, Opeyemi Tomori, decried the poor working conditions of its members and the disregard for labour laws in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigerians are no strangers to strike actions, but this would be the first by the country\u2019s telecommunications workers. Techpoint Africa spoke with customer care representatives from MTN and Airtel, who either claimed ignorance of the strike or said that their services would not be affected.\n\nIf it goes ahead as planned, it could have damaging effects on an economy already grappling with a Twitter ban and widespread insecurity.\n\nInterestingly, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) records that Nigeria\u2019s telecommunications industry contributed 15.05% to the nation\u2019s GDP in 2020.\n\nFollowing reports of a planned strike by telecommunications workers last year, the Federal Government stepped in. They may do so again.\n\nHelium Health launches in Kenya\n\nAdegoke Olubisi (CEO), Tito Ovia (Head, Public Growth Sector), Dimeji Sofowora (CFO)\n\nAfter announcing expansion plans last year, Nigerian healthtech startup, Helium Health, has finally launched in Kenya. This comes after its $10 million Series A raise in May 2020.\n\nAt the time of the raise, the startup announced that the funds would be used for its expansion and the development of new products to make the doctor-patient experience more seamless.\n\nCo-founder and Head of Public Sector Growth, Tito Ovia, announced that the startup is already working with three local partners to improve efficiency and provide better service to patients. Simultaneously, it is rolling out its services in Liberia and Uganda.\n\nHelium Health claims to have over 300 healthcare providers and 5,000 health professionals using its technology to improve access to healthcare for patients.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith this move, the six-year-old startup is now present in six West African countries, making it one of the largest healthtech startups in the region.\n\nHealthtech startups in the continent have started getting more recognition, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Disrupt Africa reports that funding for healthtech startups on the continent increased by 257.5% from 2019 to 2020.\n\nMarketForce acquires Digiduka\n\nKenyan startup, MarketForce, has announced the acquisition of Digiduka. The company provides a software solution that allows field agents to record their activities and collect data using handheld devices electronically. This way, businesses can monitor the performance of their sales channels.\n\nOn the other hand, Digiduka helps retailers earn extra money by reselling digital services such as airtime and electricity tokens and also provide them with the payments infrastructure needed to run their businesses.\n\nAccording to Tesh Mbaabu, MarketForce Co-founder and CEO, acquiring Digiduka, rather than competing with them, makes sense as it means the two companies are joining forces to solve a common problem. As part of the buy, Digiduka\u2019s staff will join MarketForce\u2019s team.\n\nFounded in 2018, MarketForce has raised over $2.5 million in funding from investors such as Future Africa, Y Combinator, Ventures Platform, and EchoVC Partners.\n\nAcquisitions are attractive to startups looking to enter new markets, and this seems to be the case with Digiduka. For example, Ajua, a Kenyan consumer experience platform for businesses, bought WayaWaya in April 2021 to take advantage of its payment bots.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nThe biggest stereotypes about young, unemployed Africans.

          "text": "On Monday, June 14, 2021, the Private Telecommunications and Communications Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PTECSSAN) \u2014 a union that protects the rights of telecom workers in Nigeria \u2014 announced plans to embark on a three-day warning strike.\n\nThe industrial action will start today, Wednesday, June 16, 2021. Reportedly, users may be unable to conveniently use data and call services during the three days as the strike is likely to disrupt these services.\n\nAccording to The Punch, PTECSSAN is embarking on the strike to express their concerns against what the General Secretary, Okonu Abdullahi, calls \u201carbitrary sackings and casualisations\u201d.\n\nAbdullahi said that workers are usually outsourced, which has caused a significant problem in the industry. And since it\u2019s a continual problem, workers are always shortchanged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent times, PTECSSAN has made demands and even threatened to go on strike regarding this problem. However, none of their demands has been met.\n\nIn August 2020, PTECSSAN threatened to go on a two-week warning strike over the remuneration of workers, employee relations practices, exit packages for long-term staff, and alleged abuse of expatriate quota, among others.\n\nMoreover, in March 2021, the telecom association planned to embark on industrial strike action against Huawei Technologies Nigeria Limited, a telecom equipment company. They kept denying workers the right to unionise.\n\nHowever, following the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami\u2019s intervention, that strike action was suspended. In a statement, he said that the telecom equipment company was ready to address the concerns PTECSSAN raised.\n\nThe strike action reportedly commencing today is against the precarious working conditions in the telecom sector like ignoring occupational health and safety, lack of hazard allowance and poor remuneration, and the abuse of national laws and institutions by employers.\n\nWhile the association may be protesting for its rights, the disruptions of data and call services may affect the Nigerian economy.\n\nYesterday, Tuesday, June 15, 2021, MTN reportedly said that due to insecurity in the country, service in Nigeria might be disrupted.\n\nWhat this means is that MTN\u2019s technical support team, in some cases, may not get to the site and achieve an optimum result timely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecall that we wrote that the Nigerian telecom lost 15.5 million mobile subscribers between December 2020 and March 2021 following the SIM registration ban. Therefore, this won\u2019t be the first disruption to the telecom sector in recent months.\n\nIn 2020, Internet shutdowns cost sub-Saharan Africa $237.4 million.\n\nAccording to Statista, as of January 2021, there were 4.66 billion active Internet users globally. In Nigeria, as of January 2021, there were 187.9 million mobile connections and 104.4 million people connected to the Internet, per Data Reportal.\n\nDeloitte\u2019s 2016 The Economic Impact of Disruptions to Internet Connectivity Report shows that in a low connectivity country, with a GDP per capita of $6,000, a population of c. 40 million people, and fixed broadband penetration of c. 5%, a temporary Internet shutdown could have an estimated GDP impact of c. $3 million per day of disruption, amounting a 0.4% of daily GDP.\n\nThis reveals the importance of the Internet to business today.\n\nWe reached out to MTN and Airtel, but as of press time, we are yet to receive a response.\n\nIt\u2019s not certain if Pantami will intervene this time, neither is it known if the industrial strike action will aid the association\u2019s demands.",

Lately corps members are being deployed to meet the needs of the health care system in the region, owing to the state government\u2019s failure to employ more doctors and nurses.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cHow do the NYSC authority want us to work and contribute our quota to the development of our mother\u2019s land in an areas that are not safe, where kidnappers on daily basis invade the areas, even with the presence of security operatives\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to the presidency and the National Assembly to intervene and reason along with us because It\u2019s just a sucide mission\u201d, he said.\n\nHe also noted that there were hardly any provisions made for the corps members in terms of accommodation and security.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe country\u2019s insecurity has affected various states in Nigeria, and it is becoming alarming. This is to the Director-General of NYSC; please allow all corps members to relocate or redeploy to their states of choice.\n\n\u201cWe expect that when posted to a camp, and after you manage to spend three weeks in camp, you should be able to relocate to your state of choice irrespective of your state of origin or course of study because the country is unstable right now.\n\n\u201cThe NYSC DG has made relocation difficult for doctors, nurses, medical laboratory scientists and pharmacists and people who studied some other courses.\n\n\u201cWe observe that some failed State governments are using these sets of people in place of doctors and nurses that ought to be in the system. The government has refused to employ workers, so corps members in the medical profession are used in hospitals as the major staff members instead of a support system.\n\n\u201cThey have refused to relocate us to where we want to go because it feels safe for us. At a time like this, we need to be around our family or relatives and not just in any state, so it is so wrong to disapprove our relocation requests.\n\n\u201cI believe we have just one life to live and our lives are more important than where we are posted to work. I am a medical doctor, posted to Jos, Plateau State, but due to the insecurity, we decided to redeploy from there and some of my colleagues used medical reports, which showed they were not OK. The criteria for leaving were medical reasons or insecurity, or marriage, so we submitted our relocation form. I left the orientation camp because I was not too fine; I wanted to go back to Delta.\n\n\u201cIn my camp, only about two persons were allowed to relocate out of about 33 doctors and those who got theirs were seriously connected. Should we go to the North and die because I am a government child?\n\n\u201cOf all my friends who are also medical practitioners, only about four were posted to Ekiti, Osun and other southern states; the rest were taken to Sokoto and Kaduna. One of us encountered bandits on his way to Sokoto; he escaped, though and we had to ask him to put on his WhatsApp location to know wherever he was going.\n\n\u201cThe accommodation they give corps members is not befitting. My friend in Borno told me they lost a corps member, a pharmacist, during the camp. She was 24 years old and she had started panting after they played volleyball. They rushed her to the clinic but in less than 10 minutes, she died. The clinic had no oxygen. It was after she died that the oxygen arrived. So the official there told them to lie that the lady died at the referral hospital. You can imagine this\u201d, the corper disclosed\n\n...",

A brush cutter is a powered garden or agricultural tool used to trim weeds, small trees, and other foliage not accessible by a lawnmower or rotary mower.\n\nIn a letter from SUBEB, signed on behalf of the Executive Chairman by the Public and Private Partnership Officer, Akinlehin Temitope, the board thanked the leading philanthropist and community supporter and offered its warmest regards.\n\nThe letter which is specifically in respect of the donation to Imule Primary in Esan West LGA on March 18, 2021, read in part, \u201cThe Board lauds your generous initiative of complementing her efforts in ensuring quality basic education delivery in Edo State and also looks forward to more partnership in this regard.\u201d\n\nMr. Iseghohimen thanked the Education Board for the gesture noting that he received the letter of commendation with great joy and deep appreciation. He revealed that he has a deep love for Illeh community and Esan land in general and would continually seek to improve the quality of life in the communities across Esan and thus make the residents happy.\n\nThe philanthropy enthusiast prayed that God would grant the members of the communities their good heart desires along with good health and wealth so that they can continue to contribute to the development of the state. He noted that the development of the community must not only be the responsibility of the government but of every member of the community whether they reside there or not.\n\nHe ascribed all the glory to God for his help and pledged to persist in seeking ways to contribute to the socio-economic development of Esan land and Edo State.\n\nMr. Iseghohimen called on other well-meaning individuals to support the government\u2019s effort to improve the quality of life in communities across not just Esan West but also the whole Edo State.\n\nThe philanthropist had earlier renovated Eresoyen Primary School in Uhogua, Community in Edo State and is constantly looking for new options to give back to the community.\n\nDennis Ainabel Iseghohimen is the founder and Director of Nicholas Auto Solution (NAS), www.nicholasautosolution.co.za, Founder, ROTBW Foundation www.rotbwfoundation.com among other businesses.\n\n...",

The reasons are still sticking and they are not far-fetched.\n\n\u201cIn case Lawan needs to be reminded, paragraph 14 of the 3rd schedule of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) forbids a person involved in partisan politics to hold office as a member of INEC.\n\n\u201cRelying on the above in demanding for a litmus of respect for the supremacy of the 1999 Constitution, the PDP holds that Onochie, as a card-carrying member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) from Ward 5 Onicha Olona, Aniocha North Local Government Area of Delta State and who is also a public campaigner for the APC and President Buhari, cannot, by any stroke of imagination, be appointed as an INEC official at any level and under any guise whatsoever.\n\n\u201cIf anything, our party assures Senator Lawan that his desperation to appoint Onochie into INEC through the backdoor is an act of rebelliousness to the 1999 constitution as well as impudence to the sensibilities of Nigerians, which must never be allowed to stand.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the PDP directs our members and other democratically minded members of the National Assembly, across party lines, to activate and deploy all legislative instruments at their disposal against Onochie\u2019s confirmation as a National Commissioner of INEC.\n\n\u201cThe PDP also directs all our members and all lovers of democracy across the country to get ready to use all legitimate means including civic action against Senator Lawan and the APC leadership in the Senate if they do not rescind their attempt to confirm Onochie at all costs.\n\n\u201cThe intent and purpose of the PDP are to preserve the sanctity and credibility of INEC and our party will never allow Senator Lawan and his APC to smuggle a fox into INEC sheep pen in their bid to corrupt and further desecrate the commission and derail our national effort towards free, fair and credible electoral process in our country.\n\n\u201cOur party also cautions Buhari Presidency to end its ignoble attempt to compromise the Senate and our electoral system in its bid to perpetuate its misrule beyond 2023.\u201d Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "The Peoples Democratic Party has threatened civil action against the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, if he fails to return the nomination of presidential aide, Lauretta Onochie, as a National Commissioner in the Independent National Electoral Commission.\n\nAccording to the party, \u201cLawan will have nobody but himself to blame for the ridiculing of his tenure in office if he failed to return the nomination as demanded by Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe PDP also asked the \u201cChairman of the Senate Committee on INEC, Senator Kabiru Gaya, to resist the attempt by Senator Lawan to drag him into public ignominy and odium by engaging him to do an incredulous, irresponsible and dirty job of returning a confirmation of Onochie to the Committee of the Whole Senate.\u201d\n\nThe party said this in a statement titled, \u2018INEC: Return Onochie\u2019s Nomination To Buhari Now, PDP Tells Lawan, Gaya,\u2019 signed by the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cThe PDP charges Senator Gaya to immediately stand down all deliberations that concern Onochie before his committee.\n\n\u201cSenator Lawan must know that Nigerians are now holding him directly answerable for gross misconduct and impeachable act of perfidy for sending Onochie\u2019s already rejected nomination to the Gaya\u2019s Committee, in utter violation of the provisions of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and total derision for the sensibility of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cOur party reminds Senator Lawan that the reasons that forced his hands to stand down Onochie\u2019s faulted nomination eight months ago have neither changed nor abated. The reasons are still sticking and they are not far-fetched.\n\n\u201cIn case Lawan needs to be reminded, paragraph 14 of the 3rd schedule of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) forbids a person involved in partisan politics to hold office as a member of INEC.\n\n\u201cRelying on the above in demanding for a litmus of respect for the supremacy of the 1999 Constitution, the PDP holds that Onochie, as a card-carrying member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) from Ward 5 Onicha Olona, Aniocha North Local Government Area of Delta State and who is also a public campaigner for the APC and President Buhari, cannot, by any stroke of imagination, be appointed as an INEC official at any level and under any guise whatsoever.\n\n\u201cIf anything, our party assures Senator Lawan that his desperation to appoint Onochie into INEC through the backdoor is an act of rebelliousness to the 1999 constitution as well as impudence to the sensibilities of Nigerians, which must never be allowed to stand.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the PDP directs our members and other democratically minded members of the National Assembly, across party lines, to activate and deploy all legislative instruments at their disposal against Onochie\u2019s confirmation as a National Commissioner of INEC.\n\n\u201cThe PDP also directs all our members and all lovers of democracy across the country to get ready to use all legitimate means including civic action against Senator Lawan and the APC leadership in the Senate if they do not rescind their attempt to confirm Onochie at all costs.\n\n\u201cThe intent and purpose of the PDP are to preserve the sanctity and credibility of INEC and our party will never allow Senator Lawan and his APC to smuggle a fox into INEC sheep pen in their bid to corrupt and further desecrate the commission and derail our national effort towards free, fair and credible electoral process in our country.\n\n\u201cOur party also cautions Buhari Presidency to end its ignoble attempt to compromise the Senate and our electoral system in its bid to perpetuate its misrule beyond 2023.\u201d Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

These range from pain, swelling at the site of the inoculation, to body pains and nausea.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, 52 cases of moderate to severe incidents of AEFI have been reported. These presented as fever, vomiting, diarrhea headaches, dizziness and allergic reactions.\n\n\u201cFive states have the highest records of the AEFI namely: Kaduna (970) Cross River (859), Yobe (541), Kebbi (511), and Lagos (448),\u201d he disclosed.\n\nAccording to Shuaib, as of today, April 16th, 1,071,346, representing 53.2% of the eligible persons targeted with the AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered their first dose in this vaccination phase.\n\nHe said the data were based on reports received from states through the Electronic Management of Immunization Data (EMID) system only and did not take into account vaccinations that were not yet captured in the system.\n\n\u201cWhat this number means is that these are the people who have their information already uploaded on our data base, while others are awaiting upload, potentially due to network problems and the high traffic of those coming in to take their shots at the same time.\n\n\u201cWhile we continue to optimize our registration and immunization data system, we also encourage the state teams to deploy the most suitable internet service for their locations in order to speed up the data entry process, so that we can have the actual number of vaccinated people at any given time,\u201d he said.\n\nShuaib added that in many states, the inoculation of frontline health workers had been completed and that they had begun offering vaccination to the elderly, particularly those that were 65 years and above.\n\n\u201cWe are glad to be able to progress quickly offer immunization to more members of the community.\n\n\u201cOur rollout has been marked by safety, efficiency, best practice, and speed. The National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) and its development partners, have a platform of Senior Supervisors that engage in daily evening review meetings to determine the status of the COVID-19 vaccine implementation in all States & the FCT.\u201d",

          "text": "Banditry in the Northwestern section of Nigeria, according to a group of bandits, began when Zamfara was created out of Sokoto in 1996 under the reign of the late military Head of State, Sani Abacha.\n\nThe bandits stated this in a video interview with Daily Trust published on Wednesday.\n\nFulani herdsmen have been exposed to humiliation, hardship, and neglect in the past under democratic regimes that began in 1999 and have pushed them to take up arms, according to the gang\u2019s commander, who spoke in Hausa.\n\nAccording to them, successive Nigerian administrations have failed to share the country\u2019s wealth with the nomads, leaving them illiterate and hungry, forcing them to resort to banditry to survive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been long we started. We started not long after Zamfara State was created. We took up arms because we are herders and despite this country\u2019s wealth, we are not carried along, we are not educated, we do not know anything. We do not have security, we do not have any benefit.\n\n\u201cWe are the ones being killed but are always seen as the aggressors. We don\u2019t have anything. Wherever a herder is, he is uneducated and has nothing. In this country, there is everything but we are not carried along. It is as if though we don\u2019t exist. We are just being killed,\u201d the leader of the gang said in the video.\n\nHe also mentioned a pact that the Nigerian government had previously broken, which was supposed to put a stop to banditry in the region.\n\nThe bandits stated that the government failed to keep its half of the bargain, bemoaning that killings occur on a daily basis in the North West, with no respect for tribe.\n\n\u201cOf course, it has been breached. You have asked for an armistice. An agreement was reached but you left that person in the forest with a gun and nothing was to substitute. What do you expect? How do you want that person to survive?\n\n\u201cAll promises made to us, none of them was fulfilled and nothing was done to enrol the young ones in schools. We should be treated the same way and given jobs, by the government. The Hausa, Yoruba, and Fulani should be treated equally,\u201d the bandits said.\n\nSpeaking, the leader of the marauding gang said President Muhammadu Buhari should head the peace talks if he is serious about ending banditry and insecurity in the country.\n\nFurthermore, the bandits claimed they supported President Buhari because he promised to fix the country, but they can see now that the promise was merely a fantasy.\n\n\u201cThe president should personally come and preside over the talks. When he was campaigning, he travelled all over, why would he not do it now? He does not take these peace talks seriously and every day people are being killed. There is no day that someone is not killed between Zamfara, Niger, Kaduna, Sokoto, and Katsina. No two days pass without someone getting killed in these places.\n\n\u201cThere is no tribe that is spared. Gunmen kill, soldiers kill, vigilantes kill. Whoever you see with a gun today in Nigeria, uses it to kill people. You may not know, but if I were to tell you the situation of things in this country, you will cry. Even the president will cry. We supported this administration and accepted dialogue because we thought he will fix the country but he won\u2019t fix the country.\n\n\u201cFrom the time he praised Goodluck (Jonathan), (Olusegun) Obasanjo, and late (Umaru) Yar\u2019Adua. These were not praiseworthy. It would have been better if he had praised (Sani) Abacha because, under Abacha, pastoralists were being educated. During Abacha, there was allocation in the budget for the nomadic communities. There was no such thing again since Obasanjo became president.\n\n\u201cThey stopped looking after Fulani. Their forests and grazing areas were taken over. You will see one person having as much as 1,000 hectares, just because he is rich,\u201d the leader said.",

          "title": "Court Sentences Former Bank PHB Boss, Francis Atuche To Over 6 Years In Prison",
          "text": "A Lagos High Court sitting in the Ikeja area has sentenced former managing director of defunct Bank PHB, Francis Atuche to over 6 years in prison.\n\nIn a judgment that lasted over 10 hours, Justice Lateefat Okunnu convicted Atuche alongside a former Chief Financial Officer of the bank, Ugo Anyanwu.\n\nThe two were convicted on at least 6 of a 27-count amended charge of conspiracy to commit a felony and stealing brought against them by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nWhile Atuche who was found guilty on counts 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 23 of the charge would serve a 6-year term for each count, Anyanwu will serve a 4-year jail term for counts 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 22 and 24 of the amended charge.\n\nThey are to serve their jail term consecutively. This sentence is coming after a trial that lasted over 12 years.\n\nIn delivering her sentence, Justice Okunnu held that the EFCC successfully proved its case against the convicts beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe judge rejected claims by the defendants suggesting that they were merely professionally negligent.\n\nShe specifically held that Atuche and Anyanwu abused their powers, ignored established rules and regulations thereby putting the bank and depositors\u2019 funds in danger.\n\nThe court also came to the conclusion that the convicts corruptly took advantage of their positions to confer on themselves undue financial benefits without regard to the health of the bank.\n\n\u201cThe convict stole from the bank and depositors and because of their action, taxpayers money was used to bail out the bank\u201d.\n\nJustice Okunnu held that she had considered the plea of the convicts, but there must be consequences for wrongdoing, adding that sentences are not just for punishment but also for deterrence.\n\nShe also ruled that the defendant should make restitution of the amount stolen from the bank. They are to pay back the sum of N25.7billion to the Federal government to replace the funds stolen from the public to bail out the bank.\n\nAccording to the Judge, they are to serve their jail terms at the Kirikiri maximum correctional facility in Lagos.\n\nAtuche\u2019s wife cleared\n\nJustice Okunnu however, cleared Atuche\u2019s wife on the charge of conspiracy and stealing.\n\nAccording to the judge, the EFCC failed to link her to the crime and insisted that suspicion no matter how strong can not take the place of fact.\n\nThe judge held that it was not proven that she was aware of the source of the funds she received into her account from her husband and she had no powers to take any decision to influence the transaction.\n\nCharges\n\nThe EFCC had alleged that between November 2007 and April 2008, the accused persons stole about N25.7bn belonging to the bank.\n\nThe anti-graft agency had also claimed that of the total N25.7bn, they stole about N14.7bn by fraudulently describing it as a loan to some companies and subsequently converted the said sum to personal use.\n\nThe Commission had listed the companies as Future View Securities, Extra Oil Limited, Resolution Trust and Investment Limited, and Tradjek Nigeria Ltd.\n\nThe EFCC also alleged that another N11bn stolen by the defendants was used to purchase about 984,375,000 units of Bank PHB shares for themselves.\n\nAccording to the commission, the sum used for purchasing the shares was described as a loan to some companies including, Guesstrade Services, Sentron Trading, Montrax Investico, Claremount Management Ltd., Trenton Trade, and others.\n\nIn proof of its case against the accused persons, the EFCC called 12 witnesses who gave oral evidence. It also subpoenaed 6 others to present some documents which were admitted as exhibits by the court.",

          "text": "The Presidency has said that the latest Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors\u2019 Forum communiqu\u00e9 is a spectacular demonstration to Nigerians as to why the opposition party and its representatives should not be entrusted with the national leadership of the country at any time soon.\n\nThis comment is in reaction to the PDP governors\u2019 take on the operations of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and the deteriorating economic and security situation in the country,\n\nGovernors elected on the platform of the PDP had on Monday raised an alarm over what they termed the \u2018OPAQUE\u2019 manner in which the NNPC carries out its operations.\n\nThe governors decried the recent NNPC\u2019s decision not to make its statutory contributions to the Federation Account, thereby \u201cstarving the States and Local Governments and indeed Nigerians of funds needed for employment, development and general well-being\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: PDP Governors Demand Decentralisation Of Security Operations To Tackle Threat\n\nThe governors maintained that under the Constitution, the NNPC is duty-bound to make proceeds of sale or business of Petroleum available to the Federation Account which belongs to the three tiers of government, excluding reasonable and verified and verifiable cost of operations.\n\nCommenting on the issue through the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, the presidency argued that in bemoaning the decision by the NNPC not to make contributions to the Federation Account, the governors appear to believe NNPC can spend the same money twice: once on the petroleum subsidy \u2013 which they all support \u2013 and then on their States via the Federation Account.\n\nIn a communique on Wednesday, Mr. Shehu noted that the \u201cNNPC is a trustee for the nation \u2013 and this means it must manage its finances with prudence and for the long-term to safeguard the financial support it bestows on our country. What the governors are asking of NNPC is to \u201cbreak the bank\u201d for their own profligate political ends\u201d.\n\n\u201cSimilar profligacy and contradiction are in full view with their call to the Central Bank to appreciate the value of the Naira. This would damage exports \u2013 including oil revenues on which NNPC depends \u2013 as well as damage small businesses and employment. But an appreciated currency would benefit those spending on luxuries from abroad \u2013 this, no doubt, being the leading desire of a typical PDP governor.\n\n\u201cWhen the governors claim a lack of federal institutions\u2019 money pouring into their States\u2019 coffers is an affront to democracy, constitutionalism, and federalism, they fail to mention the ugliest trend against the integrity of Nigeria comes by own hands with their refusal to support the Federal Government\u2019s earnest desire to reinstate the local government as the third tier and finding a lasting solution to farmer-herder conflicts costing the nation lives and livestock.\n\n\u201cThis initiative brings rights and support for generations of all ages to bring solutions to challenges that different communities of our country have faced but the PDP governors reject it \u2013 denying all Nigerians their constitutional right to live and work in any state of the Federation \u2013 preferring to appeal to ethnic division and hatred rather than support the first practical solution offered since independence,\u201d the president\u2019s spokesman stated.\n\nMr. Shehu also was of the opinion that the governors appealed to each other for more involvement of states in mining and geophysical activities within their states, which does beg the question as to why it has taken them so long.\n\nAccording to him, such opportunities and states\u2019 powers have been fully available since independence \u2013 yet only now do the PDP realise it.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, the PDP grieve over the Federal Government\u2019s action over Twitter \u2013 for it represents the curtailment of their ability to use the platform to spread fake news and invented stories to the detriment of community and good-neighbourliness between the peoples of Nigeria,\u201d the president\u2019s media aide stressed.\n\nIn his summation, Mr. Shehu said the PDP Governors propose no solutions to any of the nation\u2019s challenges in the face of COVID and global economic downturn: \u201cinstead, they grasp for more money and mourn their lack of access to social media to spread falsehoods and hate\u201d.\n\nHe further opined that their statement is evidence if any were needed, as to why the President and the APC ended the PDP\u2019s one-party rule in 2015, why the ruling party was re-elected by an increased margin in 2019, and why their winning trend is set to continue far into the future.",

          "text": "Hopes of freedom for popular Nollywood actor, James Olanrewaju, popularly known as Baba Ijesha was dashed on Wednesday following the ruling by a Chief Magistrate court sitting in the Yaba area of Lagos.\n\nThe actor is charged with alleged indecent treatment of a child, defilement of a Child, sexual assault by penetration, attempted sexual assault by penetration, and sexual assault-which contravenes sections 135, 137, 261, 202, 262, and 263 of the Lagos State Criminal Law 2015.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to all the five-count leveled against him.\n\nDuring the reading of the counts, Magistrate Nwaka noted that Baba Ijesha kept bending over and showing signs of discomfort and this prompted the question:\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\n\n\u201cDo you want to sit down?\n\n\u201cGive him a chair to sit on,\u201d the Magistrate said.\n\nThe police prosecutor in the matter has however told the Magistrate that proceedings concerning Baba Ijesha will now be handled by the DPP following information filed before the High Court.\n\nOn his part, counsel to the defendant, Kayode Olabiran made a fresh application for bail of Baba Ijesha.\n\nREAD ALSO: Three In EFCC Custody Over Currency Counterfeiting\n\nHe said, \u201cMr Olanrewaju has remained in police custody because one of the bail conditions is yet to be met.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn May 17, the Ministry of Justice, the Judiciary, the NBA, and the police took an initiative to decongest jam-packed cells across the State. My client was one of the beneficiaries and the conditions given were \u2013 two sureties, one must be a blood relation and another surety not less than level 16 in the Lagos State government civil service.\n\n\u201cThe elder brother to the defendant has appeared as a surety and we have paid the N500,000 bail bond to the account of the Lagos State government but we have not been able to get a level 16 officer to stand as surety,\u201d Mr Olabiran said.\n\nExplaining further, the lawyer said they got three different levels 16 officers but one turned them down along the line and two others declined upon hearing that they need to get a clearance letter from the Head of Service.\n\n\u201cThe level 16 officers are afraid of being issued a query. We are applying for bail on compassionate ground and in the interest of justice,\u201d Mr Olabiran added, urging the Magistrate to consider the visibly ill health of his client.\n\nA counsel from the office of the DPP, Mobolaji Owoebute-Okedeji, opposed the bail application.\n\nHe said the matter has been already filed at the High Court, and he urged the court to refuse bail.\n\nIn his ruling, Magistrate Peter Nwaka refused to vary his bail condition on charges of rape, sexual assault, and abuse of a minor.\n\nAfter considering all the submissions, Magistrate Nwaka declined to grant the defendant bail on the grounds that he no longer had jurisdiction over the matter.\n\n\u201cI have carefully considered the application of the counsel to the defendant seeking bail for the defendant and the opposition by the counsel from the DPP.\n\n\u201cSince there are indications that the matter is before the high court and the defendant will appear before the court, no bail can be given,\u201d the Magistrate said.\n\nThe court also ordered that the defendant must be accorded full medical attention by the authorities pending his arraignment at the high court and adjourned the matter to July 13 for mention.",

          "title": "\u2018Two Great Powers\u2019: Biden, Putin Plunge into Hours of Talks",
          "text": "With stern expressions and polite words before the cameras, President Joe Biden and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin plunged into hours of face-to-face talks Wednesday at a lush lakeside Swiss mansion, a highly anticipated summit at a time when both leaders say relations between their countries are at an all-time low.\n\nBiden called it a discussion between \u201ctwo great powers\u201d and said it was \u201calways better to meet face to face.\u201d Putin said he hoped the talks would be \u201cproductive.\u201d\n\nThe meeting in a book-lined room had a somewhat awkward beginning \u2014 both men appeared to avoid looking directly at each other during a brief and chaotic photo opportunity before a scrum of jostling reporters.\n\nBiden nodded when a reporter asked if Putin could be trusted, but the White House quickly sent out a tweet insisting that the president was \u201cvery clearly not responding to any one question, but nodding in acknowledgment to the press generally.\u201d\n\nPutin ignored shouted questions from reporters, including whether he feared jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\n\nThe two leaders did shake hands \u2014 Biden extended his hand first and smiled at the stoic Russian leader \u2014 moments earlier when they posed with Swiss President Guy Parmelin, who welcomed them to Switzerland for the summit.\n\nBiden and Putin first held a relatively intimate meeting joined by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Each side had a translator for the session, which lasted about an hour and a half. The meeting, after about a 40-minute break, then expanded to include senior aides on each side. Biden and Putin were expected to meet for a total of four to five hours of wide-ranging talks.\n\nFor months, they have traded sharp rhetoric. Biden has repeatedly called out Putin for malicious cyberattacks by Russian-based hackers on U.S. interests, for the jailing of Russia\u2019s foremost opposition leader and for interference in American elections.\n\nPutin has reacted with whatabout-isms and denials \u2014 pointing to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol to argue that the U.S. has no business lecturing on democratic norms and insisting that the Russian government hasn\u2019t been involved in any election interference or cyberattacks despite U.S. intelligence showing otherwise.\n\nIn advance of Wednesday\u2019s meeting, both sides set out to lower expectations.\n\nEven so, Biden said it was an important step if the United States and Russia were able to ultimately find \u201cstability and predictability\u201d in their relationship, a seemingly modest goal from the president for dealing with the person he sees as one of America\u2019s fiercest adversaries.\n\n\u201cWe should decide where it\u2019s in our mutual interest, in the interest of the world, to cooperate, and see if we can do that,\u201d Biden told reporters earlier this week. \u201cAnd the areas where we don\u2019t agree, make it clear what the red lines are.\u201d\n\nPutin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that no breakthroughs were expected and that \u201cthe situation is too difficult in Russian-American relations.\u201d He added that \u201cthe fact that the two presidents agreed to meet and finally start to speak openly about the problems is already an achievement.\u201d\n\nArrangements for the meeting were carefully choreographed and vigorously negotiated.\n\nBiden first floated the meeting in an April phone call in which he informed Putin that he would be expelling several Russian diplomats and imposing sanctions against dozens of people and companies, part of an effort to hold the Kremlin accountable for interference in last year\u2019s presidential election and the hacking of federal agencies.\n\nPutin and his entourage arrived first at the summit site: Villa La Grange, a grand lakeside mansion set in Geneva\u2019s biggest park. Next came Biden and his team. Putin flew into Geneva on Wednesday shortly before the scheduled start of the meeting; Biden \u2014 who was already in Europe for meetings with allies \u2014 arrived the day before.\n\nAfter the meeting concludes, Putin is scheduled to hold a solo news conference, with Biden following suit. The White House opted against a joint news conference, deciding it did not want to appear to elevate Putin at a moment when the U.S. president is urging European allies to pressure Putin to cut out myriad provocations.\n\nBiden sees himself with few peers on foreign policy. He traveled the globe as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and was given difficult foreign policy assignments by President Barack Obama when Biden was vice president. His portfolio included messy spots like Iraq and Ukraine and weighing the mettle of China\u2019s Xi Jinping during his rise to power.\n\nHe has repeatedly said that he believes executing effective foreign policy comes from forming strong personal relations, and he has managed to find rapport with both the likes of Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whom Biden has labeled an \u201cautocrat,\u201d and more conventional Western leaders including Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau.\n\nBut with Putin, who he has said has \u201cno soul,\u201d Biden has long been wary. At the same time, he acknowledges that Putin, who has remained the most powerful figure in Russian politics over the span of five U.S. presidents, is not without talent.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s bright. He\u2019s tough,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd I have found that he is a \u2014 as they say \u2026 a worthy adversary.\u201d\n\nThe White House held on to hope of finding small areas of agreement.\n\nNo commitments have been made, but according to the senior administration official, there are hopes that both sides will return their ambassadors to their respective postings following the meeting. Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Anatoly Antonov, was recalled from Washington about three months ago after Biden called Putin a killer; U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan left Moscow almost two months ago, after Russia suggested he return to Washington for consultations.\n\nBiden administration officials say they think common ground can be found on arms control. International arms control groups are pressing the Russian and American leaders to start a push for new arms control agreements.\n\nThe Biden team will press its concerns on cybersecurity. In recent months, Russia-based hackers have launched alarming attacks on a major U.S. oil pipeline and a Brazil-headquartered meat supplier that operates in the U.S.\n\nThe Russian side has said that the imprisonment of Navalny, the jailed opposition leader, is an internal political matter and one area where Putin won\u2019t engage on the matter. White House officials said, however, Biden intended to bring up the matter.\n\nThe meeting is sure to invite comparisons with President Donald Trump\u2019s 2018 meeting with Putin in Helsinki, where the two leaders held a joint news conference and Trump sided with Russian denials when asked whether Moscow had meddled in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBiden has prepared for his one-on-one by reviewing materials and consulting with officials across government and with outside advisers. Aides said the level of preparation wasn\u2019t unusual. Biden, in a brief exchange with reporters upon a rriving in Geneva on Tuesday night, sought to offer the impression that he wasn\u2019t sweating his big meeting.\n\n\u201cI am always ready,\u201d Biden said.\n\n___",
