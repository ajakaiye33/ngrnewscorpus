          "text": "The Federal Government and the striking Academic Staff Union of Universities would resume talks next week with a view to ending the prolonged closure of public universities.\n\nThe Minister of Labour and Employment, Sen. Chris Ngige said this at a meeting between the government side and the striking National Association of Academic Technologists.\n\nNgige noted the multiple industrial disputes in the education sector could have been averted if the unions in the sector took advantage of his open door policy like the health unions, which culminated in the peace currently enjoyed in the health sector.\n\nAccording to a statement on Friday by the acting Head, Press and Public Relations, Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, Patience Onuobia, the minister, who also decried the rivalry between the education unions, made it clear that everybody is important in the university system.\n\nHe assured that the government was tackling all the disputes in education sector holistically, knowing fully well that none of the unions could function effectively without the other union.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf you are from any union, you don\u2019t need to book appointment to see me. The doctors started using that advantage, JOHESU also did the same. That is why the health sector is quiet. But the education unions don\u2019t take advantage of my open door policy.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to cry over spilt milk. Let us look at your issues to see the ones we can handle immediately, the ones we can do in the medium term and the ones we can do in the long term. There are certain ones that are over and above me that are not in my hands to do.\n\n\u201cMy job is to prepare an agreement after conciliation on what you have agreed with your employers, the Federal Ministry of Education, put timelines and monitor them, to see whether the results will be there.\n\n\u201cAs a conciliator, I manage you people in measured steps. That is why I want to take all of you holistically and I ask for your cooperation. When I finish with you today, I will continue with ASUU next week. I have done NASU and SSANU yesterday and they were happy. I want you people to be happy as we leave here.\u201d\n\nHe, however, pointed out that the renegotiation of the 2009 agreement would not be immediate because the education ministry had put in place a committee to handle it.\n\nAlso speaking, the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Education, Andrew Adejo re-emphasised that all the issues in dispute were basically economic, in the sense that everybody wants improved conditions of service.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Sanwo-Olu\u2019s second term and MURIC\u2019s Jaguda logic",
          "text": "Issues affecting Lagos State naturally bothers me. I was born in Lagos, had my primary and a part of my secondary education in Lagos and lived in Surulere for the first 29 years of my youthful life. There is a Lagos side of me which I should say has had a certain level of influence in my thinking. If I am deemed a liberal, we should thank Lagos, if I appear not to be a bigot or ethnocentric in my approach to national issues, it can be traced to my sojourn in Lagos.\n\nTill date my parents reside in Lagos, both parents of mine made a living in Lagos from which they provided much for myself and my siblings , even now, it is like a second home to me and I draw a lot of memories and experiences from the state that never sleeps.\n\nLagos offered me the opportunity of seeing Nigeria as She is, through contact with the motley of tribes and ethnic groups that have called Lagos home, I was able to deduce that no culture or tribe was superior to the other, and that it was possible for all Nigerians to live together despite the differences posed by both culture and religion. As a Christian I had Muslim friends and neighbors, we mixed freely , and respected each other as we learned about each person\u2019s culture and beliefs. Lagos for many then and now was what I will call the poster boy of tolerance.\n\nSo it bothers me when an organization going by the name Muslim Rights Concern, MURIC all of a sudden decides to stand logic on its head and perhaps fuel some sort of acrimony between the people of Lagos using religion. MURIC has of late earned immense notoriety following a number of its comments one would deem as incendiary, all in the name of seeking to advance what it perceives or calls Muslim interests. Like a \u2018jaguda\u2019 , its leader, Professor Ishaq Akintola has sought to flay tempers by its obnoxious demand that the sitting Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu should not seek to return as Governor of the City of Excellence not because Sanwo-Olu has not performed as a sitting governor or has fallen short of the provisions required by one to occupy the office of governor but an ugly daub of religion.\n\nWhile I understand that our nation\u2019s politics has been frazzled by the ethnic and religious strains, it still beats me that the likes of Akintola would seek to use the very thing that should unite us for our common good to destroy that cord at a point in time when tempers are rife and the nation seems more divided than ever before.\n\nThe professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies is wondering why Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu is seeking a second term and believes that Lagos should have a Muslim as governor. He claims that Sanwo-Olu having spent his first four years in office should not seek another four as he is entitled to by the Nigerian Constitution . Akintola argues or offers a jaguda sort of logic when he claims that since Sanwo-Olu\u2019s predecessor Akinwunmi Ambode had done four years earlier, Christians in Lagos had had their fair share of 8 years and thus Sanwo-Olu ought to step aside for a Muslim!\n\nAkintola much forgets that prior to the emergence both Ambode and Sanwo-Olu, two Muslims in the persons of Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Babatunde Fashola both spent a whooping sixteen years dwarfing whatever possible combination of years Sanwo-Olu and Ambode could ever have. Now should we deploy Professor Akintola\u2019s jaguda logic , and stretch our imaginations into 1979, adding Lateef Jakande\u2019s four years to the tally of 16 years for the Muslims while adding Michael Otedola\u2019s two years to that of the Christians we would still arrive at a deficit for the Christians after adding four years to Babajide Sanwo-Olu..\n\nAkintola\u2019s jaguda logic on one hand possesses immense contempt for performance and continuity, such a posture betrays a lack of understanding of the issues of governance. Perhaps, Akintola must believe that we belong to the stone ages where religion solely ruled the affairs of men, he must be inured to certain trends and developments and cannot understand that in a democracy that an elected person under the Nigerian Constitution can run for a second term if he deems it fit. Akintola also shows contempt to the average voter in Lagos since he assumes that it is a given that should Sanwo-Olu decide not to run that the system by virtue of the edict of MURIC woukd settle automatically for a Muslim. He must think that even the delegates of the parties are zombies for that matter.\n\nOn a lighter side Akintola also forgets that asides Christians and Muslims , Lagos is home to a number of local religions, I am wondering why he is not advocating for Oro, Voodoo , Sango and Ifa worshippers to replace Sanwo-Olu since they are also religions and have not also had their turn in office. Even free thinkers should also agitate for their turn to govern Lagos, since the likes of Akintola believe that each religion must take its turn, then in fairness, i insist that a Sango worshipper should be allowed to occupy Alausa Ikeja.\n\nLet me state that irrespective of what anyone thinks Governor Sanwo-Olu is entitled to seek a second term.\n\nMay Nigeria Succeed",
          "summary": "Issues affecting Lagos State naturally bothers me.\nThere is a Lagos side of me which I should say has had a certain level of influence in my thinking.\nLagos for many then and now was what I will call the poster boy of tolerance.\nThe professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies is wondering why Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu is seeking a second term and believes that Lagos should have a Muslim as governor.\nLet me state that irrespective of what anyone thinks Governor Sanwo-Olu is entitled to seek a second term.",

          "text": "The Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal has observed that Nigeria is inching towards a failed state, saying that the country has never had it so bad. Echoing Tambuwal, a renowned investment banker, Alhaji Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, said the collapsed economy is the root of the nation\u2019s security challenges.\n\nTambuwal and Hayatu-Deen, who are presidential aspirants of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) made the observations at separate fora in Abuja. The Sokoto governor who spoke yesterday during a consultative meeting with the leadership of the PDP, said the country was facing greater danger than never before.\n\nTambuwal said: \u201cWe are facing greater danger that we have never faced before. Our country has been divided as never before. Our economy is in shambles with insecurity ravaging the country the way it has never been before. The general summation of the situation of the country is that we are inching towards a failed state. I am not saying that Nigeria is already a failed state, but we are inching towards that.\n\n\u201cTherefore, it is our responsibility to collectively work together towards rescuing our country, retrieving the country from the APC (All Progressives Congress) before the deed is done.\u201d According to him, the PDP is poised and better positioned to provide the required platform to turn things around. He observed that majority of Nigerians who are dissatisfied with what is happening in the country have been relocating overseas. He recalled that the situation was not this bad at the time the PDP handed over power to the APC in 2015.\n\n\u201cBut where are we today? We are all very aware of our situation. What is happening to our unity? So many Nigerians, when they wake up, they ask themselves, what am I doing here? Those who can find their way have already left and several are processing their way out of this country because of their belief that Nigeria is not working for all of us.\n\n\u201cBut we cannot all be that disappointed, disenchanted to begin to process papers to leave this country. Some of us must remain behind and slug it out through the democratic process to retrieve our country, reposition our country and work towards rebuilding our country\u201d. On his part, Hayatu-Deen attributed the general state of insecurity to the nation\u2019s collapsed economy.\n\nAccording to him, the troubled economy was the root of all other challenges confronting the nation, especially the rising insecurity. He promised to fix the economy and security if elected President, saying that was his motivation for joining the presidential race.",

          "title": "Buhari to Igbo Leaders: Only court can decide Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s fate",
          "text": "By Ogochukwu Anioke, Abakaliki; Chris Njoku, Owerri; Bolaji Ogundele, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday declared that the ongoing treason trial of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) leader Nnamdi Kanu would run its full course, clearing doubts about the possibility of government letting him off the hook.\n\nBuhari, responding to latest pleas from South East leaders for the release of the arrow head of the agitation for Biafra, said Kanu\u2019s matter should be allowed to be properly adjudicated in court.\n\nHe spoke at a meeting with the leadership of the pan-Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze, and other eminent South Easterners in Abakaliki on the second day of his visit to Ebonyi State.\n\nUnknown gunmen, apparently disappointed that Buhari made the trip in spite of the sit-at-home protest ordered by some groups, took out their anger on a motorist and a motorcyclist in the Ebonyi State capital: the vehicles were set ablaze.\n\nHowever, two armed bandits suspected to be members of the proscribed IPOB and its affiliate Eastern Security Network (ESN), were killed on Tuesday in an encounter with the police at Agwa in Oguta Local Government Area of Imo State.\n\n\u201cI have listened carefully to the various appeals from the elders to the traditional leaders regarding a wide range of options, and as I have said previously, this matter remains in the full purview of the courts where it will be properly adjudicated,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari, referencing the violence in the South East sparked by the Biafran/Kanu issue, added: \u201cI must register my deep and grave concern with regards to the deteriorating state of affairs in this region.\n\n\u201cIn the last 48 hours, I have been informed of the latest in the round of brutal actions carried out by gun wielding terrorists who prey on innocent and hardworking citizens.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately this barbaric act was visited on those who have committed their lives to protecting the lives of fellow citizens.\n\n\u201cTerrorists who have unfortunately brainwashed a segment of the population that continued to contribute their hard earned funds towards their hate filled messages but now have been terrorised through their brutal killings, truncation of commercial activities, restriction of freedom of movement, and the ability to exercise basic human rights must be fished out from amongst us, and it can only be done through the support of the people.\n\n\u201cMy worry is for our hardworking and innocent civilians for whom life is already tough and would like to go out and wean a good and honest living. There are many that fit this profile and the government owes them that obligation to protect their lives and property.\n\n\u201cI will once again repeat, no one has the right to carry an AK-47, and anyone in any part of the country doing so and is not a law enforcement officer is a threat to our peaceful coexistence and should be treated as such.\u201d\n\nSpeaker after speaker at the meeting had pleaded with Buhari to grant amnesty to Kanu and other youths from the region in detention.\n\nThey included Chairman, Southeast Council of Traditional Rulers, Eze Charles Mkpumai; Southeast Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev Fr Abraham Nwali; Ohana\u00e9z\u00e8 Nd\u00edgbo President-General George Obiozor; and First Republic Minister, Mbazulike Amaechi.\n\nEze Mkpuma asked for Buhari\u2019s support for the agitation for his successor coming from the South East, saying: \u201cWe plead with you Mr. President to grant the plea for the South East to produce the next President of the country in 2023.\n\n\u201cWe stand by you in all efforts towards the fight against insecurity in the South East and the country in general. We however plead with you as a compassionate father to temper justice with mercy in the case of our son, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cWe have started dialogue to ensure that all those who feel aggrieved are brought to round table discussion. We shall continue to support you and your administration. Do not listen to those advocating for interim government for they are inviting anarchy.\n\n\u201cWe urge you to look inwards and build the rest administration around the South Easterner who has outstanding performance,\u201d they said.\n\nMbazulike Amaechi said: \u201cI want to see peace in this country before I join my ancestors.\n\n\u201cI want to see peace in the South East, particularly where there is upsurge of crisis and something that will lead to that peace is around the corner and we are asking you to give me the mandate and I will give you peace.\n\n\u201cI guarantee you this, Mr. President.\n\n\u201cWe say in Igbo land that a mad man is owned by his people. If somebody was mad yesterday, and on guarantee of elders like me and other elders, I will bring him out and that is to get peace.\n\n\u201cHelp us to get the peace and I will give you peace in this part of this country and also in Nigeria because I am a Nigerian, I took part in the struggle for the independence of this country,\u201d he added.\n\nRev. Fr. Abraham Nwali said: \u201cAs a body that is of genuine counsel, our country is currently challenged greatly by insecurity and societal conflict here and there with high level of poverty.\n\n\u201cA great number of our families are living in the fear of the unknown.\n\n\u201cAs a father of our dear nation and South East, we bring to your notice that the sit-at-home has crippled the economy of South East and banditry is engulfing the nation.\n\n\u201cOur society is growing by violence with a lot of youth restiveness. We know that you are doing your best to solve these problems but we request kindly your Excellency of more dialogue with all nationalists and more empowerment to the various security agencies to tackle this monster called insecurity.\n\n\u201cWe request that you exercise the promotion of equity, fairness and social justice by all institutions and political parties, especially as we approach the year of transition.\n\n\u201cWe plead for your political solution as a father, a loving father, a forgiving father to grant Nnamdi Kanu freedom.\n\n\u201cWe pray that he be granted pardon as we call on all agitators to cease all forms of hostilities and other demands for a nation where the plight of the poor, the weak, the oppressed will be addressed.\n\n\u201cHistory shall be kind to you and you will have the greatest ovation in the world if your administration can do that which all think will not be possible to assist for the emergence of President of Nigeria of South East extraction come 2023.\n\n\u201cIt was done in South West in 1999 and NADECO and other agitating groups ceased all hostilities. Agitations in the South East will likewise disappear if you grant us that unique privilege.\u201d\n\nOhana\u00e9z\u00e8 President-General, George Obiozor, represented by the organisation\u2019s Deputy Legal Adviser, Peter Alike, called for amnesty for all Igbo youths currently in detention facilities across the country.\n\nEbonyi Governor David Umahi said Buhari would be remembered as a man who did not use the plight of the people of the South East to play politics but came to their rescue several times.\n\nThe governor urged Southern leaders to work towards finding a political solution in resolving some challenging issues, warning that the region is at a \u201dcrossroads.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cOn this issue of a political solution, I have never believed in IPOB\u2019s method of operation. I disagree with them. But we have gotten ourselves to a very terrible and pitiable solution.\n\n\u201dSome of us warned that we would get to this situation and some were playing politics with it.\n\n\u201cMr. President, we are at a crossroads. I have been to you and I have begged you for a political solution. Surprisingly and graciously, you granted that. You said our people should initiate that and at the forefront is Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s lawyer.\n\nThe governor, therefore, urged the President of Ohanaeze Ndigbo to meet with elder statesman, Mbazuluike Amaechi, the Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), South-East, the Chairman of South-East Traditional Rulers Council, Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s lawyer and few others to initiate the political solution.\n\nOn the 2023 elections, the governor said he believed strongly in the demand for the presidency to be zoned to the South East region on the basis of fairness, equity, justice and morality.\n\nHe said Dr Ogbonnay Onu, the current Minister of Science and Technology, in 1999 stepped down for a presidential candidate from the South West, adding the it was now time for other regions to extend same gesture to the South East.\n\nGunmen set vehicles ablaze in Ebonyi\n\nEarlier in the day, unknown gunmen set two vehicles ablaze at Ebebe Junction in Abakaliki after intercepting the vehicles.\n\nThe hoodlums were believed to be enforcing the two-day sit-at-home allegedly declared by yet to be identified dissident groups in the region to protest Buhari\u2019s visit.\n\nA motorcyclist narrowly escaped being killed.\n\nA resident of the area who spoke on grounds of anonymity said the bandits shot several gunshots to scare the people.\n\nA witness said: \u201cI was inside my shop because I slept there. I heard the gunshots but I discovered later that they left a vehicle burnt beyond recognition while a motorcycle operator told us that he narrowly escaped their bullets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so unfortunate that we witnessed such an ugly incident in this area that is usually very peaceful and sprawling with business activities especially at evening periods,\u201d he said.\n\nA team of policemen and the Ebubeagu Security Outfit later arrived and cordoned off the area.\n\nPolice spokesperson, Loveth Odah, said she was not aware of the incident.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just getting the information from you; I\u2019m not aware of the attack,\u201d Odah said.\n\nInsecurity has been on the rise in the South East over the last few months following the resumption of Kanu\u2019s trial for alleged treason.\n\nThe region has seen increased security deterioration since the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu, Leader of a pro-separatist group in the area.\n\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), the group he leads, has been blamed by the Police for series of attacks on security agencies and officials, government facilities and high profile individuals.\n\nThe group has continued to deny responsibility for the said attacks.\n\nPolice officer, two suspected IPOB/ESN members killed in Imo gun duel\n\nTwo armed hoodlums suspected to be members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its affiliate Eastern Security Network (ESN) were killed on Tuesday in a gun duel with the police at Agwa in Oguta Local Government Area of Imo State.\n\nThe suspects, according to eyewitnesses, had emerged from surrounding bushes and opened fire on a team of policemen who were on patrol duty in the area.\n\nA police officer was felled in the process.\n\nThe police responded immediately, taking out two of the bandits.\n\nSpokesman of the State Police Command, Michael Abattam, said the incident occurred on May 3 at about 4.05pm.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn 3/05/2022 at about 1605hrs, while policemen attached to Agwa Divisional Headquarters were conducting stop and search duty, armed bandits suspected to be members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and its armed affiliate, Eastern Security Network (ESN) in their numbers emerged from the surrounding bushes, shooting sporadically at the policemen who swiftly took cover and responded, engaging them in a fierce gun duel.\u201d\n\nHe said that the Command\u2019s tactical teams stationed in the area, on receipt of the distress call, rushed to the scene and engaged the hoodlums in a fire fight.\n\n\u201cFor the operatives\u2019 superior firepower and number, they were able to neutralize two of the hoodlums while others fled in disarray with bullets wounds into the bush.\u201d\n\nHe said that the police operatives tactically chased the hoodlums and in the process of combing the bush for possible recovery of their arms, arrested the fleeing suspects.\n\nHe disclosed that during the attack, one of the police officer\u2019s gallantly paid the supreme price while others were treated and discharged from the hospital for minor injuries they sustained.\n\n\u201cThe corpses of the hoodlums were later deposited at Federal Medical Centre Mortuary while investigation is ongoing.\n\nItems recovered at the scene include two locally made double barrel guns with seven lives cartridges and ten (10) expended cartridges.\n\nThe United Kingdom on Thursday announced the exclusion of IPOB members and some other secessionists from seeking asylum in the country.\n\nThe UK authorities said the decision was on account of the recent activities of such people as reported in Nigeria.\n\nIt said: \u201c\u201dIPOB is proscribed as a terrorist group by the Nigerian government, and members of the group and its paramilitary wing \u2013 the Eastern Security Network (created in December 2020) \u2013 have reportedly committed human rights violations in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cMASSOB has been banned but is not a proscribed terrorist group in Nigeria. It too has reportedly been involved in violent clashes with the authorities.\n\n\u201cIf a person has been involved with IPOB (and/or an affiliated group), MASSOB or any other \u2018Biafran\u2019 group that incites or uses violence to achieve its aims, decision-makers must consider whether one (or more) of the exclusion clauses under the Refugee Convention is applicable. Persons who commit human rights violations must not be granted asylum.\n\n\u201cMASSOB, since its formation in the late 1990s, has clashed with the security forces. Some sources report that numerous individuals have been killed, wounded, and arrested during these clashes \u2013 usually during demonstrations.\n\n\u201cThrough its online platform, \u2018Radio Biafra\u2019, and other social media, IPOB has increasingly used inflammatory rhetoric to encourage secessionist aspirations and resistance to the authorities, including violence.\n\n\u201cSources reported that the security forces have arrested hundreds of IPOB supporters at different events, particularly between 2015 and 2017 and including during raids on homes of IPOB leaders. Since 2015, IPOB has also claimed that the security forces have used excessive force, including killing and injuring hundreds of its supporters.\u201d\n\nConfiscate funders\u2019 assets, shut Radio Biafra, Presidency tells UK\n\nFollowing its decision to proscribe and re-designate IPOB as a terrorist organisation, the United Kingdom (UK) has been urged to take the next step by confiscating assets belonging to the group\u2019s international network of funders.\n\nThe Presidency, which gave the charge in a statement issued by Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, yesterday also tasked the UK to make the re-designation of the group more potent by shutting down its communication outlets, especially the London-based Biafra Radio.\n\nThe Unite Kingdom Visas and Immigration (UKVI), a division of the British Home Office, on its website three days ago, announced the re-designation of IPOB as a terrorist organisation, in an updated guideline to its decision makers.\n\nReacting to the new decision, the Nigerian government, through the Presidency, welcomed the fact that though it took time in coming, the UK decision would help to tackle the scourge of terrorism in the country.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cNigeria welcomes the decision by the United Kingdom to proscribe the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) as a terrorist group.\n\n\u201cThe violent secessionist organisation has long been proscribed as such in Nigeria where it carries out the majority of its murderous activities.\n\n\u201cIt has taken our allies in the U.K. so long to follow suit owing to two reasons: first, the deep pockets of IPOB\u2019s international network of funders that allow for lawyers and influence peddlers to aggressively lobby for and whitewash the activities of their client in Western courts; and second, IPOB\u2019s influential communication network of TV and radio stations \u2013 including London-based Radio Biafra \u2013 employed with great effect to spread misinformation abroad and incite violence at home.\n\n\u201cThe next steps are clear: now that IPOB has rightly been designated a terrorist group, the UK authorities should, in our view, follow up with confiscation of their assets, shut down their communication channels and sanction the issuance of visas to IPOB\u2019s funders in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSuch sanctions have played a critical role in combating other terror groups. And make no mistake: today Africa is a breeding ground for terror with local and international groups alike gaining strength across the continent, thriving on the economic devastation of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s intelligence and security forces are the first lines of defence against such groups, including ISIS and Al Quaeda affiliated Boko Haram. We rely on our allies in the West for their support.\n\n\u201cIPOB\u2019s \u2013 and its 50,000 strong paramilitary unit\u2019s \u2013 reign of terror has seen villagers butchered, school buses set alight and politicians\u2019 homes bombed. Through their international network of radio and TV stations, they threaten further violence if their demands are not met, while inciting violence and religious and ethnic tension between Nigeria\u2019s Christian and Muslim populations.\n\n\u201cTheir mouthpieces and their wallets are their most effective tools \u2013 it is these assets Nigeria\u2019s allies must target next.

These reports are untrue. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) is not a proscribed organisation in the UK.\n\n\u201cThe inaccurate reporting relates to the 13 April 2022 publication by the UK Government of a revised Country Policy and Information note (CPIN) on separatist groups in SE Nigeria, including the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). CPINs provide country of origin information (COl) and analysis of COI for use by UK Government decision-makers handling particular types of protection and human rights claims.\n\n\u201cAll asylum and human rights claims made in the UK are considered on their individual facts in accordance with our obligations under the UN Refugee Convention and European Convention on Human Rights, taking into account relevant background country information and case law.\n\n\u201cThe CPIN on separatist groups in the South East, including the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), provides a general assessment of risks faced by individuals belonging to those groups. These assessments are based on an analysis of publicly available country information obtained from a wide range of reliable sources including media outlets; UK and other governments; local, national and international organisations; and non-government organisations.\n\n\u201cThis CPIN also acknowledges that the Nigerian government has proscribed IPOB as a terrorist organisation, some members of IPOB have reportedly used violence against the state and members of the public, and advises that persons who have committed human rights abuses must not be granted protection.\n\n\u201cThe document is publicly available on our UK Government website, Gov.UK at www.gov.uk/government/publications/nigeria-country-policy-and-information-notes.\u201d",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja and Chijioke Agwu, Abakaliki\n\nFive months after he gave reasons he would not honour the request by South-East traditional and religious leaders to grant amnesty to the leader of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, to deescalate tension in the zone, President Muhammadu Buhari, has again said Kanu\u2019s fate will be decided by the courts. Kanu is facing charges bordering on treasonable felony instituted against him in response to years of the campaign for the Republic of Biafra through IPOB.\n\nAccording to a statement by Femi Adesina, Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Buhari, Friday in Abakiliki at a meeting with South-East leaders, said in response to appeals by traditional, religious and political leaders in the region for the release of Kanu: \u201cI have listened carefully to the various appeals from the elders to the traditional leaders regarding a wide range of options, and as I have said previously, this matter remains in the full purview of the courts where it will be properly adjudicated.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\n\u201cMy worry is for our hardworking and innocent civilians, for whom life is already tough and would like to earn a decent and honest living.\n\n\u2018\u2018There are many that fit this profile and the government owes them that obligation to protect lives and property. I will once again repeat, no one has the right to carry an AK-47, and anyone seen in any part of the country doing so and is not a law enforcement officer is a threat to our peaceful coexistence and should be treated as such,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari vowed that the Federal Government would deploy its strength to protect innocent and hardworking Nigerians from terrorists and those causing breakdown of law and order in the South-East region. He expressed concern over the deteriorating security situation in the region, reiterating his directive to security agencies to \u201cflush out\u201d those perpetrating violence in the land.\n\n\u201cIn the last 48 hours, I have been informed of the latest in the round of brutal actions carried out by gun-wielding terrorists, who prey on innocent and hardworking citizens, unfortunately, these barbaric acts were visited upon those who have committed their lives to protect their fellow citizens,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president paid tribute to members of the Nigerian armed forces who recently lost their lives in the region. On infrastructure, the president highlighted some of his government\u2019s achievements in the region, dismissing those peddling false narratives of lack of care and consideration for the people of the South-East by this administration\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

In his remarks, Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi said President Buhari would be remembered as a man who did not use the plight of the people of the South-East to play politics, but came to their rescue severally. He urged Southern leaders to work towards finding a political solution in resolving some challenging issues, warning that the region is at a crossroads.\n\n\u201cOn this issue of a political solution, I have never believed in IPOB\u2019s method of operation, I disagree with them but we have gotten ourselves to a very terrible and pitiable solution.\n\n\u201cSome of us warned that we will get to this situation and some were playing politics with it. Mr President, we are at a crossroads. I have been to you and I have begged you for a political solution. Surprisingly and graciously you granted that. You said our people should initiate that and at the forefront is Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s lawyer.\u201d\n\nThe governor, therefore, urged the President of Ohaneze Ndigbo to meet with elder statesman, Mbazulike Amaechi, the Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Southeast, the Chairman of Southeast Traditional Rulers Council, Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s lawyer and few others to initiate the political solution. On the 2023 elections, the governor said he believed strongly in the demand for the presidency to be zoned to the South-East region on the basis of fairness, equity, justice and morality. Umahi, who is also a presidential aspirant, commended some leaders from outside the region for expressing their support for the next president of Nigeria to emerge from the South-East. The Chairman of Southeast Traditional Rulers, Eze Charles Mkpuma and CAN Chairman, South-East, Very Rev. Fr. Abraham Nwali, also spoke in favour of a president of Nigeria of South-Eeast extraction come 2023.\n\nThe leaders while expressing support for a united Nigeria, appealed to the president to grant pardon and release the IPOB leader, urging other agitators to cease all forms of hostilities.",

          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja And Tony John, Port Harcourt\n\nThe Supreme Court on Friday resolved the legal dispute between Rivers and Imo over the ownership of 17 oil wells in favour of Rivers State. In a unanimous judgment, the apex court specifically declared that the oil wells located in Ndoni and Egbema communities belong to Rivers State. Before the judgment, there was a political arrangement put in place by the Federal Government for the revenue from the disputed wells to be shared equally between the two states. However, when Emeka Ihedioha became governor in 2019, a presidential memo directed that all the revenue should go to Imo.\n\nIn the judgment which was prepared by Justice Helen Ogunwunmiju, but delivered by Justice Emmanuel Agim, the apex court dismissed the counterclaim ownership put forward by the Imo State government.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nWhile the apex court granted reliefs 1, 3 4 5 and 6 sort by Rivers State, it refused reliefs 2, 7 and 10 sought by the state.\n\nAmong the reliefs granted by the apex Court in favour of Rivers are a declaration that the boundary between River and Imo as delineated in Nigeria administrative map 10th edition, 11th, 12th, and other maps bearing similar delineation are inaccurate, incorrect, and do not represent the legitimate and lawful boundaries between Rivers and Imo states.\n\nA declaration that the correct instruments, map and documents to be relied upon in the determining the boundary between Rivers and Imo state are those used by Rivers in delineating the boundary line between the two states, including Decree no. 14 of 1967, Decree no. 12 of 1976, the White papers/conclusion of the Federal Military government on the Irikefe and the Nasir boundary Commission/boundary Adjustment Commission, the Eastern Nigeria map, the Provincial map of Owerri province, Warri Province, Onitsha Province, Rivers Province, the Ahoada District map and Aboh Division map.\n\nA declaration that all the oil wells within Akri and Mbede communities, including the oil wells identified on Rivers map showing the location of oil wells wrongly attributed to Imo State including Akri 012, Akri 009, Akri 010, Akri 004, Akri West 002, Akri 001, Akri West 001, Akri 003, Akri 002, and Akri South 001, Mbede 017, Mbede 010, Mbede 019, Mbede 018, Mbede 002, Mbede 009, and Mbede 005 are all oil wells within the territory of Rivers State and form part of Rivers State and that it is only Rivers State that is entitled to receive the full allocation of the distributable revenue derived from the oil wells based on the 13 per cent derivation principle as provided for under Section 162 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended, among others.\n\nRivers State is in its suit marked SC/1037/2020, seeking a declaration that the boundary between it and Imo state, as delineated on Nigeria administrative map 10, 11 and 12 editions and other maps bearing similar delineations, are inaccurate, incorrect and do not represent the legitimate and lawful boundaries between Rivers and Imo State. The state sought a declaration that all the oil wells within Akri and Mbede communities are wrongly attributed to Imo State and that they are all oil wells within the territory of Rivers state. It maintained that only Rivers State is entitled to receive the full allocation of the distributable revenue from the oil wells on the basis of the 1390 derivation as contained under section 162 of the 1999 constitution.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Nyesom Wike said Rivers State was in court with its neighbouring Imo State, not to claim victory, but to defend its ownership rights of oil wells in Akri and Mbede communities. The Rivers State governor made the clarification in Port Harcourt on Friday, in response to the ruling of the Supreme Court of Nigeria which delivered judgement on the subsisted boundary dispute between the two states over the affected oil wells.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt bears repeating that the quest to defend our ownership rights through the courts over the Akiri and Mbede oil wells was not intended to claim victory over Imo or any other state.\n\n\u201cWe also deplore the collusive actions of the National Boundary Commission (NBC), which unfortunately, has become notorious as one of the most corrupt national agencies, which has functioned more in causing confusion than resolving boundary disputes,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernor Wike pointed out that while the dispute lingered, the NBC did nothing in demarcating the boundaries to establish the proper location and title to the disputed oil wells. But instead of ensuring that NBC did its work, Governor Wike said the former Imo State governor, Emeka Ihedioha repudiated the subsisting 50:50 per cent sharing formula and also made provocative claims as exclusive owners of the oil wells.\n\n\u201cIn order to actualise this spurious claims, he (Ihedioha) stealthily wrote a letter dated August 9, 2019, to President Muhammadu Buhari and requested for the refund of the sum of N15 billion from Rivers State to Imo State as backlog of accrued proceeds from the 13 per cent derivation revenue of the said oil wells.\n\n\u201cActing on Governor Ihedioha\u2019s letter, Mr President warranted a letter to be written to the Revenue Mobilization, Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMFAC) through his late Chief of State, Mr Abba Kyari, to alter the status quo in favour of Imo State without reference to the subsisting dispute and agreement between the two states.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike said Rivers State government was surprised by that action because since 1999, Peter Odili and Achike Udenwa, both former governors of the respective states had agreed to a 50:50 per cent sharing of derivative proceeds from those wells.",

CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nIn a statement signed by the President of AON, Abdulmunaf Yunusa and copied to the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika and the Director General of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA)\n\nCapt. Musa Nuhu, the body that aviation fuel price (JetA1) has risen from N190 per litre to N700 currently and that no airline in the world can absorb the shock from such an astronomical rise over a short period.\n\nThe body said: \u201cIt is with a great sense of responsibility and patriotism that the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON)\n\nhave carried on deploying and subsidising their services to our highly esteemed Nigerian flying public in the last four\n\nmonths despite the astronomical hike in the price of JetA1 and other operating costs.\n\n\u201cOvertime, aviation fuel price (JetA1) has risen from N190 per litre to N700 currently. In the face of this, airlines have engaged the Federal Government, the National Assembly, NNPC and oil marketers with\n\nthe view to bringing the cost of JetA1 down which has currently made the unit cost per seat for a one hour flight in Nigeria today to an average of N120,000. The latter cannot be fully passed to passengers who are already experiencing a lot of difficulties.\n\n\u201cWhile AON appreciates the efforts of the current government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari to\n\nensure air transport in Nigeria grows, unfortunately, the cost of aviation fuel has continued to rise unabated thereby\n\ncreating huge pressure on the sustainability of operations and financial viability of the airlines.\n\n\u201cTo this end therefore, the AON wishes to regrettably inform the general public that\n\nmember airlines will discontinue operations nationwide with effect from Monday May 9, 2022 until further notice.\n\nAON uses this medium to humbly state that we regret any inconveniences this very difficult decision might cause and\n\nappeal to travelers to kindly reconsider their travel itinerary and make alternative arrangements.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

Should the warning go unheeded, an indefinite strike shall be called soon afterwards.\n\nHowever, workers in all aviation organisations including FAAN and AIB are hereby directed to support and operate with the unions to assure full compliance and success of the strike,\u201d they stated.",

They refuse to accept that the North has over 55% of the population of Nigeria. They won\u2019t concede that the voting population in the Northwest region of the North alone is bigger than those of the Southeast & South-south combined\u201d\n\nJohn Shiklam in Kaduna\n\nNot comfortable with stereotypes and alleged blackmail anymore, a foremost umbrella body for the north, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), yesterday, reacted to the ongoing controversy and constant bashing of the region over zoning within the two leading political parties \u2013 the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2013 and declared that the North would not allow itself to be blackmailed any more, neither was it afraid of the country\u2019s break-up.\n\n\n\nThe forum, in a statement in Kaduna, warned that gone were the days, when Northerners felt blackmailed and intimidated by threats of re-structuring, secession, break up or break down of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nAccording to the statement signed by the Secretary General of the forum, Murtala Aliyu, the North is not and had never been opposed to the election of any Nigerian from any part of the country as President, maintaining however, that anything that would be done to achieve that must be in accord with the law and democratic principles.\n\nACF said some Southern politicians were already \u201cgiving their Northern counterparts an ultimatum not to elect anyone from the North as president or we will break up the country!\u201c\n\n\n\nIn the statement title, \u201cEnough of the blackmail\u201d, the ACF warned that gone were the days when Northerners felt blackmailed by certain narrative from the South, but that the times had changed.\n\n\n\nThe statement read: \u201cA long running political riddle that has continued to frustrate all efforts at achieving \u2018justice, equity and fair-play\u2019 is this: anything and everything in which the North has superiority or advantage or strength is, in the opinion of many Southerners, fake or contrived or speculative and therefore unacceptable.\n\n\n\n\u201cThese Southerners contest the facts that the North has 78% of the landmass of Nigeria. They refuse to accept that the North has over 55% of the population of Nigeria. They won\u2019t concede that the voting population in the Northwest region of the North alone is bigger than those of the Southeast & South-south combined.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey will never acknowledge the fact that all the beef, all the tomatoes, the onions, the beans, etc. consumed in the South, is produced in the North. They concede nothing. On the contrary, they say the North brings nothing to the table and is entitled to nothing. Not to an equitable share of national revenues, not to a fair share of employment in the public services or to admissions into public schools.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the law says, for example, that election outcomes must be based on one man one vote, they quickly dismiss it as an \u2018imposition\u2019 by Northerners. They contest every fact, every principle including those that formed the basis of our union such as our federation, our system of administration, our\u2077 democracy, etc.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd as we inch up towards the 2023 elections, it comes as no surprise that some Southern politicians are giving their Northern counterparts an ultimatum which roughly translates thus: elect no one from the North as President or we will break up the country!\n\n\n\nBut what are the facts?\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s Fourth Democratic Republic is about 22 years old. Of this, Northerners ruled for only ten years. But in-spite of this, some southern politicians are furious, issuing dare warnings against the election of any Northerner as president. It has to be stated clearly and for the avoidance of any doubt that the North is not and has never been opposed to the election of any Nigerian from any part of the country as President.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnything that will be done to achieve that, however, must accord with the law and democratic principles. Gone are the days when Northerners felt blackmailed and intimidated by threats of re-structuring, secession, break up or break down of Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe North does not seek to dominate any part of the country but will not submit itself to be relegated to serfdom. Those issuing ultimatums are to be pitied, knowing that they know not what they are doing. They own no patent nor monopoly of the art or science of ultimatums.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nNdubuisi Francis in Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Economic Summit Group (NESG), a private sector-led think-tank and policy advocacy group, has proposed a ten-point action plan under an integrated strategy for revenue optimisation, expenditure efficiency and public debt management.\n\n\n\nThe action plan was contained in a report submitted in Abuja, yesterday, to the Debt Management Office (DMO) under the auspices of Debt Management Roundtable (DMR), an initiative of the NESG and Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA).\n\n\n\nThe NESG chief executive, \u2018Laoye Jaiyeola in a statement highlighted the depth of research and sub-regional collaboration involved in the production of the report, as well as its significance for sustainable debt management across the West Africa sub- region, if implemented.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the NESG, our mission is an open, inclusive, sustainable and globally competitive economy. We champion sustainable debt management because unsustainable public debt accumulation is inimical to economic growth, not only in Nigeria but ECOWAS as a whole.\n\n\n\n\u201cNigeria is a focal point for debt sustainability, considering that the country accounts for 50 per cent and 67 per cent of the region\u2019s total debt and GDP respectively. This behooves us to adopt more sustainable strategies to create the required fiscal space for national development, with positive knock-on effects in other ECOWAS nations.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe presentation was graced by stakeholders from Nigeria\u2019s public and private sectors, including Dr. Abel Essien of the ECOWAS Commission; Paul Adeyeye, OSIWA and Zainab Mangga, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Country Office, among others.\n\n\n\nIn her keynote address, The Director-General, DMO, Ms. Patience Oniha, said: \u201cThe timing of the launch of the report could not have been more appropriate with the global debt levels already rising pre-COVID-19 and still growing since the COVID-19 pandemic started in the year 2020.\n\n\n\n\u201cConcerns around debt sustainability have expectedly been heightened. According to the World Bank\u2019s World Economic Outlook, \u2018Globally, sovereign debt grew from 49.1 per cent of GDP in 2014 to 57.9 per cent in 2019, and in sub-Saharan Africa, from 35.1 per cent of GDP in 2014 to 55.4 per cent in 2019.\u2019 The respective figures for 2021 were 66.7 per cent and 60.3 per cent.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe indications are that the trend will continue as the economic consequences of COVID-19 may linger for a longer period, coupled with the increased economic pressures in the form of rising inflation from higher food and energy prices caused by the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe IMF projects in its World Economic Outlook for April 2022 that the average Debt to GDP Ratio in West Africa is expected to rise to 67.2 per cent in 2022 from 56.4 per cent in 2019.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn his remarks, the DMR Chairman, Taiwo Oyedele, identified corruption in public spending, insecurity, geopolitical challenges, resource over dependency, and a shallow tax base as some major drivers of unsustainable debt.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe DMR report is holistic and includes workable recommendations that, if adopted, can prevent West Africa from getting into a debt trap. Debt in and of itself is not a bad thing. It is what we do with the debt that really counts.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo how can we begin to apply the resources that we make \u2013 whether internally generated or money borrowed \u2013 in an efficient manner to promote productivity and prosperity for our people.\n\n\u201d The report provides answers that should help steer Nigeria and other ECOWAS countries towards debt sustainability.\u201d\n\n\n\nInaugurated in March 2021, the DMR was tasked with providing viable alternatives and recommendations that government can apply to ensure public debt is sustainably managed.

          "text": "Fellow Americans,\n\nNobody knows the joy of winning better than I do, believe me. I have always been a winner for as long as I can remember. Okay? Nobody knows the beauty of fighting to win better than I do. I am always a fighter and when I fight, I win. Everybody knows that.\n\nI have reached the very top. Absolutely. And I reached the top at a very tremendous speed. You all know it. The first time I ran for office, I ran for president. It was beautiful. Right? What usually takes great men three attempts before they get a win, I won in a landslide the very first time I ran. I heard that it has never been done anywhere else in the world.\n\nIn the last four years, I have accomplished for America things that presidents that were in office for twelve years did not accomplish. It is not even close. I made America a big-league winner again. I put billions and billions of dollars into your pockets through my amazing tax cuts. I have shown you that everything is possible if you have the right man to do the right job. Everybody is saying so.\n\nAll over the world, there is huge respect for America again, in some cases, even massive fear. Bigly! Which is good. I made it happen. Nobody messes with America because I highly insisted on it. I placed America first, which is fair. I stopped those out of control dope and overrated countries that get away with murder at the expense of America. It didn\u2019t happen again. Not on my watch! I was tough so that America would be triumphant.\n\nThe world had never seen anything like that before.\n\nBecause of me, the next generation of Americans will grow up knowing that America is the greatest nation on earth, full of courageous men like me. Thanks to me, they will grow up knowing that ours is a Christian nation where it is allowed to say Merry Christmas. Our children and grandchildren will grow up knowing that the whole world is out there for them to dominate and not bow to the sissies who think that we must worship the environment at the expense of the staggering economy that I built.\n\nFrankly, I have done everything that I set out to do \u2013 most of which were things that have never been done before. I have in place the greatest military that humans ever assembled for our incredible men and women in uniform. I assembled it in just four years by rebuilding our powerful military that they destroyed due to neglect and incompetence. I secured America from coast to coast with walls and wires, cages and visa bans. I took care of it, just as I promised I would do. I returned America under God. Before I came, they had taken America to the shrines of the devil.\n\nAmericans love me because of these outstanding accomplishments. I have seen it on the faces of fabulous Americans while I travelled around the country in the last few weeks.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I could stay around and fight. And it is a fight that I know that I will win. But I have decided not to. There is no point.\n\nI believe that I have nothing else left to prove. My achievements will be around till the end of time. I won\u2019t be surprised if, by January 20, 2021, my face would go up on Mount Rushmore to join other presidents of my calibre. It won\u2019t surprise me one bit. People think it is going to happen.\n\nTo all my special supporters, I say thank you for the unbelievable fantastic ride. Don\u2019t despair, for I will send you a brilliant comforter. Those stupid little lightweights on the other side who have no clue may taunt you. When those clowns do, remind the goofy and crooked losers that I made America great again. Tell those terrible lowlifes that they have proved themselves unworthy of Donald Trump\u2019s genius and have opted to reduce America to a Second Class nation in the world. Total Disaster!\n\nSo, my fellow American, I bide you all farewell. May God bless you, and my God bless the United States of America.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump\n\nThe 45th President of the United States.",

          "title": "The Teflon President With Nine Lives Is On His Way Out By Dr. Wumi Akintide",
          "text": "You probably know who I am talking about. The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump. Can any of you reading this write-up imagine Barack Obama, who twice won the popular vote and the Electoral College tallies and who spent 8 good years in the White House without a single scandal, being described as a cat with 9 lives?\n\nNot by a long shot. The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics.\n\nYou would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming to be the smartest President America has ever put in office.\n\nWhat is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that. America under Trump is no longer the America we used to know and the Republican Party has become a den of thieves and sexual predators that have lost their moral compass as a major political party in God\u2019s own country.\n\nIn cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.\n\nEven though the White House was built with slave labor, as widely documented by historians, no black man was ever expected to live in that majestic building that the arrogant Donald Trump, in one of his craziest moments, has described as a \u201cdump.\u201d\n\nThe guy is just too arrogant to admit that the Obama couple was far superior to him and his Melania in intellect and education. Barack earned his education from Columbia and Harvard while Michelle earned her own from Princeton and Harvard.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any better than that for any American President dead or alive but the \u201cC\u201d average student from an undergraduate business program would tell you he is the smartest dude in the universe who never makes a mistake or regrets anything. He sounds to me like a reincarnated Adolf Hitler who told the Anglo-Saxons they were the most superior white race in the world who must dominate the world. Donald Trump is pretty much preaching the same doctrine today. His latest unilateral announcement to make Jerusalem the undivided capital of the Zionist Regime without consultation with any of America\u2019s traditional allies is tantamount to suicide and a move that will go down in infamy, to quote the immortal words of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nDonald Trump once boasted that he was far more experienced than all of the American generals combined. He is therefore seeking to invalidate or demolish anything the first black President had ever done during his 8 glorious years in the White House.\n\nThe one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin. He turned around the American economy while reducing unemployment in America to the lowest it had ever been in 20 years. He killed Osama Bin Laden and he passed into law the Affordable Health Care Reform Law that offered medical insurance coverage to 46 million Americans with the stroke of his pen.\n\nThe Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but his Republican base and some charlatans in the party are buying the cheap blackmail from a delusional outlaw in the White House.\n\nEven though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent.\n\nMy point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again.\n\nIi is Donald Trump that I call the Houdini of American Politics for how and why he has survived up to this moment despite all of the atrocities he has committed as a candidate and now as President for close to one year.\n\nIf Barack Obama had uttered half the statements credited to Donald Trump, he would never have secured the nomination of the Democratic Party in 2008 and would have been ostracized for life.\n\nI seek your indulgence to go back to memory lane to remind some of the fans of this column about the America we used to know before crazy Donald Trump showed up. Eagleton was dropped from nomination as running mate due to a history of mental health illness. Spiro Agnew, Vice President to Richard Nixon, was defrocked for tax evasion and fraud. Joseph Biden was forced to drop out of his Presidential bid at a point in his career because he was found guilty of plagiarism in one of his stump speeches - he lifted a quotation from Neil Kinnock, a Labour Party leader in Britain without acknowledging his source.\n\nGerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in large part because he pardoned Richard Nixon, an unconvicted felon, for obstruction of justice and for displaying ignorance when he stated in one of his debates with Jimmy Carter that the now-defunct Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe.\n\nGeorge Bush lost to Bill Clinton for going back on his \u201cread my lips\u201d pledge not to increase taxes. The voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.\n\nI gave all of these examples to show how Donald Trump would appear to have completely changed all the rules of the game for anyone who will be President in America. Republicans nominated a man who has had more than 4000 litigations against him in the Court of Law, most of those litigations he had to settle out of Court because he was too embarrassed to let them go forward.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who falsely tried to delegitimize the man he was going to replace by claiming Obama was not born in America. Republicans nominated a man whose Trump Plaza Building in New York was already known to be the money laundering capital of the world.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who claimed he loved to sexually assault women by \u201cgrabbing their pussies\u201d because they allowed him to commit the crime because he was a star who could get away with murder. He actually gloated that his supporters would still vote for him even if he had shot and killed a man on 5th Avenue in broad daylight in Manhattan. Republicans nominated and elected a pathological liar who is never ashamed to blackmail his opponents by calling them names and insulting them and getting away with everything.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man whose financial and business record with American banks and financial houses across the board were so bad that no American Bank was willing to do business with him because he had swindled them time and again. Republicans nominated and elected a man who had been divorced three times and who has filed for Bankruptcy more than five times and a man who has bluntly refused to submit his tax returns for public scrutiny because he has managed to avoid paying taxes for more than 20 years.\n\nRepublicans nominated and elected a con artist who is not afraid to lie his way out of every problem and a man who has openly tried to undermine NATO and many of the time-honored agreements all of his predecessors in the White House had committed to for more than 70 years.\n\nThey elected a hoodlum who openly colluded or conspired with the KGB while openly casting aspersion on the credibility of the American CIA and FBI. Republicans elected a man who wants to repeat Harry Truman\u2019s mistake by becoming the second American President to deploy or detonate the nuclear bomb, this time on North Korea.\n\nRepublicans have elected a man who openly emulates and praises dictators like Vladimir Putin. He made it clear he would want to be like them if he had his way. Republicans elected a man who tweets in the early hours of the morning and who has used tweeting as an instrument of policies and presidential orders. They elected a man who on Wednesday made good on his promise destroy the last vestiges of the Camp David Accord by unilaterally moving the capital of Israel to divide Jerusalem, thereby stroking the embers of fire and fury in the Middle East. Republicans have elected a man who has made his inexperienced son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the de facto Secretary of State to the United States through the backdoor.\n\nThe list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less. Republicans elected a man who has claimed that his own opinion or decision is all that counts and who has proclaimed most institutions of the fourth estate of the realm as \u201cfake news\u201d disseminators.\n\nHe has pointed accusing fingers at networks like CNN and print media like the highly respected New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, to mention a few.\n\nWhat atrocity, in less than one year in office, has this President not already committed? The list is inexhaustible. The greatest loser in this entire saga has to be the Republican Party and the clear winner has to be Vladimir Putin who now has the American President in his pocket and dictating to him what he must do or not do. Whoever thought that the whole world is going to turn 180 degrees for America and that Donald Trump is on his way to becoming the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Politics right under our eyes, and Americans appear totally helpless and clueless to do something about it.\n\nIt is a complete outrage and totally incredible!\n\nI rest my case.\n\nDr. Wumi Akintide",
          "summary": "The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump.\nIn cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.\nThe one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin.\nThe voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.\nThe list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less.",

          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "CAF is tackling Africa's $4bn cybersecurity threat",
          "text": "As African businesses grow in number and reach, the importance of cybersecurity in Africa must be reiterated. More Africans are coming online, increasing the continent\u2019s contribution to the global economy, and everyone from businesses to governments and individuals must learn to protect their data and digital sovereignty.\n\nGlobally, businesses lose about $1 trillion per annum to cybercrime. From ransomware attacks and phishing scams, to cryptojacking and malware, cybersecurity threats are on the rise as the world moves to become a \u201cglobal village\u201d.\n\nAfrican countries are often erroneously tagged as the countries where most cybercrimes originate from, but this has consistently been proven false. China, Russia, Brazil, India, and the United States have repeatedly topped the charts, and only 1 African country\u2014Nigeria\u2014has frequently made some of these lists.\n\nAlthough many African countries might not have the largest cybersecurity threats, they are still at risk of cyberattacks. Interpol\u2019s Africa Cyberthreat Assessment Report states that over 90% of businesses on the continent are operating without the necessary cyber security protocols in place. In 2021, cybercrime reduced GDPs across Africa by 10%, resulting in a $4 billion loss. The top 5 cyber threats are online scams, digital extortion, business email compromise or BECs, ransomware, and botnets, and most were distributed through emails. Over 679 million cybercrime-related emails were detected last year alone\u2014with 219 million of this emanating from South Africa.\n\nAs these threats grow, so do the development of cybersecurity organisations like Ciberobs, an Ivorian cybersecurity firm providing analysis, information, and tools for governments and businesses. Ciberobs also hosts an annual cybersecurity conference\u2014Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\u2014where decision-makers across sectors gather to highlight the cyber threats facing Africa, and how to address them.\n\nIn preparation for the second edition of CAF scheduled to hold in Abidjan on May 9 and 10, TechCabal held a conversation with founder and Managing Partner Franck Ki\u00e9 to underline the importance of events like CAF.\n\nFranck Kie, Managing Partner of Ciberobs\n\nTimi Odueso: How did Ciberobs start?\n\nFranck Ki\u00e9: Well, I had my Masters\u2019 in cybersecurity. I remember I was doing a research paper and project on cybercrime in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and I couldn\u2019t find the data I needed. So I put up keyword alerts on the internet and found an old article with all the data. That journey\u2014searching for and finding the data\u2014is what really brought about Ciberobs. On a more personal level, I\u2019ve always really been interested in bringing my contribution to make Africa safer. As a kid, I grew up seeing political unrest all around C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and I always wanted to make Africa safer, one way or the other. When I had the chance to switch careers from business to cybersecurity, I took that chance, and I haven\u2019t looked back since.\n\nTO: Since Ciberobs founding in 2019, have you found any trends across regions? Are there some countries taking cyber security more seriously?\n\nFK: I wouldn\u2019t say that some regions are doing better than others, but we could say that for countries, some of which are doing better than others. Kenya, and East Africa in general, is making a lot of advancement, partly due to the growth of the mobile money industry. There are also other countries that are more advanced because they need the economic advantage; there\u2019s danger and risk at stake, and they need to tackle it. Countries like Morocco, Mauritius, Kenya, Togo, South Africa, and even C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are definitely putting cybersecurity at the top of their lists. And C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for example, is taking it quite seriously because we\u2019ve been on the receiving end of global financial restrictions brought on by growing cybercrime in the country. Up until a few years ago, it was forbidden to send money, through Western Union, to Canada from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nTO: Hmm. Interesting. What advancements have been made since then to help curb these restrictions?\n\nFK: Awareness is the biggest advancement we\u2019re making now. People need to know about these cybersecurity risks. At Ciberobs, a lot of our work focuses on awareness and sensitisation. We write news, articles, and host webinars on cybersecurity. We\u2019re also planning to go to schools and universities to carry out these awareness programmes. Our biggest activity, however, is the Cyber Africa Forum event which we launched last year. In that first edition, we had over 700 attendees representing 60 countries, and we held roughly 150 meetings during the whole run.\n\nFirst edition of Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\n\nTO: Wow, was there a resolution made in the first edition?\n\nFK: No, there wasn\u2019t. Last year was really about promotion and awareness. We wanted governments to know the importance of taking more measures in order to improve cybersecurity. Last year was more like a sub-regional event. This year, we\u2019re going bigger. We\u2019re having delegations from ministries from Kinshasa, and Brazzaville; and top cybersecurity leaders from companies like Huawei, Ecobank, Deloitte, Orange Bank, Kaspersky, and PwC. What we\u2019re really looking forward to doing this year is facilitating discussions that will highlight information and solutions to cybersecurity issues for decision-makers across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to be a part of the conversation at CAF register for free here. The programme will take place in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, on May 9 and 10, 2022.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Anambra State Governor, Charles Chukwuma Soludo, has announced the appointment of Chukwuemeka Fred Agbata as the MD/CEO of the Anambra State ICT Agency for a four-year tenure.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Agbata will be expected to use his experience to help the government achieve its plans of building a mega-city. This will include expanding broadband access, digitising government services, and supporting technology startups in the state.\n\nAgbata brings over a decade of experience working in the technology sector in different roles in the media and startup space, experience that he believes will serve him as he begins a new chapter.\n\nSpeaking to Techpoint Africa on how his past will help him in his new role, Agbata said, \u201cWith my industry experience, I will be able to quickly launch new programs, attract the right partners, strengthen the tech and developer communities, organise programmes and meetups, and tons of other initiatives and activities that will benefit both Anambra State and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgbata\u2019s mandate will tie neatly into the state government\u2019s mission to make Anambra the digital and creative capital of Nigeria. Through the Soludo Solution, the state plans to train and support up to 10,000 youth annually while setting up a five billion venture capital fund to incubate and provide growth capital for startups.\n\nMuch of the growth in Nigeria\u2019s tech sector has been seen in Lagos State. However, growth in the industry needs to be spread across more cities if the country\u2019s unemployment rate is to be reduced.\n\nWith ICT\u2019s growing contribution to the country\u2019s GDP, some states have taken steps to take advantage of this trend.\n\nIn 2020, the Edo State Government launched the Edo Innovation Hub. The hub provides a place for state residents to convene and potentially build technological products.\n\nLast year, it inaugurated a board with Victor Asemota, SwiftaCorp Co-founder as its chairman; and Oswald Guobadia, Senior Special Assistant to the Nigerian President on Digital Transformation, as a member.\n\nAlready, the state has partnered with tech talent accelerator, Decagon in a project that plans to train 15,000 residents of the state in software development and is an attempt to follow and potentially leapfrog Lagos State as a top destination for technological innovation.\n\nOne factor that has aided the rise of Lagos as a tech hub is the existing infrastructure absent in most states in the country.\n\nAccording to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, the South Eastern region of Nigeria, where Anambra State is, has the lowest Internet penetration rates, with 13.7 million users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncreasing the number of residents connected to the Internet will be vital in achieving the government\u2019s goals. Already, the previous government has set the ball rolling by waiving the right-of-way charges for telcos in the state, paving the way for the new government to build on it.\n\nIn Agbata\u2019s experience and Soludo\u2019s previous experience as a Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the state could become a digital powerhouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

If you\u2019re wondering why, it\u2019s because I\u2019ll be learning about the Web3 from experts. Isn\u2019t this something you should look forward to too?\n\nInterestingly, Bolu highlighted five ways we can learn Web3 at the Summit here: 5 ways to learn about Web3 at the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\nYou don\u2019t want to pass up this opportunity to learn from great minds. To attend, please register here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nProblems YC-backed startups are solving\n\nTikTok\u2019s Pulse\n\nTigerrise\u2019s plan to improve mental health\n\nWhat problems are YC-backed startups solving?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI believe you\u2019ve been seeing Y Combinator (YC) posts in our newsletter for over a week now. And I understand how tiring it can be to see the same thing repeatedly.\n\nDon\u2019t worry; I\u2019m about to change that. This is a new story. And, I won\u2019t bore you. You\u2019d tell me if I was, won\u2019t you? \ud83e\udd14\n\nKeep in mind that Chimgozirim had a chat with the founders of Y Combinator (YC) in March 2022 and told us how they work. Please read it here: Investors on high alert as Y Combinator shows more interest in East and North Africa\n\nBesides, on Wednesday, May 4, 2022, we issued a report indicating the following:\n\nThe breakdown of the $1.3 billion raised by YC-backed African startups\n\n51 YC-backed African startups are from Nigeria\n\nA large percentage of YC-backed African startups were accepted into the accelerator programme in the first two years of their establishment\n\nDetails of featured startups, among others\n\nYou can, of course, download the report here. It\u2019s completely free.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s crucial to note that 95 African companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, roughly half of which are 51 fintechs from Nigeria. Most importantly, it\u2019s also critical to ask questions such as, \u201cWhat problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups \u2018trying\u2019 to solve?\u201d\n\nAccording to our data, these startups are active in various industries, including Financial Services, eCommerce, Agriculture, Healthcare, and Mobility & Logistics. So, again, what problem are they attempting to address?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur Senior Reporter, Emmanuel Paul, is likely to have an answer to your question. Please look at it here: What problems are Y Combinator-backed startups solving in Africa?\n\nTikTok to split ad revenue with creators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall this: Meta needs to get over TikTok? Interestingly, TikTok appears to be upping its game, leaving Meta with no breathing room. Maybe some sleepless nights for Meta in the coming days?\n\nWhy? TikTok has introduced Pulse, a new advertising program that will allow brands to place advertisements alongside the platform\u2019s most popular videos.\n\nIsn\u2019t this fantastic news for TikTok Pulse creators? To put things into perspective, ad revenue will be split 50/50 between creators and publishers. This is similar to what YouTube offers creators, who reportedly receive a 55% cut.\n\nNow, you\u2019re interested, aren\u2019t you? But there\u2019s a catch: TikTok says p,m Pulse will be available only to creators and publishers with at least 100,000 followers, and even then, ads will only appear alongside \u201cthe top 4% of all TikTok videos.\u201d\n\nMoreover, TikTok\u2019s Pulse will also ensure that creator content is \u201csuitable\u201d for advertisements.\n\nThis means that Pulse will allow brands to target their ads to specific areas of TikTok. Brands can use Pulse to place ads alongside videos in 12 different categories, including beauty, fashion, pets, gaming, TV & movies, auto, Spanish language, sports and recreation, and more.\n\nFor the time being, this feature will be available to a select group of users in the United States beginning in June 2022. And sometime in September 2022, more countries.\n\nTigerrise to improve mental health access\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Emily Underworld on Unsplash\n\nIn Africa, mental health care is scarce. Per the World Health Organization (WHO), 75-95% of people with mental illnesses do not have any access to appropriate care in low and middle-income countries.\n\nTo back up this claim, Kenya\u2019s health ministry reports that 75% of people in need of mental health services cannot obtain them. Knowing the stereotypes surrounding mental illnesses in Africa, I don\u2019t think this is breaking news.\n\nWhy? Studies have shown that Kenyans suffering from mental illnesses are frequently stigmatised on several levels.\n\nConsequently, Tigerrise \u2014 a company which uses data-driven insights to disrupt the delivery of health and wellness services positively \u2014 has partnered with the Elton John AIDS Foundation.\n\nMoreso, it has received a $1 million grant to empower Kenyan youth to take charge of their mental and physical health to increase access to mental health care in Kenya.\n\nWhat\u2019s in for Kenyans? Over the next three years, the Elton John AIDS Foundation\u2019s $1 million grant will ensure that all Triggerise-affiliated clinics in Mombasa, Kenya, provide mental health screening and services ranging from individual and group counselling to trauma-based care.\n\nMoreover, these services will be fully integrated with Triggerise\u2019s existing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services for young people aged 15 to 24.\n\nSince seamless access to SRH is critical for this age group, the collaboration will ensure that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) services are part of Triggerise\u2019s established offerings in Mombasa.\n\nRichard Matikanya, Triggerise\u2019s Chief Operating Officer said, \u201cThe timing of this investment is particularly exciting, as the growing mental health burden among young people in their diversity \u2014 particularly those living with HIV \u2014 has largely been overlooked. Our partnership will allow us to contribute to the evidence base on how to ensure that young people have access to mental health services that respond to their needs on their terms.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWHAT DOES THE FUTURE OF ABORTION LOOK LIKE?\n\nChange: an Opportunity rather than a Fear\n\n\u201cEverything happens for a reason\u201d \u2014 and other lies I\u2019ve loved\n\nOpportunities\n\nTechpoint Africa will host entrepreneurs and startup enthusiasts at Techpoint Pitch Friday on Friday, May 13, 2022, by 5 p.m at 43b Emina Crescent, Opebi, Allen, Ikeja.

          "title": "What problems are Y Combinator-backed startups solving in Africa?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s probably safe to state that technology and exposure have changed how startups operate in Nigeria. After its first entry with Senegal\u2019s Wave, Y Combinator, one of the most prestigious accelerators in the world today, has gained increasing prominence in Africa.\n\nResearch from the good folks at Intelligence by Techpoint, our data and research team, has shown that African startups, on average, enter YC within a year or two of launch.\n\nIn March 2005, four illustrious professionals decided to start a company that would change how venture capitalists (VCs) invest in startups. With a seed fund of $150,000, the company took in the likes of Reddit in its first batch and has gone on to fund an enviable list of startups, including Stripe, Airbnb, and OpenSea.\n\nSince Paystack\u2019s entry in 2016, Y Combinator has seemingly increased its focus on Africa annually. This has significantly changed how African startups operate and, per some founders, helped refine their business processes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince Paystack\u2019s entry in 2016, Nigerian startups have dominated the scenes, gravitating towards the accelerator. Little wonder that 53% (51) of YC-backed African startups (95) are from Nigeria. Egypt comes in at a distant second with 12 startups, while Kenya rounds up the top three countries with 9 startups.\n\nDifferent interested parties have reasons for Nigeria\u2019s seeming dominance in YC, but it\u2019s not so surprising for the accelerator.\n\nKat Manalac, Head of Outreach at Y Combinator, points out that when one company from a region goes through YC, gets featured in the press, and raises money after demo day, more founders from that region start applying the following year.\n\n\u201cWe saw this in 2014 with Algolia \u2014 the Algolia founders were some of YC\u2019s first French founders. They went through YC in Winter 2014, and in the following batch, we saw 17 French founders go through the program. This is what started happening with African companies after Paystack went through the batch,\u201d she says.\n\nCombined, Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups had raised $1.3 billion as of March 2021, with two of them \u2014 Wave and Flutterwave \u2014 reaching a billion-dollar valuation. Paystack, another huge success story, was acquired by Stripe, a US-based payments startup, for $200 million in 2020.\n\nThese headline-grabbing stories appear to show investor attraction for YC-backed companies. For most investors, getting into YC means that a startup now has a higher valuation. But the big question remains: What problems are Y Combinator-backed startups solving?\n\nWhat problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups solving?\n\nWhile this might be the most obvious question, I guess we should have framed it thus: What problems are Africa\u2019s YC-backed startups \u2018trying\u2019 to solve? Why? To use the Nigerian parlance, \u201cProblem nor dey finish\u201d, which simply means problems are never ending.\n\nOur data shows that these startups are playing in various industries, including Financial Services, eCommerce, Agriculture, Healthcare, and Mobility & Logistics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019ll work our way up from the industries with the least focus to the ones with the most focus for this article. We found some startups working in some unexpected industries, but you\u2019ll have to download the report to find out.\n\nEducation, Media, and Telecoms\n\nEducation, Media, and Telecoms are together because each sector has only one YC-backed startup trying to solve its problems. This is hardly surprising, considering that only 5% ($245m) of the $4.9 billion African startups raised in 2021 went to the Education sector.\n\nWhile Africa\u2019s education startups didn\u2019t get up to 3% of startup funding in 2020 ($1.07 billion), Media and Telecoms did not make any notable imprint on the funding numbers for 2021 and 2020.\n\nThese startups have raised a combined $7.2 million and are seemingly making decent strides in their respective industries.\n\nIn 2021, the African Union reported that there were 42 million out-of-school children in Africa, with 40% of this number coming from West Africa. Six out of ten Africans are still without access to the Internet, and affordability remains a big issue for those who have access.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that these are huge capital-intensive sectors and might not be appealing to the fast-paced, high-growth nature of modern startups. But we might just be an innovative execution away from the problem. Easier said than done, we know. As for media? That\u2019s a different ball game entirely.\n\nOther sectors like Real Estate and Marketing also feature in this group.\n\nEnergy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, two Energy startups have gone through the prestigious accelerator programme and closed a combined $22 million to date. Slightly better than the three industries above, renewable energy solutions have attracted decent funding in Africa.\n\nWhile it only accounted for 5% ($245 million) of funding in 2021, it took 22% of funding in the previous year. A cursory glance at the numbers, which show that 43% of Africans didn\u2019t have access to electricity as of 2019, evidently points to a vast untapped market.\n\nLike Telecoms, this is also capital intensive, and from what we\u2019ve observed, several renewable energy solutions are barely affordable for the average (or even upper-middle-class) African.\n\nAgriculture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith all its classes and tasty nutrients, food is an integral part of society. So far, YC has funded three startups looking to provide tech-enabled solutions for food security in Africa, and they have secured a combined $64 million.\n\nLike the previous industries, it appears there\u2019s a low investor appetite for startups building agriculture solutions across the continent. Agriculture startups accounted for 4% of funding in 2021, lower than 7% in 2020.\n\nAccording to world vision, 282 million people are undernourished in Africa, and that\u2019s just one result of several underlying problems. While food prices keep rising, 37% of food produced gets wasted.\n\nMobility & Logistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMobility & Logistics is at the heart of commerce and nearly everything we do. To date, six African Mobility & Logistics startups have gone through YC, raising $94.6 million. A trend we observed is that most of these startups are based in North Africa, with roughly 30% from Nigeria.\n\nRecent funding announcements have shown a renewed interest in eCommerce in North Africa. Overall, Mobility & Logistics companies accounted for 10% of the total funding in 2021, a marginal improvement from 7% in 2020.\n\nWhen we split both sectors, we\u2019ll find that most of these companies are logistics companies. Mobility startups, on the other hand, have not raised as much.\n\nHealthcare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tyck via Iwaria\n\nAfrica\u2019s Health sector is huge not for its number of hospitals and medical infrastructure but for the number of problems waiting to be solved. Everything, from preventive healthcare, telemedicine, health insurance, and precision medicine, represents critical areas in Africa.\n\nY Combinator has invested in eight African Health startups that have bagged a combined $115 million. These startups offer diverse healthcare solutions in preventive healthcare, health insurance, cancer diagnostics, medical logistics, and precision medicine.\n\nNine out of the top ten causes of death in Africa are health-related problems that run pretty deep. While healthcare startups are emerging, their services are mainly meant for a particular class, so it\u2019s hard to see how they can reach the mass market without significant regulatory backing.\n\nHealth startups accounted for 8% of 2021\u2019s funding, not improving on 9% in 2020. While technology is great, there are other serious considerations beyond its scope \u2014 for now at least.\n\nMarketplace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketplace startups have grown in popularity in recent years, and platforms that simply offer the technology to connect sellers to buyers are popping up with diverse execution strategies. So far, YC has invested in 17 startups looking to help Africans buy and sell online.\n\nConsidering the well-documented struggles of Jumia and Konga, questions abound on the viability of eCommerce startups in Africa. But these questions have not stopped YC-backed African eCommerce startups from bagging $138 million to date.\n\nOverall, eCommerce startups have accounted for 3% and 5% of funding in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Also noteworthy is that an increasing number of eCommerce startups are now serving businesses rather than consumers directly.\n\nFinancial Services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Services startups are the cream of the crop and the most popular sector by almost any metric in use. It has attracted the most funding and, perhaps, the most media attention for the past four years.\n\nSo far, YC has invested in a whopping 47 Financial Services startups in Africa, almost half of its Africa alumni. They\u2019ve collectively raised over $854 million, about 65% of the total funding raised by Africa\u2019s YC alumni.\n\nHowever, this trend is not peculiar to YC. Fintech companies accounted for 62% of funding in 2021, mainly due to megadeals from Flutterwave and Chipper Cash. In the preceding year, fintechs grabbed 33% of funding, still much higher than any other sector.\n\nThere are some obvious reasons for the prominence of fintech companies. Over half of the continent\u2019s population does not have access to formal financial services. As of 2020, the median age of Africans was 19.7 \u2014 this means half of the population was younger, and half of the population was older.\n\nMost fintech companies\u2019 efforts do not seem geared toward improving financial inclusion but rather promising a better experience for people who already have bank accounts. However, the jury is still out on how successful they\u2019ve been.\n\nPayments, for instance, have witnessed the most advancement. With the exploits of Paystack and Flutterwave, API-led fintechs are changing how financial companies communicate, but nearly every other sub-sector is still in the early stages.\n\nWhy is the focus on fintech?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we fund is typically a reflection of what strong teams are applying with,\u201d says YC\u2019s Manalac, in response to our question on fintech\u2019s evident dominance.\n\nManalac\u2019s assertion suggests that the company does not deliberately look out for fintech companies, but it receives several applications from founders offering financial services solutions.\n\n\u201cThat payments lead the way shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise because it is a primary pain point for all human beings irrespective of where you are, and is one area that technology has proven that it can build solutions for,\u201d says Adesoji Solanke, Director, Frontier/SSA Banks & Fintech Equity Research, Renaissance Capital.\n\nPelumi Aboluwarin, CTO of Nigeria\u2019s Nomba (formerly Kudi), maintains that running a business is hard, so payments shouldn\u2019t be difficult too. Perseus Mlamba, CEO, Zambia\u2019s Union54, also argues that payment is the key to unlocking innovations in health, agriculture, and industry.\n\nWhile both founders run prominent financial services startups, Ikenna Nzewi, CEO of Releaf, a Nigerian Agritech startup, agrees.\n\n\u201cFintech was the first piece of our growing innovation story so it makes sense that most of the investment and attention so far has gone to that sector. However, as innovation from more sectors emerges, I believe we will see a more diverse split.\u201d\n\nAll things considered, we can safely say that YC-backed companies are mainly looking to solve problems in finance, eCommerce, logistics, and Healthcare. As these entrepreneurs gain more experience, we should better understand how these tech solutions could be best applied in an African context. As the founders we spoke to explained, going through YC is just the beginning.\n\nLooking to understand how YC\u2019s activities are changing Africa\u2019s startup landscape? We spoke to some prominent entrepreneurs who have gone through the accelerator to gain insights. Watch this space on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmmanuel Paul Writer and Narrator.

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe International Girls in ICT Day was celebrated globally on April 28th, 2022, and the team at the Microsoft Africa Development Center (ADC), West Africa, celebrated the day at an intimate event with schoolgirls and female tech enthusiasts.\n\nThemed \u201cAccess and Safety,\u201d the day was marked to reinforce the safety for girls and young women to thrive in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and the need for safe and reliable access to the internet and digital tools. This year and every year, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and partners work together to develop solutions and ideas for lowering barriers to access and improving safety online for girls and young women.\n\nThe event held at the newly launched Microsoft facility in Lagos with young girls from Girls Senior Secondary Grammar School Obalende, Ikoyi Lagos, female tech enthusiasts as well as 30 ladies under 30 with no prior tech knowledge all in attendance. This audience were treated to inspiring conversations, one-on-one sessions with mentors, a tour of the office facility, and an introduction to skilling pathways in technology.\n\nOn their part, the 30 ladies under 30 who attended the observance without an academic degree or career in tech left with renewed energy willing to pursue careers in tech and software engineering.\n\nHosted by Sefunmi Wande-Durojaye, Lead Ecosystem and Program Development at Microsoft ADC-West Africa, the observance sparked conversations in ICT for girls during the day-long event, with a keynote address delivered by Bolanle Olumekor, Knowledge Management Assistant at United Nations Information Centre Nigeria.\n\nParticipants had the opportunity to hear inspiring and insightful speeches from the speakers during the sessions. Paula Wigwe, Business Manager at Microsoft ADC-West Africa, shared a relatable story of how she got into tech even though her first degree was in Estate Management. Her story had a lot to do with her curiosity, resilience and being focused.\n\nBeyond the significance of internet access and safety for young women, the day was leveraged as another channel to inspire young women interested in STEM to dream and believe in a future at Microsoft like many women, they had the opportunity to meet. Jacquelyn Ekwueme, Senior Program Manager in the Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), and Adora Nwodo, Software Engineer in Mixed Reality, shared their experiences on ways to become a voice and remain relevant within the tech industry.\n\nPer opportunities in skill advancement, Microsoft ADC West Africa partnered with Utiva and Skillup Africa to help the females in skilling up toward their career journey in tech.\n\nOther notable sessions during the day included a career session anchored by Tejumade Olaniyi, Recruiter at the ADC West Africa and an experience at the Garage led by Lydiah Karanja, Program Manager of the Garage, ADC East Africa.\n\nThe Garage session gave the participants the opportunity to try their hands on a few projects, bringing home how very accessible and fun tech can be for young women.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrand Press This Brand Press article wasn\u2019t written by Techpoint Africa\u2019s editorial team.

          "text": "Domestic airlines operating in Nigeria have said they will discontinue operations nationwide with effect from Monday May 9, 2022 until further notice as a result of the fuel increase nationwide.\n\nIn a statement by the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON), it stated that member airlines have carried on deploying and subsidizing their services to the Nigerian flying public in the last four months despite the steady and astronomical hike in the price of JetA1 and other operating costs.\n\nIn the statement which were signed by managing directors of Max Air, United Nigeria Airlines, Ibom Air, Arik Air, Aero Contractors, Azman Air, Overland, Dana Air and Air Peace, they disclosed that overtime, aviation fuel price (JetA1) has risen from N190 per litre to N700 currently, adding that no airline in the world can absorb this kind of sudden shock from such an astronomical rise over a short period.\n\nRead also: International airlines shun new Lagos terminal over space constraints\n\n\u201d While aviation fuel worldwide is said to cost about 40percent of an airline\u2019s operating cost globally, the present hike has shut up Nigeria\u2019s operating cost to about 95 percent. In the face of this, airlines have engaged the Federal Government, the National Assembly, NNPC and Oil Marketers with the view to bringing the cost of JetA1 down which has currently made the unit cost per seat for a one hour flight in\n\nNigeria today to an average of N120,000. The latter cannot be fully passed to passengers who are already experiencing a lot of difficulties.\n\n\u201cWhile AON appreciates the efforts of the current government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure air transport in Nigeria grows, unfortunately, the cost of aviation fuel has continued to rise unabated thereby creating huge pressure on the sustainability of operations and financial viability of the airlines. This is unsustainable and the airlines can no longer absorb the pressure,\u201d the body stated.",

          "text": "There are indications that Aero Contractors, the oldest airline in Nigeria, is on its way to closing shop. This follows the current financial crisis in the company, compounded by foreign exchange scarcity, high cost of aviation fuel and low passenger traffic.\n\nAfter 61 years of flight operations in Nigeria, the airline has N50 billion unserviceable debt and can currently boast of only two old aircraft \u2014 a Bombardier Dash 8-300 and a Boeing 737-500 \u2014 without operating cash to sustain its operations.\n\nHowever, experts in the aviation sector said all hopes may not be lost for the falling airline as there are some urgent interventions that can be deployed to save the airline from going under.\n\nAlexander Nwuba, managing director, Smile Air Ghana and former MD, Associated Airlines and WestAir Benin told BusinessDay the airline may need to first incorporate new structures and split the business.\n\n\u201cAero is in a situation where its liabilities create the impossibility as a going concern. In other climes like the USA, they would file a chapter 11 bankruptcy, meaning that they can longer pay their debts and force their creditors into a settlement so that the business can continue. Here it is not possible,\u201d Nwuba said.\n\n\u201cIf you cannot pay your debts, the government either rescues you, a buyer comes to the table to pay your debts or you quit the business. In the case of Aero with a stupendous debt profile, now under the management of Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON), it\u2019s either AMCON writes off the debt or finds a buyer,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said AMCON has over the years tried to see if it can resuscitate the business but all they have ever seemed to achieve is to pour kerosene into fire and Aero comes out of it, worse, now it\u2019s obvious that AMCON no longer wants to fuel the fire and there is talk of a shutdown.\n\nRead also: Despite $300m trapped funds, airlines increase flights into Nigeria\n\nHe said this invariably means that the business will disappear, which doesn\u2019t have to happen as there are still many lucrative and profitable parts to the business that can be spun off and sold.\n\n\u201cThe methodology I proposed is to establish Aero parts, a part trading and aircraft support company, Aero maintenance, to continue the profitable aircraft maintenance business; Aero support, to provide field support to the industry, Aero Services, which can leverage the 62-year business experience and provide services across many sectors from training to manuals and business process development; catering, cleaning etc. and the core airline business which requires the Air Operating Certificate (AOC), so the helicopter and aircraft business would not be easily split,\u201d Nwuba said.\n\nHe explained that these businesses can be sold into the marketplace or, the current employees can engage investment bankers to help them raise money to buy the businesses that they have demonstrated knowledge and skills in, adding that the proceeds of the sale will go to the main Aero which can then reduce its liabilities and liquidate the rest of the assets such as planes.\n\nFor John Ojikutu, aviation security consultant and Secretary-General of the Aviation Safety Round Table Initiative (ASRTI), when AMCON took over Arik and Aero, the corporation was supposed to find out the total amount owed by the two airlines locally and internationally, find technical and credit buyers both locally and international, dispose the remaining debts in the stock market to the public as shares and establish the two airlines separately as flag carriers or combine the two to form a national carrier.\n\nOjikutu said asking AMCON to be running the two airlines to recover more than N300 billion is a task that can only be achieved in 30 years if the receiver can make an annual net profit of N10bn, which can only be achieved by an aviation corporate organisation not a new asset receiver like AMCON.\n\nSpeaking on how to save the airline, he said there is a need to find out if the aircraft in the airline fleet are older than most contemporary airlines in the country, regional or continental.\n\n\u201cAero never had the problems it was having until the British technical partners left in 2010 when the Ibru family took over its running and became independent and in the hands of Nigerian management. Two years later, precisely in 2012, it joined new airlines like Arik to begin sourcing about N20 billion government intervention funds.\n\n\u201cIs anyone going to conclude that old aircraft and forex brought Arik too to the level it is? Unless we find out how these airlines got involved with over N200bn intervention funds or whoever facilitated the funds for them, we can never find solutions to their problems,\u201d he said.\n\nOlumide Ohunayo, an aviation analyst, told BusinessDay that AMCON have bitten more than they can chew, hinting that when they came into the industry everyone was happy because they promised to resuscitate the airline and save jobs but have failed.\n\n\u201cI expected that by now, Aero would have sold the airline to investors and this would have allowed the airline to survive. There were some aircrafts that were leased out which did not favour the airline. It is sad that things are happening this way. Aero was very successful and the best-managed airline at the time and still holds their safety records. We hope investors can still pick up the ashes of the airline,\u201d Ohunayo said.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s national energy company spent almost two-thirds of its revenue subsidizing gasoline in the first quarter of the year and contributed no money to the government despite soaring oil prices, according to Bloomberg.\n\nMany of the country\u2019s economists and business leaders have called the overbearing focus on maintaining a costly petrol subsidy regime a show of bad economic management by the government.\n\nData published by the Nigerian National Petroleum Co. show how high oil prices are weighing down rather than boosting public finances in Africa\u2019s largest crude producer.\n\nThe World Bank and International Monetary Fund have repeatedly urged Nigeria\u2019s government to remove the subsidy on gasoline, which is forecast to cost the country as much as $9.6 billion this year.\n\nNigeria has very little refining capacity, prompting the NNPC to import all its gasoline via crude-for-fuel swaps with local and international traders, which the company sells at an increasingly steep loss to retailers and wholesalers. That makes pump prices in Nigeria among the lowest in the world, at 162.5 naira a liter.\n\nRead also: Despite energy transition concerns, NNPC intensifies oil search in the north\n\nThe state-owned group is supposed to send excess funds each month to a pool that finances the federal and state governments in Africa\u2019s most populous nation.\n\nThe NNPC last year contributed about 15% of its gross revenue of 3.43 trillion naira to the fund, according to company data.\n\nThe firm says it spent 1.43 trillion naira subsidizing gasoline in 2021 \u2014 it is on track to nearly double that figure this year.\n\nNigeria has so far been unable to take advantage of the increase in the price of crude, which has surged since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Brent crude was up 1.6% at $112.7 a barrel at 12 p.m. in London.\n\nThe country\u2019s production has consistently fallen well short of the limits set by OPEC+, which currently stands at 1.735 million barrels a day.\n\nA spokesman for the NNPC didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",

These reports are untrue. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) is not a proscribed organisation in the UK,\u201d a statement from the UK high commission in Nigeria said on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe inaccurate reporting relates to the 13 April 2022 publication by the UK Government of a revised Country Policy and Information note (CPIN) on separatist groups in SE Nigeria, including the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). CPINS provide country of origin information (COI) and analysis of COI for use by UK Government decision-makers handling particular types of protection and human rights claims.\n\n\u201cAll asylum and human rights claims made in the UK are considered on their individual facts in accordance with our obligations under the UN Refugee Convention and European Convention on Human Rights, taking into account relevant background country information and case law.\n\n\u201cThe CPIN on separatist groups in the South East, including the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), provides a general assessment of risks faced by individuals belonging to those groups. These assessments are based on an analysis of publicly available country information obtained from a wide range of reliable sources including media outlets; UK and other governments; local, national and international organisations; and non government organisations.\n\n\u201cThis CPIN also acknowledges that the Nigerian government has proscribed IPOB as a terrorist organisation, some members of IPOB have reportedly used violence against the state and members of the public, and advises that persons who have committed human rights abuses must not be granted protection.\n\n\u201cThe document is publicly available on our UK Government website, Gov.UK at www.gov.uk/government/publications/nigeria-country-policy-and-information-notes.\u201d\n\nPlease see our statement, which clarifies the UK Government's position in response to some inaccurate reporting in circulation today. pic.twitter.com/pPou7SxQ9S \u2014 UK in Nigeria\ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec (@UKinNigeria) May 6, 2022\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian governor, relying on the apparently inaccurate report of the UK prescribing IPOB as a terrorist group, on Friday evening, released a statement welcoming the decision.\n\n\u201cNigeria welcomes the decision by the United Kingdom to proscribe the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) as a terrorist group,\u201d a tweet from the official Nigerian government twitter handle read.\n\n\u201cThe violent secessionist organisation has long been proscribed as such in Nigeria where it carries out the majority of its murderous activities.\u201d",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThe government of Osun State under the leadership of Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, has ordered immediate enrolment of 30,000 youth into its Health Insurance Scheme.\n\nThe initiative is aimed at ensuring that Osun youths get quality healthcare delivery that is accessible, affordable and beneficial.\n\nThis is even as the government announced that it has also kick started massive recruitment into Osun Youth Employment Scheme popularly called O\u2019YES.\n\nThese disclosures were made on Friday by the Commissioner for Youth and Sports, Mr. Azeez Olayemi Lawal, during a press conference held at the Conference Room, Ministry of Information and Civic Orientation, State Government Secretariat, Abere.\n\nLawal said the initiative was to properly integrate the youth into the Scheme, especially those who are out of school, unemployed, physically challenged or mentally challenged.\n\nHe said the beneficiaries of the Scheme would be drawn from the 30 Local Government Areas, including Ife-East Area Office of the State in line with the Osun State Youth Policy Programme and Implementation Strategies.\n\n\u201cThe present administration\u2019s efforts in making sure that healthcare delivery is accessible and affordable to all citizens and residents of the State led to the establishment of the Osun Health Insurance Scheme (OHIS). The benefits of the Scheme are enormous as the people of Osun are now able to access quality healthcare without tears, with evidence of improvement in their health,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the youths, who constitute a greater proportion of the population of the State, some of whom are out of school, unemployed, physically challenged or mentally challenged, are yet to be fully integrated into the scheme.\n\n\u201cIn order to address this, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, who is a lover of the youth, directed that 30,000 vulnerable youth drawn from all the local government areas of the State be enrolled under the Osun Health Insurance Scheme (OHIS).\n\n\u201cThe enrollment of (30,000) thirty thousand vulnerable youth in all the Local Government in the State shall be as follows: Distribution of (OHIS) Osun Health Insurance Scheme forms to the vulnerable youth through Local Government Chairmen; Capturing and Documentation of vulnerable youth beneficiaries in each of Local Government in the State by Osun Health Insurance Scheme Team; Inauguration ceremony of (30,000) thirty thousand vulnerable youths into (OHIS) Osun State Health Insurance Scheme to be presided over by Mr. Governor, at a later date\u201d, Lawal added.\n\nThe Commissioner revealed that the administration of Governor Oyetola has concluded plans to recruit massively into the Osun Youth Empowerment Scheme as part of efforts to maximize the potential embedded in the youth so as to further contribute their quota to the growth and development of the State.\n\nHe said the recruitment of the prospective candidates for the Batch 5 of the O\u2019YES Cadets would kickstart today, and that about 62,000 Cadets had gone through the Scheme that comprised 4 batches so far so good.\n\nAccording to Lawal, the Scheme is a revolving 2-year Volunteers Scheme which strives to empower recruited youths across the 30 Local Governments and Area Office in the State while the volunteers are divided into different specialized cadres such as Public Sanitation, Public Works Brigade, Green Gang, Osun Sheriff Corps, Traffic Marshalls, Osun Paramedics, Sanitation Czars and Teachers Corps and the volunteers are deployed to offer productive services in the identified areas of socio-economic life in accordance with the objectives of the scheme.\n\n\u201cLet me make it clear that O\u2019YES itself is not about offering employment to the youth but empowering the participating youth to become self-reliant and possibly become employers of labour. This is where the exit programme comes in. The Exit Programme empowers the Cadets by helping them become self-reliant through acquisition of relevant entrepreneurial and vocational skills. As at present, the Scheme has about 74 exit programmes for the cadets to choose from.\n\n\u201cWe can boldly say that the Scheme has achieved success in transforming the lives of the ex-cadets through the exit programmes, to the extent that you can now find many of the ex-cadets doing fine in different areas of endeavours, be it the Civil Service, Para-Military Service, Private Sector etc. Similarly, many of our ex-cadets have established their own businesses.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the owners of AJ Gas in Ile-Ife, and Alamar Multi-Purpose Nigeria Limited, passed through the Scheme. Some others have improved on their educational standing such as Dr. Foluke Kehinde, Ms Deronke Egbedun who is now in Canada, etc. On the political front, there are some former O\u2019YES cadets who are now serving as Council chairmen, Secretaries to Local Government councils, Councillors, Senior Special Assistants to the Governor among others.\n\n\u201cIn addition to these, O\u2019YEs under the present administration has recorded more success stories which include Collaboration with the Osun Agency for Community and Social Development Project CSDA on PALM-OIL PROCESSING PROJECT for some ex-cadets of O\u2019yes. The sum of N1,574,625.00 was approved and presented by CSDA to six Local Government Areas. For instance, OREDAPO Vulnerable Group Ifetedo in Ife South LGA among others included some O\u2019YES Cadets who are into palm oil processing\u201d, he added.",

The PDP National Assembly Screening Panel for Anambra never disqualified me. Our party\u2019s National Organising Secretary, Capt. Umar Bature had repeatedly assured me of the integrity of the process under his watch, and I thank him for his courage and candour in handling the procedure.\n\n\u201cThe dust is now settled, and we are moving forward full-throttle. In 2020 when I resigned from my role as the President and Group CEO of Transcorp Plc in 2020 to dedicate the next chapter to public service, I promised God that I would always make the people I serve my priority.\n\n\u201cNo matter what has been thrown my way, I have never lost focus that I am on a quest to serve my people. As such, I listen to my people. I make decisions that I believe put their best interest at heart. That is why I am running for the senatorial seat for Anambra South.

          "text": "Airlines in Nigeria said they will suspend operations from Monday, May 9, over rising cost of aviation fuel, that now sells for N700 per litre, from N190.\n\nAzman Air, Max Air, United Nigeria Airways, Ibom Air, Arik Air, Air Peace, Dana Air and Overland Airways in a joint statement Friday, made their plan known to the authorities.\n\nThis was done via a letter addressed to the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika.\n\nA copy was sent to the Director General of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, Captain Musa Nuhu.\n\nThe airlines said no airline in the world can absorb the astronomical hike in the fuel cost, which has increased its fuel cost component from 40% to 95%.\n\nThey also said the cost burden will make them offer a seat for about N120,000 for one hour journey.\n\nThe full statement:\n\nIt is with a great sense of responsibility and patriotism that the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) have carried on deploying and subsidizing their services to our highly esteemed Nigerian flying public in the last four months despite the steady and astronomical hike in the price of JetA1 and other operating costs.\n\nOvertime, aviation fuel price (JetA1) has risen from N190 per litre to N700 currently. No airline in the world can absorb this kind of sudden shock from such an astronomical rise over a short period. While aviation fuel worldwide is said to cost about 40% of an airline\u2019s operating cost globally, the present hike has shut up Nigeria\u2019s operating cost to about 95%.\n\nIn the face of this, airlines have engaged the Federal Government, the National Assembly, NNPC and Oil Marketers with the view to bringing the cost of JetA1 down which has currently made the unit cost per seat for a one hour flight in Nigeria today to an average of N120,000. The latter cannot be fully passed to passengers who are already experiencing a lot of difficulties.\n\nWhile AON appreciates the efforts of the current government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure air transport in Nigeria grows, unfortunately, the cost of aviation fuel has continued to rise unabated thereby creating huge pressure on the sustainability of operations and financial viability of the airlines. This is unsustainable and the airlines can no longer absorb the pressure.\n\nTo this end therefore, the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) hereby wishes to regrettably inform the general public that member airlines will discontinue operations nationwide with effect from Monday May 9, 2022 until further notice.\n\nAON uses this medium to humbly state that we regret any inconveniences this very difficult decision might cause and appeal to travelers to kindly reconsider their travel itinerary and make alternative arrangements.\n\nSigned:\n\nAlhaji (Dr.) Abdulmunaf Yunusa Sarina: President\n\nJointly signed by:\n\n1.

          "text": "\u2026Govt should see oil theft as a national economic sabotage \u2013 Olamilekan \u2026Companies must engage natives \u2013 Efih \u2018\u2026Register illegal refiners\u2019 \u2026Finger security personnel in deals\n\nA representative of the oil-producing host communities (HostCom) in the Niger Delta region at the recently concluded stakeholders\u2019 consultative meeting organised by the Nigerian upstream regulatory Commission, Prince Philemon Ebiesuwa, has advised the federal government to bring illegal miners into a cooperative in order to curb oil theft.\n\nPrince Ebiesuwa, of Awoye \u2013 an oil-producing community in Ilaje LGA, Ondo state, gave the advice while speaking exclusively to Blueprint Weekend on the sideline of the meeting against the backdrop of the revelation that Nigeria lost about $3.2 billion to crude oil theft between January 2021 and February this year.\n\nAccording to him, the act is perpetrated with the aid of security personnel and some oil companies\u2019 staff.\n\nHe said some of the people that were involved in this oil theft were \u201cvery powerful community people, adding that \u201cmaybe, they don\u2019t want to challenge them or cross their path.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cSo, if you say oil theft, there is no way they can do it without some inside knowledge of security operatives or some staff of these oil companies.\n\n\u201cBut the one I know of, and I can speak of, in my area in Ondo state, particularly where Chevron operates, is that there is this local community security network.\n\n\u201cThe aim is for community people to go around and protect the facilities from being vandalised; and it has worked because they are the local people and they know the people involved in it. As they patrol, it has reduced to the barest minimum, if not eliminated. I can say with certainty that such doesn\u2019t happen in that area because of the local security network and it has worked.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat is feel can stem the tide is what the vice-president suggested. And I can tell you that 30-40% of AGO we use in the Niger Delta are from these illegal refineries. They produce them and people use them. So, if you can legalise them, ask them to register with the government and the government supplies them, they can now produce a better AGO. And those that are registered will not allow any illegal body to come and spoil their business. I think that is one way to fight it.\n\n\u201cYou are not going to proliferate it. If they are known in Ondo state, and you ask them to come together and form a consortium, and give them regulations, the way they will work without endangering the environment. That one is better than allowing them to go and continue to cause more damage.\u201d\n\nProduction figures\n\nSimilarly, a security consultant, Friday Efih, said in an exclusive chat with this reporter that \u201cthose figures they are calling are figures given to them by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Ltd. (NNPCL),\u201d adding that the \u201cNNPCL themselves are not sincere.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cBefore the divestment of the facility at Oben to Seplat by Shell, they said they were producing about 20,000 barrels per day, and when Seplat took over, in the first three months their production increased with the same facility, the same security challenges, to about 35,000 barrels per day; so, where was the 15,000 going into?\n\n\u201cYou know the DPR officials are those that fill the vessels at the terminals. A vessel is supposed to take 2 million, what they do is that they can give you 2.2 million. At a time, they will stop the metre and just fill the vessel, and then they bargain with the owner of the vessel how much they will get, nobody monitors them.\u201d\n\nEfih also said to curb the menace, oil companies needed to engage the natives from their various host communities.\n\n\u201cThis, he said, \u201cis because they know the terrain and so they would be able to adequately monitor the pipelines.\u201d\n\n\u201cOil theft must thrive because the natives are not being engaged. How can you bring somebody from another region to man the stations? Definitely, they must compromise. But when you engage the natives, you will succeed more than an outsider. In every community I know who and who to engage.\n\n\u201cThese people that you are going to engage are the people that will say, okay, they are stealing 50,000 barrels per day, we can reduce it; the only thing is to reduce the rate. You know criminality can never be wiped out, what you do is curb it.\n\n\u201cThe people you will engage will be your eye. These are the people that will give you information on a daily basis about the flow lines. Once there is a leakage, they are the ones that will report the leakage to the company. When they report to the company, that leakage will be stopped.\n\n\u201cThe natives have to give me a report on a daily basis and you must write your report by 8:00am and by 10:00am, I will get our report. Once I don\u2019t get a report from you at about 12am to 2:00am, it means something different because if you wait for a monthly report, you can never work it out. So, the mode of reporting will be twice a day.\n\n\u201cThe first one will be by 12pm and the second one will be by 3:00am. At least, I know how they operate and anyone that does not report within those specific time frames, it means something is wrong. In their case, they wait for a monthly report which is a summary of all your activities for the month. You can get another report every two weeks. When you are closing the monthly report, it is expected to come in latest on the 28 of the month, while the reports from the natives are expected to come on the 26 of the month.\u201d\n\nAlso, speaking exclusively to Blueprint Weekend, a political economist, Adefolarin Olamilekan, said the remote and immediate causes of the development should be considered.\n\nOlamilekan said the government should be blamed for its failure to see oil theft as a national economic sabotage, as according to him, successive governments had only paid lip service to tackling it head-long.\n\nHe said the presidential task force set up to address the issues of oil theft had failed to produce the desired result.\n\n\u201cHowever, the challenge keeps increasing with more complicated issues of official negligence and culpability.\n\n\u201cOil majors operating in the Niger Delta region for reasons best known to them fail to deploy modern security technologies to safeguard oil pipes or even replace outdated and worn out equipment.\n\n\u201cThe shameful involvement of security personnel as an act of sabotage in reducing oil theft rather escalates it in more complex ways,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said further that to tackle oil theft there was the need for a declaration of war on oil thieves.\n\n\u201cIn this regard there needs to be a legislation that would back the government pronouncement of oil thieves as economic terrorists. Oil companies and NNPC must see the need to replace oil wells and pipelines that are already in obsolete conditions. Meanwhile, the use of technology is critical in securing oil platforms across the Niger Delta and beyond.\n\n\u201cThirdly, the oil host community must stand up against oil thieves. We suggest a government incentive to the community that would not allow oil thieves in their domains.\u201d\n\nGovt functionaries not left out\n\nAlso, speaking with this reporter via telephone, a source who asked not to be named in print for obvious reasons, said the oil theft situation \u201cis the way it is because top functionaries in the government and oil companies are involved.\u201d\n\nThe source said, \u201cThere was a time I went to one of our stations and when I saw what was happening close to the JTF houseboat, I met their commander and complained and he told my boss to stop sending me here. Look at the OPEC report concerning Nigeria\u2019s rig count, the situation is gradually shutting down the economy.\u201d\n\nHe said further that the sophistication involved in oil theft had made it possible to sell crude without having to shutdown production.\n\n\u201cThere is a way you can tap crude without having to disrupt production. The wellheads can be working but the oil is coming out. It\u2019s like your Somo; once there is a leak, it will be working, but water won\u2019t come out. That is the situation we find ourselves right now.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

The \u2018Indigenous People of Biafra\u2019 (IPOB) is not a proscribed organisation in the UK.\n\n\u201cThe inaccurate reporting relates to the 13 April 2022 publication by the UK Government of a revised Country Policy and Information note (CPIN) on separatist groups in SE Nigeria, including the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). CPINs provide country of origin information (COI) and analysis of COI for use by UK Government decision-makers handling particular types of protection and human rights claims.\n\n\u201cAll asylum and human rights claims made in the UK are considered on their individual facts in accordance with our obligations under the UN Refugee Convention and European Convention on Human Rights, taking into account relevant background country information and case law.\n\n\u201cThe CPIN on separatist groups in the South East, including the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), provides a general assessment of risks faced by individuals belonging to those groups. These assessments are based on an analysis of publicly available country information obtained from a wide range of reliable sources including media outlets; UK and other governments; local, national and international organisations; and non-government organisations.\n\n\u201cThis CPIN also acknowledges that the Nigerian government has proscribed IPOB as a terrorist organisation, some members of IPOB have reportedly used violence against the state and members of the public, and advises that persons who have committed human rights abuses must not be granted protection.\u201d\n\n\u2018Confiscate IPOB assets\u2019\n\nIn his Friday statement, Mr Shehu asked the UK to confiscate IPOB assets, shut down their communication channels and sanction the issuance of visas to IPOB\u2019s funders in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cSuch sanctions have played a critical role in combatting other terror groups. And make no mistake: today Africa is a breeding ground for terror, with local and international groups alike gaining strength across the continent, thriving on the economic devastation of the pandemic,\u201d Mr Shehu said.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s intelligence and security forces are the first lines of defence against such groups, including ISIS and Al Quaeda affiliated Boko Haram. We rely on our allies in the West for their support.\n\n\u201cIPOB\u2019s \u2013 and its 50,000 strong paramilitary unit\u2019s \u2013 reign of terror has seen villages butchered, school buses set alight and politicians\u2019 homes bombed. Through their international network of radio and TV stations, they threaten further violence if their demands are not met, while inciting violence and religious and ethnic tension between Nigeria\u2019s Christian and Muslim populations.\n\n\u201cTheir mouthpieces and their wallets are their most effective tools \u2013 it is these assets Nigeria\u2019s allies must target next.

There are certain ones that are over and above me, that are not in my hands to do.\n\n\u201cMy job is to prepare an agreement after conciliation on what you have agreed with your employers, the Federal Ministry of Education, put timelines and monitor them, to see whether the results will be there.\u201d\n\nThe minister believes the strikes in the sector were mainly due to economic reasons and he says with dialogue, the solution would be reached.\n\nThe move is the government\u2019s latest effort to end the strike which was embarked on by ASUU on February 14, 2022.\n\nFollowing the industrial action, students recently protested in Benin City, calling for the reopening of schools.\n\nSeveral high-profile personalities including the First Lady of Lagos State, Ibironke Sanwo-Olu, have also waded into the matter.

I understand how important it is for so many people.\u201d\n\nThe 44-year-old Jean-Pierre, who has a daughter with her partner, a CNN journalist, has already taken to the famed podium in the White House\u2019s James S.

          "title": "Nigerian Airlines to Suspend Operations from May 9 over High Cost of Aviation Fuel",
          "text": "The Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) has served notice of ceasing operations on Monday, May 9, over the high cost of aviation fuel otherwise known as JetA1.\n\nIn a statement co-signed by the leading executives of Air Peace, Max Air, Arik Air, United Nigeria Airlines, Aero Contractors, Ibom Air, Azman Air, Overland Airways and Dana Air, the airlines complained of subsidising their services to customers in the last four months due to the \u201castronomical hike\u201d in the price of aviation fuel from N190 per litre to N700.\n\n\u201cAirlines have engaged the Federal Government, the National Assembly, NNPC and Oil Marketers with the view to bringing the cost of JetA1 down which has currently made the unit cost per seat for a one hour flight in Nigeria today to an average of N120,000,\u201d the AON statement said.\n\n\u201cThe latter cannot be fully passed to passengers who are already experiencing a lot of difficulties,\u201d said the operators who recently had to raise base fares fir a one hour flight to N50,000.\n\nThe operators revealed that aviation fuel is about 40% of an airline\u2019s operating cost globally but the recent hike in prices has shot up Nigerian airlines\u2019 operating cost to about 95%.\n\nRead the Statement in full below:\n\nAIRLINE OPERATORS TO SHUT DOWN OPERATIONS AMIDST HIGH COST OF JETA1, SYMPATHISE WITH PASSENGERS\n\nIt is with a great sense of responsibility and patriotism that the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) have carried on deploying and subsidizing their services to our highly esteemed Nigerian flying public in the last four months despite the steady and astronomical hike in the price of JetA1 and other operating costs.\n\nOvertime, aviation fuel price (JetA1) has risen from N190 per litre to N700 currently. No airline in the world can absorb this kind of sudden shock from such an astronomical rise over a short period. While aviation fuel worldwide is said to cost about 40% of an airline\u2019s operating cost globally, the present hike has shut up Nigeria\u2019s operating cost to about 95%.\n\nIn the face of this, airlines have engaged the Federal Government, the National Assembly, NNPC and Oil Marketers with the view to bringing the cost of JetA1 down which has currently made the unit cost per seat for a one hour flight in Nigeria today to an average of N120,000.\n\nThe latter cannot be fully passed to passengers who are already experiencing a lot of difficulties.\n\nWhile AON appreciates the efforts of the current government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure air transport in Nigeria grows, unfortunately, the cost of aviation fuel has continued to rise unabated thereby creating huge pressure on the sustainability of operations and financial viability of the airlines.\n\nThis is unsustainable and the airlines can no longer absorb the pressure. To this end therefore, the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) hereby wishes to regrettably inform the general public that member airlines will discontinue operations nationwide with effect from Monday May 9, 2022 until further notice.\n\nAON uses this medium to humbly state that we regret any inconveniences this very difficult decision might cause and appeal to travelers to kindly reconsider their travel itinerary and make alternative arrangements.\n\nSigned: Alhaji (Dr.) Abdulmunaf Yunusa Sarina President Jointly signed by: 1.

          "text": "Not comfortable with stereotypes and alleged blackmail anymore, a foremost umbrella body for the north, Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), on Thursday, reacted to the ongoing controversy and constant bashing of the region over zoning within the two leading political parties \u2013 the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) \u2013 and declared that the North would not allow itself to be blackmailed any more, neither was it afraid of the country\u2019s break-up.\n\nThe forum, in a statement in Kaduna, warned that gone were the days, when Northerners felt blackmailed and intimidated by threats of re-structuring, secession, break up or break down of Nigeria.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nAccording to the statement signed by the Secretary General of the forum, Murtala Aliyu, the North is not and had never been opposed to the election of any Nigerian from any part of the country as President, maintaining however, that anything that would be done to achieve that must be in accord with the law and democratic principles.\n\nACF said some Southern politicians were already \u201cgiving their Northern counterparts an ultimatum not to elect anyone from the North as president or we will break up the country!\u201c\n\nIn the statement title, \u201cEnough of the blackmail\u201d, the ACF warned that gone were the days when Northerners felt blackmailed by certain narrative from the South, but that the times had changed.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cA long running political riddle that has continued to frustrate all efforts at achieving \u2018justice, equity and fair-play\u2019 is this: anything and everything in which the North has superiority or advantage or strength is, in the opinion of many Southerners, fake or contrived or speculative and therefore unacceptable.\n\n\u201cThese Southerners contest the facts that the North has 78% of the landmass of Nigeria. They refuse to accept that the North has over 55% of the population of Nigeria. They won\u2019t concede that the voting population in the Northwest region of the North alone is bigger than those of the Southeast & South-south combined.\n\n\u201cThey will never acknowledge the fact that all the beef, all the tomatoes, the onions, the beans, etc. consumed in the South, is produced in the North. They concede nothing. On the contrary, they say the North brings nothing to the table and is entitled to nothing. Not to an equitable share of national revenues, not to a fair share of employment in the public services or to admissions into public schools.\n\n\u201cIf the law says, for example, that election outcomes must be based on one man one vote, they quickly dismiss it as an \u2018imposition\u2019 by Northerners. They contest every fact, every principle including those that formed the basis of our union such as our federation, our system of administration, our\u2077 democracy, etc.\n\n\u201cAnd as we inch up towards the 2023 elections, it comes as no surprise that some Southern politicians are giving their Northern counterparts an ultimatum which roughly translates thus: elect no one from the North as President or we will break up the country!\n\nBut what are the facts?\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s Fourth Democratic Republic is about 22 years old. Of this, Northerners ruled for only ten years. But in-spite of this, some southern politicians are furious, issuing dare warnings against the election of any Northerner as president. It has to be stated clearly and for the avoidance of any doubt that the North is not and has never been opposed to the election of any Nigerian from any part of the country as President.\n\n\u201cAnything that will be done to achieve that, however, must accord with the law and democratic principles. Gone are the days when Northerners felt blackmailed and intimidated by threats of re-structuring, secession, break up or break down of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe North does not seek to dominate any part of the country but will not submit itself to be relegated to serfdom. Those issuing ultimatums are to be pitied, knowing that they know not what they are doing. They own no patent nor monopoly of the art or science of ultimatums. Enough of the blackmail.\u201d",

We just find a way to engage the marketers and the government on the ways to solve this problem. We don\u2019t want to push it to the flying public. Everything will continue normally. There is yet no official statement but the impact on our operations will be too much to bear and that is more reason why airlines want to engage government and marketers to find ways to resolve this. It is a big issue. AON needs to step action and engage the government. We want everybody to fly,\u201d Ezenwa said.\n\nDuring one of the meetings held in March at the instance of the House of Representatives Committee on Aviation, the AON threatened to shut down operations over the non-availability of aviation fuel for their airplanes, as fuel marketers gave reasons why they hiked the pieces.\n\nAON had told the lawmakers then that due to the increase in price of fuel and its unavailability, its members won\u2019t be able to sustain their operations and condemned the marketers for refusing to disclose the actual amount they buy aviation fuel per litre.\n\nCurrently the base fare of 45 minutes to a one-hour flight is N50, 000, which air travellers described as exorbitant, prompting many tavellers to shun the airports and there are indications that any increase to that base fare would further reduce passenger traffic at the airports.",
