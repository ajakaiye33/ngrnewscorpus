          "text": "THE Senator David Mark-led Peoples Democratic Party Committee saddled with the responsibility of finding a lasting solution to the plethora of court cases, as well as conflict of interests between feuding party leaders, is to present its report or an interim report by September 9, The PUNCH has learnt.\n\nIt was gathered in Abuja on Tuesday that party stakeholders who are expected to hold the 93rd National Executive Committee meeting of the party on that date, are hopeful that meaningful progress would have been made by then.\n\nA member of the party leadership, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media on the issue, said, \u201cWe have a lot of confidence in the ability of the Mark committee to deliver on this very important assignment.\n\n\u201cAs you know, the former Senate President is a party loyalist to the core. He is one person who you can give a task and go to sleep and we can confidently say, he is one person whose major interest is the preservation of the PDP brand.\n\n\u201cWe expect at least an interim report from the committee by the time we meet in less than two weeks\u2019 time to decide on the membership of the zoning and convention committee.\u201d\n\nThe PUNCH had reported that the party\u2019s NEC had set up the David Mark panel after its 92nd meeting in Abuja, last Saturday.\n\nIt was mandated to get the feuding party members to withdraw pending litigation from various Courts and subject themselves to the internal conflict resolution mechanism of the PDP.\n\nThis followed three conflicting court orders served on Secondus from different courts.\n\nA Rivers State High Court had issued a restraining order asking Secondus not to parade himself as National Chairman but a High Court in Kebbi State granted an order asking him to immediately resume office, soon after he obeyed both orders, a Cross River State High Court issued an order barring him from presiding over the affairs of the party.\n\nChairman of the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum, Governor Aminu Tambuwal, had in his remarks at the NEC meeting said, \u201cWe have activated all mechanisms that we have in PDP, to resolve all of our issues.\u201d\n\nThis is even as the PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, on Tuesday, expressed confidence that the results of the reconciliation efforts being made by the Senator Bukola Saraki-led National Reconciliation and Strategy Committee will soon become manifest.\n\nSecondus, who spoke through his Media Adviser, Ike Abonyi, in Abuja, explained that the committee\u2019s mandate was not given a timeline because the process of reconciliation often takes time.\n\nHe said, \u201cRemember, the National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus set up the Saraki-committee with a specific assignment to reconcile aggrieved members and work of strategies that will help the party win the 2023 election, this is on course.\n\n\u201cWithout prejudice to the work being done by other committees, the result of the work being done by Saraki and his team will soon become manifest.\n\n\u201cWe expect genuine reconciliation to take place so that the congresses in the remaining nine states will be completed before our national convention.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

I spoke to him around 9.27pm (on Saturday). And I swear by the Holy Qur\u2019an, the subject of our discussion was security. Little I know or little did he know that he had less than eight hours to live.\n\n\u201c This insecurity issue didn\u2019t just come in a day and it is good we understand this because if we don\u2019t understand it, we will continue to prescribe a medicine that will not cure it and the prescription, which is dangerous to me that I have seen so far, is for politicians to attempt to politicise the issue of security.\n\n\u201cSo, courtesy demands that we advise ourselves and look at clearly what are the issues? How do they come about? Then with that information we can prescribe the correct antidote to our problem.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

I am not happy despite the many efforts they have faced more threats from the flood. We are calling on the Federal and State Government to come to the rescue of our people in the Amuzari community.\u201d\n\nAdding his voice, another community leader of Amuzari, Ozo Collins Anoro, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t sleep in the night anytime it rains you hear people crying for help and when you come out you see that their houses have been flooded and properties destroyed.

          "text": ".\n\nDeputy President of the Senate, Ovie Omo-Agege, has said that a sustainable electoral process was only possible if it was founded on an adequate electioneering culture.\n\nRepresented by Dr Daniel Bwala, Special Adviser on Legal and Constitutional Matters, the deputy senate president said this at the public presentation and inaugural meeting of the Electoral Hub, in Abuja, on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to him, no matter how good the clauses were in the electoral laws if the other aspects of the electioneering process were flawed, the electoral process itself will ultimately be flawed.\n\n\u201cWhile there have been many more issues in our electoral history, it seems to me that if we have had adequate and unambiguous clauses, plus adequate advocacy, understanding and the will to comply, we would have had fewer controversies, fewer post-election court cases and generally, a more credible electoral process.\n\n\u201cThis is to say that we need adequate and generally acceptable rules of engagement in the electioneering process.\n\n\u201cI refer to how candidates emerged on party platforms, campaign rally rules and generally political actions toward a fair and credible political participation by voters.\n\n\u201cI am glad, for instance, that the National Assembly is now dealing with the issue of direct primaries\u2019\u2019, Omo-Agege said.\n\nHe added that the obvious preference for direct primaries, for example, would have more than a salutary effect on the challenges of dealing with select delegates at primaries, which had been a sore point in our electioneering process, citing the ongoing electoral reform process, therefore, as a responsibility for all.\n\nThe deputy senate president said that there was a need to join hands to work out an electoral system that would not only agree with global best practices but would make Nigeria a stronger nation.\n\nMrs May Agbamuche-Mbu, National Commissioner, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), said that the launch of the forum would enrich knowledge and enhance understanding of the electoral process in Nigeria as well as serve as a reference point for both political parties and voters.\n\nAgbamuche-Mbu assured Nigerians that the commission would continue to improve on its processes for more transparent, credible elections, urging all eligible voters to utilise the Continuous Voter Registration to get voter cards, transfer their cards, among others.\n\n\u201cNine weeks into the exercise, we have witnessed 2,485,770 online registrants and 3,325,741 in total. These figures are encouraging and of the online registrants 2,160,292 are youths between ages 18 to 34,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nShe added that recently, INEC expanded polling units by creating additional 57,023 units across the country, bringing the total units to 176,996, with the aim of bringing the voting process closer to the people.\n\nProf. Adebayo Olukoshi, Chairman, The Electoral Forum and Professor, Wits School of Governance, in South Africa, commended the forum for the initiative to gather veterans with knowledgeable insights on the electoral process.\n\nOlukoshi said that the world over it was believed that interacting with such a class of people would help in improving the quality of governance, elections and democracy.\n\nHe said that issues of electoral integrity had continued to plague Nigeria, so, there was a need to commit to working at ensuring electoral integrity, so that citizens could reap the dividends of democracy.\n\nMs Princess Hamman-Obels, Director, IRIAD, The Electoral Hub, said that the Hub conceptualised the Electoral Forum as a way to pool resource persons from electoral management bodies together with other electoral stakeholders.\n\nThis, Hamman-Obels said, was to find solutions to the unique problems facing the electoral process in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWith the support of OSIWA, the forum has been established under the chairmanship of Prof. Adebayo Olukoshi, and other high-calibre practitioners.\n\n\u201cWe believe that by facilitating discussions among different stakeholders, we hope to deepen understanding of the electoral process in Nigeria, as well as provide solutions to improve electoral integrity and credibility,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nHamman-Obels said that the aim of the forum was to facilitate systematic electoral reforms, promote evidence-based law-making, policy and advocacy on elections in Nigeria.\n\nShe added that another objective of the forum was also to advance strategies to improve the capacities and credibility of electoral management bodies in Nigeria.\n\nToday\u2019s public launch and inaugural meeting\u2019s objective was to formally launch the forum, determine its operations, produce an understanding of members and review the Electoral Amendment bill, she said.\n\nMs Catherine Angai, Programme Coordinator, Democracy and Accountability, OSIWA, said that the support to Electoral Hub spoke to OSIWA\u2019s priority for evidence-based electoral reforms.\n\nAngai added that it targeted those factors that impacted electoral integrity, particularly the administrative barriers, and that the project had a research component that would critically analyse Nigeria\u2019s election management system.\n\nShe said that the research would create a compelling evidence-based narrative that presented a clear picture of the strengths and limitations of electoral bodies.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the project fills a major knowledge gap and provides an expose into the structural issues that have impacted on the work of electoral management bodies over the years,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has extolled the administration of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State on his commitment to create employment opportunities.\n\nHURIWA said it was pleased with a recent statement from the state government concerning Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) development and Director General, Enugu SMEs Centre; Hon. Arinze Chilo-Offiah, who announced the decision to train more 500 youths in various fields of innovative endeavour in addition to the 500 already trained through the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) Centre.\n\nHURIWA, in a statement signed by its National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onubiko, and Media Affairs Director, Zainab Yusuf, said that Enugu State is in line to have well-skilled techies to support startups and Tech companies in the country and the continent as a whole.\n\n\u201cThis was borne out of the conviction that tech is the future, and for Enugu to thrive, it had to have a future in tech. The presence of tech experts in Enugu can also ensure a place for tech giants like Google and Microsoft to operate in the state. Enugu Tech has graduated over 500 persons, with an additional 500 yet to be trained,\u201d HURIWA observed.\n\nAlso, following the recent release of the Global StartupBlink Ecosystem Index Report of 2021, HURIWA revealed that there has been a whirlwind of multiple emotions; surprise and happiness.\n\n\u201cBut the common question on everybody\u2019s lips is \u2018how\u2019? With the rise of Nigeria\u2019s ranking fueled by its massive consumer market and more than 500 active startups, one of the largest in Africa, very few expected that Enugu will make a huge contribution to this. More surprising is Enugu\u2019s rank as the first Southeastern Nigeria state to make the list and the 978th globally.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt then that Gov. Ugwuanyi has etched his name on the sands of time, as a Governor whose vision has sighted Enugu state as a bride to be courted by every South-east man or woman for many generations to come and is working assiduously to consummate this reality,\u201d HURIWA said.\n\nThe group noted that the mission of Governor Ugwuanyi\u2019s administration is to put Enugu on the global map and led the governor through the SMEs centre.\n\n\u201cTherefore, there is no gainsaying the fact that Enugu under the dispensation of genuine leadership of a man celebrated with the epaulet of \u2018Gburugburu\u2019 by his people offers a good example of how a combination of sustained investment in nurturing small scale enterprises and removing all stifling bureaucratic structures can launch a state\u2019s economy onto a growth trajectory,\u201d it said.\n\nFurthermore, HURIWA averred that the Enugu Tech is a testament that job creation is evidently the prime commitment of Gov. Ugwuanyi.\n\nContinuing, HURIWA, informed that one of the takeaways from this gesture is that Governor Ifeanyi\u2019s focus is to define human capital as a sector that should be funded and invested in, just as it is done in the agricultural sector, manufacturing, the creative industries and all.\n\nHURIWA\u2019s belief is that the creation of the SMEs centre by the Ugwanyi led administration of Enugu state was prompted by the dire prognosis that most small businesses in the local communities die before their fifth anniversary.\n\n\u201cThe cost of this training, alongside others, was also subsidised to N50,000 from N250,000 with the funding provided by the Enugu SME Center to participants through the Human Capital Development Loan; one of the many programs under the Human Capital Development Loan Initiative.\n\n\u201cOf course, the vision of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, which is to facilitate easier access to resources required by entrepreneurs, SMEs and players in that environment to achieve sustainable development in Enugu State is gradually metamorphosing into reality.\n\n\u201cWith the number of programs the SMEs Centre has spearheaded in Enugu, the successes and development in Enugu have taken a positive turn, as the State Government successfully registered Business Names for over 6,000 Startups, a number which is key to the recent global recognition.\n\nFurthermore, HURIWA pointed out that unlike the trend whereby virtually all politicians seeking the office of governor voiced their commitment to similarly lofty goals, Governor Ugwuanyi\u2019s empowerment programs together with NBC\u2019s job analysis across states has shown that his pledge was no typical campaign rhetoric.\n\nAdditionally, the rights group expressed gratification in the sense that the Governor did not succumb to the temptation of using the civil service as a job- dispensing point.\n\nThe group noted that since 2015 when the Ugwuanyi administration began, Enugu has benefited largely from. insightful policies of the Governor which provide the state with a sound financial base.",

          "title": "Unlawful arrest: Are law enforcement agents beyond redemption?",
          "text": "Despite legal provisions (both local and international) for the protection of citizens\u2019 fundamental rights, law enforcement agents/agencies have persistently violated same, notwithstanding the many instances of courts\u2019 intervention and condemnation by lawyers. ERIC IKHILAE , in this report, presents some of such cases.\n\nThe Constitution is replete with provisions intended to protect citizens\u2019 fundamental rights. An entire chapter, Chapter Four, exists for this purpose. This is in addition to the various international instruments on rights protection, subscribed to by the country.\n\nThe Judiciary also has measures to ensure that cases of rights violation are promptly addressed, one of which is the Fundamental Rights (Enforcement Procedure) Rules 2009.\n\nDespite these, security agents/agencies routinely violate Nigerians\u2019 rights with impunity. Although the nation professes democracy, the uninspiring attitude of the federal and many state administrations to the protection of citizens\u2019 rights, arguably, emboldens lawless law enforcement agents/agencies.\n\nThis much was affirmed by the Court of Appeal (Abuja) when it condemned the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)\u2019s actions in the case involving a businessman, Babatunde Morakinyo.\n\nThe Morakinyo case\n\nThe EFCC arrested Morakinyo and, on March 19, 2020, arraigned him before Justice Ahmed Mohammed of the Federal High Court, Abuja on money laundering-related charges. The agency claimed that Morakinyo used his firms to distribute about N9,016,385,467.01 taken from the Kwara State Government\u2019s coffers between 2009 and 2016 to former officials of the state.\n\nThe defendant was granted bail, which he perfected, following which the judge endorsed a warrant for his release. Before he could exit the court premises, officials of the EFCC arrested and detained him from March 19, 2020, to April 4, 2020.\n\nThe EFCC only released him after the office of the Attorney-General Federation intervened, following a complaint by Morakinyo\u2019s lawyer.\n\nRead Also: Indonesia arbitration centre appoints Adenipekun advisory board member\n\nBelieving that his rights had been violated, Morakinyo filed a fundamental rights enforcement suit, marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/437/2020 to challenge his arrest on the court\u2019s premises and detention between March 19 and April 4, 2020, at the EFCC\u2019s facility in Jabi, Abuja.\n\nThe case was heard by Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, who, in his judgment on March 1, 2021, declared the EFCC\u2019s actions as unlawful and a breach of Morakinyo\u2019s rights to personal liberty and dignity.\n\nJustice Ekwo, condemning the decision of the EFCC to arrest the applicant within the premises of the court, noted that such an act was not only a disrespect for the court but also unlawful because no law allows such practice.\n\nHe added that by arresting Morakinyo in court, EFCC officials \u201cdemonstrated apparent disregard for the Judiciary as an arm of government and ruptured its integrity.\u201d\n\nThe judge added: \u201cThe act is an aberration of the tenets of the democracy we profess to practise. In a democracy, no arm of government is to be made to appear as subjugated to the other. Unconstitutional and illegal courthouse arrest is condemnable and punishable. And, the courthouse arrest of the applicant by the respondent is no less so.\u201d\n\nWhen can EFCC re-arrest a person on bail?\n\nWhile rejecting EFCC\u2019s claim that it re-arrested Morakinyo preparatory to his arraignment at the Lagos division of the Federal High Court on a separate charge, Justice Ekwo said the EFCC could only re-arrest an individual, under any reason, after obtaining an order of a court.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe further said: \u201cWhere the court has granted bail to a person and the person has met the terms of bail, and release warrant has been issued to him, but he is facing arraignment in another court, he need not be re-arrested.\n\n\u201cHe can be served the subsequent charge and given the opportunity to appear in court on the date fixed for his arraignment. The assumption that such a person is likely not to appear in court for the other trial is unfounded as his particulars of bail are in the custody of the court already.\n\n\u201cThe court, before which he is appearing next, has the discretion to grant him bail upon the previous terms or modify same. He is aware that it is in his interest to appear in court to answer the allegations against him.\n\n\u201cTherefore, there is no valid foundation for the subsequent arrest of the applicant on the excuse of a pending charge in Lagos when he had been granted bail by a court of coordinate jurisdiction in Abuja upon arraignment for another charge,\u201d the judge said.\n\nJustice Ekwo proceeded to award N50million in damages against the EFCC \u201cfor abusing its statutory powers and arbitrarily trampling on the fundamental rights of the applicant.\u201d He equally ordered the EFCC to publish a public apology to Morakinyo in two national dailies within 14 days.\n\nThe EFCC appealed the decision, and in a judgment on August 25, 2021, a three-member panel of the Court of Appeal, Abuja upheld Justice Ekwo\u2019s decision and found, among others, that the EFCC abused its power in an \u201coppressive, repressive and condemnable\u201d manner in its handling of the Morakinyo\u2019s case.\n\nJustice Hussein Mukhtar, in the lead judgment, said that the lower court decision was unambiguous and without misdirection or error, adding that the re-arrest of the respondent was wilful, unlawful and must be condemned.\n\nJustice Muktar added that the fundamental rights of Nigerian citizens to freedom of liberty and human dignity, guaranteed under Section 35(6), was unassailable and could not be ignored as done by EFCC in its handling of Morakinyo\u2019s case.\n\nHe, however, reduced to N10 million, the N50 million damages awarded against the EFCC on the ground that the fine was excessive.\n\nRickey Tarfa\u2019s arrest\n\nThe Morakinyo case is not the first of such cases involving the EFCC. In February 2016, its officials arrested a senior lawyer, Rickey Tarfa (SAN), within the premises of the Lagos State High Court, Ikeja for allegedly obstructing the re-arrest of his clients \u2013 Ghanhoue Sourous Nazaire and Zenou Modeste, both Beninoise nationals, who were already being tried for alleged forgery of their company resolution and Form CA7.\n\nTarfa was only released three days after, following the intervention of the leadership of the Nigerian Bar Association.\n\nCourts as hallowed ground\n\nAs held by the courts in the case of Morakinyo, the NBA and lawyers have on many occasions condemned the practice by security agencies of arresting suspects on court premises.\n\nA former Chairman of the NBA (Ikeja branch), Martins Ogunleye, noted that it is an aberration for anybody to be arrested within the premises of a court. In reference to the Tarfa\u2019s case, he said: \u201cThe matter is made even more serious when the person arrested is a lawyer practising his trade within the premises of the court.\n\n\u201cThere are certain places where you do not arrest a man, right from Victorian times. You don\u2019t arrest a man within the precincts of a court or church. These places are hallowed places, never to be desecrated.\u201d\n\nAnother lawyer, Akinlolu Kehinde (SAN), said: \u201cIt is wrong for any law enforcement agency to arrest anybody within the precinct of the court. You don\u2019t arrest anybody within the precinct of the court; you allow the person to get out of the court premises before you arrest him, or before you start questioning him.\n\n\u201cThis is because the courtroom, the precinct of the court, is hallowed ground. That must be emphasised, it is hallowed ground.\u201d\n\nOther shades of rights violation by law enforcement agents\n\nArrest before investigation\n\nIncidents of rights violation by law enforcement agents/agencies are not limited to arrest on court premises. There is also the practice where citizens are arrested and detained before being investigated for the offence alleged. As against the practice in civilised climes where investigation precedes arrest and detention, the reverse is mostly the case in the country.\n\nWhen law enforcement agents arrest before fishing for evidence, suspects end up spending days, months or even years in custody without trial. In most cases, to justify their action, such law enforcement agencies race before a magistrate who in most cases lacks the jurisdiction to try the offence alleged) for a remand warrant, under a holding charge arrangement.\n\nGloria Okolie\n\nA recent example is the arrest and continued detention of 21-year-old Gloria Okolie by the police since June 17, 2021, on the allegation that she is in a relationship with some members of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), an arm of the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nSince her arrest, the police have been unable to charge her to court. They claimed to be investigating her involvement with both groups.\n\nYoruba nation agitators\n\nThere is also the case of the 12 associates of the Yoruba nation advocate, Sunday Adeyemo (Sunday Igboho), who were arrested during the July 1, 2021 raid on his Ibadan home by a team of military personnel, led by operatives of the State Security Service (SSS).\n\nTo date, the 12 are still being held in the custody of the SSS without being charged before any court. During a hearing in the fundamental rights enforcement suit by the detainees, SSS lawyer Idowu Awo claimed his client was still investigating some of the detainees.\n\nConsequences of arrest before investigation\n\nExperts are of the view that apart from constituting an abuse of power and rights violation, the practice of arresting and detaining a suspect before investigation has the potential to compel such a detainee to incriminate him/herself if lured with the promise of freedom.\n\nThe practice also constitutes a clog in the wheel of prompt administration of justice in a criminal trial, during which such detainee insists on a trial-within-trial to prove that he/she was compelled to provide a so-called confessional statement.\n\nAccording to the Executive Secretary of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Tony Ojukwu, such unprofessional conduct undoubtedly results in further violation of the rights of such a detainee.\n\nWith particular reference to Miss Okolie\u2019s case, Ojukwu argued that her continued detention, without being taken before a court of competent jurisdiction, violates her rights to freedom of movement and liberty among several others, with impunity \u201cby the very personnel charged with the responsibility of protecting the lives and property of citizens.\u201d\n\nOjukwu noted there was no official state policy in the country that approved the act of torture, inhuman and degrading treatment, but regretted that some adamant law enforcement officers act according to their wicked whims and caprices to engage in dishonourable conduct of debasing and subjecting their fellow human beings to the lowest status that cannot be equated to the treatment of beasts and other lower animals.\n\nOjukwu added that such practice was inconsistent with the provisions of the 1999 Constitution, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, (ICCPR), International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and other relevant Bills of Rights, to which Nigeria is a party.\n\nFailure to honour court orders for release of detainee\n\nIt is equally becoming a norm for law enforcement agencies to spurn orders of courts either granting bail to detainees or for their release. Prominent cases include that of the former National Security Adviser (NSA), Mohammed Sambo Dasuki, who despite an order of an international court \u2013 the Community Court of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) \u2013 for his release, was kept in the custody of the SSS until the government chose to release him on its own volition. There was also the case of the leader of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), Ibrahim El-Zakzaky and his wife, Zeenat.\n\nThere is also the case of the 12 associates of Igboho \u2013 Abdulateef Onaolapo, Tajudeen Erinoye, Diekola Jubril, Ayobami Donald, Uthman Adelabu, Oluwafemi Kunle, Raji Kazeem, Bamidele Sunday, Amudat Babatunde (AKA Lady K), Okoyemi Tajudeen, Abideen Shittu and Jamiu Oyetunji.\n\nIn a ruling on August 4, 2021, Justice Obiora Egwuatu of the Federal High Court, Abuja upheld their claim of unjust incarceration and admitted them to conditional bail. The 12 detainees subsequently perfected their bail, following which Justice Egwuatu ordered their release by endorsing their release warrant. But to date, the SSS has failed to let the detainees go.\n\nPractice unacceptable\n\nThis practice by law enforcement agencies has been condemned by many, including lawyers, whose clients are at the receiving end. Former NBA President, Joseph Daudu (SAN) and Femi Falana (SAN) who led the legal teams for Dasuki and El-Zakzaky frowned at the refusal of the SSS to obey court orders for their client\u2019s release.\n\nExpressing a similar view last week, lawyer to the 12 associates of Igboho, Pelumi Olajengbesi threatened to initiate contempt proceedings against the Director-General of the SSS for failing to release his clients.\n\nOlajengbesi said: \u201cRegrettably and indeed unacceptably, while no charges, in full or tentatively, have been preferred against all the 12 detainees, the SSS has failed and refused to honour an order of court which granted bail to, and ordered the release of all 12 detainees upon the perfection of the terms of their bail, which have now been fully satisfied and duly communicated to the SSS.\n\n\u201cThe refusal of the SSS to honour a clear order of court, though habitual, is not only worrisome and unacceptable, but is an affront on the authority of the court and our entire judicial system. Such blatant disregard for, and contemptuous, spiteful and insolent disrespect of an order of court if allowed to fester would undermine the very integrity of the court and breed even newer levels of rascality by state agents.\n\n\u201cIt would also amount to surrendering the freedom and rights of all the 12 detainees to the whims and caprices of an agency that has gone rogue and thrive in wilful disobedience of court orders.\u201d\n\nSubstitutional arrest\n\nThere is also the practice where law enforcement agents/agencies engage in substitutional arrest, also known as the arrest of a person in lieu of the actual suspect. There have been cases where relatives or friends have been arrested by law enforcement agents because they could not apprehend the actual alleged offender.\n\nLaw enforcement agents have always rationalised this act by arguing that when they arrest an offender\u2019s relative, particularly a father or mother, such a suspect would have no option but to surrender.\n\nAlthough outlawed, particularly with the provisions of sections 4 and 7 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law of Lagos State (ACJL) 2011 and the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) 2015, the unlawful practice is still rife.\n\nSection 4 of the ACJL of Lagos provides that: \u201cNo person shall be arrested in lieu of any other person,\u201d while Section 7 of the ACJA states: \u201cA person shall not be arrested in place of a suspect.\u201d\n\nJudicial condemnation of such practice\n\nCourts have on many occasions declared the practice as unlawful. In the popular case of ACB V. Okonkwo, where Mrs Mary Okonkwo was arrested, detained and her property confiscated by the police for an alleged infraction by her son, the Court of Appeal in Enugu came down hard on the police for engaging in such conduct.\n\nA three-man panel of the appellate court, comprising Justices Akintola Ejiwumi, Niki Tobi and Eugene Ubaezonu, in a judgment on July 25, 1996, was unanimous in dismissing the appeal marked: CA/E/140/95, by the now-defunct African Continental Bank (ACB). The bank\u2019s appeal was against a judgment of the Enugu State High Court in a fundamental rights enforcement suit by Mrs Okonkwo, marked: E/MISC./29M/94.\n\nJustice Tobi (now late) said: \u201cThere is no law that says that the sin of the son be visited on the mother simply because of that relationship. To do that without reason will be inimical to justice. In the instant case, it was undoubtedly an invasion of the first respondent\u2019s (Mrs Okonkwo\u2019s) right for the appellant to cause her property to be detained when it was not shown that she was involved in the alleged crime committed by her son who was an employee of the appellant.\u201d\n\nHow can the unlawful practices be curbed?\n\nExperts have suggested ways to curb these unlawful practices, including continued education of law enforcement agents on the various legal provisions on citizens\u2019 rights and how they could effectively operate within the limit of the law.\n\nOjukwu noted this when he said his agency, \u201cas a national institution, saddled with the responsibilities of promotion, protection and enforcement of rights of citizens and foreigners resident in Nigeria, we have not missed any available opportunity to educate and train police personnel and indeed other law enforcement agents on human rights issues, the NHRC Act (as amended) as well as other national, regional and international human rights instruments to which Nigeria is a signatory.\u201d\n\nFalana suggested a review of the current practice where damages from cases of rights violation are awarded by courts against institutions in which such offending law enforcement agent operates. He suggested that such costs or awards should be made personal on the offending agent.\n\nHe said: \u201cArresting people in lieu of criminal suspects has been prohibited, but still goes on every day \u2026 why is the Nigeria Police Force paying damages for the responsibilities and negligence of its officers?\n\n\u201cI have been pleading with the human rights community; if your client is detained, don\u2019t sue the police alone, sue the police officer involved and ask for specific damages against him.\n\n\u201cIf, by the time the judgment is delivered, he has retired, let them take part of his pension; that will serve as a lesson for people. But, right now, they detain illegally, some get killed, the officers involved get promoted, retire with their benefits. For me, that should not be allowed.\u201d",

          "text": "From Fred Ezeh, Abuja\n\nJoint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has directed tertiary institutions to independently decide on candidates cut-off marks for admission for the 2021/2022 academic calendar.\n\nJAMB Registrar, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, said the decision was taken at the 2021 policy meeting to herald the commencement of the 2021 admission exercises.\n\nThe meeting had in attendance heads of tertiary institutions who discussed admission related issues.\n\nHe said October 29 deadline had been set for the closure of amendments for 2021 admissions. He said the meeting also approved that every institution was at liberty to admit candidates based on its own minimum score.\n\nIt was however learnt that the decision to allow universities, polytechnics and colleges of education adopt their cut-off marks was reached due to the inability to arrive at a particular figure, as was the case some years ago, where by voice vote, the institutions arrived at a particular figure as cut-off mark for admission.\n\nOloyede who spoke on the coutcome of the meeting said some universities as University of Maiduguri proposed 150 minimum cut-off mark; Usman Dan Fodio University Sokoto, 140; Pan Atlantic University, 210; University of Lagos, 200; Lagos State University, 190; Covenant University, 190 and Bayero University Kano, 180.\n\nHe said those at the meeting resolved to allow the ministry to decide as they could not agree on the December 31, 2021 deadline for public institutions and January 31, 2022, for private institutions.\n\nOloyede said stakeholders also adopted the 2021 admission guidelines, which provided that all applications for part-time or full-time programmes for degree, NCE, OND, and others must be posted only through JAMB. He said candidate\u2019s credentials must be uploaded on Central Admissions Processing System (CAPS) and recommended by the institution, while JAMB approves and the candidate accepts the offer of admission.\n\n\u201cIf any candidate fail to accept an offer, the institution is at liberty to change the candidate after informing JAMB,\u201d he said.\n\nOloyede said that for the 2021/2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), the board is introducing two new subjects, computer studies, and physical and health education, bringing total subjects undertaken in Nigeria to 25.\n\nThe stakeholders also exempted prison inmates, visually impaired and foreign candidates from sitting for post-UTME exercise.\n\nSpeaking on the 2020 admissions, Oloyede said out of the 956,809 admission spaces in 962 higher education institutions in the country, about 600,000 have so far been admitted.\n\nOloyede said private universities in the country were only able to admit 36,381 candidates out of the 120,938 spaces available to them. He said there were many admission spaces that have not been filled up in several courses due to lack of qualified candidates,\n\nDeclaring the policy meeting open, Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, commended JAMB for introducing use of National Identification Number (NIN) in the registration process for UTME.\n\nRepresented by Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Education, Sonny Echono, the minister said the use of NIN drastically reduced examination malpractices in the 2021 UTME, adding that the West African Examination Council (WAEC) will also follow similar path by adopting mandatory use of NIN.\n\nHe expressed concerns that the government\u2019s directive that all admissions should be done through JAMB\u2019s CAPS is being violated.\n\nHe directed JAMB to furnish government with the list of affected institutions for necessary punishments.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "Katsina Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has described the recent High Court judgment in Rivers State on Value Added Tax (VAT) as capable of causing chaos across states of the federation vowing \u201cwe will resist its implementation.\u201d\n\nThe governor also campaigned for the review of the current revenue sharing formula which he described as unfair and unjust as it gave more resources to the Federal Government to the detriment of the states and local governments.\n\nMasari spoke yesterday when a delegation from the Revenue Mobilisation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) paid him a sensitisation visit at Government House, Katsina.\n\n\u201cWe have heard the judgment of the state High Court in Rivers and we have appealed against that judgment. It means people will begin to pay double VAT because if you pay VAT in Kano, at the point of departure it means when you come to Katsina you pay another VAT.\n\n\u201cIf you pay VAT in Lagos, it means you also pay VAT all along the way until you reach your destination. It will bring a lot of burden on the people. That judgment is not fair. It is other parts of the country that make Lagos and Rivers states what they are. We have to work together as a nation and come up with something that will work for all of us.\u201d\n\nMasari said there was no justification for allocating over 50 per cent to the Federal Government when in reality the people who deserve such funds are in the states and local government areas.\n\n\u201cFrom 1999 to date, we have not been able to come up with a new revenue allocation formula despite constitutional provisions to do so. The formula has become stagnant. It is lopsided, it puts more resources at the centre and less resources for states and local governments. The burden and responsibilities of daily needs are at states and local government levels. The current formula has given the Federal government over 50 per cent while states and Local Governments share less than 40 per cent.\n\n\u201cThis where the people are, this is where the problems are. This formula is stale, unfair, unjust and there has to be a change to address realities of today and prepare us for tomorrow.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "The President, who spoke Tuesday at the launch of the Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme at the State House, Abuja, listed some of the key drivers of economic growth and diversification in the second quarter to include telecommunications, transportation, electricity, agriculture and manufacturing.\n\nHe said: \u201cTuesday, 22nd June, 2021, I set-up the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy (NPRGS) steering committee to coordinate our work to fulfil my promise to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in ten years. This is building on the positive results from the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan and the targeted response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic with the Economic Sustainability Plan.\n\n\u201cThese efforts have yielded results with Nigeria recording its biggest economic growth in six years with a GDP growth of 5 per cent in the second quarter of 2021. The sectors that drove this growth are trade, telecommunications, transportation, electricity, agriculture and manufacturing. Each of these sectors showed significant improvement and thus created more jobs for our populace.\n\n\u201cAn important part of our policies and strategies is the focus on employment and creating opportunities for our people. When this government was elected in 2015, we committed to increasing job opportunities for Nigerians and as part of our social investments programme we recruited 500,000 graduates into our N-power programme\u201d.\n\nPresident Buhari added that he had in 2019 directed that the number of graduates be increased to one million.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThese graduates are recruited to work in agricultural, health and education institutions across the country. The N-power programme also has a non-graduate component that provides skills to tens of thousands of Nigerians in areas such as technology, masonry, auto repairs, and carpentry.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that about two million people join our labour force annually. We continue to work with our partners to provide more opportunities to create jobs and the Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme in partnership with the United Nation\u2019s Development Programme being one of such opportunities\u201d.\n\nHe stressed that the jubilee programme will provide a pathway for young Nigerians to gain work experience in top tier organisations, gaining relevant skills and building the right networks for the future in various sectors including information and communications technology, financial services, trade, manufacturing, agriculture and agro-processing.\n\n\u201cOther sectors include mining, telecommunications, creative industries and technology, education, health, research and development, and public sector institutions. We believe that building the right skills and experiences across these sectors are important to sustain the economic growth we are experiencing.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe said the programme will build on other efforts of the government to support young Nigerians such as the N75 billion youth fund in the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, which was created to support young Nigerians in business or with business ideas, with N25 billion released annually for three years.\n\n\u201cThe Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP) was our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have set-up a survival fund which has helped many businesses stay afloat in the worst economic periods of the last 5 years, more than one million Nigerians have benefitted from the fund, with more than 500,000 benefitting from the MSMEs Payroll support track, approximately 270,000 beneficiaries of the artisan support track, and about 50,000 beneficiaries of the MSME grant scheme,\u2019\u2019 the President added.\n\nAccording to him, the International Labour Organisation estimated equivalent of an unprecedented 255 million jobs being lost around the world as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe noted that the Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme, being a fully paid post-NYSC work placement programme would provide an opportunity for mentors who were already engaged in various industries, gained relevant experience and built capacity over the years to provide mentorship and support for young Nigerians.\n\nHe added: \u201cBeyond the skills and work experience, we will be building a new culture of mentorship and guidance that can chart a new course for skills development and work experience in our country.\n\n\u201cWe believe that as this programme creates new opportunities for 20,000 recent graduates annually, the beneficiaries will use the opportunities presented to them and maximize their 12 months of engagement\u201d\n\nThe President encouraged all eligible Nigerians to apply for the jubilee programme, while urging private sector organizations to join by providing work placement opportunities, mentors and funding.\n\n\u201cI would like to say thank you to the United Nations Development Programme and the European Union for their support on this vital initiative. And I hereby declare the program open,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo said the government remains appreciative of the role of private sector in transforming economies by creating employment and employment opportunities and investments.\n\nAccording to him, start-ups, largely driven by young Nigerians, attracted 170 million dollars in the past year, which was the highest on the African continent, explaining that the Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme was to celebrate the nation\u2019s 60th anniversary.\n\nAdebayo noted the role of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo in driving the initiative to fruition and support of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).\n\nThe Resident Representative of UNDP, Mohammed Yahya assured that the UN will continually support Nigeria to move human potentials across the country to capacities and skills that will place the country on a better pedestal.\n\n\u201cEach day, young Nigerians continue to break barriers with their capacity and ingenuity,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cYoung Nigerians have produced outstanding innovations. There is no shortage of talents in Nigeria.\u2019\u2019",

          "title": "Digital Currency Gains Traction as CBN Appoints Technical Partner",
          "text": "\u2022IMF urges caution on adoption of cryptocurrency as national currency\n\nNdubuisi Francis and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) yesterday announced the formal engagement of global fintech company, Bitt Inc., as technical partner for its proposed digital currency, also known as e-Naira. CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, disclosed this in Abuja.\n\nBut the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cautioned that countries seeking to adopt the digital currency should be wary of its disadvantages.\n\nEmefiele said the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) would bring about increased cross-border trade, accelerate financial inclusion, and lead to cheaper and faster remittance inflow. He said the digital money, also known as cryptocurrency, would lead to easier targeted social interventions, as well as improvement in monetary policy effectiveness, payment systems efficiency, and tax collection.\n\nCBN\u2019s Director, Corporate Communications Department, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, explained, in a statement, that the e-Naira project had been a long and thorough process for the apex bank following its resolve in 2017 to digitise the local currency after extensive research and exploration.\n\nNwanisobi said CBN\u2019s decision was in line with an unmistakable global trend in which over 85 per cent of central banks were considering adopting digital currencies in their countries.\n\nThe CBN pointed out that the selection of Bitt Inc. from among highly competitive bidders was based on the company\u2019s technical competence, efficiency, platform security, interoperability, and implementation experience.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cIn choosing Bitt Inc. the CBN will rely on the company\u2019s tested and proven digital currency experience, which is already in circulation in several Eastern Caribbean countries.\n\n\u201cBitt Inc. was key to the development and successful launch of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) pilot of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) in April 2021.\u201d\n\nEmefiele had recently hinted that a national digital currency would be launched in October. The apex bank had also said the digital currency would be treated as a critical national infrastructure to protect it from operational and cyber-security risks.\n\nFurther clarifying the e-Naira project, the CBN governor had said, \u201cYou have some naira in your account and you chose to convert part of your naira into a digital wallet by way of a digital currency. We will support that.\n\n\u201cIf, for instance, you have N10 million in your account. Of course, when this starts, the CBN will move some of the balances of banks with CBN to those banks in digital currency.\n\n\u201cSo you go to your bank, you have N10 million and you want to move N2 million out of your N10 million into a digital currency.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll debit your account and move it to your wallet of N2 million digital currency, which you can spend across countries.\u201d\n\nEmefiele added, \u201cSo we think that this is a noble idea and we are not the first\u2026many other central banks are at advanced stages of revealing their own digital currency.\n\n\u201cOur own digital currency, which is tagged e-Naira, will certainly come into operation, by the special grace of God, by October and we are working very hard for this.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cWe believe that transactions will be cheaper and more efficient, as there will be less to complete.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian economy, just like the rest of the world, is going digital and cash cannot play in that space. Therefore, e-Naira, which will represent the digital equivalent of cash, will be used as the fiat currency to effect transactions.\n\n\u201cAnd in terms of financial inclusion, we believe that with over 30 per cent of bankable adults still outside the financial system, the ability to have offline payment through our e-Naira initiative will bring most of them into the formal financial sector.\u201d\n\nAccording to him,\u201d The use of cash is declining everywhere in the world, just as in Nigeria and with the advent of digital commerce, which is booming in the country, more and more people are adopting the use of electronic money to facilitate digital commerce.\n\n\u201cSo our e-Naira is a digital representation of cash, which means as a fiat currency, it is a fiat currency that will be just as acceptable as the physical or analogue naira.\n\n\u201cWe recognise the need for wide stakeholder engagement and education to be able to create awareness for the use of e-Naira as alternative to cash to further drive towards a cashless society.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, just like the CBN had warned previously, IMF sued for caution by countries seeking to use crypto-assets as their national currency. The multilateral institution reiterated that the demerits of adopting crypto-assets as national currency outweighed its merits.\n\nThe Washington-based institution gave the advice in a blog post, titled: \u201cCrypto-assets as National Currency? A Step Too Far.\u201d It acknowledged that the new digital forms of money had the potential to provide cheaper and faster payments, enhance financial inclusion, improve resilience and competition among payment providers, and facilitate cross-border transfers.\n\nHowever, IMF stated that the potential benefits were not a straightforward process, as it required significant investment as well as difficult policy choices, such as clarifying the role of the public and private sectors in providing and regulating digital forms of money.\n\nIt observed that some countries might be tempted by a shortcut -adopting crypto-assets as national currencies, adding, \u201cmany are indeed secure, easy to access, and cheap to transact.\u201d\n\nThe IMF stated, \u201cWe believe, however, that in most cases, risks and costs outweigh potential benefits. Crypto-assets are privately issued tokens based on cryptographic techniques and denominated in their own unit of account.\n\n\u201cTheir value can be extremely volatile. Bitcoin, for instance, reached a peak of $65,000 in April and crashed to less than half that value two months later.\n\n\u201cAnd yet, Bitcoin lives on. For some, it is an opportunity to transact anonymously\u2014for good or bad. For others, it is a means to diversify portfolios and hold a speculative asset that can bring riches but also significant losses.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The chat ended a few minutes ago. The friendly chat was held in strict compliance with the provisions of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Defence Intelligence Agency is the primary military intelligence agency of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nFollowing the declaration by the DIA that Olawunmi was wanted, a top source had said, \u201cThe agency has declared retired Navy Commodore Kunle Olawunmi wanted for spilling the beans over Boko Haram sponsors in the Buhari regime. They asked him to come with his international passport on Tuesday to the DIA office in Abuja.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters had last Wednesday reported what Olawunmi said when he featured on Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Sunrise Daily\u2019 breakfast programme.\n\n\n\nHe had condemned the attack by bloodthirsty bandits on the Kaduna campus of Nigeria\u2019s foremost military university, the Nigerian Defence Academy, where two military officers were killed and another kidnapped.\n\n\n\nThe Professor of Global Security Studies had said, \u201cIt is an aberration; you don\u2019t attack the Nigerian Defence Academy and get away with it. In 2017, I carried out an investigation by the Minister of Defence that wanted me to check what was going on with the training and the security there (NDA). I remember I spent about a week in the NDA with the commandant and the staff but something struck me: every Friday, the gate of NDA is thrown open and everybody has access to pray in the mosque.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn Fridays, you are going to see the same thing happening across all military formations in the country. If you go to Defence Headquarters, I served at the Defence Headquarters as the Deputy Director, Defence Administration, between 2015 and 2017, throughout my two years at Defence Headquarters, I received visitors twice because of the strict security architecture there but every Friday, the gate of the Defence Headquarters is thrown wide open for everybody to come in and observe Juma\u2019at.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat is the time the terrorists have the time to profile our security environment. It has always been the case. I have served the military intelligence for the past 35 years. Our problem is religion and socio-cultural.\u201d\n\n\n\nOlawunmi had added that he was a member of the Intelligence Brief at the Defence Headquarters during the leadership of the then Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen. Abayomi Olonisakin (retd.).\n\n\n\nThe intelligence expert said he told the then CDS that the centre of gravity of the Boko Haram insurgency ravaging the North-East and spreading to other parts of Nigeria was the sponsor.\n\n\n\n\u201cI told General Olonisakin then that the centre of this problem cannot be solved the same way we solved the problem of the Niger Delta. The Niger Delta problem was solved during (Ex-President Umaru) Yar\u2019Adua basically by me and I told them that we can\u2019t use that same template for Boko Haram.\n\n\n\n\u201cI told General Olonisakin to look at the centre of gravity of the problem. I was made a member of the committee in 2016-2017 including former Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru that died.\n\n\n\n\u201cI told them that the centre of gravity of Boko Haram in Nigeria is the sponsors of the programme. It was beyond us because the job we needed to do was kinetic but we cannot resolve the issues of sponsors of Boko Haram that were in Buhari\u2019s government that we know them. That was why we couldn\u2019t pursue that aspect that could have resolved the issue because we need to arrest people.\n\n\n\n\u201cRecently, 400 people were gathered as sponsors of Boko Haram, why is it that the Buhari government has refused to try them? Why can\u2019t this government bring them to trial if not that they are partisan and part of the charade that is going on?\n\n\n\n\u201cYou remember this Boko Haram issue started in 2012 and I was in the military intelligence at that time. We arrested those people. My organisation conducted interrogation and they (suspects) mentioned names. I can\u2019t come on air and start mentioning names of people that are presently in government that I know that the boys that we arrested mentioned. Some of them are governors now, some of them are in the Senate, some of them are in Aso Rock.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy should a government decide to cause this kind of embarrassment and insecurity to the sense of what happened yesterday (Tuesday at the NDA)?\u201d\n\n\n\nOlawunmi had also said that the Department of State Services (DSS) had tremendous information on terrorists but could not do anything because of the body language of the President.\n\n",

I remember I spent about a week in the NDA with the commandant and the staff but something struck me: every Friday, the gate of NDA is thrown open and everybody has access to pray in the mosque.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn Fridays, you are going to see the same thing happening across all military formations in the country. If you go to Defence Headquarters, I served at the Defence Headquarters as the Deputy Director, Defence Administration, between 2015 and 2017, throughout my two years at Defence Headquarters, I received visitors twice because of the strict security architecture there but every Friday, the gate of the Defence Headquarters is thrown wide open for everybody to come in and observe Juma\u2019at.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat is the time the terrorists have the time to profile our security environment. It has always been the case. I have served the military intelligence for the past 35 years. Our problem is religion and socio-cultural.\u201d\n\n\n\nOlawunmi had added that he was a member of the Intelligence Brief at the Defence Headquarters during the leadership of the then Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Gen. Abayomi Olonisakin (retd.).\n\n\n\nThe intelligence expert said he told the then CDS that the centre of gravity of the Boko Haram insurgency ravaging the North-East and spreading to other parts of Nigeria was the sponsor.\n\n\n\n\u201cI told General Olonisakin then that the centre of this problem cannot be solved the same way we solved the problem of the Niger Delta. The Niger Delta problem was solved during (Ex-President Umaru) Yar\u2019Adua basically by me and I told them that we can\u2019t use that same template for Boko Haram.\n\n\n\n\u201cI told General Olonisakin to look at the centre of gravity of the problem. I was made a member of the committee in 2016-2017 including former Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru that died.\n\n\n\n\u201cI told them that the centre of gravity of Boko Haram in Nigeria is the sponsors of the programme. It was beyond us because the job we needed to do was kinetic but we cannot resolve the issues of sponsors of Boko Haram that were in Buhari\u2019s government that we know them. That was why we couldn\u2019t pursue that aspect that could have resolved the issue because we need to arrest people.\n\n\n\n\u201cRecently, 400 people were gathered as sponsors of Boko Haram, why is it that the Buhari government has refused to try them? Why can\u2019t this government bring them to trial if not that they are partisan and part of the charade that is going on?\n\n\n\n\u201cYou remember this Boko Haram issue started in 2012 and I was in the military intelligence at that time. We arrested those people. My organisation conducted interrogation and they (suspects) mentioned names. I can\u2019t come on air and start mentioning names of people that are presently in government that I know that the boys that we arrested mentioned. Some of them are governors now, some of them are in the Senate, some of them are in Aso Rock.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy should a government decide to cause this kind of embarrassment and insecurity to the sense of what happened yesterday (Tuesday at the NDA)?\u201d\n\n\n\nOlawunmi had also said that the Department of State Services (DSS) had tremendous information on terrorists but could not do anything because of the body language of the President.\n\n",

Hon. Aminu Bello Masari CFR, the Governor of Katsina State, do hereby make the following:\n\n\u201c1. This Notice may be cited as the Security Challenges (Containment) Order and shall come into effect on the 31st day of August 2021;\n\n\u201c2. Immediate total closure of Jibia-Gurbin Baure road to all motorists until further notice. Travelers plying that road are advised to go through Funtua;\n\n\u201c3.

          "title": "Incremental innovation with Nigerian healthtech startups",
          "text": "Hello everyone, let\u2019s get a little personal.\n\nLast week, I spent time in Warri \u2013 a city located in South-South Nigeria, notable for being an oil hub and popularizing the incredibly complex but impressive Warri pidgin language. My trip turned out to be an unexpectedly stressful event and by Sunday, I fell sick.\n\nNow falling sick wasn\u2019t an issue; the issue was that I\u2019d fallen sick on a Sunday and my accommodation was located in a small, but populated, community that didn\u2019t have a pharmacy within walking distance. Also, the mom and pop shops that littered every street around the hotel didn\u2019t open before noon on Sundays.\n\nAs my people say: I was in hot soup.\n\nThe hotel concierge had to walk a mile to buy a pack of Panadol for me, and for the hotel\u2019s First Aid box.\n\nPartner Message\n\nThe Flutterwave Mobile app, the app that turns any smartphone into a mobile POS is now redefining commerce. The Flutterwave Mobile App makes it super convenient for anyone to take their business with them anywhere, anytime. Learn how you can take your business anywhere, anytime here.\n\nFirst dibs on Mega Cities\n\nBut while I was waiting and battling aches and pains, I couldn\u2019t help but wish I had access to a healthtech or telemedicine company that could deliver the medication I need right to my hotel room. Or better still, send a healthcare professional to run some tests and properly diagnose my symptoms.\n\nMy experience revealed two things: Nigeria needs more healthtech startups. And those startups need to have foot traffic in other cities and communities, outside Lagos and Abuja.\n\nWith a population of about 14million people, Lagos is Nigeria\u2019s busiest and most populated financial and commercial hub. The mega city also has thriving tech hubs scattered across diverse communities.\n\nSo of course you\u2019re going to see a growing number of founders setting up their business headquarters in Lagos. It makes business sense to penetrate at least 1% of the most populous market in Nigeria.\n\nBut there\u2019s a tendency for these founders to grow comfortable in Lagos, or eventually expand their businesses into neighboring South-West states like Ekiti, Ogun, and Ondo.\n\nComparatively speaking, there are more Fintech startups than healthtech/telemedicine in Nigeria. And out of that small crop of healthtech startups, at least 50% of them were founded in Lagos, and are currently serving customers in the megacity.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that some of these startups serve clients in states outside their HQ location\n\nPartner Message\n\nKB4-CON EMEA is a free, highly engaging, cybersecurity-focused virtual event designed for CISOs, security awareness and cybersecurity professionals in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The event will be on Thursday, September 23rd and features keynotes from two of the most well known figures in cybersecurity. Mikko Hypp\u00f6nen will cover how our global networks are being threatened by surveillance and crime, and how we can fix our technical, and human, problems. Kevin Mitnick will reveal social engineering tradecraft and insights and wow you with a live hacking demonstration. You can register here.\n\nIncremental innovation\n\nOf those Lagos headquartered health startups, only a small number of them are focused on delivering medication and home-based tests to their users.\n\nEven with over 2,000 registered private hospitals and more than 200 public health centers in Lagos, there\u2019s still a high percentage of underserved Lagos residents who can\u2019t afford basic medical care. Those who can afford a one-time hospital visit would rather self medicate or purchase analgesics (panadol, ibuprofen, etc) from a street vendor, but they stand the risk of buying expired drugs.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to ignore the need for telemedicine businesses in Lagos. But it\u2019s also crucial to remind prospective founders who want to break into Nigeria\u2019s health ecosystem that communities outside Lagos also need attention.\n\nFor Ifeoluwa Dare-Johnson, founder and CEO of Healthtracka, launching in Lagos was deliberate, but her team is also keen to expand into more Nigerian cities and marginalized communities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple of people reach out to us from Abeokuta and Ibadan \u2013 they have a need for our services. They need tests done, but the nearest hospital is too far from them.\u201d Ifeoluwa said over our Zoom call.\n\nHealthtracka is a digital health platform that offers convenient at-home lab tests and provides their users with easy-to-read results.\n\n\u201cOne of the things about innovation in healthcare is that it has to be incremental. We have to first build confidence and trust in our prospective users. And building that trust will look different for people who live in Lagos and people who live outside Lagos.\u201d\n\nInnovating incrementally requires healthtech founders to spend time immersing themselves in unfamiliar markets and listening to the needs of their future customers.\n\n\u201cOver the next one year, I hope Healthtracka can expand into other cities outside Lagos. I\u2019m thinking Abeokuta, Ibadan, and even Warri. Lagos is an innovation centre, so it\u2019s good to start building here. Test your product in Lagos, and then expand into other communities using the lessons you\u2019ve learned.\u201d\n\nSo my challenge to emerging and prospective healthtech founders is this: can you spread health and digital innovation outside the commercial walls of Lagos?\n\nIt could be argued that larger commercial cities have higher purchasing power \u2013 and this argument is valid \u2013 but if innovation does not spread into the corridors of smaller emerging cities, their purchasing power will not be strong enough to partake in the digital economy.\n\nPartner Message\n\nDid you know that the US Stock markets have returned on average 10% annually for nearly a 100 years?

          "text": "On August 17, a court in Abuja granted an order to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze bank accounts belonging to four startups, which allow Nigerians to invest in foreign securities, for 180 days.\n\nThe crackdown by the apex bank could result in severe unintended casualties for the companies; but above all, it puts at risk what is arguably their most valuable asset \u2014 customers\u2019 trust.\n\nThe global finance industry is built on the foundation of trust. And in Nigeria, where more than 80 million citizens live below the poverty line, trust is even more paramount. Most Nigerians are likely to be skeptical about storing their hard-earned Naira with a digital-only company for extended periods.\n\nAnd the fintech platforms affected by CBN\u2019s move \u2014 Trove, Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka \u2014 know this.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBeyond offering financial products with attractive investment returns, the startups have invested in building a customer trust and loyalty bank. This has mostly been through providing consistent financial literacy and transparent communication over the years, primarily via emails and Telegram channels.\n\nEach of the fintech firms has thousands of members in its respective Telegram community \u2014 Risevest (+12,000), Chaka (+5,000), and Trove (+3,000) \u2014 where inquiries and queries are responded to in real-time with opportunities to further educate their users.\n\nNews of the embargo on their bank accounts would ordinarily have sparked a frenzy among customers and it did for a moment. Some users took to social media to express their shock and others made moves to withdraw their funds, exhibiting a natural human instinct to fight or take flight when faced with a crisis or an unexpected situation.\n\nBut the majority of users have held on, helped by their trust in the companies, which quickly communicated the suspension to customers while assuring them their funds were safe.\n\n\u201cI got an email from Risevest before I even read in the news that their accounts were barred. So I was already calm knowing that my money was safe,\u201d Motunrayo Koyejo, a software engineer and Rise Vest user, told TechCabal. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have this much confidence if I didn\u2019t get that email.\u201d\n\nRise Vest\u2019s email to users after the suspension.\n\nWhile the suspension affected four retail trading apps, there is a tendency that such clampdown can result in contagion; a situation where a crisis affecting some companies spreads to other players in the industry.\n\nStephanie Osaji, who uses Cowrywise for savings said after seeing news of the court order, she was \u201cscared, thought about my funds and was wondering what would happen to my money\u201d if the platform suddenly shut down.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I considered withdrawing my money. I remember logging into the app and checking when my next due date for withdrawal was,\u201d Osaji said. \u201cBut then I just told myself that they would figure it out. I mean Nigerian startups almost always have a way of figuring things out.\u201d\n\nAnother Cowrywise user, Mosopefoluwa Okeowo, told TechCabal she thinks fintech startups will always find a solution. \u201cI honestly believe in them totally.\u201d\n\nThis sort of consumer confidence is one that takes years to build. Communicating with customers and stakeholders at the very early stages of a mishap is crucial to reassuring their confidence.\n\nSe the money I have in risevest yh, even if it will go like that we go die there. Thats how much I believe in Eke \u2014 Sani Yusuf (@saniyusuf) August 17, 2021\n\nSem. Sem. Started investing with Eke so long ago. Before he even started coming this way and we had never met until years later.\n\n\n\nRise will survive. https://t.co/a42wEDeVAW \u2014 Gossy (@gossyomega) August 23, 2021\n\nNigerians embracing investment-tech amid economic uncertainty\n\nAfrica\u2019s bustling fintech ecosystem has been increasingly defined by payments specialists and digital banks.\n\nBut a crop of wealth management startups has emerged in recent years, the majority helping Nigerians invest in foreign stocks and assets easier than ever before.\n\nInvesting in reliable financial assets appeals to many millennials in the country who are keen on hedging their future wealth against the unstable Naira, amid broader economic uncertainty.\n\nWith \u20a61,000 (around $2), anyone with a smartphone and internet can register on Chaka and browse through over 11,000 shares publicly listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and stock exchanges in the U.S.\n\nSavings and investment apps also boast superior returns on deposits. Compared to less than 5% interest rates on fixed deposits offered by Nigerian banks, Rise Vest offers a guaranteed 10% annual return on its fixed-income offering.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safer to save money with banks but one gets little or nothing in return,\u201d Koyejo said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an option in this economy. I\u2019d rather keep my money and invest with Rise Vest. I don\u2019t plan to use the money I have invested soon anyway.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

Two years later, the company got into the 2017 Y Combinator\u2019s Winter batch, making it the first company accepted from Morocco.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing a career today is easy because people are spoilt for choice. There are options that cut across almost every facet of life, with the numbers going up since the adoption of remote work and creation of new roles by organisations globally following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic last year.\n\nHowever, it was not this straightforward back in the day in Nigeria. A couple of decades ago, the joke \u2014 often hiding admonition \u2014 was that in making a choice, one should look at the big four: medicine, banking, law, and engineering. Anything else was considered trivial, even disgraceful in some circles.\n\nAfter carefully considering his abilities and family pressure because of his position, Nifemi Akinwamide probably had a good idea where he belonged early in life.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the first child, and that comes with a lot of responsibilities from a very young age. Typically, I didn\u2019t exactly have someone to look up to, since there\u2019s nobody before me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s unsure, but it\u2019s possible his dad thought attending a boarding school as early as his first secondary school year would give him a certain level of exposure. Given that Nifemi was chauffeured to and from primary school, the change was difficult to adapt to.\n\n\u201cNow that I think of that experience, it wasn\u2019t so good because I didn\u2019t really understand who I was, nor did I know what it meant to be alone,\u201d Nifemi revealed during a chat at Kudi\u2019s HQ, in Lekki, Lagos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNifemi Akinwamide. Product Manager, Marketplace, Kudi\n\nOver time, Nifemi grew out of this phase of his life. Nevertheless, he dealt with a lot as a young boy.\n\nNavigating the waters of undiagnosed dyscalculia\n\nGrowing up, Nifemi had some challenges that made basic academic tasks harder for him than other children his age. He couldn\u2019t understand maths concepts and had difficulty reading.\n\nAs if those weren\u2019t enough for a boy his age to contend with, his handwriting was illegible and comprehending the basic rules of grammar was tough.\n\nWithout knowledge of why he was having those experiences in school, his parents put extra measures in place to help him improve. Still, he didn\u2019t make much progress, and the pattern continued.\n\nAs was the norm in his school, he visited an academic counsellor when it was time to choose a senior secondary school class.\n\nLooking at his record, the counsellor advised against choosing pure sciences, and suggested he pursued the social sciences or arts. Unfortunately, his father didn\u2019t like this recommendation and insisted on pure sciences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExpectedly, Nifemi struggled through senior secondary school, even repeating one class. And when he saw how well his friends were doing in sciences, he concluded he wasn\u2019t intelligent enough to be there.\n\nAfter graduating, Nifemi went to the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA) to study metallurgical and material engineering, after failing to secure a place in electrical engineering. However, he only did this to satisfy his parents; he knew more than anyone that he lacked the ability to cope with the maths-laden courses.\n\nHe tried unsuccessfully for three years to understand the courses, but couldn\u2019t, resulting in carryovers. At that point, he knew something had to be done; his guardian shared his sentiments also.\n\n\u201cHe sat me down and was like there\u2019s no problem with this boy. Because, one of the things he realised is that of all the wards that stayed with him, I was the only one who engaged him. We had spoke about life, politics, and other deep talks that young people wouldn\u2019t find interesting.\u201d\n\nFor the first time, his challenge was critically examined, and he was asked to see a psychiatrist, who, suspecting that he had a cognitive deficiency \u2014 possibly dyslexia or dyscalculia \u2014 advised him to begin therapy.\n\nTherapy had two results: it helped him gain an understanding of the challenge he had dealt with all his life, and gave him the opportunity to change his course to project management, a social sciences course he was more suited for.\n\nRefocusing his energy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNifemi Akinwamide. Product Manager, Marketplace, Kudi\n\nGrowing up in Ibadan, one of Nigeria\u2019s major cities, Nifemi was conservative, and the last person you\u2019d find socialising. But his life changed after his diagnosis in university.\n\nIn a conversation with old schoolmates at private universities, he realised that his school was not as popular as he thought, and apart from its website, nothing else popped up in an online search. And the idea to create a now-defunct blog \u2014 futatoday.com \u2014 for the school was born. Something else happened to Nifemi at this point; the creation of the blog opened his eyes to what had been missing in his life.\n\n\u201cThat was like the biggest blog during my time on campus. What I did was to find a way to push information about things that were happening on campus to the world. All my energy was pushed into that since school wasn\u2019t doing it for me.\n\n\u201cAnd in less than two years, we were doing a lot, and I was already making money from doing publications for people on campus, getting words from the Student Affairs and VC out, organising and covering events. What I wanted in the school, like shows and celebrity events, I introduced. Just doing all these, I was everywhere!\u201d\n\nIt is safe to say that with the blog came the blooming of the conservative Ibadan-raised boy. At the time, he had about 15 students working with him as writers, photographers, and creatives. Although futatoday.com was not a successful business, running it taught Nifemi entrepreneurship lessons that would shape many of his future decisions. And at barely 20 years old, he had gotten some exposure.\n\nForay into real media\n\nHe also tried his hands on website designing, getting his first paying job at Fourth Canvas (formerly VGC Media) \u2014 a brand identity development startup founded by his friend, Victor Fatanmi \u2014 where he was the startup\u2019s first head of communications for the first few years of the business.\n\nTech media startup, Techpoint Africa, was one of Fourth Canvas\u2019 clients, and during a visit, Adewale Yusuf (then CEO of Techpoint Africa), asked if he\u2019d be interested in joining the team. Willing to give it a shot, he joined the team in January 2017. But he had a bigger plan.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I want to do with my life as a whole is to make an impact. I don\u2019t plan to do stuff just for the sake of it.\u201d\n\nNifemi joined Techpoint Africa when the startup was looking for new revenue streams, and he suggested events, mainly because of his experience running his blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNifemi Akinwamide\n\nThe typical behind-the-scenes person that he is, Nifemi was glad when his suggestion was accepted. He probably thought he could work from a safe distance without unnecessary interactions.\n\nHowever, he was shocked, to discover that he\u2019d also have to write and publish articles for the first few months, something he did not like given that he lacked writing prowess.\n\n\u201cI guess one thing that stood out for the editors was my very good thought process. I could figure out what direction I wanted to go with a story. But then, considering my background, I would have typos and feel bad after seeing the edits. But it got better.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNifemi Akinwamide. Product Manager, Marketplace, Kudi\n\nLater in the year, he led the team to hold its first event, Techpoint Inspired. After a successful event, he was made the head of events and tasked with organising more events. In 2018, he organised Techpoint Build, one of Africa\u2019s largest tech gatherings, with over 5000 attendees.\n\nBusiness development was added to his role, and he handled all that was on his table admirably before he bowed out in June 2019 to join Kudi, an online payment startup known majorly as one of the second set of Nigerian startups that got into Y Combinator.\n\nFor the love of people and marketing\n\nNifemi\u2019s transition to Kudi was similar to his journey to Techpoint Africa.\n\n\u201cMy first ever review for Techpoint was about Kudi\u2019s chatbox,\u201d he recalls, \u201cand after my conversation with the founder for that article, I kept in touch.\u201d\n\nHe noticed the founder was also a person who liked to get things done without being seen. So, it wasn\u2019t hard to get on board once he was certain he needed to take on a new challenge. This time it was in marketing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNifemi Akinwamide. Product Manager, Marketplace, Kudi\n\nThough he was inexperienced in marketing, Nifemi believes his Kudi move was a good decision because it aligns with his position on life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a function of the market that we serve,\u201d he explains, \u201ca market of people who are thriving despite the odds. Although they don\u2019t have it figured out yet, they remain in the market.\u201d\n\nIn essence, Nifemi paints a picture of the struggles of daily traders \u2014 the unbanked \u2014 who are Kudi\u2019s target audience. As a business that started as a chatbot helping people manage their expenses before going into agency banking, the startup didn\u2019t have many digital footprints.\n\nNifemi\u2019s first assignment was to change this position through brand management, media publicity, customer research, agent relationship, and marketing.\n\nHis role as Product Manager, Marketplace requires that he functions in sales, marketing, product, agent monitoring, and any other department requiring his critical thinking and strategy skills.\n\nBehind the scene\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNifemi Akinwamide. Product Manager, Marketplace, Kudi\n\nNifemi dreams of someday becoming a founder. And though he failed at his first attempt with futatoday.com, he tried to learn as much as he could while at Techpoint Africa. He offered to help its Editor-in-Chief, M\u00fay\u00ecw\u00e1 M\u00e1t\u00f9l\u00fak\u00f2, to transcribe interviews with startup founders so that he could pick their brains about their processes.\n\nHe fondly recalls how, as a kid, he wished he had a superpower to take away people\u2019s problems. However, as a man, with some experience under his belt, his dreams have changed.\n\n\u201cI have always been a behind-the-scenes guy; that\u2019s how I am. And I realise that I\u2019m not a founder kind of person because I was okay with founders doing their thing and also helping them achieve their goals. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Most of the opportunities I have seized have been because I always show up and do my best.\u201d\n\nOver time, Nifemi has become a more confident writer, team player, and project executor. But he has an ultimate plan.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I intend to do is to retire early. I\u2019ve worked really hard in the last couple of years. Afterwards, I could then go back to educating people. I have a feeling that Nigeria\u2019s problem can only be solved when more people are educated to make the right choices.\u201d\n\nBut he fears he might either be discriminated against or treated differently once they are aware of his learning disabilities. So, he makes up for this with his exceptional works. Outside work, Nifemi loves to watch movies and cook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole Human enthusiast | Writer | Senior reporter | Podcaster",

In a conversation with Down To Earth magazine, the President of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), Lesetja Kganyago, revealed that in his opinion, cryptocurrencies are not currencies but crypto assets.\n\nExplaining that cryptocurrencies don\u2019t meet one of the principal characteristics of a currency \u2014 it must be generally accepted as a medium of exchange \u2014 he said cryptocurrencies are only accepted by those who use them.\n\nPerhaps, this emphasised disparity could account for the severe regulatory backlash against crypto trading in most African countries and some countries in other continents. In June 2021, the SARB banned cross-border cryptocurrency transactions on the Binance platform in South Africa.\n\nZoom in. While its global adoption is nascent, cryptocurrency is not yet a generally accepted medium of exchange. Right now, I cannot pay for my purchase at the grocery store with Bitcoin, as it is yet to be authorised for use by governments in most parts of the world. This might be because of its volatility and lack of singular regulatory autonomy.\n\nInterestingly, this is precisely why it fits into different squares such as a currency, commodity or security; it all depends on how it is looked at. It\u2019s also important to remember that the general acceptability of a currency is mainly dependent on wide social utilisation.\n\nA good time to revisit: Cryptocurrency in Nigeria: Too early for regulation \u2014 industry players\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClubhouse meetings to feel more life-like\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/@artcoastdesign?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Dmitry Mashkin</a> on <a href=\u201dhttps://unsplash.com/s/photos/clubhouse?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\u201d>Unsplash</a>\n\nWhat\u2019s the gist? Social audio app, Clubhouse, announced on Sunday, August 29, 2021, that a spatial audio feature would be added to the app. The rollout has begun with the iOS version and will subsequently extend to the app\u2019s Android version.\n\nWhy is this relevant? Clubhouse wants to make you feel you\u2019re in a physical space. The spatial audio feature will enhance sound output by enabling a real-time conversation effect, making it feel like the sounds emanate from speakers around the room. This will give off the ambience of a physical hangout.\n\nThe big picture? Think of it as being able to hear every listener\u2019s laughter in a room, in real-time, when a host shares a joke. Sounds good, if you ask me. Virtual meetings have become part and parcel of everyday life, and several arguments have ensued about their effectiveness compared to physical gatherings.\n\nZoom out. Clubhouse seems to have experienced an interesting ride in the audio social network space. It has gone from strict exclusiveness to nascent inclusivity, believed to have been fuelled by competition from Twitter and Facebook. Initially, it launched in March 2020 as an invite-only application available only on iOS. However, it has since rolled out an Android version and shed its invite-only feature.\n\nIn case you missed it on Techpoint Africa\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nHow to Remember What You Read.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki and his counterparts in Oyo and Abia States, Engr. Seyi Makinde and Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu, respectively, on Tuesday, flagged off the e-registration and Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise in Anambra State, ahead of the November 6, 2021 date for the state\u2019s gubernatorial poll.\n\nObaseki, who is also the Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) e-Registration Committee, expressed confidence that the PDP will emerge victorious in the forthcoming election.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAnambra State is the first state that we are launching the e-registration and CVR exercise as we were charged, as the committee on e-registration, to commence the exercise following the forthcoming election on November 6, 2021.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned and have seen, PDP is the only party in Nigeria. Other parties are Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV) for elections. Our party\u2019s strength rests on the ward. It\u2019s the base of the party and the e-registration launch today will be driven by the leadership of the 326 wards in Anambra State.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the exercise, we can register you in our portal as PDP members and also register you with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) if you are not a voter. The process is very simple,\u201d he noted.\n\nStating the importance of the exercise in the nation\u2019s electoral process, Obaseki noted that e-registration would make it impossible and difficult to rig the election as against the former practice of writing result in collation centers.\n\nHe urged PDP members to take the e-registration exercise seriously to boost membership as it will create room for the party to win the election, adding, \u201cWe must join the PDP to stop the hardship in the country; like high cost of food, the killings and havoc from herdsmen, bandits and robbers. Our e-registration is the right planning for the party as the exercise will further showcase the greatness of our party.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Makinde noted: \u201cI am from the South-West. Obaseki is from the South-South, and Ikpeazu came from the South-East; you have the full support of the Southern part of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf I can win election with just one member in the Oyo State House of Assembly, you can also do the same. Don\u2019t be discouraged. With the e-registration, it will be difficult to write results. They couldn\u2019t rig the Edo election; they can\u2019t also do it here. We will all rejoice come November 6, 2021 after the governorship election.\u201d\n\nIkpeazu charged the party members to embrace the registration exercise, adding, \u201cWe must come out en-masse to register from the comfort of our homes. The process is easy. No time to stand back but stand firm to stop the suffering and hardship in the nation by supporting PDP all the way to 2023.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice-Presidential candidate of the PDP, Dr. Peter Obi, commended the governors of Edo, Oyo and Abia states for coming to support the party\u2019s guber candidate, Valentine Ozigbo.\n\n...",

These figures are encouraging and of the online registrants 2,160,292 are youths between ages 18 to 34,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nShe added that recently, INEC expanded polling units by creating additional 57,023 units across the country, bringing the total units to 176,996, with the aim of bringing the voting process closer to the people .\n\nProf. Adebayo Olukoshi, Chairman, The Electoral Forum and Professor, Wits School of Governance, in South Africa, commended the forum for the initiative to gather veterans with knowledgeable insights on the electoral process.\n\nOlukoshi said that the world over it was believed that interacting with such a class of people would help in improving the quality of governance, elections and democracy.\n\nHe said that issues of electoral integrity had continued to plague Nigeria, so, there was need to commit to working at ensuring electoral integrity, so that citizens could reap the dividends of democracy .\n\nMs Princess Hamman-Obels, Director, IRIAD, The Electoral Hub, said that the Hub conceptualised the Electoral Forum as a way to pool resource persons from electoral management bodies together with other electoral stakeholders.\n\nThis, Hamman-Obels said, was to find solutions to the unique problems facing the electoral process in Nigeria .\n\n\u201cWith the support of OSIWA, the forum has been established under the chairmanship of Prof. Adebayo Olukoshi, and other high-calibre practitioners.\n\n\u201cWe believe that by facilitating discussions among different stakeholders, we hope to deepen understanding of the electoral process in Nigeria, as well as provide solutions to improve electoral integrity and credibility,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nHamman-Obels said that the aim of the forum was to facilitate systematic electoral reforms, promote evidence-based law-making, policy and advocacy on elections in Nigeria.\n\nShe added that another objective of the forum was also to advance strategies to improve capacities and credibility of electoral management bodies in Nigeria.\n\nToday\u2019s public launch and inaugural meeting\u2019s objective was to formally launch the forum, determine its operations, produce understanding of members and review the Electoral Amendment bill, she said.\n\nMs Catherine Angai, Programme Coordinator, Democracy and Accountability, OSIWA, said that the support to Electoral Hub, spoke to OSIWA\u2019s priority for evidence-based electoral reforms.\n\nAngai added that it targeted those factors that impacted on electoral integrity, particularly the administrative barriers, and that the project had a research component which would critically analyse Nigeria\u2019s election management system.\n\nShe said that the research would create a compelling evidence-based narrative that presented a clear picture of the strengths and limitations of electoral bodies.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the project fills a major knowledge-gap and provides an expose into the structural issues that have impacted on the work of electoral management bodies over the years,\u2019\u2019 she said.

          "text": "By Olusesan Laoye\n\nA Yoruba group, Egbe Omo Yoruba North America (EOYNA), has insisted that nothing should happen to Commodore Kunle Olawunmi (rtd) over his claims in a Channels TV interview that there is an attempt to Islamize Nigeria, and that some top members of Boko Haram terrorist group are serving in the government of Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nOlawunmi, a Professor of Global Security Studies who was in military intelligence for 35 years, had in the said interview last week, alleged that there in an \u201cintention is to Islamisze Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe had noted that, \u201cSome people have this mindset to Islamize Nigeria. These people are known. They don\u2019t mind if the economy is dead. They are are hard liners who just want to Islamize Nigeria. They look at the Taliban, for example, and they feel they can do it here.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t care if people die in the process, it\u2019s fine as long as they dip the Quran in the Atlantic Ocean.\u201d\n\nOlawunmi had also argued that some of the hard liners known to the intelligence community to have links with terrorists, are now in government, further alleging that the attack on NDA had insider collaboration, while arguing that the security crisis in the country is about sociocultural issues, as according to him, \u201cas long as you speak Hausa or Fufide you can do anything you like.\u201d\n\nHowever, following the interview, the Defense Intelligence Agency of the Defence Headquarters (DHQ), invited him to appear in its office, an invitation he honoured on Tuesday.\n\nReacting to the invitation in a statement on Tuesday, EOYNA asked Buhari to go after those identified by Commodore Olawunmi during the interview, and not attempt to victimize him over his revelations.\n\nIn the statement signed by Durojaye Odimayo Akindutire, MD president of the group, and made available to newsmen, the group said if President Buhari wanted to fight insecurity seriously and genuinely, he should go after the sponsors of insurgency who have remained untouchable.\n\nThe Yoruba group referred to Olawunmi\u2019s revelations that the sponsors of insurgency were well known to security agencies in the country but were being shielded by some people in authority.\n\nAccording to the statement, the group described as \u201cpotent and disturbing\u201d the revelations of the retired military officer.\n\nThe statement reads in parts: \u201cThe Kernel of what he (Olawunmi) revealed is that \u201cthe center of gravity of insecurity of all stripes in Nigeria is the sponsors\u201d. This is what connects the Dots. And until and unless these sponsors are exposed and brought to heel, Nigeria will never know peace and will continue to regress.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is that these sponsors are highly placed Individuals that include Governors, Senators and people in Aso Rock who are known to security personnel but are being shielded by those in Authority.\n\n\u201cThese revelations have confirmed the worst fears of some ethnic nationalities in Nigeria that the murderous rampages of kidnappings and dispossession of lands in the Middle Belt and Southern parts of the country are part of a larger sinister Agenda of Ethnic and Radical Religious Domination of the Taliban variety being pursued by some elements in sharia north.\n\n\u201cIf President Buhari-led Federal Government wants to tackle insecurity in Nigeria seriously and genuinely, EOYNA calls on the Federal Government under President Buhari to address the core problem identified by Comdre. Olawunmi as its center of gravity \u2013 the sponsors here in Nigeria who are well known and have been untouchable. This should be done for All Nigerians to see.\u201d\n\nCommending the retired military officer for the revelations, the group, cautioned that nothing adverse should happen to him and his family, saying he had exercised his right to free speech and had spoken the truth with facts for the sake of Nigeria and Nigerians.\n\nThe group also hinted that the Yorubas in the diaspora and at home are watching the development and would like to say that they are proud of Comdre Olawunmi and are ready to protect him for saying the ruth as a patriotic Nigerian.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe Nigerian Air Force on Tuesday, inducted A-29 Super Tucano Aircraft produced in the United States at ceremony attended by U.S. Department of Defense leaders.\n\nThe ceremony was hosted by Nigerian Minister of Defence, Bashir Salihi Magashi and the Nigerian Air Force.\n\nJournalists, were, however barred from covering the ceremony with armed security operatives from both military and para-military organisations stationed at the venue of the ceremony and other strategic locations at the airport.\n\nSpokesman of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, had on July 22, 2021, announced the arrival of the first batch of six A-29 Super Tucano aircraft in Kano.\n\nHe disclosed that the aircraft were received by the Minister of Defence, Maj.-Gen. Bashir Magashi (Rtd), alongside the Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Faruk Yahaya, and the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao.\n\nA statement released by the United States Embassy after the ceremony, quoted Gen. Jeff Harrigian, U.S. Air Forces in Europe-Air Forces Africa commander to have noted that, \u201cThe Nigerian Air Force is one of our key partners that plays a critical role in furthering regional security and stability. This ceremony symbolizes the strength of our unique partnership and underscores the value of training and working together.\u201d\n\nThe Super Tucanos were the impetus for significant deepening of training and professional relationships, he added. Precision targeting, air-to-ground integration, and human rights training are all included in the partnership between the U.S. and Nigeria. The aircraft will assist the Nigerian Air Force in their fight against violent extremist organizations including the Islamic State West Africa Province. The joint structure of air-to-ground integration also supports Nigerian Army and Navy operations.\n\nNigeria purchased the A-29s through the Foreign Military Sales program, which follows the Department of Defense\u2019s \u201cTotal Package Approach\u201d model and includes spare parts for several years of operation, contract logistics support, munitions, and a multi-year construction project to improve Kainji Air Base infrastructure. The total sale is valued at almost $500 million, making it the largest FMS program in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nHarrigian and U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria Mary Beth Leonard spoke to media about how this platform will help improve Nigerian Air Force capabilities, as well as increase training and integration opportunities between Nigerian and U.S. troops. The A-29 can perform intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and precision air-to-ground strikes, strengthening Nigeria\u2019s ability to fight terrorism.\n\n\u201cThe A-29 is a prime tool to help Nigeria combat violent extremism and is vital to sustained deterrence,\u201d Harrigian said. \u201cThe total package deal\u2014aircrew and maintainer training, precision-guided weapon delivery, and more\u2014highlights our enduring partnership with the Nigerian Air Force and our commitment to enabling their successes where we can.\u201d\n\nA total of 64 pilots and maintainers from the Nigerian Air Force trained to U.S. standards with the U.S. Air Force\u2019s 81st Fighter Squadron at Moody Air Base in Georgia, USA. Training also emphasized the Law of Armed Conflict and civilian casualty mitigation, which are fundamental principles of the Nigerian military\u2019s professional education and training.\n\nAs part of the program, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is providing $36.1M in infrastructure support to the A-29s\u2019 home base, Kainji Air Base, including earth-covered magazines and aircraft sunshades, a new airfield hot cargo pad, perimeter and security fencing, airfield lights, and various airfield apron, parking, hangar, and entry control point enhancements.\n\nThe infrastructure package also includes a flight annex wing building for simulator training as well as munitions assembly and storage and small arms storage. USACE has also stationed a project engineer at Kainji to provide ongoing maintenance and assistance.\n\nThe Super Tucano induction ceremony is the latest of multiple significant engagements between U.S. Africa Command, its components, and Nigerian counterparts. Other recent engagements include a visit by the Expeditionary Sea Base USS Hershel \u201cWoody\u201d Williams (ESB 4) in August 2021 and U.S. Army Special Forces training with the Nigeria Navy Special Boat Service in July 2021.\n\nU.S. Army Gen. Stephen Townsend, commander, U.S. Africa Command, visited Nigeria in February 2021, where he met with President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s Chief of Staff Ibrahim Gambari, Minister of Defence Magashi, and Chief of Defence Staff Gen.

The Ministry is presently considering other ways of using using the NIN to uncover some other admissio irregularities and all perpetrators including their collaborators in the institutions would be made to face the consequences. \u201c\n\nOn illegal admissions being conducted by some tertiary institutions, the minister expressed concerns that the government\u2019s directive that all admissions should be done through JAMB\u2019s Central Admissions Processing System, CAPS, is being violated.\n\nHe directed JAMB to furnish government with the list of affected institutions for necessary punishments.\n\nHis words : \u201cIt is saddening that despite the clear directives at previous policy meetings some institutions still illegally admitted candidates outside CAPS. I consider such act as a direct affront on the system and appropriate sanctions shall be applied on those found to have been in such disruptive act.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, any institution that issued admission letter to candidates outside CAPS will be punished for such gross indiscipline and fraud.\n\n\u201dThe consequence of admissions conducted outside of CAPS is grievous. It subjects the candidates to gloom future as nemesis of illegal admission awaits them at the completion of study when it will be impossible to take full advantage of the acquired certificates.\n\n\u201cAs a demonstration of our resolve, I have directed JAMB to bring forward for appropriate sanctions, the list of all institutions involved in the violation of the directive of government which was was personally conveyed by me at the 2018 policy meeting in Gbongan, Osun State.\u201d",

          "text": "According to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, the Federal Government\u2019s objective and purpose is to ensure that no Nigerian kid is denied access to basic education.\n\nProfessor Osinbajo made the remarks today in Abuja, where he was a special guest of the Women Arise for Change Initiative in conjunction with the African Child Policy Forum, Ethiopia, at the National Dialogue Forum on the Girl-Child in Nigeria, themed \u201cTowards A Girl-Friendly Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Government has \u201ccommitted in word and practice to education so that no child is denied access to free basic education,\u201d Osinbajo said, highlighting the Buhari administration\u2019s efforts in the area of improving access to education for Nigeria\u2019s female children.\n\n\u201cWe believe that free and compulsory education of girls is game-changing in many respects, as it has been empirically shown to positively impact the age of marriage, and even maternal and infant mortality,\u201d he said.\n\nOsinbajo added, \u201cIn 2020 the Federal Executive Council approved a World Bank credit facility in the sum of $500 million to finance the Adolescent Girls Initiative for Learning and Empowerment Project, to improve secondary education opportunities among girls in targeted areas of participating States, which are Borno, Ekiti, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Kebbi and Plateau.\n\n\u201cThe project is aimed at creating safe and accessible learning spaces, advancing an enabling environment for girls, and strengthening the institutional capacity of the Federal and State governments to support girls\u2019 education and empowerment.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Vice President, the project has benefited approximately 6 million girls and boys between the ages of 10 and 20, with a particular focus on disadvantaged adolescent girls.\n\nProfessor Osinbajo stated that the Buhari government will continue to prioritize the needs of Nigerian girls in laws, policies, and practices in order to assure their safety, education, and health.\n\nHe cited the Buhari administration\u2019s continued efforts to enhance the welfare of Nigerian girls, including the passage of the Child\u2019s Right Act of 2003 and, more recently, the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act of 2015.\n\nWhile urging further action from state governments to guarantee that these Acts are domesticated in the states, Prof Osinbajo stated that the National Economic Council (NEC), which the Vice President chairs, is working with the states to achieve their adoption.\n\n\u201cWe have made a point of working with the States to ensure that they adopt these Acts in their States. This led to the creation of the Human Capital Development (HCD) unit as a special NEC project headed by a special adviser to track implementation of relevant policies,\u201d he said.\n\nProfessor Osinbajo also urged state governments to be more proactive in addressing issues related to the girl-child.\n\n\u201cWhile the Federal Government must remain focused and committed to advancing effective approaches to keeping girls safe, most of the efforts will occur at the State and local government levels.\n\n\u201cGender-responsive measures that will transform education systems and address the barriers inhibiting girl child education must be introduced in States. And we are committed to ensuring that these initiatives happen,\u201d Osinbajo assured.\n\nHe then noted the impactful steps taken by the Rule of Law Advisory Team in the Presidency towards achieving a strong justice response system in supporting women and girls.\n\n\u201cSince 2016, the Rule of Law Advisory Team in the Presidency has been taking a range of steps. We have formed strategic partnerships with relevant stakeholders, local and international, including the European Union Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption Programme, the Open Society Initiative for West Africa, The Cans Foundation and Ford Foundation, all of whose commitments have proven valuable in supporting our efforts to succeed.\n\n\u201cTo ensure effective coordination of responses to cases of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV), the Rule of law Team supported the establishment of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) Response Teams across the country.\u201d\n\nContinuing Professor Osinbajo explained that in 2019, the President directed the National Human Rights Commission to set up a special panel to investigate cases of unlawful arrests, assault and Sexual and Gender-Based Violence in the Federal Capital Territory following complaints of raids of night clubs and arrests of women by the Police.\n\nIn the same vein, the VP emphasised the importance the Buhari administration places on ensuring that women have significant representation in government programmes, including the Social Investment Programmes (SIPs) and Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP).\n\n\u201cFrom 2015 we have ensured that Government\u2019s social and entrepreneurial programmes have an affirmative component for women.

          "title": "Hurricane Ida\u2019s Aftermath: No Power, No Flights, Scant Drinking Water",
          "text": "Hundreds of thousands of Louisianans sweltered in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida on Tuesday with no electricity, no tap water, precious little gasoline and no idea when things might improve.\n\nLong lines that wrapped around the block formed at the few gas stations that had fuel and generator power to pump it. People cleared rotting food out of refrigerators. Neighbors shared generators and used buckets of swimming pool water to bathe or to flush toilets.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of work ahead of us and no one is under the illusion that this is going to be a short process,\u201d Gov. John Bel Edwards said as the cleanup and recovery began across the soggy region in the oppressive late-summer heat.\n\nMore than 1 million homes and businesses in Louisiana and Mississippi \u2014 including all of New Orleans \u2014 were left without power when Ida slammed the electric grid on Sunday with its 150 mph (240 kph) winds, toppling a major transmission tower and knocking out thousands of miles of lines and hundreds of substations.\n\nAn estimated 25,000-plus utility workers labored to restore electricity, but officials said it could take weeks.\n\nWith water treatment plants overwhelmed by floodwaters or crippled by power outages, some places are also facing shortages of drinking water. About 441,000 people in 17 parishes had no water, and an additional 319,000 were under boil-water advisories, federal officials said.\n\nThe number of deaths climbed to at least four in Louisiana and Mississippi, including two people killed Monday night when seven vehicles plunged into a 20-foot-deep (6-meter-deep) hole near Lucedale, Mississippi, where a highway had collapsed after torrential rains. Edwards said he expects the death toll to rise.\n\nIn Slidell, crews searched for a 71-year-old man whose wife said he was attacked by an alligator in Ida\u2019s floodwaters. She pulled him to the steps of the home and paddled away to get help, but when she returned, he was gone, authorities said.\n\nWildlife officials warned of bears, snakes, alligators and feral hogs looking for food in the storm\u2019s aftermath.\n\nEdwards traveled with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell to see the damage firsthand. She said FEMA teams arriving Tuesday would go house to house in hard-hit neighborhoods to register people for aid, particularly in areas with widespread cellphone outages.\n\nThe governor warned some of those who fled their homes not to come back until officials give the all-clear.\n\n\u201cThe schools are not open. The businesses are not open. The hospitals are slammed. There\u2019s not water in your home and there is not going to be electricity,\u201d he said after touring LaPlace in hard-hit suburban St. John the Baptist Parish, where 80% of rescues, but no deaths, took place. \u201cSo let\u2019s get you where you can be safe and somewhat comfortable.\u201d\n\nIn New Orleans, drivers lined up for roughly a quarter-mile, waiting to get into a Costco that was one of the few spots in the city with gasoline. At other gas stations, motorists occasionally pulled up to the pumps, saw the handles covered in plastic bags and drove off.\n\nMichael Pinkrah used his dwindling fuel to find food. He cradled his 3-week-old son in the back seat of an SUV and his 2-year-old daughter played in the front seat as his wife stood in a long line in the sweltering heat to get into one of the few grocery stores open in the city.\n\nPinkrah said he and his wife thought about evacuating but couldn\u2019t find a hotel room. They found out about the open store through social media. But even that link was tenuous.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t charge our electronic devices to keep in contact with people. And without that, all of the communication just fails,\u201d he said.\n\nElsewhere in New Orleans, Hank Fanberg said both of his neighbors offered him access to their generators. He also had a plan for cooking food: \u201cI have a gas grill and charcoal grill.\u201d\n\nIn Houma, the dismal reality of life without air conditioning, refrigeration or other more basic needs began to sink in.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no electricity. Our desperate need right now is tarps, gasoline for generators, food, water,\u201d pastor Chad Ducote said. He said a church group from Mississippi arrived with some food and supplies but was gone in 10 minutes. Neighbors came to Ducote\u2019s pool to scoop up buckets of water.\n\n\u201cThe people down here are just doing what they can. They don\u2019t have anything,\u201d he said.\n\nAdding to the misery was the steamy weather. A heat advisory was issued for New Orleans and the rest of the region, with forecasters saying the combination of high temperatures and humidity could make it feel like 105 degrees Fahrenheit (41 degrees Celsius) on Tuesday and 106 on Wednesday.\n\nAP",
