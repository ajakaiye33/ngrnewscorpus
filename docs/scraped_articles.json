You only need to remain sincere, honest, hard working and committed to the ideals of good governance. Nigeria needs people like you at this crucial junction.\u201d\n\nAhmed, however, urged the minister to de-emphasize politics in order to concentrate on governance, saying Nigeria is at a point that all hands must be on deck to tackle the current challenges bedeviling the country.\n\nAlso speaking, the host of the event, Dr. Goke Adegoroye, who is the uncle of the minister, urged him to make the best use of the remaining months of the Buhari administration to make a lasting impact on the administration and the country.\n\nResponding, Adegoroye thanked all the guests who came to honour him, promising that he would hit the ground running in making indelible contributions to the development of the transport sector.\n\nHe commended President Buhari on the achievements so far recorded in the sector, including expansion of railway network and new ports development.\n\nAdegoroye said attention will be placed on the completion of many of those projects in the coming months.\n\nTalking about his colleague, the Minister of Transport, Engr. Mu:azu Sambo, Adegoroye said even though he was yet to meet him, all he had heard about him are positive, as he\u2019s said to be a pleasant gentleman, adding that they will work very hard closely together to make their impact in the one year or less left in the dispensation.\n\n\u201cEven though I have never met him, everyone who knows him has told me that Engr. Sambo is easygoing, humble, pleasant and a purposeful man, with a good track record in the public sector.\n\n\u201d I am sure we can leverage on his capacity and experience for us to move the Ministry forward seamlessly\u201d, he added\n\nEarlier, a separate reception in honour of the minister in Abuja was attended by former Governor of Ondo State, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, who described Adegoroye as a fine gentleman, who has indeed paid his dues as a leader of men and responsible politician and he\u2019s undoubtedly qualified for his new position.\n\nOther dignitaries at the event included Justice Bode Adegbehingbe of the Ondo State judiciary, Mr. Ogaga Ovarawah, SAN, Mrs. Funmi Awoloomo, SAN, Dr. Remi Olatubora, SAN, Mrs. Nmadi Ogbwue, a former Managing Director of the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC) and members of the National Assembly, among others.",

They happen. And I want to assure you that all those who are supposed to play a role in ensuring that the attack is neutralized did the best that they could to neutralize it. I think what helped them (terrorists) was the number of people they came with and the superior weapons that they came with. And because nobody anticipated it, the few people who are there guarding the place could not withstand the number that they came with. I think that was what happened.\n\n\u201cLike I said, this investigation is still going on. You will only do good to allow the investigation to continue and maybe by the time they finish, you will be able to get the details of what actually happened and why it happened.\u201d\n\nDingyadi revealed that some of the assailants were killed.\n\n\u201cSome of them have been killed. But I can\u2019t give you the number and I don\u2019t know the number. Because like they use to do, whenever one of them is killed, they take the corpse away and you cannot know the number of people who have been killed but definitely quite a number of them were killed and many of them runway with bullet wounds.\u201d The minister said the meeting which was summoned by President Buhari, reviewed the security situation in the country, particularly the Kuje jail break as a result of the attacks on the Correctional Centre by terrorists, the banditry attack in Katsina, as well as the various attacks on Shiroro local government of Niger State. The minister said the President was deeply concerned about the recent developments.\n\n\u201cMr. president is surprised that what happened in Kuje actually took place in spite of all the security arrangement that has been made to ensure that such an incident does not happen.\n\n\u201cWe are assuring the nation and Nigerians in general that arrangements have been made to ensure that full investigations are carried out to ensure that a repeat of these incidences will not occur. The service chiefs have been given very clear directives to ensure that adequate measures are taken not only to investigate what happened, but also to take steps to forestall the reoccurrence of such incidences. We call on Nigerians to continue to support the Federal Government, in its effort to ensure that we fight criminalities to finish and to ensure that this country is brought back to normalcy in a more secure and a more peaceful atmosphere.\n\n\u201cWe are moving toward 2023, and government is committed to ensuring that there\u2019s peace, tranquility to ensure a very credible and a peaceful and transparent elections in Osun State come early next week.\u201d",

In his message, the President assured Nigerians that he won\u2019t rest until he brings relief to Nigerians, adding that he is quite aware of the difficulties people are facing. He promised that he is working to resolve them. He called on Nigerians to put the interest of the country above selfish interests and to \u201cuse religion as a motivation for the love of our common humanity.\u201d\n\nMr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the Lagos State governor, urged Nigerians, especially Muslims to imbibe the lessons of the sacrifice made by Prophet Ibrahim and work for the unity, peace and progress of the nation.\n\nIn a public statement issued on his behalf by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, assured that Rivers State government would continue to protect the rights of every citizen in the state and to guarantee the freedom of worship and association as enshrined in the constitution.\n\nGovernor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, of Rivers State, wished Muslim faithful and all Nigerians a pleasant and safe celebration while urging them to rededicate themselves to God and to continue to pray fervently for the peace, unity, security and progress of the nation. Former Senate President Bukola Saraki, while congratulating Nigerian Muslims and other faithful across the world urged members of the Ummah in Nigeria to use the occasion of the festival to pray for peace, security, unity, and prosperity in the country because lack of these elements is threatening to disintegrate the country and set her people against each other.\n\nOsun Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, in a statement released by his Chief Press Secretary, Ismail Omipidan, the governor implored the Muslim faithful to always exhibit the act of genuine sacrifice and submission to the will of Allah, which he said, are the major lessons of the festival.\n\nGovernor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State yesterday put the Muslim community in Imo in a celebratory mood by giving them two cows and two truckloads of 50 kilogramme bags of rice to the admiration of their leaders. The entire Muslim community In Imo State which includes the Hausas, the Oba of Yaruba in Imo State, the Chairman and Secretary of the Hausa Community in Imo State and other leaders were around to receive the gifts.\n\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila urged Nigerian Muslims, to redouble their prayers for the country. Similarly, the minority caucus, in the House, in a statement by its leader, Ndudi Elumelu, charged Nigerians to use the occasion to pray for the country as well as renew their trust in God, with sense of patriotism towards nation building.\n\nAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the Presidential flag bearer for All Progressives Congress (APC), while extending greetings to all Muslims in Nigeria and around the world urged their Muslim faithful in Nigeria to take a stand against terror and injustice, especially the spate of violent attacks on innocent Nigerians.\u201d His wife, Senator Oluremi Tinubu prayed that the spirit of community, togetherness and compassionate generosity would bring good tidings to all as \u201cwe collectively confront our challenges as a nation and build a peaceful and prosperous Nigeria.\u201d\n\nOthers who sent out messages include Prof Nora Ladi Daduut, representing Plateau South at the National Assembly and Speaker, Nasarawa State House of Assembly Ibrahim Balarabe Abdullahi. While Daduut commended Muslims in Plateau South Senatorial district for the roles they have played in sustaining the peace, unity and development of the nation despite the numerous challenges confronting them, Abdullahi who wished all Muslims a successful Sallah celebration, emphasized the need for all to be law-abiding citizens and to remain committed to constituted authorities. In a press statement it released in Lagos, Globacom urged the Nigerian faithful to celebrate with love and to abide by the teachings of the Holy Koran. The Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Olalekan Balogun, Alli-Okunmade II, and the Chairman, Senate Committee on Local Contents, Teslim Folarin, urged the adherents of Islamic faith not to be carried away by wining and dining that the slaughtering of rams would naturally attract, but the essence of the revered and significant event.",

He was born in Zaria in the 1970s. Baba-Ahmed has a Bachelor of Science (Bsc) and Masters of Sciences (Msc) in Economics from the University of Maiduguri, Borno State.\n\nOn different social media platforms, social media users are optimistic that with Obi\u2019s choice, Nigeria is headed for better governance. Majority of these Nigerians are making posts and dropping comments on social media posts to support Obi\u2019s choice of vice president. A Facebook user, Munachiso Omoleme said that both men have the same ideology and mindset before now. She added that it was as if God has been preparing the two of them for a time like this to lead Nigerians to a new era. Another Facebook user, Edward Amah stated if one checks the profile of Baba-Ahmed and what he is doing at Baze University, then one will understand that Nigeria will do well with the super economist as the Vice President.\n\n\u201cTwo extremely intelligent men ruling a country like Nigeria would be one of the greatest miracles the world has seen in this century\u201d, he said.\n\nOne Obasanjo Oluwasogo revealed that Obi and Baba-Ahmed are the best brains to deploy for the national assignment to rescue Nigeria. He added that aside their educational qualifications, they have built successful careers, established lasting businesses, value human capital and abhor corruption.\n\nAnother Facebook user, Isabella Iloka wrote: \u201cA vibrant, sound, 48-year-old man from Kaduna. Have you heard him speak before? You will fall in love with him.\u201d\n\nQueens Ozegbe Obaze wrote: \u201cThis is a much better option that what other parties are presenting. These two men are young, vibrant and charismatic men who are truly hungry to change Nigeria. If the election was a job interview without any religious or ethnic attachment, I am sure no sensible employer who wants to run a successful business will employ old men over young, cerebral team of Peter Obi and Baba-Ahmed.\u201d\n\nFrank Abah said: \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t love these two young, energetic, intelligent, forward looking and detribalized men who are committed to rescuing Nigeria from a deadly clutch of corrupt, unrepentant and ethnically swayed old politicians? The persons who wouldn\u2019t love these two are undoubtedly enemies of Nigeria and haters of good things.\u201d\n\nKingsley Nzemechi said: \u201cThis is a great combination. Obi and Baba-Ahmed are two people who have the same ideology for the development of Nigeria. They are very competent and possess a good dose of integrity. They will give this country a paradigm shift. The choice before Nigerians is very simple, whether we want to live or die as a nation depends on what we do by February 2023.\u201d\n\nEmeka Osani said: \u201cWith these two men at the helm of affairs of this great nation, our tax payer\u2019s money will be saved from incessant medical treatment abroad. This is a wonderful combination and I hope it becomes a reality for the betterment of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nPeter Uche Ezeonye said: \u201cMr. Peter Obi is huge on economics while Dr. Yusuf Datti Ahmed is huge on education.

We are looking to see where we can partner with Nigeria. Certainly on security issues, on agriculture and on technology. And we\u2019re looking to see where but it\u2019s for the government and for the people of Nigeria to point us in the direction where we can help them work together.\n\n\u201cBut as the senator said, certainly in areas of training and in areas of others we\u2019ve been, we would be very interested in sharing best practice and sharing intelligence. We would certainly be interested in working together,\u201d he said. In his initial remarks, the host, Senator Orji Kalu expressed the readiness of the Senate to support the collaboration between Israel and Nigeria to curb insecurity in the country in aspects of ammunition and training.\n\nKalu maintained that Agriculture and Security are two key areas which Nigeria must tap from Israel, stating they are major aspects of Israel\u2019s expertise. On legislative partnership the Abia-North Senator stated that the National Assembly will be open to accept legislative bills sponsored by foreign nationals including Israelis that will strengthen the ties of both countries.\n\nSaid Kalu: \u201cThis ambassador is barely six months here. And we at the Senate will do everything possible to make sure the next appropriation will focus on Israel, and Israel will come over to give us important training in areas of security.\n\n\u201cWe are doing everything possible to maintain our relationship with the Israelis and then. You know? The Israeli history is a successful history. And if Nigeria can learn two things from the Israelis, which are security and agriculture, we shall make a lot of progress and we\u2019ll go a long way.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk too much about what Israelis can do. I have one of the agricultural companies that revolutionised Agriculture in the northern part of Nigeria in terms of equipment and all, \u201cSotadan Suki\u201d used to be their chairman and I hope that we can find common ground with the Israeli companies. The government and people should talk about two things \u2013 agriculture and security. These are areas which the Israelis have a lot of expertise in.

I realised it was time to ascend to that kingly sphere where I belong. Ebiye is a perfect blend of the best of the best ever to do it in comedy. I\u2019ve been over the years influenced by a lot of comedians such as Eddie Murphy, Richard Pryor, Basket Mouth Bovi, AY, Okey Bakassi to name a few. I have studied their excellence over the years and watched every performance and as a comedy addict, you can tell in my excellence.\n\nMy style of comedy\n\nMy comedy is spontaneous and natural; these stand me out. I just have a very different mind and I see the jokes in everything and anyone. My act on stage or behind the cameras inspire me but mostly off cameras when I see how happy people are because of what I do on cameras.\n\nRelating my brand to the brands I work with\n\nI try to make brands understand how natural my vibe is. I\u2019m currently a brand ambassador for Online Alaba and Yobs Kitchen and I\u2019ve done influencing jobs for over thirty brands. Due to how naturally-funny my skits are, the audience doesn\u2019t get a forced brand on them. I don\u2019t shove my brands in the faces of my audience instead, I make the audience through my jokes understand why they should patronize my partner brands and hey they get to laugh too!\n\nMy most difficult skit\n\nIt\u2019s got to be a skit I did with about fifteen people. I had never rehearsed so much in my life for a skit but most times it\u2019s less stressful when I am alone in my skits. I always try to give meaning to all I do and that\u2019s what everyone who indulge in my content gets to see. Originality is key and I bring it into my creations as pure and as authentic as possible because you can\u2019t actually see an Ebiye content and not laugh.\n\nJourney so far\n\nIt\u2019s been a beautiful one and the highlight of my beautiful comical journey is when I received an award about nineteen years ago from my primary school, Rightville, Surulere for the \u201cMost Humorous Child.\u201d That for me was the moment my vision came clear, my love for comedy grew as I always would make my friends in school laugh from primary to university. I chased comedy like a lion chases his prey and I caught comedy and ate it, I guess.\n\nThe road ahead is promising and I\u2019m very hopeful for all that\u2019s going to come along as I journey this part of success. My brand is dear to me and I hold it in high esteem knowing fully well what becomes of it is totally in my control. I would also be forever grateful to my mum\u2019s brother, Peter Udom for assisting my mum in training I and my sister to the best schools one can ever attend.",

          "text": "Ferdinand Ekechukwu\n\nThere had been quite a number of posts celebrating his birthday following a poster shared on his Instagram page a week earlier. \u201cA Toast to Olu Jacobs 80th Birthday Celebration\u201d, boldly reads the message. His wife and amazon of the silver screen, Joke Silva, had hinted at his 80th birthday celebration on her Instagram page when she shared a throwback picture of her husband. She captioned the photo \u201cWho has the foggiest idea who this handsome young man is? #80th birthday loading\u2026\u201d\n\nThis prompted a brief exchange between this reporter and Joke Silva. \u201cGood morning\u2026 His date of birth is 11/7/42\u201d, she affirmed. Olu Jacobs will clock 80 on Monday 11th of July, 2022. Adding to our exchange that she feels \u201cGrateful and thankful to celebrate his 80th. Just plain touched and moved by the outpouring of love for him from people from all over and from all walks of life. Good is good\u201d.\n\nOludotun Baiyewu Jacobs, simply well-known as Olu Jabobs, is one of Nigeria\u2019s finest gifts. The world has been his stage for many years and he played without fear. A seasoned actor who has starred in numerous Nigerian and British drama series and movies, Olu Jacobs has performed with uncommon grace while gracing our screens. But age is here and has slowed the veteran.\n\nHowever, neither age nor frailty can diminish his status in Nigeria\u2019s film and theater industry. By any conceivable parameters, Olu Jacobs is a successful professional who has paid his dues in the industry and is thus mostly respected by all. With over five decades of his life in bringing joy and entertainment to many homes in Nigeria and beyond.\n\nThe deluge of love since the news of his forthcoming 80th birthday made the rounds has been overwhelming. Olu Jacobs is one of those who made good use of their skills to pursue a worthy career, benefiting society and country. Jacobs\u2019 acting talent showed up early. His career had a highly focused and fruitful trajectory: he made his mark in innovation and mentoring, both in theatre arts and in Nigeria\u2019s movie industry.\n\nIn secondary school, he joined debating and drama societies, trying out on stage and building his craft. This interest was later confirmed after he discovered Chief Hubert Ogunde, the Nigerian actor, playwright, theatre manager and musician who founded the first contemporary professional theatrical company in Nigeria. Jacobs attended one of Ogunde\u2019s annual concert parties in Kano and became convinced of his path.\n\nLike the best of his contemporaries \u2013 at a time when Nigerian universities could not offer many options \u2013 he pursued his higher education abroad. In 1964, Jacobs travelled to Britain to study. He took up a spot at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London, studying acting. Jacob also worked with various repertoire theatres in Britain and Ireland and starred in several British television series and international movies.\n\nHe returned home in 1980, just like many other Nigerians looking to develop their home societies, to enrich the federation and encourage young talents to find local success. Cinema wasn\u2019t just work for Jacobs, it was life itself. In 1989 he married Joke Silva, another veteran actor and a graduate of the University of Lagos and the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London.\n\nThey have both enjoyed being together as a couple many years down the line despite their stardom and individual roles. That togetherness has taken them far as best friends and life partners for over 35 years. A multi-award winning actor and producer, scriptwriter, broadcaster, businessman and entrepreneur, Olu Jacobs has been hailed by many as one of the greatest and most widely respected African actors of his generation.\n\nHe has also received awards both within and outside the country for his professional achievements. He is also a national honour recipient. He was conferred with the National Honour of the Member of the Federal Republic, MFR, by President Goodluck Jonathan in 2011. Recently, he was also conferred with a Lifetime Achievement Award by Africa International Film Festival, AFRIFF, as did African Movie Academy Awards, AMAA, in 2016.\n\nHe was honoured with the Industry Merit Award for outstanding achievements in acting at the 2013 Africa Magic Viewers\u2019 Choice Awards. His legion of viewers and well-wishers from around the globe wish this father-figure, actor and cultural icon many more years.",

          "text": "Baba Fela\u2019s iconic \u2018Water no get enemy\u2019 track from his 1975 album titled \u2018Music is the Weapon\u2019 remains a popular catchphrase among Nigerians in the 21st century. The track, in its entirety, spoke loudly about the crucial role of water in our daily lives and how humans and water are inseparable. A remarkably interesting line in the song says: \u2018If water kill your child, na water you go use\u2019, an allusion to the fact that even if water caused you havoc, you still cannot avoid using water.\n\nFela, through the hit track, creatively illustrated the strong bond between humans and water. Forty-seven years after, a brand, through the ingenuity of its handlers, was able to relate this bond to that of true friendship among human beings.\n\nAquafina Water, with the new #PadiofLife campaign, emphasizes human relationship with water as true friendship, which every human craves for.\n\nNoteworthy is how the campaign got people talking. In different clips of the #PadiofLife campaign, Aquafina brand ambassadors, Nollywood actors, Kate Henshaw, Jemima Osunde, Jide Kene, Munachi Abii and popular Twitter personality, Aproko Doctor, expressed their love for Aquafina water in a manner they would have done for a true and reliable friend. The captivating teasers generated reactions and customer engagement across social media platforms and on radio.\n\nSocial media has over time become an agenda-setter for public discussions, and the #PadiofLife campaign was a notable instance. In one of the high points on Twitter, controversial social media personality, Daniel Regha, gave his usual unsolicited advice with a comment on Kate Henshaw\u2019s video. The conversation took a life of its own. Hashtag #PadiofLife started trending and thousands of handles latched on to it to share their personal friendship stories.\n\nThe conversation spiraled offline, as on-air radio personalities also made Padi of Life a topic of discussion on their shows. Listeners were given the opportunity to phone-in and give a shout-out to their Padi of Life.\n\nIn a creative and engaging manner, the campaign has drawn attention to the fact that Aquafina is more than just water. The #Padioflife campaign highlighted Aquafina\u2019s premium brand status, the importance of choosing a brand you can trust. The campaign also explored Aquafina\u2019s \u2018Purity Guaranteed\u2019 mantra and the purification process that places Aquafina premium bottled water ahead of the crowd.\n\nLikewise, the campaign is a pointer to Aquafina\u2019s drive for healthy living. Aquafina is a major promoter of a healthy lifestyle among Nigerians, with the sponsorship of health events, shows, and sporting activities. The bottled water brand has been a major player in the Nigerian market for years and is one of the few brands in the premium category. Aquafina is produced by the makers of Pepsi and is retailed in three bottle sizes of 50cl and 75cl and 150cl, available in major cities across Nigeria. So, the next time you think of pure drinking water, go for Aquafina premium drinking water.",

          "text": "Victor Okpala\n\nFilmmaker Victor Okpala has been in the industry and has a good number of television films, series and cinema projects credited to his name. In this interview with Ferdinand Ekechukwu, Okpala shares influences, aspects, and moments leading to his journey in the industry as he debuts his first cinema directorial titled Tiger \u2018s Tail\n\nTell us about your journey into the movie industry?\n\nWell, right from childhood, I have always been a lover of the arts. From literary and debating society to cultural groups in secondary schools, I knew I will end up in the arts sector. When I got into the university, even though I was in the social sciences, I was always with the theatre department rehearsing and holding drama sessions. Once I left school, I knew where to go but had to work a bit here and there then off to film school. Once I got back I registered my company and started with TV series production Eagle Eye which was syndicated in about 18 stations nationwide. While doing TV, I started working with other filmmakers as producer or line producer then went on to direct and the rest they say is history.\n\nHow long have you been in the industry and how many movie projects have you been involved in?\n\nI have been around professionally since 2010 and I have done over 40 TV films, 10 TV series and about 5 cinema projects.\n\nWhat has the experience been like working in the industry as a filmmaker?\n\nThe experience has been good and rewarding. Sometimes you face a big challenge that will almost make you want to give up but you keep striving and of course it gets better by the day.\n\nWhat was your aspiration growing up?\n\nLike I said earlier, I had always wanted to be in the arts but as a small boy I didn\u2019t quite know what part of arts business I will be in but I always knew. Example, I wrote an entire magazine as a junior secondary student and wanted to publish it. I read every novel or magazine I could lay my hands on, watched every foreign film or cartoon released then. All those things shaped my love for the arts. My mom wanted me to be a full-time pastor and others wanted me to be a lawyer but here I am doing what God has ordained me to do.\n\nWhat aspect of your growing up years influenced your present career in filmmaking?\n\nI was an avid reader of every magazine or novel you can think of. I was a very introverted young man growing up with my granny; I had all the time to read every book, novel and magazines. I watched a lot of Hollywood films. I also grew up on local magazines like Papa Ajasco, Dauda and the likes. I remember I used to buy those mini magazines with my lunch money while in secondary school. So, yes, that aspect shaped me. I also sang in the choir and church band.\n\nWhat inspires the type/kind of stories you tell?\n\nSo many events in and around my life always inspires me to tell my kind of stories. I grew up watching Rambo and the likes, Mr. Bean for comedy and many other cartoons. So, I like to tell more of action stories or what we call thriller.\n\nYou have your first cinema directorial Tiger\u2019s Tail which comes out soon. Tell us about it\u2026\n\nTiger\u2019s Tail is a project of passion, love and everything in between. We started the journey pre Covid-19 and of course Covid-19 happened and we slowed down and didn\u2019t do it again till this year. It was supposed to happen in 2020 but here we are. Let me not say much about it so I won\u2019t give away anything. I implore everyone to go watch it in the cinemas from 22nd July and see the magic we made. They won\u2019t be disappointed at all.\n\nHow did you come up with the story and how long did it take to shoot Tiger\u2019s Tail?\n\nI conceived the story in 2020 and started piecing it together. I have always, always wanted to tell a socially relevant story that will resonate and make impact. I have done that with my TV movies and series for many years, so when the idea came i called my writers and we started working on it and here we are with one of the best films you will see this summer in the cinemas all over Nigeria, Ghana and Cameroon\n\nYou have a lineup of fantastic actors in the movie (Zubby Michael, Kelechi Udegbe, Alexx Ekuboh, Etinosa Idemudia, Nosa Rex and a host of others) \u2013 how was it working with them?\n\nWorking with these actors was pure bliss, not off course without the usual little challenges here and there but they were amazing set of people to work with. Alex has been my friend and working partner for many years so it was very easy to work with him. Zubby is a brother and we bonded as brothers. Rex has been a friend. You cannot have issues with Etinosa because she\u2019s a free spirit. Tacha was her 1st ever movie before or after BBN house. All the actors on the project are amazing and have continued to be so supporting and promoting the movie. It\u2019s a family affair and I love them all\n\nWhat makes Tiger\u2019s Tail different? Why should people go and see it? What should the viewers expect?\n\nWe are used to a kind of movie here in Nigeria but Tigers tail is refreshingly different and action packed with a lot of romance and drama. It\u2019s a pot-pourri of entertainment and the audience will live every minute of it.\n\nAre you adept to making any particular genre or film?\n\nI love to make action packed movies that will keep people on the edge of their seats and off course topped with romance and a lot of drama. Black Panther is a movie i will never forget in a hurry. We are getting there by God\u2019s grace.\n\nWhat\u2019s your goal as a filmmaker?\n\nMy goal is simple; to keep getting better at my craft and satisfying my teeming fans with every of my film and of course better things will always follow.",

          "text": "Ferdinand Ekechukwu\n\nSound of pseudo gunshot twice. Not the kind heard at a recent nightclub shooting which is still being investigated. But one that greeted his entry on stage at a recent concert where he performed to a sold-out crowd. It sure amplified that moment as fans got ecstatic. The set that followed next and the reception was good to write home about as always. After all, it\u2019s Burna Boy.\n\nThe Grammy-winning artiste is set to perform again this July during a summer tour dubbed \u201cLove, Damini.\u201d His performance has been the talk of social media, with a number of his fans singing his praises from Norway to Portugal to Wembley where the megastar performed a single \u2018For My Hand\u2019 featuring Ed Sheeran at Ed Sheeran\u2019s Wembley Stadium show last Weekend.\n\nThe single is off Burna Boy\u2019s latest studio album \u2018Love, Damini\u2019, which he dropped on July 8 via Atlantic Records. The singer had told Billboard the title of the Long Play (LP) is particularly personal to him. It bears his name Damini. Featuring a number of guest appearances from Ed Sheeran, Popcaan, Victony, J Balvin, Blxst, J Hus, Kehlani, Ladysmith, and Black Mambazo.\n\n\u2018Love, Damini\u2019 is Burna Boy\u2019s 6th album after his debut album \u2018L.I.F.E\u2019, \u2018On a Spaceship\u2019, \u2018Outside\u2019, \u2018African Giant\u2019, and \u2018Twice as Tall\u2019. On Love, Damini, Burna Boy has already officially released two songs from the album \u2013 \u2018Kilometre\u2019 and \u2018Last Last\u2019 with the latter enjoying impressive level of success. The Afro-fusion artist also shared a music video for the single, which he self-directed.\n\nThe vibe-y, mid-tempo song finds him reflecting on past relationships before ultimately concluding everything will be okay which many of his fans believe spoke about the relationship he had with Stefflon Don and how they eventually broke up. Don, in the same vein, released a new single she calls \u2018First of All\u2019 which is believed her reply to Burna\u2019s.\n\nThe track, produced by Chopstix, features sample of American singer Toni Braxton\u2019s 2000 R&B hit, \u201cHe Wasn\u2019t Man Enough.\u201d Off the heels of the success of the perceived break-up song, Burna has shared new details about the hit single which has got everyone talking. In a recent interview, the Nigerian star spoke on sampling Braxton\u2019s song.\n\nHe went ahead to speak on how sampling the song was his idea and how it was something he really wanted to do. Not stopping there, Burna also added that it was a special creative process for him getting the producer, Chopstix to actualise it. However, fans became more interested when the Nigerian star spoke on how much royalties Braxton was making from Last Last.\n\nAccording to Burna, the American singer makes 60% from the earnings of \u2018Last Last\u2019. This caused quite a stir on social media with many people expressing their shock, wondering how much he makes from the song after his record label, Atlantic Records, had taken their official cut. However, Burna Boy noted that he wasn\u2019t complaining.\n\nWhile he is a successful digital artiste, his live shows accounts for a huge part of his earning. And with a catalogue and statesmanship that has helped him to sell out arenas across Europe, Burna Boy wouldn\u2019t mind giving up a good part of his streaming pay if it means making great singles.",

          "text": "It was a sunny Saturday afternoon in Gaa-Lamba, a community in the Asa Local Government Area of Kwara State.\n\nSalamatu Ayinde, a 26-year-old nursing mother, stood in front of her house with a worried look on her face.\n\nBorehole at Gaa-Lamba Village\n\nClad in a brown-striped wrapper that barely covered her chest, the nursing mother had her gaze fixed on the ground and one hand on her collarbone.\n\nMs Ayinde was lost in thought when SaharaReporters approached her to inquire about the Zonal Intervention Project (ZIP)-facilitated borehole in her community.\n\nShe looked up with a jolt, sighed and began to complain bitterly.\n\n\u201cThat borehole has never been useful to us.

But, the finding shows that even though the new borehole was installed, it could not serve the people beyond a few after it was opened.\n\nThe Water Situation In Kwara\n\nPoor access to clean and potable water for use in many households across Nigeria has contributed majorly to the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and several others.\n\nAccording to data from Water and Sanitary Hygiene National Outcome Routine Mapping (WASH NORM) in 2019, only 14 per cent of the country\u2019s population have access to safely managed drinking water supply facilities.\n\nThe survey also shows that access for people in rural communities is four times less than the population of urban areas. This is due to such supply points being more than 30 minutes away from their homes.\n\nMeanwhile, in a recent report by UNICEF and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the north-central region ranks lowest of all geopolitical zones in the number of people using basic water supply, sanitation services.\n\nOut of the 36 states and the federal capital territory (FCT), Kwara ranks 36th, just a step above Ebonyi which sits at the bottom of the table.\n\nUNICEF reports that when sources of water are not within immediate premises, women and children pay the price of water collection.\n\nThe N100M Water Projects\n\nTo bring potable water closer to the people of his constituency, In 2020, a member of the Federal House of Representatives, representing Asa/Ilorin West Federal Constituency, Abdulyekeen Alajagusi, nominated projects for the provision of motorized boreholes at Alapa/Onire Odegiwa Ward and at Afon, in the Asa Local Government Area of Kwara State at the sum of N25 million each (N50 Million in total).\n\nThe projects, which were part of the 2020 Appropriation Act, were aimed at resolving water scarcity across six villages. These villages are Gaa-Lamba, Labintan Alakuko, Giwa-Olowo, Ile Baale Afon, Sakama, and Gaa-Igboroko. It was placed under the supervision of the Lower Niger River Basin Development Authority (LNRBDA).\n\nA document released by the supervising agency which was obtained by SaharaReporters revealed that the budgeted sum (N100,000,000.00) was totally cash-backed on the projects.\n\nOn-site fact-finding\n\nTo monitor the projects, SaharaReporters embarked on site verification of these borehole projects supervised by the Lower Niger River Basin Development Authority (LNRBDA) at Alapa/Onire Odegiwa Ward.\n\nVisits to the locations of these projects revealed that although new boreholes were installed at these villages, except for the one built at Giwa Olowo village that was found still serving the community, the other two installed at Labintan Alakuko and 0Gaa-Lamba could not solve the problem of water scarcity in these communities.\n\nThe borehole built at Gaa-Lamba was not functioning during SaharaReporters\u2019 investigation, while that of Labitan Alakuko was functioning but could not serve the population that depended on it.\n\n\"The borehole is working but the problem is that it is not pumping water well,\" said Ismaila Alao, a resident of Labitan Alakuko Village.\n\n\"To fetch a 25-litre jerry-can, you would need to wait for at least an hour and this is why many residents do not even bother about the borehole.\n\n\"As you can see, it has been a while since we went there because no one is ready to contribute money to buy petrol and at the end, the borehole will not pump well,\" he added.\n\nLike many disadvantaged communities in Kwara, where the presence of government was not felt in any way, people of Labitan Alakuko village have many years relied on wells and a stream for their survival and the women in the communities have to struggle daily with walking long distances to the stream to fetch water for drinking, cooking and doing chores.\n\nWhen the borehole had just been drilled, it was a dream come true as women, children and men joyfully thought going to streams to get water would be a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cBut we are still going to the streams to fetch water because the borehole is not enough for us,\" said a woman who was too angered to give her name.\n\nAFON\n\nWhen SaharaReporters visited the locations for the second phase of the projects in Afon, it was discovered that boreholes were installed at Ile Baale Afon, Sakama and Gaa-Igboroko villages.\n\nWhile the people of Ile-Baale Afon were still benefiting from the water project installed in front of their community, residents of Sakama and Gaa-Igboroko complained of lack of water as the boreholes installed were not functioning. They were still forced to trek long distances to neighbouring villages in search of potable water.\n\nBalikisu, a mother of five who is a resident of Sakama village said, \"We fetch water from wells or streams. And Sometimes, we pay pushcart users money to get water for us to drink and do our house chores.\n\n\"All this would have stopped if the borehole installed for us was working well,\" Balikisu added.\n\n\n\nLNRBDA Spends 50 Million Naira On Ote-Ballah Dam But No Value Derives\n\nAnother water project nominated in 2020 by Abdulyekeen Alajagusi for the people of his constituency was the rehabilitation of the Ote-Ballah Dam. N50 million was allocated in the 2020 Federal Government budget for the rehabilitation of this dam in the Asa Local Government Area of Kwara.\n\nAccording to the information received from Lower Niger River Basin Development Authority (LNRBDA), the total sum of N50M was released to rehabilitate the dam which has been abandoned since 2003 and awarded to Micheal Jacobs Consulting Limited.\n\nA visit to the dam by SaharaReporters showed that despite the public funds committed to the project, residents of the communities are yet to derive value for the money as they still scramble for water to meet their daily needs.\n\n\"It has been over ten years we fetched tap water here,\" said Kamaru Yusuf, a resident of Alalubosa Area, Ote, in the Asa local government area.\n\nAnother resident of Ote who identified herself as Amope said for the past seven years since she was married into the community, she had never fetched water from the tap.\n\n\"We only get water from hand-pupping boreholes and wells,\" Amope said.\n\nContractor Speaks\n\nWhen contacted for comment, Fatai Aberi, the Managing Director of Fab Confidential Limited told SaharaReporters\u2019 correspondent that they had completed the project and got a 'satisfied' acknowledgement after the needed assessment from LNRBDA, the supervisory agency.\n\nHe said despite the N25 million contract sum released for the project, he also used part of his personal funds to see that the project was complete\n\nBut when told about the situation of some of the boreholes that stopped supplying water shortly after inauguration, he said, \"For now, I can't promise anything but we will try and see what we can do.\"\n\nNo Comment on Ote-Ballah Dam\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, all efforts to get the reaction of the lawmaker regarding his failure to rehabilitate dam projects he had facilitated for members of his constituency were not successful. He did not answer several calls from SaharaReporters and did not reply to text and Whatsapp messages sent to his mobile line.\n\nAlso, Micheal Jacobs Consulting Limited, the company that handled the project, did not return several calls, text messages, and Whatsapp messages sent to them, asking for their comment on the dam project.",

See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Anti-graft Agency, ICPC Moves N2.1bn Recovered From Ex-Army Chief, Buratai To Central Bank, To Seek Forfeiture Of Posh Vehicles, House, Others\n\nIn reaction, Buratai demanded from SaharaReporters a retraction with an apology carried with the same prominence on its platform and two national dailies for seven (7) consecutive days.\n\nThe retired General also claimed the story had dented his reputation.\n\nThe letter reads partly, \u201cTukur Buratai (hereafter referred to as \u201cour Client\u201d) on whose firm instruction and authority we write you. See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Anti-corruption Agency, ICPC Top Official, Jabaru, Interfered With Investigation, Didn't Allow Full Disclosure Of Recovered Funds, Others During Raid Of Buratai's Property\n\n\u201cWe refer to your publication dated 23rd day of June 2022 with the caption \u201cEXCLUSIVE: Anti-graft Agency, ICPC Uncovers Billion of Cash Meant for Arms, Ammunition To Fight Boko Haram in Abuja Home of Ex-Chief of Army Staff, Buratai.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the said publication, you alleged that the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offenses Commission (ICPC) had recovered N1.85 billion from a house and office said to belong to our Client. It was further reported by you that \u201cthe huge cash was part of the billions of Naira earmarked for the purchase of arms and ammunition by the Muhammadu Buhari-led government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a very serious allegation capable of brewing hatred and attack by the public against our Client as a former Chief of Army Staff. There is no doubt that Nigerians are seriously concerned about the security situation of the country and the said publication has portrayed our Client as a person responsible for diversion of funds meant for the fight against Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cConsequently, our Client has been exposed to hate, ridicule and embarrassment from members of the public with his friends calling him from different parts of the world to ask for explanations. See Also Corruption PHOTOS: Safe With Foreign Currencies, Posh Vehicles Recovered From Ex-Army Chief, Buratai\n\n\u201cThe publication is not only false but malicious and an attempt to malign the reputation of our Client. Our Client who is the current Ambassador to Benin Republic rose through the ranks and became a Lieutenant General in the Nigerian Army before his retirement in the year 2021. Our Client who was also a former Chief of Army Staff from July 2015 to 2021 has taken the battle against insurgency to the field with enormous energy and resources as well as loss of field officers.\n\n\u201cBy your publication, our Client has been ridiculed as a man without honour, dignity and incapable of representing Nigeria and portrayed as a fraudster/dishonest person before Nigerians and the international community. See Also Military REVEALED: Identity Of Civil Servant Who Took Bail Of Military Contractor Arrested In Buratai\u2019s Abuja House With Multibillion-Naira Cash, Vehicles, Rolex Watches\n\n\u201cWe hereby demand that you retract your publication with a public apology to our Client within Seven (7) days of receiving this letter and a public apology to be published in two national dallies in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTAKE NOTICE that if you fall, neglect and/or refuse to publish the apology within seven (7) from today, we shall not hesitate to commence legal action against your organisation for defamation.

          "text": "A former Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Tukur Buratai (retd.) has threatened to sue SaharaReporters for exposing the discovery of billions in cash meant for arms and ammunition to fight Boko Haram in his Abuja home.\n\nBuratai made the threat in a letter signed by his counsel, R.O Atabo, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), to the newspaper.\n\nBuratai\n\nSaharaReporters had exclusively reported how the ICPC recovered funds (including foreign currencies) from a house registered to someone fronting for Buratai, a military contractor and Managing Director of K Salam Construction Company Nigeria Limited, Mr. Kabiru Sallau.\n\nAlso recovered were G-Wagon; 2022 editions of BMW and Mercedes Benz cars; customized mobile phones; several designer wrist watches, including three Rolexes, and some property documents.\n\nBuratai, a retired Lieutenant General was the COAS between 2015 and 2021. See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: Anti-graft Agency, ICPC Moves N2.1bn Recovered From Ex-Army Chief, Buratai To Central Bank, To Seek Forfeiture Of Posh Vehicles, House, Others\n\nIn reaction, Buratai demanded from SaharaReporters a retraction with an apology carried with the same prominence on its platform and two national dailies for seven (7) consecutive days.\n\nThe retired General also claimed the story had dented his reputation.\n\nThe letter reads partly, \u201cTukur Buratai (hereafter referred to as \u201cour Client\u201d) on whose firm instruction and authority we write you. See Also Exclusive EXCLUSIVE: How Anti-corruption Agency, ICPC Top Official, Jabaru, Interfered With Investigation, Didn't Allow Full Disclosure Of Recovered Funds, Others During Raid Of Buratai's Property\n\n\u201cWe refer to your publication dated 23rd day of June 2022 with the caption \u201cEXCLUSIVE: Anti-graft Agency, ICPC Uncovers Billion of Cash Meant for Arms, Ammunition To Fight Boko Haram in Abuja Home of Ex-Chief of Army Staff, Buratai.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the said publication, you alleged that the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offenses Commission (ICPC) had recovered N1.85 billion from a house and office said to belong to our Client. It was further reported by you that \u201cthe huge cash was part of the billions of Naira earmarked for the purchase of arms and ammunition by the Muhammadu Buhari-led government.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a very serious allegation capable of brewing hatred and attack by the public against our Client as a former Chief of Army Staff. There is no doubt that Nigerians are seriously concerned about the security situation of the country and the said publication has portrayed our Client as a person responsible for diversion of funds meant for the fight against Boko Haram.\n\n\u201cConsequently, our Client has been exposed to hate, ridicule and embarrassment from members of the public with his friends calling him from different parts of the world to ask for explanations. See Also Corruption PHOTOS: Safe With Foreign Currencies, Posh Vehicles Recovered From Ex-Army Chief, Buratai\n\n\u201cThe publication is not only false but malicious and an attempt to malign the reputation of our Client. Our Client who is the current Ambassador to Benin Republic rose through the ranks and became a Lieutenant General in the Nigerian Army before his retirement in the year 2021. Our Client who was also a former Chief of Army Staff from July 2015 to 2021 has taken the battle against insurgency to the field with enormous energy and resources as well as loss of field officers.\n\n\u201cBy your publication, our Client has been ridiculed as a man without honour, dignity and incapable of representing Nigeria and portrayed as a fraudster/dishonest person before Nigerians and the international community. See Also Military REVEALED: Identity Of Civil Servant Who Took Bail Of Military Contractor Arrested In Buratai\u2019s Abuja House With Multibillion-Naira Cash, Vehicles, Rolex Watches\n\n\u201cWe hereby demand that you retract your publication with a public apology to our Client within Seven (7) days of receiving this letter and a public apology to be published in two national dallies in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cTAKE NOTICE that if you fall, neglect and/or refuse to publish the apology within seven (7) from today, we shall not hesitate to commence legal action against your organisation for defamation. It is hoped that you would comply to avoid the unpleasantness of litigation and its attendant consequences.\u201d",

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: Freelance digital marketer Baraka Mafole wants Tanzanians to thrive in the digital economy",
          "text": "In 2019, Baraka Mafole, then 19, gained admission into the National Institute of Transport (NIT), Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to undertake a bachelor\u2019s degree in information technology (IT). He was excited about this. But then, things took a wrong turn.\n\nAfter discovering that his fellow students were making money online, Mafole decided to join them; he spent hours learning digital skills. But this distracted him from attending classes. As a result, he failed his first-year university exams and was expelled from the university. He didn\u2019t sulk, though. Instead, he started applying for opportunities at different companies. At first he was rejected by many companies he pitched to because, according to them, he wasn\u2019t skilled enough.\n\nHe pored over online courses on YouTube, Udemy, and other educational technology platforms to learn more about digital marketing and social media management. After upskilling, he resumed his search for jobs. This time around, he was successful; a startup in Dar es Salaam hired him as a social media manager.\n\nBut 4 months into the job, he quit. His confidence in his skills had grown, and he was receiving multiple offers for lucrative digital marketing and design gigs.\n\nIn 2020, he decided to become a full-time freelancer. That same year, he registered on online freelancing platform, Upwork, and since he joined, he has earned at least $4,000 from gigs\u2014over a dozen times more than the country\u2019s upper range TZS 315,000 ($135) for minimum wage. He has been awarded a top-rated badge (for earning more than $1,000 on the platform).\n\nShortly after he began making money on Upwork, he began sharing his freelancing journey online, which helped him build a large online following and get invited to speak at events.\n\nIn the last decade, the Tanzanian digital ecosystem has evolved as more Tanzanian citizens have access to digital services. In 2010, just 18.5% of the country\u2019s population had mobile phones. That number has grown 6-fold to reach 82% or 50 million people in 2021. Similarly, mobile internet penetration has grown 5-fold from 2.9% or 3 million people in 2010 to 25% or 15 million people in 2021\u2014with 12 million new mobile internet subscribers added over the decade. Within this period, the East African country has seen significant economic growth\u2014average annual GDP growth of 7%\u2014which has improved the lives of its citizens. This growth and improvement in quality of living can be traced to the use of digital technologies to improve access to key services such as education, agricultural market information, healthcare, financial services and employment, through digital technologies.\n\nIn recent years, Tanzania has seen heavy investments in fibre infrastructure in recent years to connect more Tanzanians to the internet. Back in 2016, the government updated the Tanzanian National ICT Policy of 2003, in what serves as a recognition of the contribution of the ICT sector to promoting socio-economic development in the country.\n\nDigital technology is poised to help Tanzania in achieving its developmental goals. Already, the mobile industry contributes 5.2% (or $5.2 billion) to Tanzania\u2019s GDP, and employs 2.6 % (or 1.5 million) of its total population.\n\nBut despite having an impressive 2.6% unemployment rate, millions of young Tanzanians remain unemployed, and the skills of those that are currently employed risk becoming obsolete in the coming years if they don\u2019t book their place in the digital economy.\n\nFrom university withdrawal to helping thousands of unemployed\n\nDuring his one year away from school, Mafole discovered that a communication degree could improve his chances of getting higher-paying gigs. So in 2021, he returned to the University of Dar es Salaam to study communication.\n\nOne day in May 2021, another enterprising Tanzanian, Leyla Mohamed reached out to him, out of the blue, and encouraged him to spread his impact further by training young people on digital skills. This led them to co-found an initiative called Tanzania Digital Trailblazers later that month, a series of virtual events to bring awareness of digital skills to young Tanzanians.\n\nAfter 3 months, the co-founders changed the initiative\u2019s name to one in Swahili, Sanuka Kidijitali (roughly meaning, \u201cGet informed fast about the digital world\u201d) to help people easily recall the name better. This time around, they added physical monthly digital skills training events to the mix. This helped Sanuk Kidijitali train over 300 people on digital skills such as writing, digital marketing, and blockchain; guides to get jobs on freelancing on job platforms such as Upwork, Fiverr, and LinkedIn; using video conferencing platforms such as Zoom and Google Meet to speak with clients, and other digital tools such as Canva and Wix for various digital tasks.\n\nSanuk Kidijitali has a 3,000-strong community of young people in various Telegram groups that it is training and connecting to opportunities. It has also spread its awareness through its newly developed university outreach programme to university students across Tanzania, starting from the University of Dar es Salaam.\n\nSanuka Kidijitali launched a podcast, The Founders Confessions, where its co-founder Mohamed, speaks with startup founders in Tanzania to start and increase conversation about the digital economy in the country. Mafole is the country director of Social Media Day Tanzania, an event which took place last Saturday, on July 2, at the Nkrumah Hall, University of Dar es Salam. It brought together digital entrepreneurs for networking while offering them upskilling sessions.\n\n\u201cOur plan at Sanuka Kidijitali is to reach as many youths as we can, as we currently reach 5,000 plus, but one day we will hit our target of 100,000 per year,\u201d Mafole, who is also Sanuka Kidijitali\u2019s chief operating officer (CPO), told TechCabal.\n\n\u201cWe have an employment problem and digital jobs are a solution to this problem, but university students can\u2019t use computers and unemployed graduates do not have digital skills,\u201d he said.\n\nMafole said that dozens of Tanzanian youths have connected with his story and have been inspired to upgrade their lives by learning digital skills. After discovering that only 18 Tanzanian freelancers have earned over $1,000 on Upwork as compared to Kenya\u2019s 300, he realised that his country is playing catch-up. \u201cMy task is to help people who don\u2019t have digital skills build them and also help those that do identify and navigate freelancing platforms to get jobs,\u201d he explained.\n\nBut it is not all rosy, Mafole warned. Tanzanian freelancers still have to deal with inaccessible payment gateways or cut-throat transaction costs, high data pricing, and bad internet connection. And that\u2019s not all. They also have to deal with societal stereotypes. \u201cMany Tanzanians still see freelancing as an extra job and not as a real job. When you tell people you are a freelancer, they make you feel like you are unemployed,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "These founders are closing delivery gaps in Rwanda\u2019s capital",
          "text": "In the past 2 years, stories of success and challenges e-commerce startups have often involved the impact of the pandemic on operations, and this story of 2 Rwandan co-founders does not break the formula.\n\nDuring the 2020 lockdown, Anselme Mucunguzi, 30, noticed a gap in the technology needed to service last mile delivery in Kigali, the Rwandan capital. To his mind, payment processing was robust\u2014people could use Paystack or Flutterwave when ordering stuff online; and for SMS marketing, they could use products like Africa\u2019s Talking. But there was no solution that delivered goods from sellers to the doorsteps of buyers. Sellers relied on random motorcyclists riding past to deliver packages to their customers. It was a risky measure. Not only could they not vouch for the professional and ethical conduct of such random riders, they also had no failsafe way to track the transportation of these packages. Even worse, these random riders were delivering the packages to locations that were described verbally, with landmarks as identifiers. It was an unreliable solution.\n\nSo, in January 2021, he founded Nisawa, a last-mile delivery service. The company was a subsidiary of Panavis, a legal research platform he\u2019d started working on in 2017 as part of his master\u2019s thesis at the University of Notre Dame, and incorporated in 2019. His co-founders were lawyer Mayday Karugarama, and software engineer Fran\u00e7ois Birori.\n\nNisawa would close operations a few months later, on October 14, due to disagreement over business direction with his then co-founder, Fran\u00e7ois Birori. Birori had wanted Nisawa to transition to an online marketplace while Mucunguzi insisted on remaining in the last-mile delivery line.\n\nOn October 15, the day after Nisawa closed, Vanoma began operations, maintaining all former staff and customers of Nisawa. Building off of the solution he activated at the predecessor startup, Vanoma is an integrated e-commerce solution centred around a last-mile delivery service to enable local businesses and independent sellers to sell online.\n\nVanoma\u2019s solution is designed to take the burden off the seller. All a seller needs to do to initiate a delivery is supply the receiver\u2019s phone number on the Vanoma website. Vanoma then sends the receiver an SMS with a custom link they refer to as a \u201cdelivery link\u201d. On clicking the link, the receiver is led to Vanoma\u2019s website where they can easily geolocate themselves thanks to their smartphone\u2019s built-in GPS capabilities. Once their exact location is established, a rider is sent out to pick up the package from the seller and deliver to the buyer. The seller never has to bother about the logistics beyond that initial action of supplying the receiver\u2019s phone number on the Vanoma website.\n\nIn July 2021, Mucunguzi invited his longtime friend Theophile Nsengimana, 30, to join him as co-founder; and in October, Nsengimana agreed.\n\nFriendship and partnership\n\nMucunguzi and Nsengimana\u2019s friendship is older than Vanoma. They met in 2011, as 2 of 32 high schoolers selected for the annual Rwandan Presidential Scholars programme. Mucunguzi would go on to study chemistry with a minor in mathematics at the Belhaven University, Jackson, Mississippi, while Nsengimana would move to Little Rock, Arkansas to study computer science and mathematics at the Philander Smith College.\n\nFour years later, the pair teamed up to work on a music streaming platform for Rwandan music in 2015. Mucunguzi lived in Indiana at the time and was about to begin his master\u2019s in physical chemistry. Nsengimana had just graduated from Philander Smith and worked in San Francisco.\n\nYeyote failed to gain traction because, Mucunguzi says, \u201cit is difficult to monetise media\u201d in Rwanda.\n\nThey rested the idea in 2017 and moved on to other projects. Mucunguzi was rounding off his master\u2019s degree at Notre Dame and Nsengimana was preparing to begin his, in computer science, at Tennessee State University.\n\nThe \u201cdead end\u201d\n\nI find Mucunguzi\u2019s decision to start Panavis curious, as he is no lawyer by training. (Law is a very technical discipline requiring dedicated training, I maintain.) He laughs at my question, and warns me that we\u2019re about to \u201cget into rabbit holes\u201d. He then tells me the reason he got into the legal business: Yeyote, the music streaming app he\u2019d worked on with Nsengimana.\n\nWhile building the app, he discovered that he had to constantly study laws around licensing, copyright, and incorporating a company, across several countries.\n\nThe legal research platform did not succeed as a business because its biggest could-be client, the Rwandan government\u2019s ministry of justice, had a stringent budget that planned expenses for 2\u20133 years at a time. What this means is, the ministry couldn\u2019t decide in April (or even January) of a given year that they\u2019d need Mucunguzi\u2019s service in July. Panavis would have to wait until the next budgetary allocation round to fit into the government\u2019s budget.\n\nOn top of that, the law firm market in Rwanda is small, he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have more than 15 legitimate law firms. Even if each one is paying a subscription fee of $100, or even more, that\u2019s not enough to pay 3, 4 people Unless you are about to get government clients. Even the law schools were not willing to pay substantial money. So, it was really a monetisation problem.\u201d\n\nThe business was a \u201cdead end,\u201d he concluded. He shuttered up Panavis in 2020 at the onset of the lockdown\u2014a year before founding Vanoma.\n\nA second try\n\nIn July 2021, when Nsengimana got the invitation from Mucunguzi to join him at Vanoma, he was working out of Seattle as a software engineer for Amazon. It was a great job, but he wanted more. He wanted to leave paid employment and return to entrepreneurship. He and Mucunguzi had stayed in touch after Yeyote folded up. In fact, 3 years before, Mucunguzi had asked him to co-found with him at Nisawa, but Nsengimana refused; he was busy balancing school and his work.\n\nStill, the years he\u2019d spent with Mucunguzi building the music streaming app were some of the most fulfilling of his life, he tells me. So, when Mucunguzi approached him to be his co-founder at Vanoma, given their history of working together and his yearning to do work that was \u201cmuch more rewarding\u201d, he agreed and relocated to Kigali to co-run the business.\n\nExpanding competition\n\nVanoma startup employs 12 full-time drivers who make deliveries all over Kigali, the city that is the extent of their coverage, as of today.\n\nI want to know what their expansion plans are. Mucunguzi tells me their approach is to avoid markets such as Nairobi, Kenya, that are \u201cextremely competitive\u201d. Nairobi, he explains, already has plenty of delivery products\u2014Uber and Bolt, for example\u2014so Vanoma will not be expanding there just yet. But they could expand into Uganda, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, or Cameroon any day now, once they feel ready, as their findings show these markets are ripe for an ecommerce boom.\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "Rita Anwiri Chindah on her life as a lawyer and digital content creator",
          "text": "Today on Everyday People, we meet Rita Anwiri Chindah, an intellectual property and information technology lawyer and an arbitrator based in Port-Harcourt, Rivers State. A random decision at the university led her down a path that would eventually turn her into an educationist. Now she hosts the IPSERIES podcast, a mini blog series on Twitter, and publishes a Substack newsletter to educate people on how much intellectual property is a part of all we do.\n\nI published my first [IPSERIES] episode on May 18, 2020. I think I had about 65 plays in how many days, but the feedback I kept getting from people was that I was sniffing and truthfully I was sniffing because I have allergies.\n\nI started getting comments from people on how to record. Someone suggested I should record in a quiet place. So sometimes when I want to record, I have to tell my family, cause I stay with my parents.\n\nI tell them, \u201cI\u2019m recording today. Please, can you guys, you know, tone down the noise,\u201d and they do that.\n\nThen someone else suggested, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a mic?\u201d\n\nAnd I was like, \u201cWhere am I going to get a mic?\u201d I tried to get one from Jumia, and when they did not deliver after one month, they said I should go to the nearest post office.\n\nI went there the first time and they said, \u201cOkay, maybe come back next week.\u201d\n\nAnd I went back the following week.\n\nThey said, \u201cAh, Madam, we never receive anything [we haven\u2019t received anything].\u201d\n\nI was like, \u201cAh!\u201d\n\nSo I think I sent an email or I called. And they said if I couldn\u2019t wait, I should cancel the order.\n\nI was like, \u201cAfter waiting this long, are you people joking?\u201d I had had enough. Like, seriously, why are we not moving forward? Why do we always look for ways to frustrate people?\n\nThen this year, I think I saw someone on Instagram selling a mic, and I was like, \u201cOkay, let me try her,\u201d and I bought it, and it was excellent.\n\nBuilding blocks\n\nRita Anwiri speaking at a South South Media event. Source: Instagram\n\nI did my LLB at Madonna University, Okija, and in 400 level, they introduced three elective courses: oil and gas, banking and finance, and intellectual property (IP). And I was like, \u201cWhat is intellectual property?\u201d\n\nI just decided to do the random one I\u2019d never heard of.\n\nIP education for me started when I was at Infusion Lawyers. Senator Ihenyen, my boss at the time, and I had this conversation about IP awareness and educating people. And then, the firm came up with a Frequently Asked Question blog called IP ABC.\n\nThat was where the interest started to build up. Then I started dropping IP bits on Twitter and tagged it IPSERIES. I\u2019m not sure if that was the first major case I analysed. It wasn\u2019t much of a case, but I saw someone post something that I felt was untrue because Deola Sage put up a notification saying her Komole design had been registered as a design under the Nigerian Design Act.\n\nSomeone said she didn\u2019t have the right to do that, \u201cHow can you protect aso oke [traditional Yoruba fabric]?\u201d\n\nI thought about it and concluded it was not ordinary aso oke. So I sat down and compared the original Yoruba aso oke and Deola Sage\u2019s Komole [Kandids].\n\nI went on Instagram and I stumbled on this post and it makes me very excited because creatives such as Deola has taken a bold step in the fashion industry to protect her designs.\n\nNow the not clearly states that any infringement of any sort would be prosecuted \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffe pic.twitter.com/qdshVQz92w \u2014 ANWIRI (@esmeraldo99) October 23, 2019\n\nI did that tweet, and people received it well, so I started building on that.\n\nThen during the pandemic, LolA With The Duffle Bag on Twitter shared a link to her podcast and said that she uses Anchor to do her recording.\n\nHere\u2019s the trailer for my new podcast where I\u2019d be sharing and answering your questions. Watch, listen and enjoy!\n\n\n\nFirst episode drops May 4, links would be available then. Get ready to subscribe on Spotify, Apple podcast, google podcast and other platforms.\n\n\u2764\ufe0f, \ud83d\udca1 and \ud83d\udcbc pic.twitter.com/covcNVmnrh \u2014 LolA With The Duffle Bag\u2026 (@L3galtool) April 27, 2020\n\nSo I checked it out, and when I realised it was very easy to record and share, I decided to try doing a podcast.\n\nAfter the podcast, I began considering a newsletter. Telema Davis, one of my friends who always pushes me to do more, told me to do it if I wanted to. Expectedly, he edited my first newsletter publication.\n\nI didn\u2019t know which platform to publish on, and he suggested Substack? So I got my Substack account. So far, I have 66 or 67 podcast episodes, 12 newsletters, and over one hundred mini blog series on Twitter.\n\nSomeone who has listened to all my podcasts suggested I put my microphone in a pillowcase and, you know, talk into it, and the background sound would be muffled.\n\nSo I\u2019ve done all those things just to make sure that I put out good quality content.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s not easy staying consistent; it\u2019s a bit overwhelming because each content must have a different storyline. So it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re just copying, pasting, and resharing.\n\nContent is key, and everything is content. When you\u2019re just starting, you don\u2019t get likes or retweets, and at such times, you wonder if you\u2019re making sense. But once you keep at it, people get to know and interact with you.\n\nWalking through the process\n\nRita Anwiri (third from the left) speaking at a panel at the Africa NXT 2022 event\n\nFirst up for me is usually the research, where I have to study the case and look out for things people didn\u2019t notice while reading or talking about the case because I\u2019m giving a Nigerian/African perspective. So I also have to read and compare many documents and conversations.\n\nThe next step is structure. How do you want the story to flow? Are you going to tell a very witty story? I write and then type because I\u2019m used to capturing my thought processes on paper first. As I type, I figure out what is relevant and what to discard.\n\nOnce I\u2019m done with research and typing for the Twitter series, I start posting. Sometimes I try to throw in pictures to help people better understand the conversation.\n\nWhen that is done, I share the link on LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\nSometimes, depending on how complex it is, I decide to have a guest on my podcast. I remember we had this Tracy Chapman and Nicki Minaj case when I started, and I was wondering how to discuss it. So I reached out to Mark Jaffe, a colleague and friend who is more into copyrights. Interestingly, this connection was not physical, and that is the beauty of the Intenet \u2014 it is easy to connect with people.\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that foreigners always want to help, so I was not surprised when he asked what I needed. We had a very interesting conversation and he said he was willing to come back and talk about something else if I needed him to.\n\nDealing with Internet connection issues\n\nRita was selected as a Trailblazer by the World Intellectual Property Review (WIPR) magazine in 2020\n\nIt\u2019s not easy, especially with network issues; I once went in and out of a session with a guest ten times.\n\n\u201cLook, I hope the last episode recorded?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cFingers crossed,\u201d I replied\n\nWhen I was listening to the recording, I did not hear anything that I said, I didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nThere was this time when it was a football matter and I wanted to interview two guests, but only one of them could log in. After many attempts, we cancelled and did not try to record afterwards; I felt bad because I was really looking forward to that conversation, which was going to shed light from the eSports sector to the regular sports sector\n\nSo while the Internet is good, the technical issues are not fun. It\u2019s kind of embarrassing sometimes because you\u2019re all hyped up. You have your router or your MiFi on standby. You have your mobile data, just in case. And before you know it, something unexpected happens. I sometimes ask myself why I am in Nigeria.\n\nI was so upset once that I tagged Anchor on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWhy are you guys doing this to me, today of all days? I can\u2019t even log in. I can\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cApologies, maybe check your Internet,\u201d they responded.\n\nAnd I was like, \u201cOh gosh, the Internet again!\u201d\n\nThe thing is you are trying to task yourself mentally while doing many things simultaneously, but people have no idea what goes into producing content. When you\u2019re Googling and reading different documents, make sure give a brief summary of everything because that is really where the work is.\n\nAnd the thing is, you are trying to tax yourself mentally while doing all of this and people don\u2019t see behind it. When you\u2019re trying to Google, trying to read different documents, make sure that you give a brief summary of everything. That\u2019s where the work is.",

Comrade Philip Shaibu, on Friday, led other top government functionaries to pay last respects to late Rev. Fr. Christopher Odia, who was gruesomely murdered by suspected kidnappers, with clerics at the event decrying the worsening spate of insecurity in the country.\n\nOdia, a catholic priest, was allegedly murdered by his kidnappers in Ikabigbo, Etsako West Local Government Area (LGA) of Edo State.\n\nAt the funeral mass and interment held for the clergy at the Priests\u2019 Cemetery, Immaculate Conception Seminary, Ivianokpodi-Agenebode in Etsako East LGA, the National President of the Nigeria Catholic Diocesan Priest Association (NCDPA), Very Rev. Fr. Johnbosco Ezehi, charged President Muhammadu Buhari to take urgent steps to guarantee the safety and security of Nigerians.\n\nHe noted that the Federal Government has failed in its primary duty of protecting the lives and property of Nigerians, adding that the President should step down or proffer a solution to the increasing spate of killings and kidnappings across the country.\n\nEzehi said, \u201cWe condemn the increasing attacks by suspected herdsmen who have turned the country into a massive graveyard. If the President cannot keep our country safe, then he automatically loses the trust of the citizens. He should no longer continue to preside over the killing field and mass graveyard that our country has become.\n\n\u201cNigerians call on the President to take drastic and urgent steps to reverse the ugly tragedy that threatens the foundation of our collective existence and unity as a nation. It\u2019s clear to the nation that the president has failed in his primary duty of protecting the lives of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Shaibu noted, \u201cI must agree with our cleric that the government has failed in its responsibilities of securing lives and properties. If the issue of security was tackled earlier enough, we would not get to where we are today. We must turn to God to help us now as our land is troubled and only God will heal our land.\u201d\n\nReassuring improved security in the state, the acting governor added, \u201cAs a state government, we have decided to take our destiny into our own hands and not push the blame. We are collaborating with security agencies and stakeholders in securing our state.\n\n\u201cWe have involved religious leaders and vigilante groups, among others and have adequately equipped them to strengthen our security architecture. We want to secure the property and lives of our people.\u201d\n\nShaibu noted that the state is localizing security and working with all security stakeholders in the state to ensure a peaceful, safe and secured environment, adding, \u201cWe can\u2019t isolate ourselves from the federal security and calling on everyone to be security officers collaborating with the government to secure our land.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Catholic Bishop of Auchi Diocese, Most. Rev. Dr. Gabriel Dunia stated, \u201cI appeal to both the federal, state and local governments, as the Lord has entrusted the leadership and security of Nigeria into their hands, to do the needful by protecting the lives and property of the people which is their primary responsibility.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

However, for a well-informed and engaged citizenry to exist, the media must not just inform the public, but analyze and present information and unbiased date that can and should shape policy.\n\nThe AUN-Premium Times Data Hub is is a unique collaboration between higher education and media to inject more data-driven analysis into civic discussions and journalism. The Development Hub will use data and analysis to build an evidence base for change.\n\nThe purpose of this Hub is to present data and analysis and a platform for discussion on every major sphere of development, including gender, poverty, education, health, economic growth and employment, governance and democracy, peace and security and the role of technology. On each platform, the best available data on Nigeria\u2019s current status will be presented and analysed and solutions to specific problems will be proposed.\n\nOur goal is to present and analyze data in a way that will educate you, our readers, guide you toward action and, over time, guide the decisions of policymakers.

We guarantee to keep your information anonymous,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nThose declared wanted were: Abdulkareem Musa, Abdusalami Adamu, Abubakar Abdulrahman Habibu, Abubakar Mohammed Sadiq, Abubakar Mohammed, Abubakar Yusuf, Adam Lawal Muhammad, Akibu Musa Danjuma, Amodu Omale Salihu, Bello Haruna, Bilyaminu Usman, Bukar Ali, Ibrahim Mohammed, Ikya Abur, Ismail Idris Abdullahi, Modu Aji, Mohammed Sani, and Musa Abubakar.\n\nAlso declared wanted were: Mustapha Umar, Mustapha Umar, Shehu Abdullahi, Suleiman Idi, Suleiman Zacharia, Sunday Micheal, Yakubu Abdullahi, Yasir Ibrahim Salihu, Yunusa Mukaiya, Abdulmannan Obadiki, Abubakar Mohammed Musa, Abubakar Umar, Adamu Mohammed, Ahmadu Hagola, Asama Haruna Kanti, Baluye Modu, Bassey Victor Kingsley, Diko Iko, Fannami Alhaji Bukar, Faruku Waziri, Hassan Hassan, Ibrahim Musa, Idris Ojo, and Ishaq Farouk.\n\nOthers were: Mohammed Goni Kyari, Mohammed Guja, Mohammed Saleh Buba, Mohammed Umar, Mukhtar Ussaini Khalidu, Musa Adamu, Musa Umar, Onyemire Asagba, Rabiu Shaibu, Sahabi Ismail, Sani Mohammed, Umar Ahmadu Ladan, Usman Balarebe, Yahaya Adamu Abubakar, Yusuf Yakubu, Abdulazeez Obadaki, Auwal Abubakar, Mansur Mohammed Usman, Mohammed Abubakar, Mohammed Jamiu Eneji Sani, Muazu Abubakar, Muhammed Sani Adamu, Muktar Umar, Nambil Zakari Gambo, Sadiq Garba Abubakar, Yazid Muhammed Usman, Yusuf Ali Yusuf.\n\nLawmaker\u2019s admonition\n\nIn a related development, the chairman , Senate Committee on Finance, Solomon Adeola (APC, Lagos West), has said the incident was traceable in part to the lack of strict control and mismanagement of international borders of Nigeria by the relevant authorities.\n\nAdeola stated this in Abuja Friday in his remarks as the chief launcher at the public presentation of a compendium of three books titled \u201cBridging African Boundaries: Cross Border Areas and Regional Integration in Comparative History and Policy Advocacy\u201d authored by an expert on African boundaries, emeritus Professor Anthony Asiwaju, at National Universities Commission, Abuja.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe only living Nigerian passionate about border issues and problems is Professor Asiwaju. At over 80 years he has remained focused for over three decades on the issues of borders, the people at the international borders, their problems and solutions all over Nigeria and indeed Africa.\n\n\u201cThe relevance of his work can be seen in the problem of insurgency bedeviling our nation. Recently we had the Kuje Prison attack by a terrorist group that freed many terrorists and hardened criminals.\n\n\u201cFrom the video clip of the incidents and the language of the attackers, it is clear that these are foreigners that must have infiltrated our country through porous international borders.\n\n\u201cWe need to take international border issues and people living along the borders more seriously than we have done.\u201d\n\nThe senator, who presently represents Lagos West Senatorial District with an active international border at Seme and is now the APC candidate for 2023 for Ogun West Senatorial District with another active international border at Idiroko, said \u201cpolicy makers and leaders must take the issue of control and management of our borders and its people seriously to prevent the threat posed by insecurity with identifiable origin beyond our international borders.\u201d\n\nHe added that with the array of mostly experts at the book presentation, he would encourage and support any effort like workshops and seminars for policy makers and stakeholders to brainstorm and implement policy advocacy contained in the research work of the compendium.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo, who was represented by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Dr. Adeola Ipaye, said Professor Asiwaju\u2019s researches and efforts were instrumental to the establishment of major border control agencies like National Border Commission and the National Border Development Commission adding that at the continental level, the African Union established similar institutions based on the erudite professor\u2019s work on border issues.\n\nThe author of the book, Prof. Asiwaju, said the book was for tertiary level history students, readers, researchers and policy makers in the field of border studies, adding that \u201cit is an effort to publicise history as an applied science to be relied on by those in charge of public policies in applying solutions to myriad of integrative and developmental problems.\u201d\n\nThe highlight of the occasion was the purchase of 100 copies of the book by Senator Adeola for donation to the libraries of the National Assembly, the Nigeria Institute of Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS) and other educational institutions in his senatorial district and beyond.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

This was revealed in a statement yesterday in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking on the development, the Executive Vice-President in charge of Business Development and Corporate Banking, Afreximbank Mr. Amr Kamel said, \u201cThe intervention by Afreximbank will help, Nigeria, one of its member states, to invest in natural gas as part of its pathway towards a just energy transition and achieve a more sustainable and climate resilient economic development.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe holistic approach deployed by the Bank in the UTM project is a model that Afreximbank aims to replicate across its member countries. It is through such interventions that we can ignite transformative actions that will spur industrialization and export development activities across the continent\u201d.\n\nThe deal marks Afreximbank\u2019s ongoing support in leading UTM\u2019s fundraising efforts to secure the necessary investment required for the projects\u2019 implementation. This project is of historical significance as it is the first FNLG project developed by an African-owned company on the continent.\n\nUTM is undertaking the development, design, and construction of an FLNG facility with a Liquified Natural Gas LNG nameplate production capacity of 1.2 million metric ton per annum and a storage capacity of 200,000 cubic meters, as well as ancillary facilities to be located 60km from the shore of Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.\n\nAs well as representing a \u201cfirst\u201d as an African-led intervention in the FNLG sector, the project aligns with Afreximbank\u2019s strategic aim of advancing activities which boast strong climate finance credentials. Most importantly, the project paves the way for a just energy transition in line with the reduction of carbon emissions as prescribed at COP26.\n\nMoreover, this project has economically transformative potential \u2013 establishing trade-enabling infrastructure which will allow Nigeria to pivot from a crude oil export-based economy to a gas-based processing industrial economy in turn unlocking significant development impacts.\n\nTo advance the timely implementation of the project, Afreximbank is leveraging its diverse product suite to provide end-to-end solutions. During the pre-investment stage, the project preparation facility will be deployed to de-risk the project and rapidly progress it towards bankability.\n\nIn addition, under the PPF, the Bank will be appointed as mandated lead arranger (MLA) and lead in syndicating the debt raise \u2013 with the ability to incorporate credit enhancements, if required.",

Gbemisola Saraki, made this known at the 16th International Maritime Seminar for Judges, organised by the Nigerian Shippers Council NSC under the Auspices of Federal Ministry of Transportation in collaboration with the National Judicial Institute NJI on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nHighlights of the event was hinged on the importance of Nigerian ownership of shipping activities within the country in order to reap the full economic benefits of the maritime sector.\n\nRepresented by the Director of Procurement, Useni Adamu, Saraki emphasised the need for capacity building in the maritime industry.\n\n\u201cIt is a common knowledge that most of our maritime transportation is conducted by foreign shipowners, thereby limiting the economic benefits accruable to the nation and the sub-region in areas such as creation of jobs, freight and insurance earnings etc\u201d she noted.\n\nThe Minister explained that it is in the above regard that the development of a national fleet becomes imperative.\n\n\u201cThe present administration is looking into ways of encouraging the establishment of a private sector-driven national shipping line to ensure maximum exploitation of the potentials in our maritime industry.\n\n\u201cA Ministerial Committee has been working on this important initiative and I look forward to having their concrete recommendations for immediate implementation\u201d she stated.\n\nWhile welcoming Judges of Federal High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court, the Chief Judge of Sierra Leone and the Representatives of Supreme Court Judges from Ghana, Kenya and other West African countries, Saraki explained the need for continues engagement with the judiciary in ensuring smooth development of the maritime sector.\n\n\u201cMy Lords, the lacuna created by the low penetration level in Maritime Law at the undergraduate levels of our Universities, coupled with the fast pace of development in international trade, exerts a lot of strain on our judicial officers some of whom are confronted with this special area of the law for the first time when Admiralty matters are brought before their courts for adjudication.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore commendable that this seminar has created a veritable forum where prominent jurists and legal luminaries come together to rub minds on how to enhance the competitiveness and economic viability of our maritime industry, not only through the capacity building of the judicial officers, but indeed also in tackling some of the crucial issues on the front burner of maritime discourse both locally and globally.\n\n\u201cThis will no doubt increase the confidence of investors in the industry, since it is obvious that an efficient, lucid, predictable and stable legal system plays a very significant role in attracting investors\u201d the Minister noted.\n\nIn his Address, the Acting Chief Judge of Nigeria, Justice Olukayode Ariwoola said the seminar is designed among other things to acquaint participants with emerging trends in the sphere of Admiralty Law and the challenges that digitalisation and globalisation may throw up on the adjudication of admiralty matters.\n\n\u201cI can say without contradiction that Judges who have experienced and participated in this Seminar in the past, have become better equipped with knowledge of rudimentary maritime laws necessary in handling compicx maritime claims/cases\u201d.\n\nIn his vote of thanks,, the Executive Secretary of NSC, Hon. Emmanuel Jime said \u201cthe task of organizing and maintaining a high quality event like this, is understandably, not an easy one.\n\nIt requires enormous commitment, sacrifice, dedication and patriotic duty and responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore in this light that I want to thank the Chairman and members of the International Maritime Seminar for Judges Organizing Committee led by the Honourable, the Chief Justice of the Federal High Court, Honourable Justice John T. Tsoho for their untiring and priceless work done in putting all this together in spite of the unusual late start of the preparations.

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General, National Steel Raw Materials Exploration Agency, NSRMEA, Engr, Dr. Umar Albarka Hassan, has said that value addition in iron and steel production was not only for the purpose of revenue generation but will also spur industrialization and investment rates in the country.\n\nHassan during an interview session with journalist in Abuja on progress made in the steel and minerals sector noted that the country has established smelting companies that will produce in large sums steel metals that had exportable characteristics to the world and which investors have come to reckon with.\n\nSpeaking on the resuscitation of the Ajaokuta Steel Company located in Kogi State, he stated that, \u201d there is hope for the Ajaokuta Steel Company, not only for it but for others of which Ajaokuta is one of the many steel plants in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor Ajaokuta, it has perculiar challenges and we are aware of the MOU the government has signed for the development of the steel company this is not only for the blast furnace functions. Our key plan is not only for Ajaokuta. We also have these hub that produces iron ore for most of the private owned steel companies in the country that produces steel through scrap metal, that hub will help to reduce the amount of money expended in materials required to produce steel products.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the plant has still not come on steam. But the reason are pretty straight forward. Subsequent administrations simply failed to put in place some components required to make it functional. For instance logistics challenges. The blast furnace requires thousand tonnes of liquid steel for the first phase. Some of these materials like 1.3million tonnes of coking coal that needs to be imported annually for the 1.3million tonnes annual production of liquid steel require ships sailing to nearby ports.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the agency has been able to establish the production of manganese which will definitely step up the importation of that resources for the production of steel in Nigeria emphasising that, \u201cwe don\u2019t produce steel, we produce steel, we establish local sources to facilitate the local producers to boost their capacities to produce steel there by bridging those gaps.\n\nSo if we do that along with the processing of some local sources for our raw materials especially for iron ore, then we will improve the sector.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the role of the Agency in exploration and sourcing for raw materials for economic development, he explained that, \u201cas for my agency, our minerals resources are found and majored under iron and steel minerals. When you talk about steel production it is actually extracting iron ore and converting it into steel which is also value addition. And our mandate is to source for materials for iron and steel production and ofcourse adding value. When you talk about other minerals that are exploited example gold and other minerals we have established smelting companies to create value addition to such minerals.\n\nHe also revealed that some of our achievements of the agency in developing the nation\u2019s economy includes \u201cestablishing the gap of characterising our minerals resources, we explore, establish deposits but are they really suitable for use to produce iron and steel so that agency ensures this using our improve and confirmed laboratories to facilitate characterisation on these raw materials that we established.\n\n\u201cAnd currently these laboratories are apt and in good working conditions. We have the Scintrex( Fluxgate) Magnetometer for magnetic surveys, SARIS Resistivity Meter for Earth Resistivity Measurements, drilling rigs and support equipment and mineral separation equipment that will enable us produce and sample products that we can test their suitability. Similarly for the physical survey activities we have acquired equipment that would empower that department to enable them to establish locations and facilitate determination of real targets to minimize searching for actual locations of these resources.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that the role of the agency in sourcing for local sources of raw materials for example iron ore has fostered the development of the African Natural Resources Steel Plant in Kaduna State noting that, NSRMEA helped in the exploration of iron ore that was used to establish the company similarly for Ajaokuta Steel.\n\n\u201cBuilding upon the previous achievements of the agency, we have discovered and established iron ores in some areas where such had not been established, talking about the Raw Materials industry in Niger State, there is also the establishment of Bauxite in Ekiti State and similarly a very important local sources for Silica Sand resources that we established in five, 5, States of Katsina, batches found in Ogun, Ondo, Akwa Ibom. Also we have established Manganese resources located in Cross River and Kogi State we have also established and earmarked local sources deposits in Zamfara State,\u201d he added.\n\nContinuing on the achievements of the NSRMEA which has been in existence for the past 50 years since its establishment in 1971 with the discovery of iron ore deposits by the agency through the Nigerian Steel Development Authority, NSDA, which led to the creation of Ajaokuta Steel Company which is a major milestone, the Director General also said that the agency has discovered deposits of very necessary raw minerals resources that was required for the production of steel products in Nigeria adding that the essence of this local resources is to ensure that these raw materials were not imported.",

Ben Nwude, a former President of the Nigerian Society of Mining Engineers reviewed efforts made by the governments of 36 States of the federation and resolved that none was satisfactory.\n\nKadiri said state governments were not doing enough in the quest to jointly pursue the realisation of the Roadmap for Growth and Development of the Nigerian mining sector.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNone of the 36 State governments satisfied the criteria for organisation ten most impactful mining sector entities of 2022. The absence of states in the list is a sad commentary that undermines the realisation of set goals for the sector, especially the economic diversification agenda.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman expressed concern that although the economic diversification agenda was repeatedly adopted by successive federal administrations in the country, \u201cthere is little to show for it as over 80 per cent of Nigerians were still poor despite the abounding multiplicity of solid mineral resources in the thirty-six of the federation.\n\nHe called on states to collaborate with the federal government to realise set goals, and quoted a World Bank poverty assessment report titled, \u201cA Better Future for All Nigerians: 2022 Nigeria Poverty Assessment,\u201d as saying that the number of poor Nigerians is increasing, and it is projected to hit 95.1milloin in 2022.\n\n\u201cThere are so many policies and campaign promises to develop the solid minerals sector but there is hardly equipment or financial support from state governments to indigenous mining operators, and there are too few state government-owned mineral development companies.\u201d\n\nKadiri added that state governments must make commitment to the development of the sector as some of them have accorded the agriculture sector.\n\nHe disclosed that the 10 entities earned the recognition for commitment to global best practices and for working against all odds to put the Nigerian mining sector on the world map and by providing information needed by prospective investors, and needed to support critical projects of government that are designed to facilitate economic diversification.\n\nHe therefore congratulated the entities that made the list and urged them to continue to contribute to the growth and development of the Mining and Mineral sector of Nigeria.",

It will save ammunition; it will be more effective,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe official declined to say if the new ammunition were Excalibur rounds, guided shells that can travel more than 40 kilometers and deliver munitions exactly on target.\n\nCanada has already sent a few of the high-cost, US-made Excaliburs to Ukraine, but the Pentagon has not said whether it has done so.\n\nSince the first Himars launchers were provided to Ukraine last month, analysts believe Kyiv\u2019s forces may have successfully destroyed a dozen or more Russian ammunition depots far behind the front lines.\n\n\u201cRussians are making very incremental, limited, hard-fought, highly costly progress in certain, select small spaces in the Donbas. They are way behind on their timelines,\u201d the official said, referring to the eastern region of Ukraine that Russia seeks to control completely.\n\nUsing their Himars systems, the Ukrainians in the last week have been able to \u201csignificantly disrupt the ability of the Russians to move forward,\u201d the official added.",

          "text": "Elon Musk\u2019s tumultuous $44 billion bid to buy Twitter is on the verge of collapse \u2014 after the Tesla CEO sent a letter to Twitter\u2019s board Friday saying he is terminating the acquisition.\n\nThe chair of Twitter\u2019s board, Bret Taylor, tweeted Friday that the board is \u201ccommitted to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement. We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery.\u201d\n\nTwitter could have pushed for a $1 billion breakup fee Musk agreed to pay under these circumstances. Instead, it looks ready to fight over the deal, which the company\u2019s board has approved and CEO Parag Agrawal has insisted he wants to consummate.\n\nThe possible unraveling of the deal is just the latest twist in a saga between the world\u2019s richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms. Much of the drama has played out on Twitter, with Musk \u2014 who has more than 100 million followers \u2014 lamenting that the company was failing to live up to its potential as a platform for free speech.\n\nOn Friday, shares of Twitter fell 5% to $36.81, well below the $54.20 that Musk had offered to pay. Shares of Tesla, meanwhile, climbed 2.5% to $752.29.\n\nMusk lawyer Mike Ringler wrote in the letter to Twitter dated Friday that for nearly two months, Musk has sought data to judge the prevalence of \u201cfake or spam\u201d accounts on the social media platform.\n\n\u201cTwitter has failed or refused to provide this information. Sometimes Twitter has ignored Mr. Musk\u2019s requests, sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified, and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving Mr. Musk incomplete or unusable information,\u201d the letter said.

Twitter said it removes 1 million spam accounts each day. the spam accounts represent well below 5% of its active user base each quarter. To calculate how many accounts are malicious spam, Twitter said it reviews \u201cthousands of accounts\u201d sampled at random, using both public and private data such as IP addresses, phone numbers, geolocation and how the account behaves when it is active, to determine whether an account is real.\n\nLast month, Twitter offered Musk access to its \u201cfirehose\u201d of raw data on hundreds of millions of daily tweets, according to multiple reports at the time, though neither the company nor Musk confirmed this. Private data, which isn\u2019t available publicly and thus not in the data \u201cfirehose\u201d that was given to Musk, includes IP addresses, phone numbers and location. Twitter said such private data helps avoid misidentifying real accounts as spam.",

Platini, then president of UEFA, was seen as having sway with European members who could influence the vote.\n\nThe payment emerged following a huge investigation launched by the US Department of Justice into bribery, fraud and money-laundering at FIFA in 2015, which triggered Blatter\u2019s resignation.\n\nBoth officials were banned from football for eight years in 2015 over the payment, although their bans were later reduced.\n\nPlatini, who also lost his job as UEFA president following the ban, said the affair was a deliberate attempt to thwart his attempt to become FIFA president in 2015.\n\nPlatini\u2019s former general secretary at UEFA, Gianni Infantino, entered the FIFA race and won the election in 2016.\n\nSpeaking following the verdict, Platini said: \u201cI want to express my happiness for all my loved ones that justice has finally been done after seven years of lies and manipulation.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cMy fight is a fight against injustice. I won a first game.\n\n\u201cIn this case, there are culprits who did not appear during this trial. Let them count on me, we will meet again. Because I will not give up and I will go all the way in my quest for truth.\n\n\u201cBelieve me, going from being a legend of world soccer to a devil is very difficult, especially when it comes to you in a totally unfair way.\u201d\n\nSky Sports",

          "text": "Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has died after he was shot on Friday while campaigning in the city of Nara.\n\nPublic broadcaster NHK said he appeared to have been shot from behind by a man with a shotgun.\n\nAuthorities have arrested a 42-year-old man who appeared to have shot Abe, media reported.\n\nKyodo news agency and NHK said Abe, 67, appeared to be in a state of cardiac arrest when taken to hospital, after having initially been conscious and responsive.\n\nHe has however been confirmed dead.\n\nNHK showed video of Abe making a election campaign speech outside a train station when two shots rang out, after which the view was briefly obscured and then security officials were seen tackling a man on the ground. A puff of smoke behind Abe could be seen in a separate video shown in NHK.\n\nTBS Television reported that Abe had been shot on the left side of his chest and apparently also in the neck.\n\nPolitical violence is rare in Japan, a country with strict gun regulations.\n\nAbe served two terms as prime minister to become Japan\u2019s longest-serving premier before stepping down in 2020 citing ill health.\n\nBut he has remained a dominant presence over the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), controlling one of its major factions.\n\nHis protege, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, goes into Sunday\u2019s upper house election hoping, analysts say, to emerge from Abe\u2019s shadow and define his premiership.\n\nKishida suspended his election campaign after Abe\u2019s shooting and was returning to Tokyo, media reported.\n\nThe government said there was no plan to postpone the election.\n\nThe ambassador of the United States, Rahm Emanuel, said he was saddened and shocked by the shooting of an outstanding leader and unwavering ally.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. government and American people are praying for the well-being of Abe-san, his family, and the people of Japan,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nAbe is best known for his signature \u201cAbenomics\u201d policy featured bold monetary easing and fiscal spending. read more\n\nHe also bolstered defence spending after years of declines and expanded the military\u2019s ability to project power abroad.\n\nIn a historic shift in 2014, his government reinterpreted the postwar, pacifist constitution to allow troops to fight overseas for the first time since World War Two.\n\nThe following year, legislation ended a ban on exercising the right of collective self-defence, or defending a friendly country under attack.\n\nAbe, however, did not achieve his long-held goal of revising the U.S.-drafted constitution by writing the Self-Defense Forces, as Japan\u2019s military in known, into the pacifist Article 9.\n\nHe was instrumental in winning the 2020 Olympics for Tokyo, cherishing a wish to preside over the Games, which were postponed by a year to 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAbe first took office in 2006 as Japan\u2019s youngest prime minister since World War Two. After a year plagued by political scandals, voter outrage at lost pension records, and an election drubbing for his ruling party, Abe quit citing ill health.\n\nHe became prime minister again in 2012.\n\nAbe hails from a wealthy political family that included a foreign minister father and a grandfather who served as premier.\n\nFirst elected to parliament in 1993 after his father\u2019s death, Abe rose to national fame by adopting a tough stance toward unpredictable neighbour North Korea in a feud over Japanese citizens kidnapped by Pyongyang decades ago.\n\nThough Abe also sought to improve ties with China and South Korea, where bitter wartime memories run deep, he riled both neighbours in 2013 by visiting Tokyo\u2019s Yasukuni Shrine, seen by Beijing and Seoul as a symbol of Japan\u2019s past militarism.\n\nIn later years, Abe refrained from visiting in person and instead sent ritual offerings.",
