          "title": "How whistleblower misled FG to besiege Justice Odili\u2019s Abuja home",
          "text": "By Ikechukwu Nnochiri \u2013 Abuja\n\nAn Abuja Chief Magistrate Court sitting at Wuse Zone 6, has accused the Federal Government of misleading it to issue a search warrant against a Justice of the Supreme Court, Mary Odili.\n\nJustice Odili is currently the second most senior jurist of the apex court, after the Chief Justice of Nigeria, CJN, Justice Ibrahim Muhammad.\n\nHer home in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, situated at No. 9, Imo Street, Maitama, was on Friday, besieged by security operatives who claimed their action was based on a valid court order.\n\nHowever, a few hours after the order was issued, the Chief Magistrate Court, revoked it on the ground that it was deceived by the Joint Panel Recovery unit of the Federal Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe revocation order came at a point Vanguard learned that the CJN, Justice Ibrahim Muhammad, who was said to have been perturbed by the development, ordered the Chief Judge of the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, to query the Magistrate.\n\n\u201cThe CJN was very upset when he heard that the home of Justice Odili was besieged by security agencies. His anger further heightened when he learned that action of the security agencies was based on an order from a Magistrate Court in Abuja.\n\n\u201cHonourable Justice Muhammad is a man that takes the welfare of not just justices of the Supreme Court, but every judicial officer in the country very serious.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that he seriously condemned the action of the Department of State Services, when its operatives invaded homes of judges in 2016\u201d, a top source at the Supreme Court told Vanguard.\n\nMeanwhile, Magistrate Emmanuel Iyanna, who granted the order for Justice Odili\u2019s Abuja home to be searched, said he was deceived to do so through misrepresentation of facts by two affidavits that were deposed to by a self-acclaimed whistleblower, Aliyu Umar and a senior Police Officer, CSP Lawrence Ajodo.\n\nConsequently, Magistrate Iyanna, revoked the search warrant he issued against Justice Odili on Friday.\n\nThe revocation order read: \u201cUpon misrepresentation to this honourable court that led to the issuance of a search warrant in favour of Joint Panel Recovery, Ministry of Justice, against House 9, Imo Street, Maitama, Abuja, dated October 29, 2021. In view of the above fact, the said search warrant is hereby revoked\u201d.\n\nThe whistleblower, Umar, had claimed that he observed some illegal activities going on at Justice Odili\u2019s residence in Abuja.\n\nIn an affidavit he deposed to on October 13, 2021, Umar averred: \u201cI have observed some illegal activities going on in those houses within Abuja that are illegal and hereby report the said matter to the law enforcement agency.\n\n\u201cI hereby state that all information provided by me to the EFCC is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: My nude video a mistake \u2014 Cross; it\u2019s intentional mistake, T-Boss replies\n\nBased on the affidavit, CSP Ajodo, acting on behalf of the panel which comprises the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, the Nigeria Police Force and the Ministry of Justice, also deposed to an affidavit, wherein he applied for a warrant to be issued for Justice Odili\u2019s house to be searched.\n\nJustice Odili, who is the wife of a former Governor of Rivers State, was said to have resisted attempts by the security agents to invade her house.\n\nIn the midst of the stand-off that lasted about five hours, the EFCC, through its Spokesman, Mr Wilson Uwujaren, quickly distanced itself from the operation.\n\nThe anti-graft agency said it had no hand in the matter and advised members of the public to disregard any news to the contrary.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe attention of the EFCC has been drawn to claims in a section of the media that operatives of the commission today, October 29, 2021 stormed the Maitama, Abuja home of a Judge of the Supreme Court, Justice Mary Odili, purportedly to execute a search.\n\n\u201cThe commission, by this statement, wishes to inform the public that the report is false as it did not carry out any operation at the home of Justice Odili. If there was any such operation as claimed by the media, it was not carried out by the EFCC.\n\n\u201cThe Commission enjoins the public to discountenance the report.\u201d\n\nIt will be recalled that the Federal High Court in Abuja had on October 18, ordered the immediate release of the international passport of Justice Odili\u2019s husband, which was seized by the Nigeria Immigration Service, NIS.\n\nThe court, in a judgement that was delivered by Justice Inyang Ekwo, held that there was no legal justification for the action the NIS took against the former governor, Dr Peter Odili.\n\nJustice Ekwo said there was no evidence to establish that Odili\u2019s passport was seized on the order of any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nHe, therefore, ordered the NIS to immediately release and return the seized passport, as well as tender an apology to the Applicant.\n\nOdili, who piloted affairs of Rivers State from 1999 to 2007, had approached the court to challenge the seizure of his international passport by the NIS.\n\nHe told the court that his passport with numbers B50031305, was seized from him on June 20 by NIS officials for an undisclosed reason, shortly after he landed at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja.\n\nIn an 8-paragraph affidavit he personally deposed to, the former governor, said he landed at the airport from the United Kingdom where he had gone for his routine medical checkup.\n\nHe averred that upon his arrival, his travelling documents were checked and given back to him, but while he waited for his luggage to be cleared, an Immigration official approached him and demanded for the passport on claim of routing check.\n\nOdili told the court that he complied and handed his documents over to the official who went away with them and failed to return it back.\n\nHowever, the NIS, in the processes it filed before the court, maintained that its action was based on a directive from the EFCC.\n\nIt will be recalled that a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, had in 2007, issued an order of perpetual injunction that barred the EFCC and other security agencies in the country from arresting or investigating the former governor.\n\nVanguard News Nigeriaw",

Government of misleading it to issue a search warrant against a Justice of the Supreme Court, Mary Odili.\n\nJustice Odili is currently the second most senior jurist of the apex court, after the Chief Justice of Nigeria, CJN, Justice Ibrahim Muhammad.\n\nHer home in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, situated at 9, Imo Street, Maitama, was on Friday, besieged by security operatives who claimed their action was based on a valid court order.\n\nHowever, few hours after the order was issued, the Chief Magistrate Court, revoked it on the ground that it was deceived by the Joint Panel Recovery

Department of State Services, DSS, when its operatives invaded homes of judges in 2016,\u201d a top source at the Supreme Court told Vanguard.\n\nI was deceived\u2014 Magistrate\n\nMeanwhile,

deposed to by a self-acclaimed whistleblower, Aliyu Umar and a senior Police Officer, CSP Lawrence Ajodo.\n\nConsequently, Magistrate Iyanna, revoked the search warrant he issued against Justice Odili on Friday.\n\nThe revocation order read: \u201cUpon misrepresentation to this honourable court that led to the issuance of a search warrant in favour of Joint Panel Recovery, Ministry of Justice, against House 9, Imo Street, Maitama, Abuja, dated October 29, 2021.\n\n\u201cIn view of the above fact, the said search warrant is hereby revoked.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower, Umar, had claimed that he observed some illegally activities going on at Justice Odili\u2019s residence in Abuja.\n\nIn an affidavit he deposed to on October 13, Umar averred: \u201cI have observed some illegal activities going on in those houses within Abuja that are illegal and hereby report the said matter to the law enforcement agency.\n\n\u201cI, hereby, state that all information provided by me to the EFCC is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\u201d\n\nBased on the affidavit, CSP Ajodo, acting on behalf of the panel which comprises the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, the Nigeria Police

public to discountenance the report.\u201d\n\nThe Dr. Peter Odili\n\nIt will be recalled that the Federal High Court in Abuja had on October 18, ordered the immediate release of the international passport of Justice Odili\u2019s husband, which was seized by the Nigeria Immigration Service, NIS.\n\nThe court, in a judgement that was delivered by Justice Inyang Ekwo, held that there was no legal justification for the action the NIS took against the former governor, Dr. Peter Odili.\n\nJustice Ekwo said there was no evidence to establish that Odili\u2019s passport was seized on the order of any court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nHe therefore ordered the NIS to immediately release and return the seized passport, as well as tender an apology to the Applicant.\n\nOdili, who piloted affairs of Rivers State from 1999 to 2007, had approached the court to challenge the seizure of his international passport by the NIS.\n\nHe told the court that his passport with numbers B50031305, was seized from him on June 20 by NIS officials for undisclosed reason, shortly after he landed at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja.\n\nIn an 8-paragraph affidavit he personally deposed to, the former governor, said he landed at the airport from the United Kingdom where he had gone for his routine medical checkup.\n\nHe averred that upon his arrival, his traveling documents were checked and given back to him, but while he waited for his luggage to be cleared, an Immigration official approached him and demanded for the passport on claim of routing check.\n\nOdili told the court that he complied and handed his documents over to the official who went away with and failed to return it back.\n\nHowever, the NIS, in processes it filed before the court, maintained that its action was based on a directive from the EFCC.\n\nIn 2007\n\nIt will be recalled that a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, had in 2007, issued an order of perpetual injunction that barred the EFCC and other security agencies in the country from arresting or investigating the former governor.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",
          "summary": "Justice Odili is currently the second most senior jurist of the apex court, after the Chief Justice of Nigeria, CJN, Justice Ibrahim Muhammad.\n\u201cThe CJN was very upset when he heard that the home of Justice Odili was besieged by security agencies.\nConsequently, Magistrate Iyanna, revoked the search warrant he issued against Justice Odili on Friday.\n\u201cIn view of the above fact, the said search warrant is hereby revoked.\u201dThe whistleblower, Umar, had claimed that he observed some illegally activities going on at Justice Odili\u2019s residence in Abuja.\nJustice Ekwo said there was no evidence to establish that Odili\u2019s passport was seized on the order of any court of competent jurisdiction.",

They have been dislodged there so they are desperately looking for a base in Niger state\u201d, he added.\n\nThe Secretary to the State Government Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Matane when contacted confirmed the story but simply said \u201cWhat the Security men did was to repel the attack\u201d.\n\nMatane also confirmed that there was no report of any casualty yet on the part of the security men but praised their gallantry which secured the lives of the people they are to protect.\n\nThe Government Scribe assured them that government will continue to do everything possible to ensure the welfare of the security men in the discharge of their duties.\n\nThe state Police Command is yet to issue any statement on the attack, and the Public Relations Officer DSP Wasiu Abiodun could not be reached to confirm the attack.\n\nIt could be recalled that the gunmen in a similar invasion, sacked the Military camps in Bassa and Allawa communities, killing five soldiers and a police inspector.\n\nThis forced the Military to closed the camps to enable it re-strategize but were reopened few months later with additional forces and equipment.",

          "title": "Bodejo, Miyetti Allah leader mocks Southern govs: Anti-open grazing law exists only in the media; it can\u2019t be implemented",
          "text": "National President, Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore Socio-cultural Organisation, Abdullahi Bello Bodejo, has said the anti grazing laws by some states, especially in the Southern part of the country exist only in the media and could not be implemented.\n\nSpeaking with VINCENT KALU, Bodejo said the groaning over the high price of cow meat would get louder, asserting that prices would hit the rooftop in the coming months.\n\nWhat is your view on the way things are going on in the country?\n\nI have to speak on the side of the Fulani. For us, we have not had it so bad all over the country. While others are crying, the Fulani are dying. The situation is so bad. They don\u2019t have place to graze their cattle; they don\u2019t have hospitals, they don\u2019t have schools.\n\nIn many states in the North, especially, Zamfara, Katsina, Sokoto, the Fulani are afraid to come to buy food; these are innocent people who are not into robbery, banditry or other forms. We are supporting the military and other security agencies to wipe out banditry in the country because it is affecting the Fulani.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nHowever, in the process of wiping out the bandits, the Fulani have become the victims. An example is what happened in one local government in Sokoto State, where the vigilance group went and slaughtered Fulani people, accusing of them of being bandits. In Zamfara State, the so-called vigilantes are responsible for banditry in the state and other states in the North.\n\nLike bandits, Boko Haram also operates in the forest; the Fulani are equally doing their legitimate activities in the bushes and forests, and they can\u2019t abandon their cattle and come and stay in the town. While they are in the forests, bandits and Boko Haram kidnap them, as well as rustle their cattle. And when they come to the town to buy provisions, security agents and vigilance groups kill them, saying they are bandits, whereas they are innocent. This is their dilemma, which is disturbing them and they have been complaining to us.\n\nThe government is trying to deal with the bandits and we support them, but how to separate them from the innocent Fulani is our headache. Our people are living inside the forests and the bandits and Boko Haram members are also living in the forest and if security agents are asked to go after the bandits or Boko Haram, they come after our people, who would not see the need to run because they are innocent. If you go to the South-West, South-East and South-South, you will see how they are killing the Fulani.\n\nBefore, the Fulani were migrating from North to South, but now they are migrating outside the country to Cameroun, Central Africa and other countries. They are leaving Nigeria en masse, which is not good for the country because of their contributions to the growth of the country.\n\nWe want the president to hasten and bring back our grazing routes and grazing reserve areas so that some Fulani that are not leaving the country can see where they settle to do their businesses.\n\nIn some states, these bandits are kidnapping Fulani, killing them, raping their wives, but this is not reported in the media. In some states, they can\u2019t go to market because the moment the vigilance groups see them, they presume them to be bandits and kill them. Some of them are surviving with little nunu they extract from cows. They have laid these complaints to us, but we don\u2019t know how to go about it even though we support the wiping out of these bandits and Boko Haram.\n\nI appeal to the security agencies and vigilance groups that, while dealing with the bandits, they should also be careful not to touch innocent Fulani. Any Fulani who is seen committing crime or carrying out banditry should be dealt with because he is causing a big trouble to the innocent ones.\n\nWhen you said the vigilantes in Sokoto and Zamfara are killing Fulani, are they not Fulani also?\n\nThey are not Fulani. It is very difficult for a Fulani to kill another Fulani; it is hard for a Hausa to kill a fellow Hausa. They have used propaganda to brand every Fulani man a bandit and begin to treat him as a leper. These people killing them are not Fulani; they are these Hausa boys and other tribes there.\n\nYou said Fulani are suffering. Have you complained to the president, who is also a Fulani?\n\nYes, the president is a Fulani man. Since he came to power, the Nigeria he met was not like the Nigeria when he was military head of state. When he just assumed office, he was welcomed with crises in Benue and Plateau states, as well as Boko Haram. While he was tackling all these, then the economy became bad.\n\nThe truth remains that this government is not helping the Fulani; our suffering is really more now that our person is the president.\n\nWhen you talked about Fulani, do you mean all the Fulani or just the herdsmen?\n\nWe have two types of Fulani \u2013 the educated and the non-educated. The work of the non-educated is just cattle rearing and carrying out their activities inside forests and bushes.\n\nYes, we have Fulani who are governors, ministers, technocrats, but I\u2019m not talking about them because they are already made, and are not concerned with the welfare of the other Fulani.\n\nI\u2019m talking about the Fulani who are inside bushes drinking the same water with their cows, and do not have access to hospitals, schools. Now, we have senators, ministers, governors who before were also drinking water from the same river with their cows, but they have climbed up and have forgotten these other people and they don\u2019t care about them.\n\nPeople are complaining over the high cost of cow meat. What made it so?\n\nEverybody wants to go into cow business \u2013 Tiv, Yoruba, Igbo, etc. Before, it was the sole business of the Fulani. If you go to these states that are banning open grazing, over 75 per cent of the cows there belong to the indigenes, especially the Tiv in Benue State.\n\nAgain the activities of the middlemen are responsible for the high cost of cows. The Fulani man does not make more than 40 per cent of the total cost of cow. Fulani man will bring out cow from bush and sell it for N120, 000 and by the time it gets to Lagos, the cost will jump up toN280, 000 and they will sell it N350, 000; when the owner of the cow sold it just N120, 000 and went back to the bush to continue his suffering.\n\nThe next reason is that, like I said earlier, these people are leaving the country in droves to other West African countries to continue with their activities since Nigeria is no more favourable to them.\n\nThe price will still go up from now. Almost all the cows consumed in this country come from individual Fulani and not from government, so as they are leaving the country, you should know the implication. You are a governor, you don\u2019t support them in anywhere and the propaganda is to demonise the Fulani person. This has made them very uncomfortable.\n\nWhy can the price come down?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want the price to come down so that everybody will know the value of the Fulani in this country. I\u2019m a cow lover; it is a business I inherited from my father, and my father inherited it from his grandfather and it goes on like that.\n\nI want everybody to know that our business is not an ordinary one that people should look down on. They should know the value of the cow and appreciate the Fulani. Those governors coming up with anti grazing laws can eat the dogs, pigs, pussycats and other animals they are rearing in their states.\n\nYou people are seen as lawless for not obeying the anti-open grazing laws?\n\nI asked the Fulani in those states that banned open grazing how they are faring; they said, they only hear it in the radio and that they don\u2019t know about it.\n\nSo, the anti-grazing law is just a media thing; it can never be implemented. It can only operate on the television, radio and in newspapers. It does not concern us and I have asked my people in those states never to obey it, and to continue with their activities.\n\nNo Fulani man will obey the law. If you are a governor and you want them to obey it, give them grazing reserve area. You can\u2019t just wake up and tell the Fulani to leave your state or stop grazing their cows in your state.\n\nAs a governor, you need food to eat, so also the cows need food to be alive. Or you want the cows to die? We want places provided for us to rear our cows.\n\nWe are not lawless; we respect law and obey order. It is the Nigeria constitution we obey, and not the anti-open grazing laws by states. We respect and support the governors; we are not anybody\u2019s enemy. The only problem is the law, which is satanic.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

We have been marginalized for so long, so, we want to make sure that the interest being shown by these people are not \u2018Greek gift\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to be there, where the matter would be handled by the court and want to know the actual reason for doing so,\u201d he said.\n\nAlaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) said it was within the rights of the Northern Elders to go to court on any issue of their choice, but noted that the Northern elders might be acting a script.\n\nADF spokesman, Abia Onyike noted, though, that the Igbo were not looking back on their push for self-determination.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs to their motivation, I believe that they may be acting out a script. Be that as it may, I believe that Ndigbo are serious about their quest for self-determination. They want it to the extent of their freewill. Forcing Ndigbo out of Nigeria does not arise. They want an autonomous republic within the African Union because they are tired of the crisis-ridden Nigerian federation.\u201d\n\nNational President of ASETU, Chief Emeka Diwe also said: \u201cNobody can be pushed out but if we choose to leave, they should give us opportunity for peaceful separation using referendum,\u201d Diwe said.\n\nApex Igbo sociocultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, had during President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s recent visit to Imo State declared that nobody could push the Igbo out of the country despite several threats from secessionists.\n\nPresident General of Ohanaeze, George Obiozor had noted that the President\u2019s visit to the zone would form a new foundation for dialogue on critical issues concerning them.\n\nObiozor said: \u201cNdigbo are committed to Nigerian unity and there is news for those trying to push us out of Nigeria. Ndigbo in Nigeria are like fish in the ocean. No matter how rough the storm is, it cannot drive the fish out of the ocean.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe and Presidential candidate of the Young Progressives Party (YPP) in the 2019 general elections; Prof. Kingsley Moghalu, had said that no amount of threat would stop the Igbo from demanding for fairness, equity and justice in the country.\n\nChairing the inauguration of Igbonine, a new sociocultural organization in Enugu, recently, Abaribe said the Igbo had always served as the glue binding the nation.\n\n\u201cWe are the largest domestic investors in Nigeria. We are the most travelled people in Nigeria, we don\u2019t want to leave Nigeria but some people are trying to push us out of the country and the reason they are doing that is what we don\u2019t know. We have a document that manifests a sectional approach to governance and we are not afraid to say it.\n\n\u201cEven in the past that Boko Haram and bandits, very well known to have devastated parts of Nigeria, nobody has designated them as terrorists. But when our boys said they wanted a referendum, it was very quick and easy for the Federal Government to designate them a terrorist organization,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe senator said the minimum demand of Ndigbo was restructuring, adding that the Igbo were not second-class citizens but have been pushed to the fringes. He declared that the Igbo were qualified to get any position in the land including the Presidency.\n\nAlso, Moghalu who was guest speaker at the event while treating the theme: \u2018Igbonine, what do we want,\u2019 stated that what the Igbo want now is to continue to resist any hegemonic worldviews in Nigeria politics and assert their own political relevance; look inwards to reverse the impact of negative value system; insist on power rotation to Southern Nigeria in 2023 with a unique argument for a President of Southeast extraction and refrain from election boycott.\n\nIgbo National Council (INC) has described the suit by the Northern elders as a ploy to deny the South East the Presidency in 2023.\n\nIts President, Chilos Godsent said: \u201cBut the INC welcomes that initiative and urge the National Assembly to pass the bill permitting a referendum for the South East zone of Nigeria before the end of 2022.\u201d\n\nElder statesman and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chief Mike Ahamba, said, however, that what the northern group was pursuing wasn\u2019t attainable and would amount to a futile effort.\n\n\u201cNo reasonable court or the National Assembly can attend to such request; it is not possible,\u201d the legal luminary stated.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "\u2018I swore by the Holy Qur\u2019an that I will serve in accordance with the constitution and leave when my time is up\u2019\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday said he would leave office when his tenure ends on May 29, 2023, and warned against campaigns for tenure extension, saying he swore to serve in accordance with the constitution.\n\nThe President was speaking at a meeting in Makkah with a select group of Nigerians resident in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia where he just ended a visit.\n\nAccording to a statement titled, \u201cPresident Buhari Says I Will Leave On 29 May 2023, Warns Tenure Extension Campaigners To Desist,\u201d signed by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari told the Nigerians: \u201cI swore by the Holy Qur\u2019an that I will serve in accordance with the constitution and leave when my time is up. No \u201cTazarce\u2019\u2019 (tenure extension).\u201d\n\nBuhari adds: \u201cI don\u2019t want anybody to start talking about and campaigning for unconstitutional extension. I will not accept that.\u201d\n\nShehu said the President also promised to provide support to increase the role of technology in the nation\u2019s elections, arguing that the introduction of the card reader and electronic register was God\u2019s answer to his prayers, having been cheated of his victory in three previous elections.\n\n\u201cAfter the third so-called defeat, I said, \u2018God Dey\u2019. My opponents laughed at me but God answered my prayers by bringing in technology. At that point, nobody can steal their votes or buy them,\u201d Buhari was quoted as saying.\n\nThe President also said he would continue to abide by the constitution in all its ramifications, adding that he will at all times supervise and deal with his ministers on the same basis.\n\nHe also assured that he would improve the welfare of Nigerians: \u201cIn the balance of 18 months or so left of my time, whatever I can do to improve the life of Nigerians, I will do it for the country.\u201d\n\nThe President commended Diaspora Nigerians in the Kingdom for representing the country well and projecting its good image.\n\nShehu said Bhari used the opportunity to urge citizens at home to be fair to his administration at all times, asking the critics to compare the security situations in the North-east and South-south in 2015 and how things have improved as of now.\n\nHe quoted Buhari as saying, \u201cMy problem is the North-west where people are killing and stealing from one another. I had to be very hard on them and I will continue to be very hard until we put them in line and bring back order.\u201d\n\nHe said President Buhari urged Nigerians living in Saudi Arabia to remain law-abiding and do nothing to derogate from the many years of friendly and mutually beneficial relationships between the two countries.\n\nA leader of the community, Dr. Abdulkadir Maikudi, who spoke on behalf of the group, requested the President to assist the privately-run Nigerian International School in the Kingdom by equipping it to provide science and technical education.\n\nAt the meeting, the Nigerian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Yahaya Lawal, and the Consul-General in Jeddah, Ambassador Abdulkarim Mansur attested to the good conduct of the nearly 1.5 million Nigerians there.\n\nAccording to them, \u201cNigerian professionals are doing well and projecting a good image of our country.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*New NWC won\u2019t assume office until December 9 when Secondus\u2019 term ends\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Chuks Okocha in Abuja and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nAn Appeal Court sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, yesterday dismissed the appeal of the suspended National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Uche Secondus seeking to restrain the party from conducting its National Convention, thus paving the way for the congress to commence today in Abuja.\n\nThe three-man panel dismissed the appeal which was filed on October 14, 2021, \u201cfor lacking in merit.\u201d\n\nWith the scare that the convention might be stopped by a court over, 3,600 delegates from all over the country will today converge on the Eagles Square, Abuja, to elect a new National Working Committee for the party.\n\nSecondus had approached the court of appeal to challenge his removal as chairman. He also sought an order of injunction restraining the PDP from holding its National Convention.\n\nThe judgement read by Justice Gabriel Kolawale, was unanimously endorsed by the other two members of the panel, who said the suit by Secondus was an afterthought and an abuse of court process.\n\nKolawole held that the attempt by the applicant to suspend the planned convention \u201cis an act of self-induced urgency to disrupt an ongoing lawful process of the party.\u201d\n\nHe wondered why the applicant waited for too long to seek the stoppage of the process which had been communicated to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nThe judge noted that Secondus did not oppose the notice of the convention written by the acting chairman of the party to INEC, \u201cneither did he oppose INEC\u2019s response to the party.\u201d\n\nThe court thus granted the PDP the right to hold its National Convention as scheduled.\n\nThe counsel to Secondus, Tayo Oyetibo said the outcome of the main appeal, which is challenging the removal of his client as chairman of the PDP, would determine whether or not they will appeal.\n\nMultiple court orders were issued against Secondus resulting in his removal from office, and the Deputy National Chairman (South), Yemi Akinwonmi, appointed in his stead.\n\nPDP Holds National Convention at Eagle Square\n\nMeanwhile, 3600 delegates will converge on the Eagles Square, Abuja, to elect a new National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nThe PDP flag has been hoisted at the Eagle Square, while banners and decorations adorned the area. A podium had also been assembled at the centre of the square.\n\nThe party said there would be affirmative vote cast for 21 of the 24 offices of the NWC today.\n\nThe party also said the new NWC to be elected would assume office on December 9, 2021.\n\nAddressing a press conference ahead of the convention, the Chairman of the National Convention Committee, Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State said 21 of the 24 offices were returned on consensus basis.\n\nAccording to Governor Fintiri, the offices that would be contested are that of the Deputy National Chairman (South), National Auditor and National Youth Leader.\n\nThe former national secretary of the party, Olagunsoye Oyinlola and Ambassador Taofeek Arapaja will be contesting for the office of the Deputy National Chairman (South).\n\nSpeaking on the ruling of the Court of Appeal, Fintiri said the new NWC would assume office when that of the old one ends.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere will be no vacuum because we\u2019re not truncating anybody\u2019s tenure. We only called for an early convention, but that does not mean because we are having early convention, we are also terminating the tenure of the present NWC. They will still be asked to serve their time until December 9. If anything, it will give them a better chance to interface and have a smooth transition.\u201d\n\nGovernor Fintiri said the affirmative votes would be through open secret, explaining that in line with INEC\u2019s guidelines, votes will be cast, adding that the convention had achieved 80 per cent consensus.\n\nFintiri said 3,600 delegates were expected to cast their votes for the incoming NWC members.\n\nHe said, \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re making efforts to reconcile most of our contestants so that we can streamline them and have a better Convention. This will improve our elective chances in 2023.\n\nTambuwual: NWC to Emerge Through Consensus\n\nThe Chairman of the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum and Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwual, has said he and his colleagues were working towards ensuring that all members of the new NWC of the party emerged via consensus.\n\nHe said this after a meeting of the PDP-GF in Abuja, late on Thursday.\n\nTambuwual said, \u201cWe have held the meeting of the PDP governors\u2019 forum. As you can see again, 13/13, all of us attended and the chairman of the convention committee brought us up to speed on how prepared they are for us to hold our convention.\n\n\u201cWe are also happy to say that part of what we discussed was the process of getting consensus during the convention.\n\n\u201cSo far, we can say with certainty that we have achieved not less than 80 per cent of that process and it is still ongoing\n\n\u201cWe are hoping that at the end of the day, we are going to have a hitch-free convention and possibly have all the candidates emerge via consensus.\n\n\u201cConsensus is part of democratic process and we are imbibing that in the interest of our party so that we can continue to have stability that will reposition the party, as we have always said, for the future.\u201d\n\nWike Hails Ruling\n\nRivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has lauded the court ruling that restored PDP\u2019s National Convention.\n\nWike said Secondus\u2019 attempt to scuttle the convention \u201cmakes him an enemy of the party.\u201d\n\nHe said no individual could derail the party\u2019s mission to rescue Nigeria.\n\nWike said: \u201cWhat Secondus is doing is to sabotage the efforts of Nigerians, the efforts of PDP from rescuing this country from the hand of the party that has failed the country. And it is not fair.\n\n\u201cThis is a party that has given you everything and there\u2019s nothing wrong in making sacrifice. Even if, assuming though not conceding, that anything was wrong, we expected that having achieved what you have achieved in your life from this party, there is nothing wrong in making sacrifice.\u201d\n\nAccording to Wike, PDP\u2019s convention starting today would be one of the best that has ever been conducted.\n\nHe asserted that Nigerians were expecting PDP to come out of the convention more united.\n\nWike said the party members, particularly the PDP governors, were more united because they had realised that Nigeria was in difficulty and that only a united PDP could wrest power from the APC.\n\n\u201cNigeria is in problem and we cannot do it alone. We require everybody to work with us, collectively and see how this country can be rescued.\n\n\u201cNigerians are not happy with the ruling party, the way Nigerians are being treated. Like I\u2019ve told everybody; there is nothing better than making sacrifice for the interest of the country. PDP is the only platform, and it is today the only opposition party that can rescue Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWike noted that Tambuwal had recently led a team of his colleague to Ondo State to woo the former Governor of Ondo State, Dr. Olusengu Mimiko to PDP.\n\nHe said the leadership of PDP \u201cis happy that they are going to the convention with nothing less than 95 per cent consensus achieved,\u201d which he said \u201cis first of its kind.\u201d\n\nThe governor added that PDP \u201cis ready and prepared to achieve the change that will end the problem of governance in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Facebook on Thursday, October 28 announced that it has changed its company name to Meta. This change of name was announced by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook\u2019s annual Connect augmented and virtual reality conference.\n\nThe company said it chose the name \u201cMeta\u201d to serve as a reminder that there is always more to build. The rebrand is part of the company\u2019s efforts to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse \u2014 a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.\n\n\u201cRight now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can\u2019t possibly represent everything that we\u2019re doing today, let alone in the future,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cOver time, I hope that we are seen as a metaverse company, and I want to anchor our work and identity on what we\u2019re building toward.\u201d\n\nPer The Verge, \u201cZuckerberg owns the Twitter handle @meta and meta.com, which now redirects to a welcome page on Facebook outlining the changes. The site previously redirected to meta.org, a biomedical research discovery tool that was a project of the Chan Zuckerberg Science Initiative. That\u2019s part of the philanthropic arm Zuckerberg co-founded with his physician wife, Priscilla Chan, in 2015. In a Medium post on Thursday, the group says it\u2019s sunsetting Meta.org on March 31st, 2022.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going to change?\n\nAs expected, the new name implies that some things about the way Facebook operates would change. Facebook said its corporate structure is not changing, however, how the company reports its financials will. Starting with results for the fourth quarter of 2021, Facebook plans to report on two operating segments: Family of Apps and Reality Labs. The company also said that it will change its stock ticker from FB to MVRS, effective December 1. In addition, Facebook assured users that the announcement does not affect how the company uses or shares data.\n\nAt the Connect conference, Facebook also announced new tools to help people build for the metaverse, including Presence Platform, which will enable new mixed reality experiences on Quest 2, and a $150-million investment in immersive learning to train the next generation of creators.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in a letter on Thursday.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "Beyond investing in African startups, Kepple Africa Ventures is creating new industries",
          "text": "For Satoshi Shinada, taking bets and investing is not something he just started doing.\n\nAt the age of 18, he took his first bet to invest in himself by leaving Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years. I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cThat\u2019s bold! Why did he do this?\u201d I had the same thought too, so I asked him about it.\n\n\u201cI was born and raised in Japan, so I wanted to expose myself to a different environment and culture. I also loved reading stories of adventures which exposed me to stories about Africa,\u201d he told me over a Zoom call.\n\nHow was he able to afford the trip? He had just won a pact he made with his grandma. The deal was if he got admitted to the best university in Japan, the University of Tokyo, she\u2019d give him an allowance. It turned out to be an allowance of $10,000.\n\nIn hindsight, Shinada believes he used the money for a better endeavour: instead of buying items, he bought experience. His experience crisscrossing Africa taught him that, even among diverse cultures, trading is a common language.\n\nBefore making the trip around Africa, he was conflicted on whether to become a researcher or a businessman. At the end of the trip, he had chosen to become a businessman.\n\nIn 2010, upon graduation from college, Shinada joined Sojitz, a Japanese company that led investment in infrastructure and energy projects in West Africa. At Sojitz, he was in charge of developing and investing in infrastructure and energy projects like the first desalination project in sub-Saharan Africa at a commercial scale. After seven years on the job, he itched to do something different.\n\nHe took some time off to return to Japan before heading to Harvard Business School for his MBA. Afterwards, he returned to Africa as a general partner at Kepple Africa Ventures.\n\n\u201cWhile at Sojitz, I had started becoming interested in Nigerian entrepreneurs starting their own businesses. I saw a lot of Africans who studied or lived in Europe and the US coming back to their home countries to start businesses that leveraged on new technologies. This was the opposite of the brain drain. I knew I had to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How did Kepple Africa Ventures start?\n\nSatoshi Shinada: The origin of Kepple dates back to when Takahiro Kanzaki, a certified public accountant, left KPMG to provide accounting and back-office support for startups in Japan. After a few years, he saw that his startups turned out to be well-established companies and unicorns. So, he came up with the idea of creating Fundboard, a portfolio management software-as-a-service (SaaS) company for venture capitalists and private equity firms.\n\nAs a result of that decision, today Kepple is at the centre of the startup community in Japan with this tool. This provided Kepple with access to a network of investors to raise $18 million for Kepple Africa Ventures.\n\nThere are three persons involved in Kepple Africa ventures. Takahiro Kanzaki is in charge of fundraising from Japanese investors. Ryosuke Yamawaki handles investing in East and Southern African startups while I focus on investing in West and North African startups. Yamawaki started investing in Kenyan startups in 2018 while I started doing the same in Nigeria the following year.\n\nDA: What\u2019s Kepple\u2019s investment thesis?\n\nSS: Kepple Africa Ventures came to bridge two gaps. The first was the deep gap between seed and Series A because investors are very fragmented. We wanted to become an anchor investor in the seed stage for startups in Africa.\n\nThe second was, we wanted to bridge the mismatch between what African startups needed and the type of investors available in the ecosystem. We wanted to solve this problem by bringing more Japanese companies to invest directly in African startups and providing strategic support/capital, and in the end becoming an acquirer of the startups.\n\nIn Africa, you usually find financial investors and impact-driven social investors from Europe or the US, but you don\u2019t find lots of strategic investors. These strategic investors are supported by the existing big businesses. They drive the growth of the startups through partnerships and end up even acquiring startups and giving exit opportunities to the ecosystems. You\u2019ll find more of these strategic investors in India or Southeast Asia than in Africa.\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve already facilitated Japanese companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to directly invest in our portfolio companies. In the past 10 months, we\u2019ve brought four or five Japanese companies to directly invest into our portfolio companies.\n\nDA: Hmm, that\u2019s good to hear. What do you look for in the companies you invest in?\n\nSS: First, I\u2019d like to point out that our big vision is to create new industries from Africa. So we don\u2019t consider our investment standalone. We want to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nNow to answer your question, we lookout for the quality of the founders; they have to have a big vision to tackle real problems. Beyond having a big vision, they need to understand the biggest pain points of their customers. And why I say so is that in Africa it\u2019s easy to mix up individual pains and social pains. For instance, deciding to tackle the pain point of poverty in Africa, although an important issue, doesn\u2019t really help you to monetise your business model. Africa is also a place where it is very difficult to make people pay for your service.\n\nSo, your service or product should be really laser-focused on the biggest pain points of your customers and then you monetise that solution. We are not charity investors; we are commercial investors, so monetisation and revenue growth are very important.\n\nDA: Are there any sectors you prefer to invest in?\n\nSS: We\u2019re sector agnostic, but we filter the startups we invest in based on four investment pillars. The first pillar is startups helping to complement or supplement the lack of public infrastructure. For example, we invested in a company called Flare. They are building an ambulance network for Africa. You know in Africa it\u2019s difficult to access a reliable ambulance network, but by providing an Uber-like platform to the owners of ambulances and hospitals, they can create that kind of public service infrastructure of the ambulance network to make people\u2019s lives better and safer.\n\nThe second pillar is startups that help businesses to digitise their operations and production, and make them more efficient. In this case, I\u2019m talking about helping companies with a business-to-business (B2B) model, because in Africa, business-to-consumer (B2C) models are not as active as other markets in Southeast Asia or India.\n\nThe third pillar is focused on startups pioneering innovation where Africa does not have legacy infrastructure yet. Sometimes you can find leapfrogging technology from Africa and that technology could be applicable to other parts of the world. An example of this is one of our portfolio companies called Shyft Power in Nigeria. They automate the management of different power sources: grid of generators, solar power or batteries. They could commercialise this technology because in Nigeria many people don\u2019t rely solely on power from the grid.\n\nIt\u2019s not the same in Japan. If we need to develop that technology in Japan, we have to create a very artificial environment where power is not stable enough. Interestingly, in Japan we are seeing more solar power sources being introduced in each home and now they need to get this power generated by solar to be combined with the power coming from the grid and sell to their communities.\n\nTo wrap this up, the fourth pillar is about startups that facilitate African content created by Africans for Africans. That\u2019s why we have invested in a company like Mdundo, which is seen as the African version of Spotify. We\u2019ve also invested in a company called Athlst, which publishes first-person narratives of African athletes from around the world.\n\nSatoshi Shinada, Maya Tada ( team member at Kepple Africa) and Lanre Aina, Co-Founder/CEO of ATHLST\n\nDA: You\u2019ve invested in almost 100 startups within 3 years. That\u2019s unusual. Why?\n\nSS: Yes, it\u2019s intentional for a number of reasons. We didn\u2019t start out early in VC investing in Africa; we entered this market in 2018. But I think we came to the market at the right time. When we came in, the ecosystem had matured, so we thought it would make sense to bet on great startups quickly.\n\nOur swift approach is modelled after one of the most successful VCs in Southeast Asia, BeeNext. BeeNext makes most of its returns from follow-up investments. So their first cheque is to get their feet in so many startups so they become an insider and know what\u2019s going on in their portfolio companies. Once they see signs of exponential growth, they double down on their investment.\n\nAnother reason we invested in many startups was that we were new to the ecosystem, so we had to establish a reputation by increasing our presence so that we would access greater deal flow. Moving very fast and efficiently did that for us.\n\nFurthermore, we wanted to challenge the perception that Japanese companies are slow. Japanese companies are notoriously known for their very slow decision-making process, compared to Indian or Chinese companies.\n\nDA: How have you been able to combine speed and quality while investing in startups?\n\nSS: That\u2019s a good question, It\u2019s always a balance between the quality and the speed. If you\u2019re investing in seed-stage startups, you don\u2019t have to do very detailed due diligence because one day the startup can decide to change its entire business model. This rarely happens in Series A. You just need to do more detailed due diligence on their product, tech, corporate governance and the founder.\n\nFor the seed-stage deals, it\u2019s more based on your conviction and trust in the founders. If you can build enough trust and conviction, with the minimum amount of due diligence, you should go ahead. And that\u2019s the strategy we took: we usually spend less than one month for due diligence when we invest in seed-stage deals. The quickest investment we\u2019ve made took two weeks, from the first introductory call to wiring the capital.\n\nDA: Tell me about some mistakes you\u2019ve made?\n\nSS: I\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\nAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\n\nDA: Have you had any bad experiences with the startups? Has any startup in your portfolio gone bankrupt?\n\nSS: I don\u2019t have any business that went bankrupt in my portfolio companies.\n\nWe\u2019ve had two companies that stopped operating, but it\u2019s not like the founders just disappeared. We understood how it happened and the founders were serious enough to explain to us what\u2019s going on. One of them even gave back 100% of the money that we invested. So, it wasn\u2019t a very bad situation.\n\nInitially, we thought we\u2019d have many cases of the stories you hear about startups going under or disappearing because our investment has been driven more by conviction and trust with our founders than anything else, but that\u2019s not happening yet. I think this is great validation.\n\nSatoshi Shinada, Maya Tada and the co-founders of Releaf\n\nDA: I see on your website it says you\u2019ve stopped accepting applications. What\u2019s happening?\n\nSS: Yes, that\u2019s true. Now we are in transition to our fund two. So we temporarily stopped accepting applications, but we still keep the form open and get about three to four applications per day. We think it\u2019s very important to keep our doors open to any new startups.\n\nInterestingly, about 85% of our investments was made into the startup that was introduced by one of our portfolio companies, or other co-investors. So the referral is the most important source of the deals. But if you just rely on that, you might miss someone coming from outside the network. So, we want to keep that door open for the outside.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your ticket size?\n\nSS: We are focused on seed-stage deals. Our first cheque is between $50K and150K. Once we invest, we look at the revenue growth in our portfolio companies, and if it shows very dramatic growth, we will do a follow-up investment, which could be somewhere between $200K to $1 million. Where we invest $1 million, it would be a syndicate between other Japanese investors.\n\nDA: Talking about Japanese investors, are there any other Japanese investors in Africa?\n\nSS: There are a few other Japanese VCs, but unfortunately, none of them have their cooperation in Africa. They just go back and forth between Japan and Africa; they\u2019re remote investors.\n\nCompared to them, we think of ourselves as very much committed to Africa because of our background of doing business in Africa. We\u2019ve noticed that a number of them just copy our investment deals. We don\u2019t like this and aren\u2019t comfortable with people just copying us while we\u2019re on the ground bearing the cost of making investments.\n\nDA: Hmm, so why are there not so many Japanese investors on the ground like Kepple?\n\nSS: Well, I think it\u2019s not as a result of the lack of capital or lack of willingness from the Japanese investors to invest in Africa; it\u2019s more about the shortage of capable and experienced talents who can manage the funds in Africa. It\u2019s very difficult to find talent who understand the African market and who can commit their lives to Africa.\n\nI\u2019m single, so it\u2019s very easy for me to move around, but my partner Ryosuke, who is based in Kenya, had to bring his wife and two kids along with him. He\u2019s really committed. His family has been around for a while such that his kids now speak Swahili.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "Nigeria became the first country in Africa to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) this week after President Muhammadu Buhari unveiled the eNaira at the State House in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nIssued by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the digital currency is built on a private blockchain technology developed by Bitt Inc and has the same value as the fiat or physical currency.\n\nThe new currency can be accessed and used via the eNaira wallet (named \u201cSpeed\u201d), a digital storage held and managed on a distributed ledger. The wallet is available for download via app stores like Google Play Store and Apple App Store.\n\nHowever, questions remain about the use cases of the eNaira.\n\neNaira use cases\n\nFinancial institutions are responsible for onboarding their customers and integrating the eNaira wallet feature into their digital banking channels.\n\nFor individuals and merchants/businesses, the wallet is required to access, hold and use the eNaira. Users can also dial a USSD shortcode and follow the required steps to perform transactions.\n\nGoing by CBN\u2019s guidelines, the requirements for opening a wallet, transaction and balance limits, as well as transaction types available, are based on the wallet tier a user belongs to.\n\nThe dedicated individual wallet for eNaira recorded over 100,000 downloads on Google Play Store less than 48 hours after its rollout, according to reports, before it was removed following a series of complaints and poor ratings. The merchant version had been downloaded more than 10,000 times.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor now, eNaira transaction types available to individual consumers via the wallet include person-to-person (P2P) transfers between friends and family; person-to-business (P2B) to pay for goods or services; and person-to-government (P2G) to pay for public services.\n\nNigerians can also transfer cash from bank accounts to the eNaira speed wallet and vice versa, receive support allowance directly from the CBN through government-to-person (G2P) transfers and carry out any other services as may be approved by the CBN from time to time.\n\nUsing the wallet, merchants can send money to their bank accounts and vice versa, as well as carry out merchant/business-to-person (M/B2P) transfers. Merchants also have to sweep their balance(s) into their bank accounts on a daily basis.\n\neNaira Merchant speed wallets can thus be used for receiving and making eNaira payments for goods and services as well as salary payments.\n\nCommercial banks like Stanbic IBTC and Guaranty Trust Bank already have how-to instructions on their websites. According to the banks, the wallet guarantees secure, faster, cheaper, and more convenient transactions for individual and merchant users.\n\nIn the long run, CBN envisions a scenario where financial institutions build an ecosystem of services, such as cross-border transfers, with eNaira as the base product. For instance, a Nigerian trader with a UBA account will be able to settle his import bills from China using eNaira.\n\nThe digital currency could also bring a significant majority of Nigerians without bank accounts into the formal financial economy. The minimum requirement for opening a tier 0 wallet is a phone number while the tier 1 category requires a mobile number and verified national identity number (NIN).\n\nThus, a plumber or vulcaniser in Oyo or Cross River State without a bank account can accept payments via his phone, store them in his wallet, and make transactions with any vendor.\n\nThe eNaira wallet tiers and conditions. Image credit: CBN whitepaper\n\nThe eNaira project will be implemented in phases. Image credit: CBN whitepaper\n\nIn addition, the CBN plans to integrate the eNaira into its forex process via international money transfer operators (IMTOs) to enable Nigerians easily receive remittances.\n\nTransactions on the eNaira platform are free for the first 90 days from Monday, after which banks will revert to applicable charges as outlined in the CBN\u2019s guide.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Estonian on-demand transportation company, Bolt, plans to launch electric taxi services in South Africa four months after introducing e-bike food delivery services in the country.\n\nBolt\u2019s plan comes on the heels of launching a \u201cgreen category,\u201d which allows riders to hail an electric or hybrid vehicle.\n\nHow would this be done? Per TechCrunch, Bolt plans to partner with banks in its African markets to assist its drivers in obtaining credit for buying electric vehicles and is exploring alternatives to its current scheme with leasing companies.\n\nThe company, which has operations in 45 countries \u2013 including seven in Africa \u2013 was launched in 2013 by Markus Villig, Bolt CEO.\n\nWhat does Bolt do? The company offers a variety of services such as ride-hailing, car, scooter, and bike rentals, food delivery, and, most recently, grocery delivery, branding itself as a transport and deliveries company.\n\nBesides, Bolt recently launched its food delivery service in Nigeria, and it has expanded its reach in South Africa to Johannesburg after moving to Cape Town in 2020.\n\nIs this familiar? Yes. The company provides a green card option in Kenya and also operates e-bike food delivery.\n\nThe company also plans to introduce food delivery e-mobility options in other East African markets, including Uganda and Tanzania.\n\naYo to modify business model to fuel growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Assistant on the Nokia \u2018Banana\u2019 8110 feature phone. Image: Screenshot from \u2018How KaiOS Is Becoming the 3rd Major Mobile OS\u2019.\n\naYo Holdings, a micro-insurance joint venture between MTN and Momentum Metropolitan Holdings (MMH), announced yesterday, Thursday, October 28th, 2021, that it will be transforming its technology backend and data management approach.\n\nWhat does this mean? This means aYo will be modifying its business model.\n\nWhy? The company plans to drive greater scale, better customer experience, and faster access to markets across the African continent in the coming years.\n\nWhy should you care? Launched in 2017, aYo offers hospital and life cover in Zambia, Uganda, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Also, the company says it currently has more than 15 million customers.\n\nMarius Botha, aYo Holdings CEO, said the company\u2019s vision is to become Africa\u2019s largest financial services technology platform by enabling the distribution of a diverse range of affordable and accessible microfinance products.\n\naYo and its shareholder, MTN, as of the time of writing, are currently finalising the details of a partnership with a new insurance group to gain access to more underwriter licenses and expand its product range and market penetration.\n\nAs part of this technological evolution, aYo has shifted to a cloud data warehousing approach, employing Snowflake as a solution to deal with growing volumes of customer data.\n\nBotha said, \u201cData is a key asset that we want to grow and leverage, as it will allow us to drive better outcomes and value for our customers.\u201d\n\naYo believes that experimenting with cutting-edge technologies will help them achieve their goal of providing disenfranchised Africans with access to financial services and bringing them into the economic mainstream.\n\nFacebook changes its name to Meta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? Yesterday, Thursday, October 28, 2021, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, announced at the company\u2019s Connect event that its new name will be Meta.\n\nWhy? Per The Verge, the rebranding is part of the company\u2019s efforts to shift its focus away from being known solely as a social media company and toward Zuckerberg\u2019s plans for building the metaverse.\n\nIn a blog post, Zuckerberg said its corporate structure would not change, but it would affect how financials are reported.\n\nNamibian government to reduce crime through SIM card registration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, October 26, 2021, the Namibian government announced that its plan to encourage citizens to register their identities when purchasing SIM cards is to aid the tracking down of criminals who use technology to commit crimes, among other things.\n\nIn March 2021, the government approved new regulations requiring all mobile phone subscribers to register their SIM cards before accessing network services.\n\nIs this common? Yes. 50 countries in Africa have introduced mandatory SIM card registration laws.\n\nBut Mbeuta Ua-Ndjarakana, Executive Director of the Information Ministry, has not set a date for the regulations to take effect.\n\nIn a statement, Ua-Ndjarakana stated that the request for information from stored SIM cards would be made following the regulations, including an order issued by a judge or magistrate authorising the obtaining of that information from service providers.\n\nUa-Ndjarakana said that the SIM card registration process would be done to protect consumers\u2019 privacy. He also mentioned that once the Communication Regulatory Authority of Namibia (CRAN) completes the consultation process and implementation modalities with operators, he will issue a start date for SIM card registration in the country.\n\nBut does SIM card registration reduce crime in Africa? Per The Citizen, information gathered from SIM cards during the registration process is unreliable in combating cybercrime.\n\nAccording to The Citizen, experts have warned of an increased risk of citizens being subjected to state surveillance due to this technology.\n\nHowever, according to Isa Pantami, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, incidents of terror like banditry and kidnapping have significantly decreased in the country due to the implementation of a policy requiring citizens to obtain a National Identification Number (NIN).\n\nWhat\u2019s your take?

Well, on the one hand, her tech-enabled agribusiness recently raised a $3m Series A round to help accelerate global expansion. That\u2019s plenty validation.

Source: Supplied,\n\nSouth African API fintech startup, Stitch has today announced its expansion into Nigeria and a $2M seed extension, with investment from Future Africa and Norrsken Foundation, among others.\n\nStitch announced an initial $4 million seed in February when it came out of stealth. This brings its total seed round to $6 million.\n\nThe startup launched officially in February 2021 with an API that provides software companies with identity verification tools and access to users\u2019 financial data.\n\nSince its launch, the company claims to have grown by 40-50% month-on-month.\n\nSpeaking about the company\u2019s expansion to Nigeria, Kiaan Pillay, Stitch CEO, says, \u201cNigeria is one of the most active markets on the continent, if not the world, for fintech. The opportunity we see here is endless.\u201d\n\nHe says the company plans to become the \u201cgo-to partner for any businesses building financial products in Africa.\u201d\n\nMore competition: Stitch would be facing off with other API fintech players such as Mono which announced a $15 million Series A earlier this month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMono, which launched in 2020, boasts partnerships with 270 businesses and 200 million financial data transactions.\n\nMeanwhile, this seed extension is to enable Stitch to grow its team in Nigeria as it prepares to expand into other African countries.\n\nCoup attempts in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\u2019s latest military coup occurred on Monday, October 25, 2021, in Sudan.\n\nThousands of Sudanese were met with bullets as they took to the streets to protest the dissolution of their democracy.\n\nPer Reuters, 7 people were killed by gunfire while 140 others were injured in clashes between soldiers and protesters.\n\nCoup \u2018pon coup: As a continent, Africa has experienced her share of challenges, deeply rooted in political tyranny and unaccountability, resulting in coups or dictatorships.\n\nAccording to Intelligence by Techpoint, Africa has witnessed 83 coup attempts since 1990, with 42 successful. Although rare today, coups still threaten democracy.\n\nRecoMed\u2019s $1.5m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tyck via Iwaria\n\nRecoMed, an online healthcare marketplace, has closed a $1.5 million financing round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the round was led by Vunani Fintech Fund with participation from others including, Growth Grid Venture Capital Partners and Push Ventures.\n\nWhat does RecoMed do? Look at it as an Amazon for healthcare professionals.\n\nLaunched in 2013, it is a platform where patients can request healthcare professionals across South Africa by searching practitioner profiles while checking reviews.\n\nRecoMed says its platform reduces the time it takes for patients to get the medical services they need. The startup takes a cut per requests made on the website.\n\nIs healthtech the next fintech? While fintech startups still get a significant chunk of African funding, healthtech startups seem to be attracting some serious cash.\n\nAccording to Disrupt Africa, funding for healthtech startups increased by 257.5% from 2019 to 2020.\n\nHowever, Africa\u2019s healthcare sector still needs more funding to increase access to quality and affordable health services. According to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), $25-30 billion in new investment will be needed to meet Africa\u2019s healthcare demand over the next decade.\n\nRecoMed plans to integrate new products into its platform with the funding.\n\nUnion54 raises $3m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnion54 Founders, Perseus Mlambo and Alessandra Martini. Credit: TechCrunch.\n\nZambian fintech startup, Union54 has raised $3 million in seed funding.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, The Y Combinator-backed startup saw investments from Tiger Global, ACE & Company, and Runa Capital.\n\nWhat does the startup do? Union54 owns an API that helps software companies issue debit cards without a bank or third-party processor.\n\nThe startup was launched by a couple, Perseus Mlambo and Alessandra Martini, this year. It is an offshoot of their previous company, Zazu, which launched in 2015 as a neobank in Zambia.\n\nThe duo launched Union54 after they encountered difficulty in issuing debit cards at Zazu. The cards had to be issued through partner banks, a process that took a lot of time.\n\nMlambo told TechCrunch that they \u201crealised that either the processor or the bank was not necessarily well equipped to be able to answer our questions or to be able to give us the product that we\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nThe funding will be channelled at building a strong engineering and product and sales team.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nNigeria\u2019s March to the Gallows.

          "title": "COP26: Success for Africa is holding rich nations to their climate finance pledges",
          "text": "Rich countries committed to mobilizing $100billion yearly in long-term financing under the Paris Agreement as part of their historical responsibility for climate change but they are not meeting up and experts say Africa should demand accountability.\n\nTherefore the African delegation to COP 26 have been urged not to be quick to give away the house unless they extract commitments from rich countries who bear more responsibility for climate change to pay a fair share towards efforts to combat its impacts.\n\nThe Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN), an environment non-profit called on African governments to be resolute in their demand for climate change liability and payments for carbon debts by rich countries.\n\nGodwin Uyi Ojo, executive director, ERA/FoEN said the pledge to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020-2025 as funds to address climate change actions stands at about 30 percent, and is nowhere near what is needed to address the change.\n\n\u201cAfrican delegates should ensure to speak with one voice to demand transitional justice in the payment of carbon debts currently put at 334 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere,\u201d he said.\n\nOjo, citing a 2015 study published in Nature Climate Change, in which Concordia University researcher Damon Matthews showed how national carbon and climate debts could be used to decide who should pay for the global costs of climate mitigation and damages, the world\u2019s leading polluters have racked up a $10 trillion carbon debt for carbon dioxide emissions since 1990.\n\n\u201cThis demand for carbon debt payment is sacrosanct and does not deflect from the US$100 billion commitment for climate actions,\u201d Ojo said.\n\nRead Also: COP26 Climate Change: Developed countries to mobilise $100bn yearly\n\nCOP26\n\nHow rich countries can meet their commitments\n\nThe governments of Canada and Germany have published a \u2018Delivery Plan,\u2019 commissioned by the incoming COP26 President, that outlines how developed countries plan to meet their joint commitment of mobilizing $100 billion in climate finance for developing countries annually from 2020 to 2025 even as it confirms that rich countries have not always met their climate finance commitments.\n\n\u201cThough developed countries pledged twelve years ago to mobilize $100 billion in climate finance annually by 2020, the \u2018Delivery Plan\u2019 confirms it is unlikely that they delivered the requisite contributions last year,\u201d said Lorena Gonzalez, senior associate in the WRI Finance Center.\n\nGonzalez said developing countries need finance now so that they can invest in climate action to shift their economies\u2019 long-term trajectory, as well as deal with mounting climate impacts.\n\nAccording to the report, based on recent estimates from the OECD, climate finance provided and mobilised by developed countries increased from US$58.5 billion in 2016 to US$79.6 billion in 2019.\n\nThis represents an overall increase since committing to the US$100 billion goal in 2009, when collective climate finance, reached US$30 billion for the period 2010\u20132012.\n\nThe plan said that based on the latest data, a more than US$20 billion annual increase would be required to meet the US$100 billion goal in2020. While it will not be known until 2022 whether the US$100 billion goal has been met in 2020, recent trends show that it apears unlikely.\n\nOne way to raise this funding, according to the report, is for rich countries to increasing the scale of climate finance and increase finance for adaptation. Article 9.4 of the Paris Agreement states that the provision of scaled-up financial resources should aim to achieve a balance between adaptation and mitigation.\n\nRich countries are also urged to prioritise grant-based finance for the poorest and most vulnerable whose situation has become complicated by the ravages of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cDeveloped countries will hence prioritize grant-based resources, as part of a wide variety of financial instruments, to ensure there are adequate financial tools at the project level,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe report also suggested addressing barriers in accessing climate finance, strengthening the Financial Mechanism of UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, working with Multilateral Development Banks to increase and improve climate finance better manage private finance and report on collective progress transparently.\n\nAnalysts say Africa, least responsible for, and yet most vulnerable to climate change, cannot afford to be complacent on the need for strong negotiating positions and astute diplomacy in order to get good outcomes from the UN meeting.\n\n\u201cOf the many negotiation issues that concern Africa, climate finance has to be among the priorities,\u201d said Chukwumerije Okereke, director, Center for Climate Change and Development, a think-tank out of the Alex-Ekwueme Federal University.\n\nAt the recent 76th UN General Assembly (UNGA) in New York, rich nations pledged to commit funds towards climate financing. For example, US President Joe Biden doubled the US Government climate finance pledge from $5.7bn to $11.4bn per year by 2024 though this is now up in the air with the uncertain negotiations at the Capitol.\n\nUK prime minister Boris Johnson pledged 11.1 billion pounds and Japan said it will provide climate finance, both public and private, to developing countries including small island states, totalling approximately $60 billion over the next five years from 2021 to 2025.\n\n\u201cWhile these new financial pledges are commendable, it is important that African leaders are not na\u00efve or ignorant about a host of outstanding issues on climate finance in COP26,\u201d Okereke said.\n\nThe scholar in an op ed said African leaders must know that the $100 billion pledged by rich countries is insufficient in comparison to what climate change is costing and will cost developing countries, so African governments must get rich countries that are responsible for climate change to increase their pledges in COP26.\n\nOkereke also said African governments must ensure that rich countries will provide new and additional financing to the existing Overseas Development Assistance and not conflate the two and must argue for energy security for Africa whose being railroaded to abandon its gas resources in the midst of energy poverty.\n\n\u201cWe cannot expect African nations, which together emitted seven times less CO2 than China last year and four times less than the US, according to the Global Carbon Atlas, to undermine their best opportunities for economic development by simply aligning with the Western view of how to tackle carbon emissions,\u201d said Nj Ayuk, executive chairman, African Energy Chamber, an energy think at the launch of the International Energy Association Net-Zero target earlier this year.\n\nThe \u2018Delivery Plan,\u2019 developed under the leadership of Minister Wilkinson from Canada and State Secretary Flasbarth from Germany, could be a key step toward ensuring developed countries rapidly scale up climate finance. Developing countries deserve to see a clear, credible and robust plan for realizing the pledge, analysts say.\n\nWhile the Delivery Plan is said to be an important start, especially in outlining a path to achieving an average of $100 billion per year for the period 2021-2025, but it does not address the likely shortfall from 2020.\n\nBuilding on this, developed countries and multilateral development banks need to ramp up commitments so that the $100 billion per year goal can be met before the expected 2023 date. They should also recognize that the $100 billion is a floor and not a ceiling, the document said.\n\nMost developed countries have not yet mobilized finance in accordance with their fair share. The United States is responsible for the greatest shortfall, and Australia, Canada, Italy, Greece, Iceland, and Portugal, among others, would need to do more.\n\nThe plan called on developed countries to continue to work toward a robust and credible collective strategy to deliver on this long-standing commitment as soon as possible, making up for any shortfalls\u2014including those from 2020\u2014and strengthening reporting and adaptation finance.\n\n\u201cAs a pillar of the Paris Agreement, much stands on climate finance. The stronger this pillar, the stronger the Agreement and the faster and farther we can move toward rapid decarbonization and enhanced adaptation and resilience that will save lives and promote human livelihood around the world,\u201d the document said.\n\nClimate financing will be a critical issue at COP 26 and the annual $100 billion goal born at the 2009 Copenhagen Accord, formalized in Cancun in 2010 and affirmed as part of the Paris pact will take center stage. Failure to make progress on this goal would undermine much-needed trust in the Paris Agreement.",

          "title": "Thomas Tuchel: From career-ending injury to world\u2019s best coach",
          "text": "Thomas Tuchel is labelled the best manager on the planet right now, but that did not happen overnight.\n\nBorn in Krumbach, the 48-year old started his football career at TSV Krumbach, a club coached by his father Rudolf Tuchel.\n\nHe later moved to FC Augsburg academy in 1988, but never played for the first team, and left after he turned 19.\n\nTuchel signed for Bundesliga side Stuttgarter Kickers in 1992 and played eight games during the 1992\u201393 season.\n\nAfter the 1993\u201394 season, he was dropped from Kickers\u2019 first team, and later joined SSV Ulm. Playing as a central defender, he played for SSV Ulm until being forced to retire in 1998, at age 24, after suffering a knee cartilage injury\n\nIn May 2021, Thomas Tuchel announced his name on the global stage helping Chelsea win the prestigious Uefa Champions League, the biggest trophy in European club football, just 4 months after taking over.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge step to arrive in the final, but it\u2019s even bigger one to bite away through,\u201d Tuchel said after winning the Champions League.\n\nIn just four months, Tuchel made everybody forget about his predecessor, Chelsea legend, Frank Lampard.\n\nFour months in which Chelsea defeated top teams in England and Europe and they did it without conceding any goal.\n\nSince Tuchel was appointed Chelsea boss in January 2021, the former Paris Saint-Germain and Borussia Dortmund manager has quickly and quietly become one of the most successful coaches in club football.\n\nDespite only being in the job for a few months, Tuchel secured a place in the top four and masterminded Chelsea\u2019s success in the Champions League.\n\n\u201cHe is an outstanding coach,\u201d Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp noted.\n\n\u201c He is one of the best coaches in the world,\u201d the perfectionist, Pep Guardiola exclaimed.\n\nRead Also: Five things Thomas Tuchel must do to fix Chelsea\n\nThomas Tuchel\n\nTuchel never had Klopp\u2019s charisma, Guardiola\u2019s intellectual aura or Diego Simone\u2019s energy, but he learned from all of them and now stands at the top of the coaching pyramid.\n\nThe biggest question here is how did Tuchel become the best coach in the world?\n\nTuchel started his coaching career in 2000 as a youth team coach at VfB Stuttgart, where he piloted in the development of first team players.\n\nIn 2005, Tuchel returned to Augsburg, with club sporting director Andreas Rettig noting the club\u2019s admiration of\n\nTuchel\u2019s tactical discipline led to him being appointed by Augsburg as a youth coach in 2005.\n\nHe was hired despite lacking a UEFA Pro Licence, which he gained in a six-and-a-half month course in Cologne.\n\nTuchel held the position for three years, after being offered the position as first team coach at FC Augsburg II in 2007\u201308 season.\n\nBack in 2009, Tuchel, an inexperienced youth coach took over at Bundesliga side, Mainz 05 a club where another exciting young coach, Jurgen Klopp, had started his career.\n\n\u201cThere are worst things than being compared to Jurgen Klopp,\u201d Tuchel said in a video documentary\n\n\u201cWe have known each other for a long time, we have a common history. He worked for Mainz as I did.\u201d Klopp noted,\n\nFrom his early days as a coach, Tuchel had his eye on the biggest coaches in the game.\n\nEven as he made his first steps in the Bundesliga, Tuchel was learning from the very best.\n\nI don\u2019t want to rest, I want the next one, I want the next success, and I want the next title.\n\nHis playing career ended at age 25 due to a knee injury, so he went ahead to study economics and worked at a bar before returning to football as a youth coach and later got a coaching role at Mainz.\n\n\u201cWe had our first training session on Tuesday and play our first game on Saturday. The team had knocked out of the cup to a fourth division side. So, I see it as an ideal time to take charge.\u201d\n\nTuchel led Mainz 05 to 9th place at that time, their best-ever finish. In his second season, Mainz qualified for the Europa League.\n\nIn a very short spell, Tuchel turned Mainz 05 into a top team.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s more about passion and desire,\u201d he hinted\n\nTraining has always been at the heart of Tuchel\u2019s success, and his methods were revolutionary. For example, to stop his players from relying on long balls out wide, he cut off the corners of the pitch.\n\n\u201cWe trained in extremely tight spaces; diamonds and circles that are 18 meters wide and 75 meters long, with two goal posts.\n\n\u201cWe have never trained on a full pitch with a full squad.\u201d\n\nTuchel forced his players to find solutions in tight spaces. That meant when they took to a full pitch for games, they played with greater freedom. His approach is practice makes perfect.\n\n\u201cWe aimed to get three points in every game, but our focus is to stay and stick with our game plan.\u201d\n\nAnother part of Tuchel\u2019s strategy is to set up to counteract each opponent\n\nKlopp plays high pressing format. Pep prefers tiki-taka, but Tuchel can beat them both by anticipating their every move and finding new tactical innovations. At Mainz, he never played the same formation with the same players twice in a row.\n\nBut Tuchel\u2019s biggest problem is the expectation of consistent excellence creates friction with some players.\n\n\u201cYou are not here to play our game, just play your game, furious Tuchel said to his players at the training ground\n\nHeinz Muller, a former player said; \u201cWhat he did to me was 100 percent bullying. He\u2019s a dictator. \u201d\n\nThe cerebral, meticulous perfectionist, Tuchel took over one of the most emotional clubs in the world, Borussia Dortmund.\n\nHe was happy to get his hands dirty during a training session and set things up himself.\n\nHis strategy worked, Tuchel won more points per game than any other Dortmund coach ever. And in each of his two years with the team, he led them to the cup final, winning it once. He also has the record of best total points of any second-placed team in Bundesliga history.\n\nTuchel improved his players, the likes of; Mats Hummels, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, and Marco Royce were at their best in his reign.\n\nTuchel moved Dortmund away from Klopp\u2019s heavy metal football to a flexible, possession-based game where the man with the ball always has multiple options.\n\nTuchel left Dortmund and picked up another high-profile job with rich and star-studded French Lique side, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG).\n\nIt was a different challenge at PSG, managing world-class players and turning them into a formidable team was his biggest challenge.\n\n\u201cFrom our first conversation, I could tell he is a winner, he always wants to improve and show his best side, \u201d Neymar said.\n\nTuchel had a successful stint in PSG, winning his first 14 games in a row for a league record. In his first two seasons, he won two league titles and the French Cup and finished runners up to Bayern in the Champions League. But losing that final went down badly in Paris, and after the team started the following season, poorly Tuchel\u2019s relationship with the media became poor.\n\n\u201cName one team that scores 4 or five goals in every game, that is impossible, but you always find something negative,\u201d Tuchel said while addressing journalists at a post-match briefing.\n\nPSG owners wanted more and a fallout with the sporting director, Leonardo led to Tuchel\u2019s sack.\n\nHis old employers didn\u2019t seem surprised with Dortmund\u2019s Vazquez saying\n\n\u201cThomas is a difficult person. You can see that in Paris too, but he\u2019s a fantastic coach, \u201d Hans-Joachim Watzke said.\n\nThe numbers show Tuchel was a success at PSG. He won three of every four games.\n\nHere at the Premier League, the toughest league in the world, Tuchel won two points per game in his first half-season at Chelsea.\n\n\u201c I saw some routines, some fundamentals, some processes that I remember when I faced them in a Borussia Dortmund, \u201d Pep said.\n\n\u201cIt will be tricky to face him, because he\u2019s a good coach.\u201d Klopp in his words about Tuchel.\n\nTuchel\u2019s obsessive demand means he is never satisfied with success.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to rest, I want the next one, I want the next success, and I want the next title.\u201d\n\nThomas Tuchel is rated the best manager, but the big question is how long will this rein last?",

          "text": "Chukwuka Ekweani popularly known as Ckay grew up around music as his dad was a lover of classical music which influenced his love for art. His passion for music brought him to Lagos with a dream to join a record label.\n\nBorn in Kaduna, northern Nigeria, he began his journey into the music industry in 2018 but a lot of people did not recognize him as an artist only as a producer. While in Lagos as a producer for Chocolate, Ckay produced an entire range of songs like Otedola by Dice Ailes, Blood and fire by DJ Neptune and Container which was his first major single.\n\nSince then, he has released an extended play (EP) titled \u2018Ckay the first\u2019 in 2019. The EP was also his first studio album \u2018Boyfriend\u2019 which came out in 2021 where he collaborated with some of the country\u2019s biggest stars, including Davido. The EP was a mix of a sexy, dance-worthy, and sometimes experimental brand of Afrobeats.\n\nIn an interview with Pulse Tv, Ekweani admitted to an in-house battle for the song that was going to lead publicity for album the \u2018Ckay the first\u201d. After an extended deliberation the record label, Chocolate City finally agreed to push the song Love Nwantinti. Later it was decided that Ckay should feature Joeboy and Kuami Eugene for the remix of the song in Q1 2020 that has since got the ears of millions.\n\nRead also: Spotify reveals Nigeria\u2019s top music cities, songs they love\n\n\u2018Love Nwantinti\u2019 the song which literally means small love in Igbo, talks about the singer\u2019s intense desire for a love interest. Featuring Joeboy may have been the best decision for Love Nwantinti. Joeboy has in the past done songs that appeal to younger female audiences locally and get them attracted each time they listen.\n\n\u201cWhen we released the EP, we just noticed that people were making videos,\u201d CKay said in an interview with hiphopDX. \u201cGirls were making videos with that song, specifically. With no promo or nothing, organically, girls just liked to make videos with this song.\u201d\n\nIndustry experts also attribute the success of the song to being released during the global COVID-19 pandemic. It was so popular on social media that Winnie Harlow, a popular Jamaican-Canadian fashion model danced to the song.\n\nThe individual video versions of the song done by fans on Tiktok and other social media platforms have contributed to its streaming numbers hitting the big times. On streaming services like Youtube, Spotify, and Audiomack Love Nwantinti has racked up almost 100 million, 12 million, and 11 million streams respectively.\n\nFor weeks now, a new version of Love Nwantinti done by DJ Yo and Axel, has taken over Tiktok and has grabbed the listening and viewing attention of millions of users across the world an indication of the fluidity and versatility of the song in creating different kind of content.",

          "title": "Nigerians rise up against attack on Odili\u2019s residence",
          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nIrked by the crude invasion of the residence of Nigeria\u2019s senior Supreme Court judge, Justice Mary Odili, by security operatives on Friday night, many Nigerians have risen up in her defence, condemning the act as an attempt to intimidate the judicial arm of government, even as many have suggested that she is being targeted because she the second most senior justice of the Supreme Court after the current Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Ibrahim Tanko Muhammad\n\nRecall that a team of police officers, said to be operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), and soldiers late Friday, invaded Justice Odili\u2019s official residence at Maitama, Abuja, brandishing a search warrant issued by Emmanuel Iyanna, a chief magistrate at Wuse Zone 6 Magistrate Court.\n\nThe security operatives had arrived at the residence bearing the warrant that was issued based on whistleblower information from a certain Aliyu Umar, an Abuja residence, who deposed on October 13, that there were illegal activities going on at 9, Imo Street, Maitama, that should warrant immediate action from the law enforcement.\n\nThe whistleblower, reportedly said in court filings that the tip-off was supplied to the EFCC, which was said to have prompted Mr Iyanna to issue a warrant on October 29 for the property to be searched.\n\nSubsequently, operatives mobilised to Mrs Odili\u2019s house based on the warrant seeking to forcibly search it in the evening of October 29, the same day a warrant was approved.\n\nBut she rejected the move to search her residence because she had no pending issues with anti-graft agencies.\n\nJustice Odili also argued that the warrant was not meant for her residence since she lives at 7, Imo River Street, Maitama, and not 9, Imo Street, Maitama, as stated in the warrant. The operatives nonetheless laid siege on the residence for hours.\n\nThe warrant has since been withdrawn by the magistrate who said the ministry of justice lied to him to obtain same.\n\nWhile the EFCC, through its spokesperson, Wilson Uwujaren, denied invading Odili\u2019s residence, noting that the commission, \u201cwishes to inform the public that the report is false as it did not carry out any operation at the home of Justice Odili. If there was any such operation as claimed by the media, it was not carried out by the EFCC. The Commission enjoins the public to discountenance the report,\u201d police and military personnel refused to vacate the residence for long periods.\n\nThe officers, however, subsequently left following the revocation of their warrant.\n\nAs a fallout of the invasion, many commentators have taken to social media to berate the President Muhammadu Buhari government, while suggesting that the action may have some ethnic and religious undertones, given the status of Justice Odili as the next most senior Supreme Court justice after the current CJN), Muhammad, though Odili is 69 years of age, two years older than Muhammad who is 67.\n\n\u201cJustice Mary Odili became No. 2 in the ranking of Supreme Court Justices following the death of Justice Nwali Sylvester Ngwuta, CFR, on 7th of March, 3 weeks to his 70th birthday,\u201d said Paul Ibe, @omonlakiki. \u201cYou can now use your tongue to count your teeth.\u201d\n\nAnother user, Th\u03b5\u03cc Abu, @TheoAbuAgada, noted: \u201cLest we forget, Dr. Mary Odili is the next in line to succeed the current CJN who has been away from work over ill health. A familiar pattern\u2026\u201d\n\nSome equally drew parallels with controversial removal of Cross River State born Justice Walter Onnoghen, from office as CJN in the lead up to the 2019 general election, with President Buhari suspending him and appointing Muhammad as his successor, following charges of alleged failure to declare his personal assets before taking office in 2017 preferred against him by the Code of Conduct Bureau.\n\nMany had insisted that Onnoghen, whose appointment as CJN was delayed by Buhari and was only made possible by vice president, Yemi Osinbajo, who was acting president appointed him as CJN, while the president was in London on health grounds in 2017, was targeted because of his region, religion and ethnicity, and similar argument has been made following the action against Odili, who happens to come from Rivers State, same South South zone as the former CJN.\n\n\u201cWe from Rivers state are observing closely, we will not allow the Onnoghen treatment to be meted to her, our Governor and other senior people are already on ground,\u201d wrote Gospel_Rx, @oga_pharmacist. \u201cThis madness must end\u2026\u201d\n\nMaking similar point, another user @Ekwulu, said: \u201cIt\u2019s like the serial nepotists are about to do an Onnoghen on Justice Mrs Odili. They hate competence and orderly succession. They must impose a lackey to be teleguided like a TV remote.\u201d\n\nStill, for another user, Concerned citizen, @aelinwa, it is a misplacement of priority for security agencies to be flexing their muscle against Justice Odili as when the country has security issues to tackle.\n\n\u201cMrs Mary Odili\u2019s house was invaded this night. A highly placed judicial officer of d FGN,\u201d he said. \u201cSheikh Gumi who has high connection with d terrorists has not even been interrogated by d EFCC, and other Securities but have d effrontery to invade the house of the Justice.\u201d\n\nLast night, as news of the invasion filtered through the media, governor of Rivers state, Nyesom Wike, visited the house with his team to confirm the story.\n\nThose spotted with him at the house include: Abiye Sekibo, former minister of transportation; Raymond Dokpesi, founder of DAAR communications; Austin Okpara, former deputy speaker of the house of representatives; and Okon Aniete and Lee Maeba, a former senator.\n\nMrs Odili\u2019s husband Peter had been under EFCC investigation for alleged fraud that dates back to his tenure as Rivers governor between 1999 and 2007. He has, however, denied the charges, and a federal judge ordered the release of his international passport earlier this week.",

          "title": "Actress to Tiwa Savage: Your sex without condom sends wrong message",
          "text": "Actress Sonia Ogiri is one female that has been very vocal about the sex tape of Tiwa Savage that went viral on social media platforms some weeks ago.\n\nHer frequent posts had also made some netizens opine that her opinions are borne out of \u201cjealousy or hatred\u201d for the award-winning singer.\n\nIn an interview with Saturday Beats, Ogiri, however, maintained her stand.\n\nShe said, \u201cYes, I have been vocal about Tiwa\u2019s sex tape, it\u2019s so unfortunate. For me, the news did not sit well, and that was why I spoke out. I must not have millions of followers, and must not be the most popular person in Nigeria for me to make my point. It is my point, my observation, and my opinion. I am part of the public; to begin with, forget about the whole social media presence or celebrity world. We\u2019re all part of the general public. She brought it out, it came to my hearing, and I contributed my quota. It\u2019s my right, and no one can take it from me. I don\u2019t care how other people see it, I don\u2019t care how people want to garnish it, I don\u2019t care about the people standing with or against her. I am not for once standing against her, I just aired my opinion about the sex tape, and it should not even have happened. She should be more aware of these things. People make mistakes and we learn from people\u2019s mistakes, she has seen other celebrities\u2019 sex tapes get leaked, so she should be smarter at this age. To me, age should come with some sense of belonging, responsibility, and wisdom. So, I expected her to be wiser than that sex tape.\n\n\u201cIt truly beats my imagination, and it\u2019s devastating, especially in Nigeria, to know that a mature celebrity would have a sex tape at this age, time, and era. It\u2019s a big error, and it\u2019s a no for me. Tiwa or any other celebrity should abstain, they should desist from this. If it is your fantasy, handle it differently. If it is your fantasy to have a sex tape, you can do that and delete immediately or save it to a hidden file where you know that the mistake of leaking the tape would never occur. Keep it off the general public, because it\u2019s really unfortunate. Tiwa should be held responsible but she hasn\u2019t apologised, she needs to apologise. She owes Nigerians a big apology. Yes, I hold her responsible, and everybody else should hold her responsible for that. And the reason I said that is because she is big enough.\u201d\n\nOgiri, who further said that she had analysed the short clip thoroughly, also noted that Savage, was having unprotected intercourse.\n\nShe continued \u201cLet\u2019s analyse this, you\u2019re having sex with someone and the person held his phone, that should tell you that something was going on, he should be holding onto something or holding onto you or touching something, but he held his phone and you were busy moaning and enjoying the moment. He was busy videoing you up to your face, showing everything that represents her as a woman. To even add salt to injury, she did what she did without a condom, what message is she passing to society? Apart from that, the sex tape of people that I have seen is always well organised, you see them in a proper arrangement on a well-made bed, lost in the mood with rose flowers or bottles of wine in the room. For a woman of that magnitude, status, level, age, and exposure, you can imagine how bitter this whole thing is; it\u2019s so disgusting and disrespectful to her.\u201d\n\nThe mother of one also noted that even though she is in love with someone, she dates responsibly and also controls her fantasy. Ogiri said, \u201cOf course I am in love with someone and I am in a relationship. If you\u2019re in love or in a relationship and both of you love each other, there is no limit to what you can do, but since there is no limit to what you can do, you have to do it wisely. I cannot control anybody\u2019s fantasy or teach them how to fantasise, but whatever fantasy you\u2019re having with your partner should be between just both of you; do not bring it to the general public, don\u2019t come and disturb us with it. When you bring it out there you would get different opinions, either good or bad.\n\n\u201cI would never have a sex tape, except it was done without my knowledge, but I am very smart to check around. I am not even in that situation because I date extremely responsible people. I don\u2019t do \u2018runs\u2019, I do relationships.

          "text": "Actress Sonia Ogiri is one female that has been very vocal about the sex tape of Tiwa Savage that went viral on social media platforms some weeks ago.\n\nHer frequent posts had also made some netizens opine that her opinions are borne out of \u201cjealousy or hatred\u201d for the award-winning singer.\n\nIn an interview with Saturday Beats, Ogiri, however, maintained her stand.\n\nShe said, \u201cYes, I have been vocal about Tiwa\u2019s sex tape, it\u2019s so unfortunate. For me, the news did not sit well, and that was why I spoke out. I must not have millions of followers, and must not be the most popular person in Nigeria for me to make my point. It is my point, my observation, and my opinion. I am part of the public; to begin with, forget about the whole social media presence or celebrity world. We\u2019re all part of the general public. She brought it out, it came to my hearing, and I contributed my quota. It\u2019s my right, and no one can take it from me. I don\u2019t care how other people see it, I don\u2019t care how people want to garnish it, I don\u2019t care about the people standing with or against her. I am not for once standing against her, I just aired my opinion about the sex tape, and it should not even have happened. She should be more aware of these things. People make mistakes and we learn from people\u2019s mistakes, she has seen other celebrities\u2019 sex tapes get leaked, so she should be smarter at this age. To me, age should come with some sense of belonging, responsibility, and wisdom. So, I expected her to be wiser than that sex tape.\n\n\u201cIt truly beats my imagination, and it\u2019s devastating, especially in Nigeria, to know that a mature celebrity would have a sex tape at this age, time, and era. It\u2019s a big error, and it\u2019s a no for me. Tiwa or any other celebrity should abstain, they should desist from this. If it is your fantasy, handle it differently. If it is your fantasy to have a sex tape, you can do that and delete immediately or save it to a hidden file where you know that the mistake of leaking the tape would never occur. Keep it off the general public, because it\u2019s really unfortunate. Tiwa should be held responsible but she hasn\u2019t apologised, she needs to apologise. She owes Nigerians a big apology. Yes, I hold her responsible, and everybody else should hold her responsible for that. And the reason I said that is because she is big enough.\u201d\n\nOgiri, who further said that she had analysed the short clip thoroughly, also noted that Savage, was having unprotected intercourse.\n\nShe continued \u201cLet\u2019s analyse this, you\u2019re having sex with someone and the person held his phone, that should tell you that something was going on, he should be holding onto something or holding onto you or touching something, but he held his phone and you were busy moaning and enjoying the moment. He was busy videoing you up to your face, showing everything that represents her as a woman. To even add salt to injury, she did what she did without a condom, what message is she passing to society? Apart from that, the sex tape of people that I have seen is always well organised, you see them in a proper arrangement on a well-made bed, lost in the mood with rose flowers or bottles of wine in the room. For a woman of that magnitude, status, level, age, and exposure, you can imagine how bitter this whole thing is; it\u2019s so disgusting and disrespectful to her.\u201d\n\nThe mother of one also noted that even though she is in love with someone, she dates responsibly and also controls her fantasy. Ogiri said, \u201cOf course I am in love with someone and I am in a relationship. If you\u2019re in love or in a relationship and both of you love each other, there is no limit to what you can do, but since there is no limit to what you can do, you have to do it wisely. I cannot control anybody\u2019s fantasy or teach them how to fantasise, but whatever fantasy you\u2019re having with your partner should be between just both of you; do not bring it to the general public, don\u2019t come and disturb us with it. When you bring it out there you would get different opinions, either good or bad.\n\n\u201cI would never have a sex tape, except it was done without my knowledge, but I am very smart to check around. I am not even in that situation because I date extremely responsible people. I don\u2019t do \u2018runs\u2019, I do relationships. My relationships are extremely responsible and my partners\u2019 social lives are paramount to them. They would never want to put such a thing out there, and I also would never want to put such things out there too; we respect each other\u2019s privacy and they\u2019re not social media intoxicated. They\u2019re not small boys that would be triggered to do such thing for whatever reason, because I am very careful, I find myself around very more careful people too.\u201d Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "The embattled National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Prince Uche Secondus, has headed for the Supreme Court to challenge the ruling of the Court of Appeal, Port Harcourt Division, which on Friday gave a nod for the party\u2019s National Convention to hold in Abuja on Saturday (today).\n\nHe said impunity, which he alleged had driven the party to the precipice and threatened its internal democracy and unity, must be resisted at all costs.\n\nIn an interview with one of our correspondents, Secondus said he had instructed his lawyers to appeal the ruling at the apex court in the interest of justice.\n\nHe said if those who orchestrated and foisted what he described as an avoidable crisis on the party had listened to \u201cwise counsel of party leaders and elders who advised the withdrawal of cases, this situation would have been avoidable. I wish the party well as always.\u201d\n\nThe Appeal Court sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State had on Friday dismissed the appeal filed by Secondus seeking an interim injunction to restrain the PDP from conducting its National Convention scheduled for October 30 and 31, 2021 in Abuja.\n\nThe three-man appeal panel ruled that Secondus lacked the power to stop the party\u2019s scheduled convention, pointing out that the national leadership of the party was not an exclusive preserve of the appellant (Secondus).\n\nThe court also said Secondus failed to challenge his suspension as a member of the party from his Ward 5 in Ikuru town, Andoni Local Government Area of Rivers State, a decision it said was affirmed by the State High Court in August 2021.\n\nThe court stated that he failed to join the party\u2019s acting National Chairman, Yemi Akinwonmi, in the suit challenging his (Akinwonmi) nomination by the party, insisting that the right which he claimed to be protecting had been withdrawn and given to Akinwonmi by the same party.\n\nJustice Gabriel Kolawale, who read the ruling of the three-man panel headed by Justice Haruna Tsammani, also noted that Secondus did not indicate interest in his application to continue as the national chairman of the PDP after being suspended nor indicated any interest to re-contest for the position upon the expiration of his tenure on December 9, 2021, hence the application was a distraction to the planned national convention of the PDP.\n\nJustice Kolawole refused to award costs against the appellant as sought by the respondents, adding that the application was not an abuse of court processes.\n\n\u201cThe appellant motion on notice filed on October 27, 2021, fails and is hereby dismissed. By the power of this decision, the 6th respondent is empowered on the authority of this court\u2019s decision to hold its national convention without any hindrance,\u201d Justice Kolawale declared.\n\nSpeaking to journalists outside the courtroom, counsel for Secondus, Mr Tayo Oyetibo (SAN), said the dismissal of his client\u2019s application was not the end of it as the instructions of the appeal were still alive.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe court has directed that the PDP can continue with the national convention. However, the instruction is that the appeal continues and depending on the outcome of the appeal, if it succeeds then it has an impact on whatever decision is taken on the national convention.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s still not over. We still have an appeal pending before this court (Court of Appeal) waiting to be taken. That is when the court said they would give us a date to come and argue. It is the outcome of that that would determine the validity or otherwise (of our case).\u201d\n\nOn his part, Henry Bello, counsel for the 1st to 5th respondents (Rivers local government council chair who took Secondus to the state High Court), who spoke on behalf of the respondents said the ruling was a ticket to a hitch-free national convention as scheduled.\n\nBello stated, \u201cThe Court of Appeal in Port Harcourt has delivered a considered ruling, where the court has dismissed the application of the appellant/applicant, Uche Secondus, to stop the national convention of the PDP.\n\n\u201cRather, the court has ordered the PDP to go ahead with its national convention unhindered.\u201d\n\nOn August 23, 2021, some PDP members instituted a suit at the Rivers State High Court with Secondus and the PDP as defendants.\n\nOn September 10, the court delivered its judgement and restrained Secondus from performing the duties of the party\u2019s national chairman.\n\nSecondus subsequently filed an appeal before the Court of Appeal on October 14, seeking an order of injunction restraining the PDP from holding or conducting the national convention, pending the hearing and final determination of the appeal.\n\nImpunity must be resisted, I\u2019ll go on appeal \u2013 Secondus\n\nReacting to the ruling, Secondus said he disagreed with it, but still respected it.\n\nSecondus in a statement released by his Media Adviser, Ike Abonyi, said the ongoing case was not about him but the need to protect the sanctity of the party\u2019s constitution.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cI have just been briefed on the ruling of the Court of Appeal, Port Harcourt dismissing my motion to halt the National Convention of the party. I respect the position of the court even though I disagree totally with it.\n\n\u201cEven as the substantive case is still pending at the Court of Appeal, I have instructed my lawyers to study the ruling with a view to appealing it immediately as no abuse of the constitution of our dear party should be allowed to stand.\n\n\u201cThe issue is not about Prince Uche Secondus but about the sanctity of our party constitution and core democratic principles of justice and rule of law not only in PDP but in our democracy. No impunity must be condoned.\n\n\u201cI will therefore wish to emphasise the fact that I did not take the party to court and would not have done that. As a foundation member of this party who has served at various levels as state chairman, chairman of state chairmen, National Organising Secretary, Deputy National Chairman, Acting National Chairman and now National Chairman, I am very much abreast with the workings of the party. I have been a witness to how much harm litigations have done to our party in the past and as a result, I have been a strong advocate against settling issues in courts.\u201d\n\nHe said he resisted pressures mounted on him to go to court to stop those planning against him because of his love for the party, adding that he did not want to be seen as someone who took the party to court.Punch\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "\u20263, 600 to decide aspirants, party\u2019s fates \u2026Consensus candidates were imposed on us\u2019 \u2026We\u2019re not forcing anybody to step down \u2013 Fintiri \u2026Aftermath always not palatable \u2013 Analyst \u2026We\u2019ll come out united \u2013 Tambuwal\n\nAs members and other critical stakeholders in the leading opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), converge on the Eagle Square Abuja to elect a new set of 18-member National Working Committee (NWC) into different positions, ABDULRAHMAN ZAKARIYAU writes on the tension and sharp divisions on who gets what and what may come after the \u2018consensus national convention.\u2019\n\nThe recall\n\nWhile the PDP held sway as the ruling party for 16 years, it produced the likes of Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo, the late Umaru Musa Yar\u2019\u00c1dua, and Goodluck Jonathan in straight feats.\n\nNot only that, in 1999, with the return to democratic rule, the party was controlling not less than 28 states with the majority members in both the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nSadly, events of the past few years have depicted the party as one without respect for its Constitution, while almost all of its NWC never served its four-year term, most of the party\u2019s national officers were disgraced out of office. The party is one that has seen all but one of its eight chairmen forced out of office in controversial circumstances.\n\nFrom its pioneer chairman, the late Chief Solomon Lar, to Barnabas Gemade, Audu Ogbeh, Ahmadu Ali, Vincent Ogubulafor, and Okwesilieze Nwodo to Bamanga Tukur, and then Prince Uche Secondus, only one, Amadu Ali, served out his tenure and bowed out without rancour.\n\nThe late Lar was booted out of office by former President Olusegun Obasanjo a few months after he assumed office as president in 1999. His successor, Barnabas Gemade who played an influential role during Obasanjo\u2019s administration, was later shown the door in 2001 after his relationship with Obasanjo got sour.\n\nThe exit of Gemade paved the way for the Audu Ogbeh-led NWC. Ogbeh\u2019s tenure is perhaps the most dramatic of all as he was forced to resign in December 2004, allegedly at gunpoint, after its much-talked about letter to the president advising Obasanjo to act on the anarchy that had taken over Anambra state, where the then godfather, Chris Uba, a known supporter of the president, had allegedly overrun the state and taken its governor, Chris Ngige, captive.\n\nLike Ogbeh, another Obasanjo\u2019s friend, Ahmadu Ali, was made the party\u2019s national chairman. Though he served his term, he left without a second term. Consequently, Vincent Ogbulafor was elected the new chairman at the party\u2019s national convention of 2008. However, as a result of a bitter feud with his state governor, Theodore Orji, over the party\u2019s structure in the South-east, Ogbulafor was charged with corruption and forced to resign in May 2010.\n\nOkwesilieze Nwodo who succeeded Ogbulafor also left sometime around 2012 under controversial circumstances after a dispute with his governor, Sullivan Chime. Similarly, Bamanga Tukur who took over ran into troubles also at home where his control of the party structure in Adamawa state was challenged by Governor Murtala Nyako. He was booted out in 2014.\n\nThe present\n\nLike many others, the Prince Uche Secondus-led NWC problems started when he failed to support Governor Nyesom Wike\u2019s plot to install the Sokoto state governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, as the party\u2019s presidential candidate in 2018. However, the fear of him hijacking the party\u2019s structure for the 2023 presidential aspirants, Wike and others succeeded in getting Secondus sacked by a competent court.\n\nCumulatively, the PDP governors have continued to install their choices of NWC and sacking them at will. This has led to mass defections of party members from state to national levels, and this has affected their performances in many elections. While this remains a great concern to the party\u2019s supporters, analysts believe that the act will continue to affect the party\u2019s internal democracy.\n\nThe convention\n\nOf all the positions, only those of the national auditor, national youth leader and deputy national chairman (South) would be contested out at the convention ground as the others have already been concluded on a consensus arrangement.\n\nMeanwhile, the chairman, conventional planning committee, the governor of Adamawa state, Ahmadu Fintiri, has disclosed that 3,600 delegates were expected to participate at this year\u2019s national elective convention of the party.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are expecting 3, 600 delegates tomorrow. This is the exact reason I told you that I\u2019ll be updating you because we\u2019re still packaging the list of delegates. You know PDP has produced a lot of officials for this country and our Constitution has also allowed for some former this and former that. We have people that have crossed over to the other side, so have to be careful so that we don\u2019t include them. But at the moment I think we\u2019re satisfied.\u201d\n\nConsensus convention, issues\n\nKeen followers of political events in the country are of the view that the main opposition party seems not to have learnt any lessons from the imposition of candidates and leaders which largely led to its downfall after reigning supreme as a ruling party for sixteen years.\n\nAs the party prepares to elect its national officials across the country today and tomorrow, tension is high as a result of what perhaps can be described as a \u201cfailed consensus.\u201d\n\nThough zoning, micro-zoning and consensus remain alien to the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria and that of the PDP, they have now become a norm. Like in the past, the party zoned and micro-zoned the positions available in the NWC; this development has increased tension among party members. Consequently, many aspirants are not comfortable going for the election; one of such aspirants is Okey Muo-Aroh, who wanted to run for national secretary before he was disqualified for allegedly taking the party to court.\n\nHe said, \u201cSome people are bragging that there was a consensus candidate; this is the bane of the party in the South-east. We have a situation where the party in its wisdom zones offices to the South-east, and nobody was privy to any arrangement. We only heard that the office of the national secretary has been zoned to Anambra auditor to Imo state.\n\n\u201cThat was why Hon. CID Maduabum, Osita Chidoka and I started having consultations and moving around, only for us to come to Enugu on Thursday and the zonal chairman said the governors would brief us. The Enugu state governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, introduced the Abia state governor, Okezie Victor Ikpeazu. And Governor Okezie Victor Ikpeazu read from a script and said they had changed their mind, and that they have put the secretary to Imo state and their candidate is Senator Sam Daddy Anyanwu. And they pronounced somebody from Anambra as the auditor. So, on that basis, the people of Anambra rejected that so-called arrangement.\u201d\n\nAlso, in the same South-east, a former national publicity secretary of the party, Chief Olisa Metuh, had a misunderstanding with the former Anambra state governor, Peter Obi, on the choice of candidate for the national auditor.\n\nMetuh, in a statement signed by his special assistant, Ebiloma Abdullahi, recently said, \u201cWhile we concede to the former governor and acknowledge his stories on moral values to the general public, we are totally against his lack of consultation, dialogue and inclusion on matters affecting party administration; an area where he knows little or nothing about.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that in the South-east caucus meeting of the PDP, Peter Obi himself led the rejection of a name put forward by Senator Ekwunife as a candidate for the position of the national auditor, wherein he openly stated that the person is not known to him and the PDP.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to state that this position was re-echoed by the entire Anambra stakeholders present at the meeting except for Senator Ekwunife. However, 24 hours later, the same Peter Obi, a man said to be of very high moral standard, somersaulted to claim the adoption of the same name without any form of dialogue or consultation.\u201d\n\nGrudges\n\nIn the South-west too, many are aggrieved over the zoning and micro-zoning arrangement. A former secretary of the party, Professor Wale Ladipo, and former national vice-chairman (South), Dr. Eddy Olafeso, both alluded to the fact that they were disqualified to force a consensus candidate on the zone and the party at large.\n\nReacting to his disqualification, Prof. Ladipo said, \u201cYes, I saw it coming. I have been joking with some members of our party in Osun state over the last one week that it has been in the public domain that certain people were not comfortable with my candidature. They said clearly that I would be screened out. I thought it was impossible, but then it became a reality. I spoke to people who are close to me and I said I was not going to the screening because I hate \u2018arrangee things.\u2019 I like people to be straightforward. We spoke to senior members of the party and they said I should go for the screening and see how it goes. And lo and behold, about 10 minutes before my appearance before the screening committee, somebody brought a petition and hurriedly gave it to them. Up till now, I have not been privileged to read the petition.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Dr. Olafeso said: \u201cThis is pure politics to scheme me and others out of the race.\u201d\n\nPolitical pundits believe that this type of consensus has increased the level of tension in the party, which if not properly managed may make some people leave the party.\n\nAn aspirant who does not want his name mentioned in print told Blueprint Weekend that many people never consented to the consensus arrangement, adding that \u201cconsensus candidates were forced on us.\u201d\n\nHe told this reporter that, \u201cI was told to step down; in fact they stopped me from purchasing forms. Some of us felt that the issue of consensus should be discussed, but in this case, we were more or less forced.\n\n\u201cThey invited me and others for a series of meetings, and said you step down, this is the person that we want, I felt so bad. To me, all positions should be open for all and the delegates should decide the fate of every aspirant. Unfortunately, this is not the case, as consensus candidates were forced on us.\u201d\n\nGov. Fintiri\u2019s reaction\n\nReacting to allegations that some aspirants were forced to step down, the chairman of the convention planning committee, Governor Fintiri said aspirants were not forced to step down.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re making efforts to reconcile most of our contestants so that we can streamline them to have a better Convention which will be hitch-free and will deepen our chances for 2021. Most of the positions as of today, except for three, will not be contested for.\n\n\u201cThe problems have reduced significantly and we will keep posting as the events unfold. At the moment we are talking to those that are contesting for the office of the deputy national chairman (South) and those that are contesting for the office of the auditor, and those that are now contested for the office of youth leader. I think at the moment it is just the offices that still have many people contesting for. The rest have been streamlined and the consensus looks okay.\n\n\u201cLike I told you, there are positions and there are people that we\u2019re still talking to. We\u2019re not forcing anybody to step down and the candidates are talking amongst themselves.\u201d\n\nAn analyst\u2019s take\n\nA political analyst, Jide Ojo, said the aftermath of an improper consensus arrangement is not always palatable. Ojo, in a telephone chat with this reporter, said: \u201cI am not a fan of consensus arrangements, but the political leaders who initiated that did it because they thought it is a better arrangement to how people negotiate for political offices than to fight for the political offices at a ballot.\n\n\u201cBut we know that it has also backfired to an extent. The way it has been playing out in Nigeria is synonymous with imposition. And when you impose candidates, the aftermath of that is always not palatable. This is because what then happens is that people who felt bad may end up defecting from the party to another. But if they have agreed through horse-trading and it works out well, then it may go well. For those who are opposed to a consensus I think it is always good to allow people to vote for the candidate of their choice.\n\n\u201cThe way the consensus arrangements have been done is another way for imposition of candidates.\u201d\n\nTambuwal\u2019s hope\n\nIn his reaction, the chairman of the PDP Governors Forum, the Sokoto state governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, said the party \u201cwill come out of the national convention united.\u201d\n\nTambuwal, who stated this recently, said: \u201cWe have just finished our meeting where we received briefings from the chairman of the convention planning/organising committee, the governor of Adamawa state, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, that we are on course and by the grace of God, they have almost concluded every arrangement and plan for a very successful, free and fair convention.\n\n\u201cWe are very grateful to the convention planning committee and other sub-committees for the work they are doing. We are optimistic that PDP is going to come out more united from this convention and much more ready to provide the desired platform upon which many Nigerians can realise their aspirations. And we shall continue to deepen our democracy and work together as democrats for a greater Nigeria.\u201d",
          "summary": "Like Ogbeh, another Obasanjo\u2019s friend, Ahmadu Ali, was made the party\u2019s national chairman.\nConsequently, Vincent Ogbulafor was elected the new chairman at the party\u2019s national convention of 2008.\nThis has led to mass defections of party members from state to national levels, and this has affected their performances in many elections.\nThe conventionOf all the positions, only those of the national auditor, national youth leader and deputy national chairman (South) would be contested out at the convention ground as the others have already been concluded on a consensus arrangement.\nThe Enugu state governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, introduced the Abia state governor, Okezie Victor Ikpeazu.",

          "title": "Abe, Golden Chioma not APC members, until registration, revalidate on \u2013 \u2013 Rivers APC -NigPilot",
          "text": "The personality, Sokonte H. Davied is a foundation member of the All Progressives Congress APC, an avowed loyalist of the Transportation Minister, Rt Hon Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi. A member Federal House of Representatives FHR, 2007-2015, he represented Degema/Bonny.\n\nHe stated in the strongest terms, that Senator Magnus Abe, the State chairmanship aspirant, Golden Chioma and their group, do not belong to the. APC, until their registration and revalidation. Hon Davis without mincing words barred his mind on the just concluded Rivers state APC Congress, and it\u2019s outcome\n\nMay I meet you?\n\nMy name is Sokonte Davis. I represented Degeme/BonyFederal Constituency in the Federal House of Assembly, FHR., from 2007\u20132015. At the end of my service in the Federal House, I served in the All Progressives Congress APC Presidential Council, as the Director, Finance and Administration, and of course, we won the presidential election.\n\nThereafter, I served as the Executive Director, Marine and Operations in the Nigerian Ports Authority NPA, from 2016 \u2013 2020.\n\nWhat do you have to say, regarding the just concluded Rivers APC state congress and the emergence of Hon Emeka Bekee, as the state Chairman of your party?\n\nAs far as I am concerned, and if you would ask any loyal member of the APC in the State, the congress went very well and smoothly. We also had candidates who contested various positions. Initially there were four aspirants for the post of party Chairman, and for of two other positions, there were two candidates each, but for the position of Women leader, initially, they were three contenders, but in the process of screening, by the committee, two only happened to turn out. For the rest of the offices, only a candidate turned out for screening.\n\nAparently, there were contestations only for the posts of the state party Chairman and state Women leader, while for all other pisitions, the candidates were returned unopposed.\n\nIn accordance with our party rules and constitutional provisions, even if a candidate is unopposed, he will still be subjected to the party delegates, and so everybody was voted for. For the position of the state party chairmanship, Chief Emeka Bekee won it with about 1570 votes, to beat his opponent who won no vote.\n\nFor the position of the Women Leader, the winner had 1600 votes to beat the other contender, who scored 8 votes. In all there were about 1600 delegates. One obvious feature about delegate election is that, nobody can manufacture figures therein, as the number cannot be higher than a particular figure already known, but can be less, because of absenteeism. All in all, there was a peaceful environment, there was conviviality comradrie, etc. It was really enjoyable, for even the rain that fell earlier could not in anyway dampen the enthusiasm of party delegates to exercise their franchise.\n\nWe are aware that the Rivers APC is yet to have a full house, being that a certain group led by Senator Magnus Abe, is not working together with you. What are the efforts of your party, with a view to reconciling with the aggrieved members, to make you have a great, full and united house, before the 2023 general elections.?\n\nA political party is an association of people, who agreed to subject themselves to the rules and regulations that govern the party, usually prescribed under the constitution, and the same constitution of the party sets out organs of the party, processes to resolve and handle issues.\n\nIndeed, we had issues in 2017, 2018 leading to 2019 general elections, which we were unable to resolve appropriately, before the 2019 general elections, leading to APC not being able to field in candidates for offices that affected our state. We did not have candidates for Governorship, Senate, Federal House of Representatives and House of Assembly, because we could not resolve the issues properly.\n\nHence the aggrieved ones took the party and its state leadership to court, and those issues have been resolved by the court, up to the Supreme Court level. The Supreme Court has given its own verdict that is binding on all, and to the extent that some challenged the setting up of A-Caretaker-Committee in the State and that also has been thrashed out.\n\nThe party at the National level decided to dissolve the National Working Committee and set up a Caretaker Committee to plan for the party\u2019s convention, which would elect new officers at the National level. The National Caretaker Committee and the Convention Planning Committee was set up, led by the governor of Yobe state Mai Mallam Buni, who incidentally used to be the National Secretay of the party. The National Executive Committee of the party in its wisdom also decided that other members of the National Executive Committee of the party, who were the non-working Committee members, should continue to work with that committee, headed by His Ececellency Mai Mallam Buni. In the process of time, they resolved a few things, as settled by the National Executive Committee of the party, because in the party structure, the highest organ is the National Convention. The next organ to it is the National Executive Committee of the party. There is the National Caucus and Board of Trustees B o T and everything. The constitution on its own has empowered the National Executive Committee to take necessary actions, the National Convention statutorily holds once in four years. Hence it cannot wait for a whole four years to take final decisions, they therefore empower the National Executive Committee, to take decisions on behalf of the party, which are usually ratified during national conventions, whenever it c omes up.\n\nThe National Executive Committee decided that all state, Local Governmentnt Area LGA, Ward Committees, organs of the party be dissolved, because there were issues here and there and disagreements left, right and centre.\n\nOf course as a party, some states had there conventions at different times, because of issues and all that stuff. At the time such a decision was taken, there were no legal encumbrances, the party agreed to dissolve state \u2018excos\u2019, wards excos and set up Caretaker Committees, at such levels, in all the states of the federation, including the Federal Capital Territory FCT, Abuja.\n\nThe second major decision of the party was the need to revalidate party membership, aware that over the time, people had left and others had also entered the party, and then registered new members, that all might be at the level. Usually the APC praises itself, it does so and everybody is an equal member of the party, irrespective of when he/she joined the party.\n\nIn that process, some members of the APC vowed not to accept the revalidation. So it\u2019s important for people to understand these issues. \u201cWhen you have not revalidated your membership, when you are not registered as a member, even when done by everybody, from the President to the least member in the APC.\n\nEvery member of the party is expected to subscribe to the rules, regulations, norms and tenets. Those who came to join us did register. Some people in Rivers State chose not to do so, claiming that their membership had not yet expired. It means that every other person who did the validation, his membership had expired, exvepect for those people in the State, who felt their membership had not elapsed.\n\nWe went on with revalidation and finished with it. Even thereafter, efforts were made to reach out to them, as individuals and as some recognized groups, to come and register, but they refused. Instead at the expiration of registration, they wrote a petition to the National Caretaker Committee, claiming to have been denied registration. The National Caretaker Committee set up another committee with Chief Victor Giadon as the Secretay, to go round the nation to view the response to the revalidation directive.\n\nWhen they came to our state, for the sake of fairness, the Secretary being a Rivers man did not put up appearances at the various meetings held in Port Harcourt. The other group did not participate in the meetings with the State APC, hence the committee gave separate hearings to those, who revalidate and registered, from those who refused registration and revalidation and instead wrote the petition.\n\nAt the meeting the committee gave them a time frame within which to get registered, but they claimed that the National Committee would come back to register them. They refused to get registered. It is not surprising for some of us, that when people from that side, (those who have not revalidate their membership took forms to contest, though they did not contest at the LGA level, they), said they were to vie with forms they bought in 2018, were unable to avail party original copies of the forms, on demand.\n\nThey did not participate in the ward and LGA congress elections They bought forms for state congress, but they knew themselves that they were not qualified, because, when they saw as part of the requirements, availability of original slip of current party registration or revalidation, they saw their handikap/limitstion, because they did not have it. Their not coming for screening was not a surprise.\n\nFor anybody to go the radio station like I heard of one chairmanship aspirant Golden Chioma criticize the congress, saying he did not believe in the process, such was why he backed out. Actually, he could not have been qualified, that was why he declined the contest. If however the screening committee had qualified him, it would have determined the premise on which it did so, for the record of the party revealed he had not yet been revalidated. Of course he might have been, but there is no evidence to prove it.\n\nIt was a delegate election, and who were the delegates he would lobby to vote for him? The delegates were elected at the ward congress., which he did not participate in. Funny enough, I heared that, as we finished on Saturday 23rd October, 2021, on Monday or so, they gathered somewhere and said, they had also held their own congress. Its laughable when intelligent people begin to behave unintelligently, it\u2019s a serous matter.\n\nSomebody said that delinquency at old age is a disease. \u201cBut we can understand that juvenile delinquency is juvenile\u201d. Truely delinquency at old age is a disease, and people who are seemingly intelligent and learned behaving as if, they are not, rather makes one to wonder. That\u2019s my concern. So far as we are concerned, in Rivers APC, as much as I talk with you now and here, there is no crisis. We are aware that some people, who not members of the party are parading themselves as members of the party, and try to create semblance of crisis.\n\nHow do you view the possibility of reconciliation?\n\nReconciliation is always open. There is a particular Chieftain of those who support Magnus Abe, fron our LGA. There is nothing we do, I don\u2019t bring to his knowledge. Even during the congresses, I reached out to him, that if there be any of their members registered with the party, that had interest in any position, he should let me know,, we saw how we could help him. I believe strongly that, what I \u2018m doing in my LGA, other leaders are so doing, or doing better, in their various wards and LGAs. Party reconciliation is not the exclusive responsibility of the Executive Committee. We are friends, ordinarily doing things together, attend weddings, and when there be deaths, calamities, we sympathize with one another.\n\nWe know ourselves and have been like that, so there is no reason we cannot relate with one another. There are leaders, but it\u2019s not their sole responsibiliy, it\u2019s our individual and collective responsibility.\n\nWith such wonderful approach to reconciliation, why was there a mass exodus of members from your party, shortly before the State congress, for example, your former spokes person Chief Ogbonna Nwuke?\n\nI can tell of the exit of Chief Ogbonna Nwuke, Rt Hon Chibudom Nwuche, his brother Ibiso and a few others. That was rather a ceremony of leaving for they had left the party long before then. In the case of Chief Nwuke, I can vouch that, he is a man of substance. He is a friend of mine, but I do not know why he chose to leave.\n\nThere was no mass exodus of our members. Those who appeared at the reception ceremony had already left before their official reception. I like the confession of one of the decampees, Hon Barry Badonn. He said, he left the APC, because of hunger, and people attacked him, but I insist that, he is the only one who said the truth, as is. It\u2019s all about stomach infrastructure.\n\nMembership of a party is not to satisfy oneself, but to see to that the party comes into governance, to give development to the people, and of course, as a member of the party, in so doing, one might benefit in one way or the other.\n\nWe are not members of the APC. because of stomach infrastructure. Of those who decamped, he is a vilain to many, but he remains my \u2018hero\u2019 , for he had the capacity to face the world and said the truth as it was.\n\nWhen people do not have a second address, so it happens in politics. If you counted, they were about 14 in number. We knew ourselves. However, before they left, we had received people like, Michael West, Salvation, Reason Onyia, Chinwe Obinna, former Commissioner Nwoke, etc. We do not use money to woo people in. We don\u2019t do it, nor do we even have the money.?\n\nThe People\u2019s Democratic Party PDP cannot say, the money they gave to the decampees are the party\u2019s money, but River\u2019s. I\u2019m not perturbed, because they are our Rivers people. If its the way Rivers Governor Chief Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, deems proper to spend Rivers common wealth, it becomes his own perception, and I cannot hold him to it, I do know, I cannot do it. Those who defected before them, who hears about them anymore? I\u2019m sad to allude that my friend and brother Chief Ogbonna Nwuke left, because of the \u2018stomach infrastructure.\u2019\n\nIn the light of the large number of defectors you keep receiving, how do you see the chances of APC winning 2023 governorship election, and take over from the PDP government?\n\nThere is serious frustration, disappointment and dissatisfaction in the minds of Rivers indegens and residents, who pray and hope daily, the APC could organize itself properly, unite and come and take over from the PDP government, because they are fed up with this present crop of PDP government in Rivers State.\n\nThe governor knows some of his Commissioners want to go, he does not mince words about it when addressing them. At the Executive arm of the government, after the governor come the Commissioners. If then he knows that some of the commissioners, working, sitting, holding and administering the State with him, their minds are not with him, it\u2019amounts to \u2018personal vote of no confidence\u2019 in his own government.\n\nThe issue is that, and I appeal especially to those we believe are our party members, but have not formalized their membership, to try to formalize their membership. When we work together the better, not that we cannot do without them. We can, but we believe in the principle of \u201cthe more, the merrier\u201d. We also believe that, a lot of them have useful contributions to make to the party, when we join together. There is no alternative, We are willing at all times, to bring everybody. together. Rivers people are looking forward to us.\n\nAgain what goes for us is the discontentment in the PDP, not only at the national, but the State level. The only advantage they have is that, since many of them are there because stomach infrastructure, and there is one person dispensing it in the State, his followers would not want to topple the apple cat. They merely keep quiet, bidding their time.\n\nThe clamour now is that Rivers State has many ethnic groups, and nationalities. Apart from Ikwerre ethnic nationality., the next largest group are the Ijaws and especially the Kalabari people, they are the Ijaws. In a state that is as diverse as ours, with more 30 ethnic groups and nationalities, and languages, it will not be proper for only one ethnic group, to be at the helm of affairs in the State always. They may have the majority of the voting populace, because they are larger, but the clsmour is \u2018let power shift to the other groups\u2019. The body language of PDP, does not lend credence to such political morality/expectation of the generality Rivers people.\n\nThe largest ethnic group in Rivers State does not form an overwhelming majority. Only itself cannot win the votes, but just the largest. It canmot outpower, outmanouvre and outvote every other ethnic group in the state, if they are united. In APC its leadership has looked at it, and decided, the next governor should come from the riverine. The Transportation Minister Rt Hon Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, as the leader in the State and foremost in the S/South region eminently qualifirf to say it, either as a policy statement or personal opinion on a sensitive matter as that.\n\nDo you mean he said so as the State party leader?\n\nOf course, such a policy directive should come from the leader. At all levels, he qualified and remains so, to make his choice.\n\nWith your cesion of the next governor to the riverine, have considered a credible candidate with record of necessary leadership exposure, candor, humility, conduct, transparency, charisma, experience, tested and trusted, and performance?\n\nYou asked as if, you were privy to the last leadership meeting, we held, just after the State congress, in consultation with other leaders. The same criteria you enumerated were the requirements we put down. We intend to choose somebody that is stable in character, conduct and attitude and sufficiently fears God, not because he says so, but because, he is seen to do so, one who can carry all along, as well as one withe prerequisite charisma to do so.\n\nWe need someone who is easily acceptable by the majority of the people. We need he that can attract membership from other parties to ours, just because of hls person. These are the qualities of the person that will fly our flag , and by the grace of God, there are people like that in our great party.\n\nGod will grant us the grace to present the State a material like that, who Rivers people will see and accept. If we present the wrong candidate, we would have created room for fear, anxiety and worry. By the time we unviel our candidate, even the PDP will know, we mean business. We are not looking for one with much money, who might see the whole thing as an investment, and must recoup his money.\n\nPeople accuse your leader of high handedness and dictatorship, how true is it. Do you also think, he will allow you to produce such a candidate?\n\nOur leader is not high handed nor dictatorial. Those who accuse him are benefactors of his insight of knowing what to do. Their resentment and protest is that, they are not the only ones chosen at all times. When others are chosen, they brand him as being high handed and dictatorial. When he chose them, were they the only ones qualified, nor were they not qualified, if so why they not query their choices?\n\nThey had the opportunity to reject their offers, but did not. Their allegation is unfounded and lacks merit. Our leader before he takes a decision, puts much time, thought and makes a lot of consultations. The only thing is that most people, when nominated or appointed, do not even know, that they were being that considered. They may not be the best, but when a lot of factors are considered, they were zeroed into, and they emerge, and, are told they were going to be this or that, and they are happy. \u201cNow that they are no longer there, they are angry.\u201d In this regard, he has promised wider consultations than he used to do, including online voting. The accusation of high handedness and dictatorial is uncharitable of those accusers.\n\nWhat are your observation on the Governor Wike\u2019s performance?\n\nMost times, I refraim from talking about Governor Wike\u2019s administration. One of the reasons is that, I will be accused of partisanship which, I am. Yet it is my right to comment on his performance. Wike has not yet graduated from the mentality of a nonperforming Local Government Area LGA, Chairman. It is, \u201d lets\u2019 do something people will see and it whelms them\u201d, without considering the economic importance, the uses of those things.\n\nHe does not think of human capital development, creation and distribution of wealth. Governor has not created wealth, and so there is no wealth to distribute. What he is sharing is the State allocation., which could have been used to create and distribute same. He has made sure that criminality pays.\n\nRivers State, for example, is not worse in crimes than Lagos, yet investors flock to Lagos to invest because, people believe Lagos state government does not enjoy, nor participate in criminal economy. The investors do not come here, because of their belief that, Rivers state government enjoys criminal economy. They produce criminals, and the criminals are running the economy.\n\nThey do not want to look that way. The moment they look that way, they go after them. They used some of them to get to power, and have not been able to create wealth, from where those people can make legitimate money. Anytime Rivers people pursue the criminals, they run to the government House, Rivers people know about it.\n\nSometimes the State government goes to free criminals held by the Department of State Srcurity Services DSSS. They use their imuniity to cover criminal elements, cover suspects being looked for by security agents.\n\nThe governor cannot boast of having attracted any direct foreign investment. As at 2016 \u2013 27, Rivers State Government RSG attracted $200, 000.00. (two hundred thousand dollars ), from foreign investors. There has not been any direct investment, ever since Governor Wike\u2019s era. There has never been any foreign activity taking place, no international organizations coming here, to do things, not one.\n\nBefore Governor Wike\u2019s regime, the difference between the Lagos state Internally Generated Revenue IGR, and ours, was about N4bn. Rivers stste currently depends on federal government allocation and statutory IGR, from companies\u2019, and he harrasses them over that.\n\nHe is not creating wealth, hence none to distribute, consequently poverty creeps into the state. Poverty, you know is a breeding ground for crimes and criminal activities and criminals.\n\nOn the issue of job opportunities?\n\nWhere are the jobs? He promised to employ 5000 teachers, up till now, he has not started the process. He tried to start the process, but the whole exercise got mixed up, because it was not well thought out. He merely announced it at a political rally ground. The conceptionalization was poor, so implimentation became chaotic. That was why he could not do anything about it.\n\nTo what extent do you educate the State masses and electorate , with a view to creating enabling ground, for emergence of your party come 2023?\n\nWe are doing that, a few of us are, at different times. At this moment , we do not need cacophony of voices, but a coordination of voices. Coordinaction gives direction, that people will be able to follow, but if there be cacophony of voices, there could be confusion and all that. We want to work as a party on the same platform, a powerful instrument.\n\nFinally, what piece of advice, do you have for Rivers people?\n\nFirstly they should trust in God. \u201cThere is always a season. The Holy Bible said,\u201d there is a season to slap, and a season to clap, a season to dance and a season to sit down. There is time and season, for everything and there is time for darkness.\n\nRivers people should know, there is a new dawn, the day is fast breaking, hence their hopes and aspirations will not be disappointed. They are not misplaced, the APC has positioned itself, its gathering itself and its positioning itself, to make sure it gives to Rivers people the quality of persons that will move us forward.\n\nHaving been in this wilderness for nearly eight years, I assure them, we will not be in the wilderness again. We are going to bring people they will accept, who will work for the benefit of Rivers State. They will bring peace, security and reconciliation, for wealth creation, distribution and creation of opportunities people will drive and do well",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nMembers and delegates of the leading opposition party Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have converged at Eagles Square, Abuja to hold their national convention and elect new officials.\n\nThe convention which is scheduled for today and tomorrow is a crucial part of the party\u2019s preparation for the 2023 elections in the country.\n\nNational party officials, governors, ex-governors, and other bigwigs of the party are currently at Eagle\u2019s Square in preparation.\n\nAccording to our political correspondent, Seun Okinbaloye, who is at the venue of the convention most of the positions up for grabs will be filled via consensus.\n\nHowever, some three positions are still under contestation.\n\nChairman of the organising committee of the convention, Governor Ahmadu Fintiri had earlier on Friday said efforts are on to reconcile most of the contestants.\n\n\u201cAt the moment we are making efforts to reconcile most of our contestants so that we can scrutinise them and have a better convention\n\n\u201cWe are expecting 3600 delegates tomorrow.

We are still talking with those contesting,\u201d Fintiri said on Friday.\n\nDisagreements, Legal Tussles\n\nBefore this convention, the main opposition party have been faced with disagreements and legal tussles.\n\nFormer chairman Uche Secondus had sought to halt the convention over his suspension from the party.\n\nBut on Friday, the Appeal Court in Port Harcourt, Rivers State granted the party the right to hold the convention in a suit brought by Secondus.\n\nAlthough Mr Secondus has vowed to appeal the ruling, the convention is poised to proceed.\n\nRivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, backed the ruling of the Court of Appeal, describing it as a victory for the party.\n\n\u201cIt is a victory for every member of PDP,\u201d Wike told reporters. \u201cIt is a sign that PDP is prepared for 2023.\u201d\n\nThe Governor said Mr Secondus had already handed over his chairmanship to PDP National Deputy Chairman (South), Yemi Akinwonmi, and had no right to seek the postponement of the convention.\n\n\u201cWe will not allow any individual or groups to derail the rescue mission of the PDP,\u201d he said. \u201cThe title of our convention is \u2018Join us to rescue Nigeria\u2019.\n\n\u201cNigeria is in problem and we cannot do it alone. We require everybody to work with us for collectively and see how this country can be rescued.\n\n\u201cSo, if there is anybody or group who are being used to derail us, PDP will not take it lightly. We are serious about it and nothing will stop us from rescuing this country.\n\n\u201cPDP should be thanking God Almighty. We should be jubilating and praising God for bringing unity to this country.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that the Court of Appeal judgement granted PDP an \u201cunrestrained\u201d right to hold the convention, making any other court judgement obtained to halt the process irrelevant.",

          "text": "The Zamfara State Police Command on Saturday denied that about 20 security operatives had been killed by bandits along Shinkafi road.\n\nEarlier reports had it that the security operatives, mostly personnel of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and local vigilantes, had been ambushed by a group led by notorious bandit leader, Turji.\n\nIn a statement signed by spokesperson, Mohammed Shehu, the Command confirmed the attack but said only one police and two civil defense personnel had been killed in the ambush.\n\nREAD ALSO: Troops Kill Several Bandits In Kaduna\n\n\u201cWhat happened was that, on 28th October 2021, Joint Police/Civil Defence Operatives deployed along K/Namoda \u2013 Shinkafi Road to stem the tide of banditry, kidnapping and other heinous crimes were ambushed by suspected armed bandits who came in large number,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThe operatives who were always at red alert engaged the hoodlums to an extensive gun duel that lasted for hours. Some of the assailants were neutralised while others escaped with possible gun shot wounds. Unfortunately, a Police Operative and two (2) Civil Defence Personnel paid the supreme price and their corpses were evacuated and buried accordingly.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police while deploying reinforcement of Police Tactical operatives to the area, reiterates the continuous commitment and resilience of the Police to rid the State of all activities of criminal elements.\u201d\n\nThe Command urged the public to \u201cignore the outrageous number\u201d of the earlier reports and \u201ccontinue to be security conscious while going about their legitimate business.\u201d\n\nBandits as terrorists\n\nThe attack is one of the latest by bandits in the North-West who have gained national notoriety for their numerous violent acts, including the mass kidnapping of school children.\n\nSeveral individuals, including Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, have urged the Federal Government to designate the bandits as terrorists. The National Assembly has also passed resolutions to the same effect.\n\nOn Friday, the Minister of Defense, Bashir Magashi, said the Federal Government was in the process of reviewing and following the required procedures to designate the criminal gangs as terrorists.\n\nIt is believed that designating the bandits as terrorists will allow the military unleash its full force on the North-West criminals without triggering international human rights rebukes.",

          "text": "Security operatives on Friday laid siege for more than four hours to the Maitama, Abuja, residence of a Judge of the Supreme Court, Justice Mary Odili.\n\nThe operatives had conducted a search allegedly in connection with unspecified illegal activities at Odili\u2019s 9 Imo Street, Maitama residence.\n\nGovernor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State visited the Odilis after the security agents left the residence late Friday night after the search episode.\n\nThe Supreme Court justice is the wife of Dr. Peter Odili, former governor of Rivers, who is presently on the watch list of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nEFCC, had, Friday night, denied conducting any operation in the home of Justice Odili following reports that raid was an EFCC operation.\n\nA statement issued by the Spokesman of EFCC, Wilson Uwujaren, denied the involvement of the commission in the execution any search warrant at the residence of Justice Odili.\n\n\u201cThe attention of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has been drawn to claims in a section of the media that operatives of the Commission today, October 29, 2021 stormed the Maitama, Abuja home of a Judge of the Supreme Court, Justice Mary Odili, purportedly to execute a search.\n\n\u201cThe commission by this statement wishes to inform the public that the report is false as it did not carry out any operation at the home of Justice Odili. If there was any such operation as claimed by the media, it was not carried out by the EFCC.\n\n\u201cThe commission enjoins the public to discountenance the report\u201d, Uwujaren said.\n\nThe Chairman of EFCC, Abdulrasheed Bawa was also on Arise News Friday night to deny insinuations that his men carried out the raid.\n\nBawa said: None of our operatives was there. We did not carry out any raid anywhere in Abuja. It is difficult for anybody to do that without us knowing before, during or after.\n\n\u201cIt is not from EFCC. I think it\u2019s just mischief makers trying to link these things to us against the good working relationship we have with the judiciary. We have a very good working relationship with the judiciary\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cIn fact, I am happy to let Nigerians know that between January and May, we have recorded 1,343 convictions which is a record. They are our biggest partners\u201d, he said.\n\nHe said Justice Odili was expected to make a formal complaint to clear the air on the matter.\n\n\u201cI believe that Hon Justice Mary Odili will make a formal complaint to the appropriate authorities, who will look at it and find out what actually happened at her residence\u201d, he said.\n\nTHISDAY, however, gathered that the raid was part of the investigation of Odili by the Joint Panel on Recovery in the Federal Ministry of Justice headed by the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami.\n\nThe panel comprises representatives of the EFCC, the Nigeria Police Force, and the Ministry of Justice.\n\nIt was further gathered that the probe was targeted at her Justice Odili\u2019s husband, who was Governor of oil-rich Rivers State from 1999 to 2007.\n\nThe security operatives, who came with a search warrant, said they received information on \u201cillegal activities\u201d going on in the house.\n\nA witness, Aliyu Umar, said in an affidavit dated October 13, 2021, that he had given the information to the EFCC.\n\n\u201cI have observed some illegal activities going on in those houses within Abuja are illegal and hereby report the said matter to the law enforcement agency.\n\n\u201cI hereby state that all information provided by me to the EFCC is true and correct to the best of my knowledge,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a second affidavit deposed to by a senior police officer, CSP Lawrence Ajodo, the panel applied to a chief magistrate in Abuja seeking a search warrant for the house.\n\nThe Chief Magistrate, Emmanuel Iyanna, subsequently approved the search warrant on October 29, 2021.\n\nWike had arrived the residence with Abiye Sekibo, former minister of transportation; Raymond Dokpesi, founder of DAAR Communications; Austin Okpara, former deputy speaker of the House of Representatives; Okon Aniete and Lee Maeba, a former senator, among others.\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",

We paid 100 per cent and, of course, all for what we did in Kano, in terms of projects, programmes and so forth, especially in the educational sector.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe in borrowing anything from anybody.

          "title": "Nigeria: Game on as Appeal Court Clears PDP for National Convention",
          "text": "An Appeal Court sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State on Friday dismissed the appeal of the suspended National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Uche Secondus seeking to restrain the party from conducting its National Convention, thus paving the way for the congress to commence today in Abuja.\n\nThe three-man panel dismissed the appeal which was filed on October 14, 2021, \u201cfor lacking in merit.\u201d\n\nWith the scare that the convention might be stopped by a court over, 3,600 delegates from all over the country will today converge on the Eagles Square, Abuja, to elect a new National Working Committee for the party.\n\nSecondus had approached the court of appeal to challenge his removal as chairman. He also sought an order of injunction restraining the PDP from holding its National Convention.\n\nThe judgement read by Justice Gabriel Kolawale, was unanimously endorsed by the other two members of the panel, who said the suit by Secondus was an afterthought and an abuse of court process.\n\nKolawole held that the attempt by the applicant to suspend the planned convention \u201cis an act of self-induced urgency to disrupt an ongoing lawful process of the party.\u201d\n\nHe wondered why the applicant waited for too long to seek the stoppage of the process which had been communicated to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nThe judge noted that Secondus did not oppose the notice of the convention written by the acting chairman of the party to INEC, \u201cneither did he oppose INEC\u2019s response to the party.\u201d\n\nThe court thus granted the PDP the right to hold its National Convention as scheduled.\n\nThe counsel to Secondus, Tayo Oyetibo said the outcome of the main appeal, which is challenging the removal of his client as chairman of the PDP, would determine whether or not they will appeal.\n\nMultiple court orders were issued against Secondus resulting in his removal from office, and the Deputy National Chairman (South), Yemi Akinwonmi, appointed in his stead.\n\nPDP Holds National Convention at Eagle Square\n\nMeanwhile, 3600 delegates will converge on the Eagles Square, Abuja, to elect a new National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nThe PDP flag has been hoisted at the Eagle Square, while banners and decorations adorned the area. A podium had also been assembled at the centre of the square.\n\nThe party said there would be affirmative vote cast for 21 of the 24 offices of the NWC today.\n\nThe party also said the new NWC to be elected would assume office on December 9, 2021.\n\nAddressing a press conference ahead of the convention, the Chairman of the National Convention Committee, Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State said 21 of the 24 offices were returned on consensus basis.\n\nAccording to Governor Fintiri, the offices that would be contested are that of the Deputy National Chairman (South), National Auditor and National Youth Leader.\n\nThe former national secretary of the party, Olagunsoye Oyinlola and Ambassador Taofeek Arapaja will be contesting for the office of the Deputy National Chairman (South).\n\nSpeaking on the ruling of the Court of Appeal, Fintiri said the new NWC would assume office when that of the old one ends.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere will be no vacuum because we\u2019re not truncating anybody\u2019s tenure. We only called for an early convention, but that does not mean because we are having early convention, we are also terminating the tenure of the present NWC. They will still be asked to serve their time until December 9. If anything, it will give them a better chance to interface and have a smooth transition.\u201d\n\nGovernor Fintiri said the affirmative votes would be through open secret, explaining that in line with INEC\u2019s guidelines, votes will be cast, adding that the convention had achieved 80 per cent consensus.\n\nFintiri said 3,600 delegates were expected to cast their votes for the incoming NWC members.\n\nHe said, \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re making efforts to reconcile most of our contestants so that we can streamline them and have a better Convention. This will improve our elective chances in 2023.\n\nTambuwual: NWC to Emerge Through Consensus\n\nThe Chairman of the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum and Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwual, has said he and his colleagues were working towards ensuring that all members of the new NWC of the party emerged via consensus.\n\nHe said this after a meeting of the PDP-GF in Abuja, late on Thursday.\n\nTambuwual said, \u201cWe have held the meeting of the PDP governors\u2019 forum. As you can see again, 13/13, all of us attended and the chairman of the convention committee brought us up to speed on how prepared they are for us to hold our convention.\n\n\u201cWe are also happy to say that part of what we discussed was the process of getting consensus during the convention.\n\n\u201cSo far, we can say with certainty that we have achieved not less than 80 per cent of that process and it is still ongoing\n\n\u201cWe are hoping that at the end of the day, we are going to have a hitch-free convention and possibly have all the candidates emerge via consensus.\n\n\u201cConsensus is part of democratic process and we are imbibing that in the interest of our party so that we can continue to have stability that will reposition the party, as we have always said, for the future.\u201d\n\nWike Hails Ruling\n\nRivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has lauded the court ruling that restored PDP\u2019s National Convention.\n\nWike said Secondus\u2019 attempt to scuttle the convention \u201cmakes him an enemy of the party.\u201d\n\nHe said no individual could derail the party\u2019s mission to rescue Nigeria.\n\nWike said: \u201cWhat Secondus is doing is to sabotage the efforts of Nigerians, the efforts of PDP from rescuing this country from the hand of the party that has failed the country. And it is not fair.\n\n\u201cThis is a party that has given you everything and there\u2019s nothing wrong in making sacrifice. Even if, assuming though not conceding, that anything was wrong, we expected that having achieved what you have achieved in your life from this party, there is nothing wrong in making sacrifice.\u201d\n\nAccording to Wike, PDP\u2019s convention starting today would be one of the best that has ever been conducted.\n\nHe asserted that Nigerians were expecting PDP to come out of the convention more united.\n\nWike said the party members, particularly the PDP governors, were more united because they had realised that Nigeria was in difficulty and that only a united PDP could wrest power from the APC.\n\n\u201cNigeria is in problem and we cannot do it alone. We require everybody to work with us, collectively and see how this country can be rescued.\n\n\u201cNigerians are not happy with the ruling party, the way Nigerians are being treated. Like I\u2019ve told everybody; there is nothing better than making sacrifice for the interest of the country. PDP is the only platform, and it is today the only opposition party that can rescue Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWike noted that Tambuwal had recently led a team of his colleague to Ondo State to woo the former Governor of Ondo State, Dr. Olusengu Mimiko to PDP.\n\nHe said the leadership of PDP \u201cis happy that they are going to the convention with nothing less than 95 per cent consensus achieved,\u201d which he said \u201cis first of its kind.\u201d\n\nThe governor added that PDP \u201cis ready and prepared to achieve the change that will end the problem of governance in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSecondus to Challenge Ruling\n\nThe suspended National Chairman of the PDP, Secondus yesterday said though, he respects the position of the Appeal Court, he would appeal the ruling.\n\nSecondus said: \u201cEven as the substantive case is still pending at the Court of Appeal, I have instructed my lawyers to study the ruling with a view to appealing it immediately as no abuse of the constitution of our dear party should be allowed to stand.\n\n\u201cThe issue is not about Prince Uche Secondus but about the sanctity of our party\u2019s constitution and core democratic principles of justice and rule of law, not only in PDP, but also in our democracy. No impunity must be condoned.\n\n\u201cI will therefore wish to emphasise the fact that I did not take the party to court and would not have done that. As a foundation member of this party, who has served at various levels, I am very much abreast with the workings of the party. I have been a witness to how much harm litigations have done to our party in the past and as a result I have been a strong advocate against settling issues in courts.\n\n\u201cThis was why I resisted and rejected entreaties of those who wanted me to go to court to halt these forces when it was obvious that they were determined to disrupt my leadership and truncate my tenure in office with the sole objective of hijacking the party for their selfish ulterior motives.\n\n\u201cTo allow this travesty to stand is to reduce our beloved party to a level where anybody can wake up overnight and remove officers against the constitutional process and the National Chairman for that matter.\u201d\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Chuks Okocha in Abuja and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt",

          "text": "The Food and Drug Administration on Friday paved the way for children ages 5 to 11 to get Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe FDA cleared kid-size doses \u2014 just a third of the amount given to teens and adults \u2014 for emergency use, and up to 28 million more American children could be eligible for vaccinations as early as next week.\n\nOne more regulatory hurdle remains: On Tuesday, advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will make more detailed recommendations on which youngsters should get vaccinated, with a final decision by the agency\u2019s director expected shortly afterwards.\n\n\u201cThe rationale here is protect your children so that they can get back towards normal life,\u201d said FDA vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks. \u201cThe tremendous cost of this pandemic has not just been in physical illness, it\u2019s been in the psychological, the social development of children\u201d too.\n\nA few countries have begun using other COVID-19 vaccines in children under 12, including China, which just began vaccinations for 3-year-olds. But many that use the vaccine made by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech are watching the U.S. decision, and European regulators just began considering the companies\u2019 kid-size doses.\n\nWith FDA\u2019s action, Pfizer plans to begin shipping millions of vials of the pediatric vaccine \u2014 in orange caps to avoid mix-ups with the purple-capped doses for everyone else \u2014 to doctors\u2019 offices, pharmacies and other vaccination sites. Once the CDC issues its ruling, eligible kids will get two shots, three weeks apart.\n\nWhile children are at lower risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19 than older people, 5- to 11-year-olds still have been seriously affected \u2014 including over 8,300 hospitalizations, about a third requiring intensive care. The FDA said 146 deaths have been reported in that age group.\n\nAnd with the extra-contagious delta variant circulating, the government has counted more than 2,000 coronavirus-related school closings just since the start of the school year, affecting more than a million children.\n\n\u201cWith this vaccine kids can go back to something that\u2019s better than being locked at home on remote schooling, not being able to see their friends,\u201d said Dr. Kawsar Talaat of Johns Hopkins University. \u201cThe vaccine will protect them and also protect our communities.\u201d\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics also applauded FDA\u2019s decision, and said pediatricians were \u201cstanding by\u201d to talk with parents.\n\nVaccinating this age group is \u201can important step in keeping them healthy and providing their families with peace of mind,\u2019\u2019 said Dr. Lee Savio Beers, the academy\u2019s president.\n\nEarlier this week, FDA\u2019s independent scientific advisers voted that the pediatric vaccine\u2019s promised benefits outweigh any risks. But several panelists said not all youngsters will need to be vaccinated, and that they preferred the shots be targeted to those at higher risk from the virus.\n\nNearly 70% of 5- to 11-year-olds hospitalized for COVID-19 in the U.S. have other serious medical conditions, including asthma and obesity, according to federal tracking. Additionally, more than two-thirds of youngsters hospitalized are Black or Hispanic, mirroring long-standing disparities in the disease\u2019s impact.\n\nThe question of how broadly Pfizer\u2019s vaccine should be used will be a key consideration for the CDC and its advisers, who set formal recommendations for pediatricians and other medical professionals.\n\nA Pfizer study of 2,268 schoolchildren found the vaccine was nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infections, based on 16 cases of COVID-19 among kids given dummy shots compared to just three who got vaccinated.\n\nThe FDA ultimately assessed more children \u2014 3,100 \u2014 who received the kid dosage to conclude it was safe. Youngsters experienced similar or fewer temporary reactions \u2014 such as sore arms, fever or achiness \u2014 that teens experience.\n\nBut the study wasn\u2019t large enough to detect any extremely rare side effects, such as the heart inflammation that occasionally occurs after the second full-strength dose, mostly in young men and teen boys. It\u2019s unclear if younger children getting a smaller dose also will face that rare risk. FDA pledged Friday to keep a close watch.\n\nSome parents are expected to vaccinate their children ahead of family holiday gatherings and the winter cold season.\n\nLaura Cushman of Salt Lake City plans to get her three children \u2014 ages 7, 9 and 11 \u2014 vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWe just want them to get to resume their pre-COVID life a little bit more. And feel safe about it,\u201d she said.\n\nBut a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey suggests most parents won\u2019t rush to get the shots. About 25% of parents polled earlier this month said they would get their children vaccinated \u201cright away.\u201d But the remaining majority of parents were roughly split between those who said they will wait to see how the vaccine performs and those who said they \u201cdefinitely\u201d won\u2019t have their children vaccinated.\n\nThe similarly made Moderna vaccine also is being studied in young children, and both Pfizer and Moderna also are testing shots for babies and preschoolers.\n\n___\n\nAP reporter Lindsay Whitehurst in Salt Lake City contributed.",
