          "text": "Oluwatobiloba Jaiyeola\n\nA dental care expert, Dr. Agho Theophilus has cautioned Nigerians against brushing right after engaging in oral sex, noting that it is bad for oral health.\n\nTheophilus who is a consultant of oral medicine at the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital Zaria, Kaduna State, said brushing immediately after engaging in oral sex could also lead to the transmission of STIs.\n\nTheophilus explained further that when an individual has injuries in their mouth if they brush immediately after engaging in oral sex, there is a tendency that bacteria could pass through these sores.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with PUNCH HealthWise, Dr. Theophilus said, \u201cIt is not appropriate to brush immediately after oral sex because patients are exposed to dental health risks like gonorrhoea, syphilis, chlamydia, HIV, herpes, human papillomavirus virus also known as genital wart and hepatitis A, B, and E.\n\n\u201cThis is because when people brush their oral cavity, sometimes they may have injuries or cuts and these injuries may serve as a point in which bacteria may pass through and from there it can enter inside the bloodstream, so it is advised that they delay it. The advisable thing is to delay it for at least 30 minutes,\u201d he said.\n\nOn how to maintain proper oral hygiene after sex, the dental care expert said, \u201cThe patient should wait for at least 30 minutes after engaging in oral sex before brushing. The individual can also engage in flossing the teeth before having oral sex.\n\n\u201cSome studies have said that the use of alcohol mouth rinse/wash could kill some of those bacteria.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is, rinsing out your mouth with water can also be helpful, not brushing immediately, wait 30 minutes after the action.\u201d\n\nTheophilus urged Nigerians to engage in the use of physical barriers to prevent oral infections gotten from oral sex.\n\n\u201cUse of physical barriers like condoms, use of what we call dental or oral damns, there is also plastic wrap for people that do oral sex on the anus. Those are some of the physical barriers that can be used in preventing oral infection,\u201d he said.\n\nDental dams he said, are like a protective shield which is usually a thin, flexible piece of latex or polyurethane sheets. These sheets protect against direct mouth-to-genital or mouth-to-anus contact during oral sex, and also reduce the risk for STIs while still giving room for stimulation.\n\nTheophilus further stressed that a patient who has just recently undergone a dental procedure or treatment should not engage in oral sex because of the risks involved.\n\nHe said, \u201cPeople need to avoid oral sex if their partner has known STIs. Also, if there are any open wounds or sores in the genitals of their partners, they should equally avoid oral sex.\n\n\u201cOral sex should also be avoided with women during their menstrual periods.\n\n\u201cPersons engaging in oral sex should also ensure their genitals, as well as the surrounding area, is washed and cleaned thoroughly.\n\n\u201cPeople should limit the number of sexual partners they have and avoid casual sex, it is also important that people should have regular health checks and screening. Note that self-education is also important.\u201d\n\nThe dental health expert also urged the government to promote HPV vaccination in men, noting that this will help in reducing HPV infection that results from sex, for men who practice the various types of oral sex like fellatio, cunnilingus, and anilingus.\n\n\u201cFellatio is the oral stimulation of a man\u2019s genital area, cunnilingus is the act of orally stimulating the female genitals and anilingus is the licking of the anus by the tongue or mouth.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, \u201cOral sex is commonly practiced by sexually active male-female and same-gender couples of various ages, including adolescents.\n\n\u201cOral health has a direct impact on the transmission of infection; a cut in your mouth, bleeding gums, lip sores or broken skin increases the chances of infection.\n\n\u201cAlthough oral sex is considered a low-risk activity, it is important to use protection and safer sex precautions. There are various methods of preventing infection during oral sex such as physical barriers, health, and medical issues, ethical issues, and oral hygiene and dental issues.\n\n\u201cThe injury or unhealthy periodontal status of oral cavity accelerates the occurrence of transmission of infections into the circulation. Thus consequences of the unhealthy or painful oral cavity are significant and oral health should be given paramount importance for the practice of oral sex,\u201d the NIH said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Plying route of politics, what women must know \u2014 Stakeholders",
          "text": "By Ebunoluwa Sessou\n\nFor women in politics, it is critical to understand the structure, build alliances, build capacity, harness potentials, criticize the chances and environment, get more training and be mentored.\n\nThese were the echoes from the just concluded Women in Politics, WIMPOL Mock Presidential Debate, Mentoring and Graduating Programme organized by Women in Management, Business and Public Service, WIMBIZ.\n\nWith the theme,\u201d Politics in Nigeria: Lessons and Perspectives\u201d, participants at the event corroborated the need for women to take their place in politics; there is still a long way to go.\n\nTaking a leaf from the just concluded APC convention party primaries, where the only woman presidential aspirant, stepped down and supported a male counterpart, it was observed that women need leadership training and mentorship programme to up-skill before achieving positive result\n\nSpeaking on the issue, a member of the All Progressives Congress, APC, and former Deputy Speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly, Adefunmilayo Tejuosho, said that nobody would give any woman free position ; rather, women would continue to ask for affirmative action.\n\nHer words: \u201cWe continue to encourage more women to be in positions of authority. We should be able to come together as women to say, \u201cNo Women, No Vote\u201d. If we do not put women in positions of authority, women will not vote. I think this affirmative action will help to bring women on board.\n\n\u201cStepping down is not only a woman\u2019s issue. I think we need to re-organize ourselves to make sure that our grassroots is intact, to make sure that the delegates that would vote are those who will vote for women.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at the population of women in Nigeria, we have more women than men. When we look at the population of voters, we have more women than men, so we just need to encourage our women to come out and vote and we voted.\n\n\u201cFor her to have stepped down at the primaries, I think, it was a decision she made. Sometimes, you have to make a wise decision especially when you observe that a particular person is more popular than you. It is better to step down and support the other person. And be part of the process so that you can make a difference in your area of expertise\u201d, she said.\n\nA member of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, PDP, Olumide Thompson, corroborated that the sole aspirant stepped down for a reason. \u201cThere is a reason for her to have stepped down. She went as far as becoming a presidential aspirant. At some point, you have to listen to your leaders.\n\nAsked what this portends for women especially at a time like this, he said, \u201cMore women need to get involved in running for offices, however, there are different aspects including community organizations, boycotting, protest, petitioning. It is only a matter of time. With more initiatives, it can be better.\n\nIn her reaction, Executive Director, WIMBIZ, Hansatu Adegbite, stated that politics is not what one can dive into. Adding that, there is a need to go back to the drawing board and harness all areas, build capacity and then come back and conquer.\n\n\u201cI think it is time for women to build their competence, capacity and understand politics, understand stakeholder\u2019s structure and use the opportunity to grow themselves\u201d, she said.\n\nOne of the mentors, Rev Juliet Binitie expert in women leadership and nation building, said, the reality is that women need to understand leadership. \u201cThey need to understand where their passion lies. The biggest problem we have in Africa is that women have not been taught leadership. We need to understand that leadership is not masculine, it is also feminine.\n\n\u201cIt is a feminine and masculine necessity in leadership. For so long, women have accepted that leadership is masculine because of the leadership within the home. Home management is not the same in public space. Every woman ordained by God is called to lead. She must find her sector of leadership and that takes time with training. It is important that a woman is trained and mentored.\n\n\u201cYou need to understand that in your psyche, something went wrong. Over the years, women are trapped by the mindset that leadership is masculine. We need to re-orientate and de-toxic your mindset. It is the right of a woman to lead.\n\n\u201cIn order to be in the fore-front of engagement, women must understand that leadership is a human issue and women have been missing in action in many sectors all over the world because of the psyche. Whether you are married or unmarried, you are called to lead\u201d, she said.\n\nAnother politician and a WIMBIZ WIMPOL Mentee, Dr. Angel Adelaja-Kuye, APC Ogun State, said, \u201cWe have gotten to the point where men must know that politics is not just for them. It is not dirty or dubious. It is for the people and by the people. We must not allow a few sets of people to dictate to us.\n\n\u201cI was lucky to be part of the presidential primaries of the APC. I was part of the accreditation committee. As we move forward to support women, we want what is best for our country. Agenda does not come above the good of the society.\n\n\u201cI was happy that the only woman on the presidential list of APC was able to get to the point where she stepped down. She participated as a presidential aspirant and I was happy to see that she believes in our leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. She decided that standing behind him was a good opportunity for women.\n\n\u201cEven if we stand with ourselves, we must look at the politics that it is a game of numbers. If she had not stepped down, how many votes do you think she would have gotten? Even if all women were going to vote for her, how many women were delegates? I do not know if all the women who voted would have been in her favour.\n\nAnother WIMBIZ WIMPOL Mentee, Comrade Jimoh Saidat, APC Kogi State,, women are naturally home builders and if they are opportune to serve the nation, it will be a better place.\n\nAddressing the Mentees, one of the founders of WIMBIZ, Adeola Azeez, Candidate representing Ijebu Central Federal Constituency, House of Representatives, Ogun State under Social Democratic party, SDP, said, \u201cWe are building a pipeline of ready-made women who will be ready to take the plunge in politics. This is the first stream and fiunding allowing, we plan to do it every year.\n\n\u201cWIMBIZ has been out for 20 years. We started with WIMBOARD Mentoring and that has developed a life of its own and everything we do in terms of programming elevates the status of women and their contribution to nation building.\n\n\u201cI want to see what I can influence in the smaller parties. I want a party that would give room for women to grow and that was the best party that I found that is inclusive and I can see myself growing faster, better and contributing to the party structure.\n\n\u201cWomen in politics program which was initiated by WIMBIZ in 2014 was a result of the poor representation of women participating in politics, particularly from the private sector.\n\n\u201cIt is not enough to go through this mentoring program, you must now live out your convictions and spread your influence. Go back, do your due diligence, join or go back to your parties, become active, be valuable, become grounded, have a voice. Help other women find their voice; spread the knowledge you have acquired to other women. Influence the uneducated women who are grounded and are the Queens in your various parties. Build influence.\n\n\u201cHave a vision that you are working towards and start at it early. Get all the help you need to fulfill this vision. Politics is not for the faint hearted; however I am confident that you can do it. If you ever decide to run for office, you need people, you need funds. So don\u2019t wait, start building your structure now\n\n\u201cWork on your personal brand. Who are you? Who do you want to be known as? But also, how do you appear? Many of us watched the just concluded APC presidential primaries.\n\n\u201cPublic speaking is critical. You must command attention when you speak. Do people listen to you; take action because of what you\u2019ve said.\n\n\u201cPolitics is not for the faint hearted; it is serious business. If we want to see a new Nigeria, then we must be deliberate about it and must act with conviction.\n\n\u201cYour set must work closely together, collaborate, cooperate and do it all together. I will suggest and recommend to you what I did, that you enroll in the school of politics, policy and governance. It\u2019s an unconventional school where we train future leaders who are dedicated to the good of the nation.\n\n\u201cWIMPOL seeks to serve as a platform, to bridge the gender gap in Nigerian politics by training existing and intending female politicians on the required skills, to attain leadership positions.\n\n\u201cOne of the things I have noticed in my political journey is that there are women in politics however it is certain that we are not as many as the male gender. Secondly, the qualities of women who represent and are in the race are unfortunately below par.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for women to rise up in value and standard to this cause of transforming the political, economic and social environment and making a positive impact in our dear country.\n\n\u201cWomen can break boundaries and take on so many roles however there is a massive knowledge barrier that limits us to reach our full potential in the political sector.\n\n\u201cQuality and why is it an issue? The people we eventually vote for at the elections are selected by people who many times are not qualified to run for office. The people who end up being delegates decide to a large extent the future of the country. It is who they select that end up being in the final race that you and I vote for. As such, we need more women who have got the 3cs (competence, character and capacity) to emerge\n\n\u201cDo you know that if we have a critical mass of educated, professional, well informed people in politics, Nigeria will not continue grappling with a system that promotes mediocrity.\n\n\u201cIt is for this reason that I am glad that you, everyone graduating from this program today, has decided to become intentional about the future of this nation by becoming active politicians in value, substance and impact.\n\n\u201cWIMBIZ will not relent on her work to strengthen advocacy in the public sector/political leadership and inculcate mentoring into its strategy to build women who are politically savvy and ready to serve in political positions\u201d, she said.\n\nTejuosho noted that the WIMPOL is an avenue to encourage more women to come on board. Presently, we are talking about mobilization and making sure that people get their PVCs so that they can vote, make sure we vote the right people into governance particularly women.\n\nWiMBIZ Women in Politics Mentoring Programme graduated 125 Mentees, and it is maiden of the programme.",
          "summary": "We should be able to come together as women to say, \u201cNo Women, No Vote\u201d.\nAsked what this portends for women especially at a time like this, he said, \u201cMore women need to get involved in running for offices, however, there are different aspects including community organizations, boycotting, protest, petitioning.\n\u201cI think it is time for women to build their competence, capacity and understand politics, understand stakeholder\u2019s structure and use the opportunity to grow themselves\u201d, she said.\nOne of the mentors, Rev Juliet Binitie expert in women leadership and nation building, said, the reality is that women need to understand leadership.\n\u201cWomen in politics program which was initiated by WIMBIZ in 2014 was a result of the poor representation of women participating in politics, particularly from the private sector.",

          "title": "Building cash to digital infrastructure for old, new generations is our strength \u2014 CEO, Nibox",
          "text": ".\n\nMr. George Manuwuike is the founder and CEO, Nibox, a self service kiosks, hybrid of ATM and point of sale machines that seeks to meet Nigeria\u2019s largely cash-based population for financial services.\n\nIn this exclusive interview, Manuwuike speaks on what stands him out as a CEO of Distinction, Nibox sustainable growth, innovative solutions and challenges amongst other issues. Excerpts:\n\nWhat prompted the establishment of Nibox Payment Systems Limited and what are the factors that have contributed to its growth?\n\nThe Nibox experience was born from the need to provide adequate, seamless, and, above all, affordable last-mile financial service delivery for the unbanked and semi-banked Nigerians in urban and remote communities.\n\nNibox is building cash to digital infrastructure for the old and new generations. Living abroad for the past 35 years and being accustomed to easy access to financial services, I was disappointed when I couldn\u2019t conclude a payment for a government tender on a Friday due to the cumbersome process of accessing the relevant payment platform required to complete the payment.\n\nTraveling back to the bank to finalize the payment was frustrating and time-consuming, and it took almost two hours to conclude the above process in late 2015. At that juncture, I decided to develop a payment solution that would eliminate this unnecessary friction and save precious time. During the conceptualization process, I realized that we had to create a technology that would make payment services hassle-free and generate wealth for ordinary Nigerians left out in the financial service space.\n\nNibox is the answer to bridging the vast gap in financial service delivery in Nigeria through its cash-to-digital payment infrastructure, called the nibox kiosk. Our goal is to deploy the nibox kiosk in all the 774 LGAs and over 4,000 communities across Nigeria to enable everyday Nigerians to make and receive payments within the comfort of their communities and no longer than 1km.\n\nWhat value is the company offering to the clients and community?\n\nAbout 45% of Nigeria\u2019s 105.5 million adult population is financially underserved, and the numbers worsen when you look at the younger population and rural dwellers. Factors contributing to this include inaccessibility, a lack of proper infrastructure, and illiteracy. In the last few years, we have learned a lot about consumers\u2019 concerns, and we dedicated our efforts to address their challenges with payments. To do this, nibox has built a safe and reliable infrastructure solution to allow people to access essential financial services without a Smartphone or a bank account.\n\nOur mission is to solve the behavior around digital finance by creating accessible, reliable and inclusive payment channel for every Nigerian. At the core of our operation are communities of franchisees, aka kiosk operators, who do the hard work of managing the fleets of kiosks. We empower them with the required tools and education to achieve their financial goals via the new generation agency banking model.\n\nNibox provides a suite of products that create a complete lifestyle shift for the agents. Our kiosks are equipped with a monitoring system, solar-power modules, full software/technical support, and other added-value services\u2014 this helps to ensure that our franchisees reach optimal performance levels at all times.\n\nAs an Administrator with sterling track records in management, what have been the challenges of managing business (s) in Nigeria, and how have you been able to weather the storm?\n\nThere are peculiarities in every business environment, which can differ from place to place. In Africa, particularly Nigeria, businesses operate in a zero-sum and discouraging environment. Setting up and developing a business in Nigeria requires a dedicated entrepreneur with high skill and unwavering dogged determination.\n\nThe challenges are enormous and include; the poor state of infrastructure, changing government policies, inadequate access to data and information, poor access to funding and capital at affordable rates, staffing the right way, and, most importantly, access to electricity.\n\nConditions such as inflation, hike in diesel prices, and unstable exchange rates only further frustrate the efforts of every business in Nigeria. As an entrepreneur, I constantly innovate around these challenges and look for ways to overcome them. Being aware and facing them headlong is the strategy I have employed.\n\nWhile I may not say that I have found solutions to all the problems, these business storms can be managed by looking for alternative solutions. We are hopeful that the government will be mindful of supporting businesses as proper economic growth rests on their shoulders. Nigeria is yet to experience a favorable macroeconomic business climate to encourage the development of small businesses.\n\nWhat values made you stand out as an administrator and as an organization?\n\nEvery great business starts with a vision, but it requires the right skills and values to execute that vision. Nibox comes from 30 years of life and business experience in different countries, verticals, and relationships.\n\nNibox redefines how Nigerians interact with digital money, and we want to remove misery from payments \u2014 this is engraved in our DNA. Below are some of the values and principles that we follow. Nibox is\u2026 customer-centric time-saving innovative making useful products simple honest inclusive thorough down to the last detail\n\nWhat innovations pulled you through the trying times of Covid-19 lockdown and resulting recession?\n\nCOVID-19 was a game-changer in ways that had not been seen. It had an immediate, severe, and in some cases, devastating influence on every industry. And so, sales channels in practically all industries were disrupted and quickly shifted to online and self-service solutions.\n\nSelf-service kiosks grew in popularity and acceptance among those delivering critical goods and services globally at the time, as there was a need to reduce face-to-face contact to safeguard both customers and personnel.\n\nAs a result, most businesses were closed or had their operating hours reduced, particularly in industries that required human interaction to get served. Nigerians had to pay their bills. Fortunately, nibox services cater to every Nigerian daily. Nibox brings these primary services to the last mile: airtime/data top-ups, cash-in/cash-out services, electricity recharge, sports betting, and government payments. As a result, the kiosk came in handy under unusual circumstances.\n\nIt served as a viable payment tool as it allowed people to complete transactions independently. It was also challenging for us, but we strategically innovated around deployments \u2014 for example, taking the service to housing estates.\n\nThe COVID pandemic experience earned nibox a global recognition award by CFI ( Centre for Financial Inclusion), Washington DC as a winner of the 2021 Inclusive Fintech 50 Global Competition (IF50) as one of the leading solutions for financial inclusion in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nCan you mention some recognitions and accolades you have garnered over the years during the course of managing business(s)?\n\nSince its inception, Nibox has won several awards both nationally and internationally.\n\nAmongst them is Best Financial Service Innovation Award at the DigitalPay Expo conference in Eko Meridien Lagos in 2018; winner of the Inclusive Fintech 50 competition by CFI (Center for Financial Inclusion) Washington DC; recognition by VISA International as a global brand for payment services; as well Google partnership where nibox has been selected into Google exclusive marketing program for innovative products and services and many others.\n\nWhat are your future projections as an organization?\n\nNibox will become an essential financial infrastructure across Nigeria and several other Sub-Saharan countries and will act as a catalyst for cash-to-digital adoption for 50 million people and exposure to over 250 million. Nigerians will use nibox to pay their utilities or shopping bills; deposit or withdraw cash; onboard new banking products without lengthy bank trips; receive their first debit/credit cards from the kiosk; and more.\n\nEven with changing demands for cash, Nibox kiosks will be well-positioned to cover the needs of digital-savvy users. Our vision is that Nibox will empower and provide employment to millions of Nigerians through direct/indirect jobs and franchising while returning superior value to the shareholders. As the first self-service kiosk company in Nigeria, we desire to make the Nibox kiosk a leading payment platform with nationwide coverage and exposure to other African markets.\n\nWhat advice would you give to upcoming professionals to survive the imminent challenges that will confront them?\n\nTaking time to understand your goals, vision, and business is my honest advice to aspiring professionals and entrepreneurs. Life frequently poses problems, which we can handle if we are well prepared. Always examine the factors that influence your life, career, and business and try to make changes. Set goals and build your vision. Constantly be innovating and looking for strategic partnerships and collaborations.\n\nKeep your options open ahead of time. Believe in yourself and be ready for the (unavoidable) bad times. Accept failures as temporary setbacks. Have Mentors and learn from their experiences. The list is endless, but being prepared is crucial to conquering obstacles. My go-to quote is \u201cGenius is 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration\u201d by Thomas Edison. Ideas are the easier part, while execution is everything.",

          "text": "By Luminous Jannamike, Abuja\n\nI DO solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute functions of the office of chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria\u201d. These were the words being read by the six new chairmen of Abuja\u2019s area councils after Justice Suleiman Belgore administered the oath of office to them and their deputies at the Cyprian Ekwensi Arts and Cultural Centre, Garki Area 10, venue of their inauguration, for a four-year tenure.\n\nOut of the six chairmen, Christopher Zakka Maikalangu of Abuja Municipal Area Council, AMAC, and Abubakar Umar Abdullahi of Abaji council would be exploring their first term in office while the chairmen of Kuje, Bwari, Gwagwalada, and Kwali councils were inaugurated for their second and final tenures. The FCT Minister, Muhammed Musa Bello, in his remarks shortly after the inauguration, urged them to reflect on the oath they have taken and chart a way forward to provide the dividends of democracy to the people at the grassroots.\n\n\u201cThe documents you signed today are very weighty. There will come a day when you will be held accountable. If you are corrupt, and the relevant agencies catch you, many of your friends and supporters will desert you. You will face the music alone. If I were you, I will go for the basics. I will tackle primary education and healthcare. I will tackle sanitation and insecurity. No matter who you are, you can\u2019t do anything on security until you relate with your elders,\u201d he warned.\n\nRemarkable among the new chairmen is 44-year-old Christopher Zakka Maikalangu, whose emergence as the chairman of AMAC, one of the largest and most strategic local council areas in the country, could be described as a transformation from grass to grace. He does not hide the facts of his life and his struggles to emerge as a leader of the people through politics.\n\nBorn on December 23, 1978 to the indigent family of Zakka Tukura Sefu Maikalangu of Garki Village, he started his educational pursuit at the Garki Primary school from 1989 in Garki village. He couldn\u2019t proceed to secondary school until he was 23. He later graduated in 2007 at the age of 29. Two years later, he ventured into grassroots politics and became a councillor in 2013. He quickly mastered the art of grassroots legislation and was re-elected on multiple occasions for his excellent representation of his ward.\n\nHaving lived all his life in the Abuja municipal and convinced that he understood the issues and challenges bedeviling the area council, he ran for the chairmanship position on the platform of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party and won by a landslide in his first attempt. Addressing his supporters and well-wishers after the inauguration ceremony, Zakka, a thoroughbred politician and grass root mobiliser with a calm disposition, promised to run a fair government, free of discrimination to all residents, irrespective of political, ethnic or religious background.\n\n\u201cThe people have so much expectations from us. By the grace of God, with prayer and support, we shall make them proud,\u201d he said, noting that the area council was the closest level of government to the people at the grassroots.",

          "text": "Bianca, wife of late Biafra warlord, Ikemba Odumegwu Chukwuemeka Ujukwu, has responded to Rev. Father Ejike Mbaka\u2019s comment on presidential aspirant, Peter Obi.\n\nRecall that Mbaka had during his ministry\u2019s gathering in Enugu State, said Peter Obi can\u2019t be Nigeria\u2019s president because he is a stingy person.\n\nHe declared that unless God ceases to exist, Obi would never smell the seat of the president.\n\nBianca, recounting her experience with Obi, disclosed how the former Anambra Governor refused to buy a $3,985 suit and went for a $220 suit in 2009 just to donate money to help the needy.\n\nAccording to her, if Obi\u2019s value is defined as \u2018stinginess\u2019 then Nigeria needs to adopt such a mould for a sustainable environment.\n\nHer post on Facebook read: \u201c NO APOLOGIES, PLEASE. On Peter Obi\u2019s supposed \u2018Stinginess\u2019\u2026.\n\n\u201cIn Life, You either live by your creed or you desecrate the mould by which the Almighty created you. Any progressive nation measures an individual by his values, not his vaults.\n\n\u201cIf this way of life is what is derided as \u2018stinginess\u2019 on the part of Peter Obi, then we all need to adopt this mould for a more sustainable and more humane environment.\n\n\u201cSometime in 2009, \u2018Mr\u2019(as he preferred to be addressed) Peter Obi, Governor Of Anambra State at the time, visited Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu and myself at Dallas, Texas. He came to deliver a get well message from Dr Goodluck Jonathan and was billed to attend a black tie event at the Dallas Marriott.\n\n\u201cCuriously, Obi flew into Dallas airport with one small carry-on luggage which he insisted on wheeling around himself, and on getting to our residence requested to freshen up. What will you be wearing to the event tonight?\u2019, we inquired. It was at that point that it struck him that he could not show up in his casuals at such a ceremony.\n\n\u201cI insisted on taking him to the luxury men\u2019s emporium at Neiman Marcus to buy a smart black suit. When we got there, he was busy doing the Dollar to Naira currency conversions. The suit that was a perfect match for him was a dapper Tom Ford suit with a price tag of 3,985 dollars plus tax.\n\n\u201cTo cut the story short, Obi refused to pay what he termed \u2019that outrageous price\u2019 for the Tom Ford suit and that was how we ended up at Steinmart where he agreed to pay a more acceptable price of 220 dollars, tax inclusive, for a basic men\u2019s suit which he was happy to wear to that evening\u2019s event.\u201d\n\nHowever , Obi later gave her dollars meant for the suit to be used for her charity foundation.\n\nMeanwhile, Obi has said he has no plan to reply to the Catholic priest.",

          "text": "Mixed reactions yesterday trailed the choice of Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as running mate to Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar in 2023.\n\nThose who bared their minds included former National Chairman Uche Secondus, Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki, former Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu and a PDP chieftain in Cross River State, Ntufam Okang.\n\nThe trio of Secondus, Obaseki and Ekweremadu lauded the decision taken by the opposition party. They said by bringing a \u201cresourceful person\u201d with immense electoral value like Okowa, the PDP was on its way to returning to Aso Rock, Abuja next year.\n\nOkang however differed, describing the preference of Okowa over Wike on same ballot with Wike as a political miscalculation.\n\nDelta State House of Assembly Speaker Sheriff Oborevwori also reacted.\n\nIn a congratulatory message to Abubakar and Okowa, Secondus described Okowa as \u201ca good head\u201d to be around the presidential candidate.\n\nIt was Secondus\u2019 first public reaction to events in the PDP since was removed as chairman in August 2021.\n\nHe wrote in the message released by his Media Adviser, Ike Abonyi: \u201cAbubakar\u2019s choice of Governor Okowa as his running mate says it all about his knack for picking a good head to be around him for the gargantuan task ahead.\n\nObaseki described Okowa as an energetic grassroots mobiliser whose emergence as a vice=presidential candidate would translate to victory for the PDP next year.\n\nIn an online statement, Obaseki said the pair of Abubakar and Okowa would rescue and place Nigeria on a growth path.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cI heartily congratulate you, my friend and brother, His Excellency, Sen. Ifeanyi Okowa, on your emergence as the vice presidential candidate of our great party, the PDP.\n\n\u201cHe (Okowa) has the needed experience that will guarantee victory for our party in the 2023 elections, in our bid to rescue the country and place it on the path of progress and prosperity.\u201d\n\nEkweremadu, in a post on his verified social media handles, described Okowa as \u201chighly resourceful and prepared for the office of the Vice President.\u201d\n\nHe commended the PDP and Atiku for the decision and called on all party leaders and faithful to go to work and ensure the success of the ticket in the presidential poll.\n\nThe former deputy senate president wrote: \u201cI join our party leaders, party faithful, and supporters in congratulating my brother and friend, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, on his emergence as the Vice Presidential candidate of our great party, the PDP. This is a sound choice by our presidential flag bearer, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and our party.\u201d\n\nThe Delta State Speaker described \u201cthe choice of Okowa as indeed a round peg in a round hole.\u201d\n\nOborevwori added that PDP stakeholders in the state would soon commence \u201cgrassroots mobilisation for the party and the presidential candidate and his running mate.\u201d\n\nBut Okang, a former Information Commissioner in Cross River State, argued that the \u201cPDP has already lost the 2023 elections by that singular decision (choice of Okowa as running mate).\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWho knows Okowa? What has he done for the party before? Look, I can\u2019t get it on that choice. Why not Governor (Nyesom) Wike?\u201d\n\nExpressing disappointment at the decision, Okang said that \u201cthe only chance the party has to win the 2023 elections was to make Wike its vice presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cHe is the only one who would have been able to speak for us in the Presidency,\u201d Okang said.\n\nThere was unusual silence when news of the selection of Okowa filtered into the Government House.\n\nMost stakeholders of the PDP in the state were said to be disappointed at the last-minute horse trading that shut Wike out of the ballot.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Government House and PDP leaders celebrated reports that Wike had been recommended by the PDP\u2019s National Advisory Committee as Atiku\u2019s running mate.",

          "text": "Why Delta governor was picked\n\n\u2018My choice won\u2019t disappoint Rivers governor\u2019\n\nSome founding fathers and governors influenced the choice of Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as running mate to Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar, it was learnt yesterday.\n\nBefore their intervention, the pendulum tilted in the direction of Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike, who came second in the party\u2019s presidential primary.\n\nThe leaders and governors advised the candidate to choose what a source described as \u201ca less controversial and a controllable running mate\u201d since the 2023 campaign will be issue-based.\n\nYesterday, Atiku unveiled Okowa at a meeting in Abuja.\n\nOthers considered for the slot were Akwa Ibom State Governor Udom Emmanuel and one-time Finance Minister Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who it was learnt, was not consulted but included on the list.\n\nDAAR Communications Chairman, Chief Raymond Dokpesi, who was initially featured, did not make the final cut following the insistence of a retired Army General who played a prominent role in the Obasanjo Administration that he should be dropped.\n\nAnother source, who was part of the search team that zeroed in on Okowa said: \u201cWe actually looked at his calmness and less controversial political lifestyle. He is adding value and not a baggage to the campaign team.\n\n\u201cWe wanted a situation whereby Atiku and his deputy will be able to work harmoniously if they win in 2023.\n\n\u201cAnd from the list of potential vice presidential nominees from the Southsouth, Okowa was never ambitious. All our leaders took note of this characteristic.\n\n\u201cAbove all, Okowa has a richer political experience than other nominees. Having consulted widely, we felt he could add more value to Atiku than others.\n\n\u201cNone of them could match his records as Chairman of Ika North-East Local Government Area, a commissioner, a Secretary to Delta State Government and a Senator. He will not be a passenger in government.\u201d\n\nThe source also cited Okowa\u2019s Igbo descent as \u201ca strategy to win votes from the Southeast\u201d.\n\nHe said Okowa\u2019s choice \u201cis the closest offer PDP can make to appease the Igbo because Okowa is a hybrid of the Southeast and Southsouth culture\u201ds.\n\n\u201cThe permutation is about winning votes because 2023 poll is going to be tough,\u201d the source added.\n\nA former governor gave an insight into why the pro-Okowa forces hijacked the process.\n\nHe said the recommendations of the National Advisory Committee (NAC) was overruled. The NAC recommended Wike.\n\nThe former governor said: \u201cThe party hijacked the process from Atiku. We went back to our winning ways of picking an amenable running mate because of the task at hand to rescue Nigeria in 2023.\n\n\u201cOkowa\u2019s emergence followed PDP\u2019s antecedents of shopping for a sober vice presidential candidate. In 1999, the late Governor Abubakar Rimi was to be vice president to ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo but we felt Rimi as a leftist would not complement him because he would be uncontrollable.\n\n\u201cIn 2007, ex-Governor Peter Odili was highly favoured to be running mate to the late President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua but his image was looming larger than Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s. We foresaw a likely crisis and opted for ex-President Goodluck Jonathan who is meek.\n\n\u201cWe wanted someone who will not rock the boat and Okowa fits the bill.\u201d\n\nThe ex-governor added: \u201cWe were almost reaching a deadlock because the governors insisted the running mate must to be one of them. We bowed to the governors\u2019 wish and reached a consensus on Okowa.\u201d\n\nOkowa\u2019s choice appears not to have gone down well with some other influential members of the party, particularly the way they said the process was hijacked by the leadership and those who believe they own the PDP.\n\nThe aggrieved members are not happy that the National Chairman Dr. Iyorchia Ayu and some leaders jettisoned the recommendations of the various committees on the choice of Wike.\n\nThe disagreement over Okowa made some governors and members of the National Working Committee (NWC), including the National Secretary, Senator Sam Anyanwu and National Vice Chairman (Southsouth), Chief Dan Orbih, boycott the unveiling of Okowa.\n\n\u201cSome stakeholders are unhappy because the party\u2019s leadership sidelined the recommendations of vital organs of the party on the choice of Wike,\u201d another source told this newspaper.\n\nAtiku: Why he is my choice\n\nAnnouncing Okowa as his preference, Atiku said he settled for the Delta governor because he needed a deputy who would be able to speak his mind freely.\n\nAtiku explained that he consulted all party organs and key stakeholders before arriving at the decision. He described Okowa as level-headed and an experienced politician both in the executive and the legislature.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn arriving at the decision, I held wide consultations with various stakeholders in our party, including our governors, National Working Committee, Board of Trustees and other leaders to seek their input and their wisdom.\n\n\u201cIn these consultations, I made clear that my running mate would have the potential to succeed me at a moment\u2019s notice, that is, a President-in-waiting.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the person must have the qualities to be President. The person must have an appreciation of the deep rot which our country has been put into by the rudderless APC government; understands the great suffering that most of our people are going through and the urgency of relieving them of that suffering; understands the critical importance of economic growth and development to provide our young people with jobs, hope, and a pathway to wealth.\n\n\u201cThe person must appreciate the critical importance of education in the development of modern societies so we can prepare our young people to be able to compete in the increasingly competitive and globalised world.\n\n\u201cMy running mate must understand that without security, development will be very difficult because local and foreign investors who have been scared away already, would not return to invest in our economy.\n\n\u201cThus, my running mate will be a person who will stand by me as I confront the frightening level of insecurity in our land.\n\n\u201cIn addition, my running mate has to be someone who is not afraid to speak his mind and give honest advice, and be by my side as I work very hard to reverse the destructive impact of the past seven years of the APC government.\n\n\u201cIt is a difficult decision that I am called upon to take. But, as someone hoping to lead a complex country such as ours, tough and difficult decisions would remain a part of my everyday life.\n\n\u201cLet me, therefore, start this momentous journey with a crucial decision about who, among the eminently qualified shortlist, would be my running mate.\n\n\u201cI know that he will not only add excitement to our already energised ticket and campaign but will also help to bring focus, discipline and stability to our government, come 2023.\n\n\u201cI am pleased, therefore, to announce here my choice of a running mate who will help to lead us to victory next year, not only in the presidential election but also in the governorship and legislative elections.\n\n\u201cAnd he will be by my side as I work hard every day to provide our people with security, revive our economy, improve education and unite our country.\n\n\u201cHe has both legislative and executive experiences. Please join me in welcoming to the ticket the next Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, His Excellency Governor Dr. Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa\u201d.",

          "text": "Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor Godwin Emefiele hinted yesterday of new plans to combat the nation\u2019s forex crisis.\n\nHe said the apex bank was looking beyond monetary policy measures to deal with the challenges.\n\nAccording to Emefiele, monetary policies cannot sufficiently address the problem in the face of rising demand for foreign exchange for goods, services and other needs.\n\nSpeaking at the maiden bi-annual Non-Oil Export Summit in Lagos, Emefiele described the RT200 FX Programme recently unveiled by the apex bank as one of such strategies.\n\nThe RT200 FX Programme is an initiative of the Bankers\u2019 Committee aimed at raising $200 billion in non-oil export earnings over the next three to five years.\n\nEmefiele listed value-adding exports facility; non-oil commodities expansion facility; non-oil fx rebate scheme; dedicated non-oil export terminal and biannual non-oil export summit as the five pillars anchoring the programme.\n\nAccording to him, the CBN has been working overtime to manage the demand and supply side to meet forex obligations.\n\nAttributing the prevailing challenges of the local economy to COVID-19 pandemic, delays in global logistic value chains and local security challenges, Emefiele expressed concern that the current sources of foreign exchange inflows were unreliable and prone to fluctuations of global economic developments.\n\nThe CBN boss noted that the global economic challenges have impacted food production among others and exerted undue pressure on the economy, thereby exposing the fragility of the Nigerian economy and making macroeconomic management very difficult.\n\nStressing the need for a more diversified economy, Emefiele said Monetary Policy alone could not bear all the burden of the expected adjustments needed to manage the challenges to the Nigerian economy.\n\nHe said: \u201cThese problems call for urgent design and steadfast implementation of other supportive, structural and complementary policies that are broad based, coordinated and focused on complementing the work of the monetary authority.\u201d\n\nRead Also: CBN okays sugarcane facility for farmers\n\nRestating the need for a more diversified economy, Emefiele said Nigeria could be great without crude oil, the global price of which the country had no control over.\n\nHe therefore urged all stakeholders to regroup by working together to reposition Nigeria on a growth trajectory by taking diversification of the economy much more seriously, emphasising that Nigeria had very little choice left but to look inwards and find innovative solutions to its challenges.\n\nHe said to avoid sudden adjustments to nation\u2019s economic life, there was need to focus on strategies that can help the country earn more stable and sustainable inflows of foreign exchange.\n\nEmefiele said: \u201cWe would need to follow the best practices of other countries and ensure that we protect ourselves a little bit from factors that are beyond our immediate control.\n\n\u201cThis is the time to start working in synergy for the good of our nation. This is the time for us as a Banking Community to do more and support exporters who have been flying the flag of Nigeria in the international market space.\u201d\n\nAdmitting the enormity of the ultimate goal of the $200 billion non-oil exports over the medium term, Emefiele expressed confidence that the goal is attainable, given the fact that many countries, less endowed than Nigeria have achieved much in the field of agriculture.\n\nUnderscoring the point, he said that within a short period of implementing the Non-Oil FX Rebate Scheme, the country had recorded a significant increase in non-oil export repatriation, adding that eligible exporters have been paid over N3.5 billion in rebates.\n\nLagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu praised the CBN and other actors in the banking sector for supporting the efforts of the Federal Government and states, especially Lagos, to boost economic growth.\n\nSanwo-Olu expressed optimism that the Lekki Deep Sea Port, which he described as the largest in West Africa, would be ready for use by the end of 2022, thereby providing enormous opportunities to exporters to conduct their trade and improve the export earnings of the country.\n\nAs part of efforts to decongest the Apapa and Tin Can Island Ports in Lagos, the governor said the State Government was awaiting approval for work to begin on the Badagry Ports in the Western part of Lagos.\n\nHe assured stakeholders that the state will continue to promote policies and programmes that will ease the process of doing business in Nigerial\u2019s industrial hub.\n\nIn his opening remarks, CBN Deputy Governor, Economic Policy, Dr. Kingsley Obiora, said the RT200 Non-Oil Exports Summit was a promise kept by Emefiele at the launch of the programme in February 2022, pointing out that the RT200 policy was designed to incentivise exporters in the non-oil export sector to repatriate and sell their export proceeds in the local foreign exchange market.",

          "title": "Okowa: Has Atiku made right choice? The Nation Newspaper",
          "text": "Ifeanyi Okowa, medical doctor and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain is a household name in Delta State, where he had served as Secretary and Chairman of Ika Local Government, Commissioner, Secretary to State Government and Senator before becoming the governor.\n\nYesterday, he started gazing at the Aguda House, Abuja. In the intra-party scheming, Okowa triumphed over Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike, former Senate President Pius Ayim, Enugu State Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi and former Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu.\n\nOkowa, according to former Aviation Minister Osita Chidoka, was screened, following his nomination as running mate by the presidential candidate, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar.\n\nHe is now on the weighing scale as running mate. The puzzle is: what value can he add? Will his choice boost the chance of the Waziri Adamawa in next year\u2019s election?\n\nThe main opposition party has been enveloped in anxiety as its leaders were locked in intrigues over the choice of the vice-presidential candidate.\n\nA National Advisory Council (NAC) was set up to conduct the search. At the end of its brainstorming session, the panel picked former presidential aspirant, River State Governor Nyesom Wike, who lost to Atiku at the primary.\n\nObviously, Atiku was not favourably disposed to Wike\u2019s choice, although many party chieftains felt that the platform needed him.\n\nBut, he had given a tough battle to Atiku at the primary, where he came second. Unlike Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal, who stepped down, Wike fought on, insisting that power should shift to the South in accordance with the PDP constitution on zoning.\n\nRead Also: Meet the Vice President\n\nSuddenly, another screening panel headed by Chief Tom Ikimi was set up to screen Wike. The move generated controversy because the Rivers governor had previously been screened for the presidential primary by a committee headed by Gen. David Mark.\n\nA section of the party was taken aback by the choice of Ikimi as leader of the committee. Ikimi belongs to the Obaseki faction of Edo PDP, which worked for the emergence of Atiku at the primary. The Obih faction, which is up in arms against Governor Godwin Obaseki, supported Wike at the shadow poll.\n\nWith the rejection of Wike, PDP has shown hostility to a faithful and committed party man, and a mobiliser. This may also widen the gulf in the Edo chapter.\n\nIn 2019, Atiku had picked former Anambra State Governor Peter Obi, without extensive consultations, particularly with the Southeast Caucus, which complained that it had no input into the calculations.\n\nDid he consult widely, ahead of 2023?\n\nOkowa has experience. He has served the party in various capacities as a reconciliator and chairman of presidential primary and party convention. In the PDP, he has paid his dues.\n\nPDP insiders said Atiku opted for a seemingly soft chieftain to pair with him. The factor at play is loyalty. This is key . But, is loyalty a sufficient factor?\n\nThe Delta governor has an Igbo name. But, he is not from the Southeast, which has consistently been the stronghold of the PDP in the South. Okowa is from Southsouth. Does his influence extend beyond Delta? How influential is he is other five states of the Southsouth? What surprise can he spring on poll day?\n\nThere are more questions begging for answers. Is PDP taking the Southeast for granted? What explanation can be given to the Southeast Caucus for not zoning the vice presidential ticket to the zone?\n\nThere is a sort of repressed tension between Igbo in the interior of old Bendel State and Igbo of Southeast. Okowa, who is from Ika, is not perceived as a core Igbo. He is not from Asaba, Ibusa or Oguachukwu, which tend to have affinity with Igbos on the other side of River Niger.\n\nIt was even suggested that being from a tiny part of the state, he became governor through former Governor James Ibori\u2019s endorsement.\n\nAt the home front, there is said to be a gulf between him and his former godfather. Ibori\u2019s anointed candidate for governor, who is the House of Assembly Speaker, defeated Ibori\u2019s candidate, David Edevie. People were shocked that he could challenge Ibori. The bitterness has not fizzled out.\n\nWith Okowa\u2019s emergence as running mate, Southeast is now left in the cold. How will PDP leading lights from the region react to the scenario? How will Atiku make it without the support of the zone?\n\nIgbo who are scattered across the country are looking up to Obi. Will Igbo at home retain loyalty to the PDP, which, apart from blocking zoning to the region, has also refused to concede the second fiddle to the zone?",

          "title": "Why I chose Okowa as running mate, by Atiku The Nation Newspaper",
          "text": "The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Atiku Abubakar has explained why he picked Delta Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as his running mate for the 2023 poll.\n\nAtiku who spoke while unveiling Okowa at the PDP National Headquarters on Thursday, said Okowa has all the qualities to function as president.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cWith the convention behind us, we have arrived at the stage for me to pick a Running Mate because this is a joint ticket. I am very happy to announce today that I have reached a decision on that.\n\n\u201cIn arriving at the decision, I held wide consultations with various stakeholders in our party including our Governors, National Working Committee, Board of Trustees, and other leaders to seek their inputs and their wisdom.\n\n\u201cIn these consultations, I made clear that my running mate would have the potential to succeed me at a moment\u2019s notice, that is, a President-in-waiting.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the person must have the qualities to be President. The person must have an appreciation of the deep rot which our country has been put into by the rudderless APC government; understands the great suffering that most of our people are going through and the urgency of relieving them of that suffering; understands the critical importance of economic growth and development to provide our young people with jobs, hope, and a pathway to wealth.\n\n\u201cThe person must appreciate the critical importance of education in the development of modern societies so we can prepare our young people to be able to compete in the increasingly competitive and globalized world.\n\n\u201cMy running mate must understand that without security, development will be very difficult because local and foreign investors who have been scared away already, would not return to invest in our economy. Thus, my running mate will be a person who will stand by me as a I confront the frightening level of insecurity in our land.\n\n\u201cAs you know, the APC government went to sleep as huge swathes of our country\u2019s territory fell into the deadly hands of gangs of criminals, including those masquerading as freedom fighters or pastoralists, while our farmers and genuine pastoralists are unable to go about their businesses. The costs in precious human lives and properties have been enormous.\n\n\u201d My running mate must also not only symbolize the imperative of reuniting our country but also be able to work with me to achieve that objective. This is because a united Nigeria is a potentially stronger, more prosperous, and more secure country able to lead Africa and give hope to the Black race.\n\n\u201cIn addition, my running Mate has to be someone who is not afraid to speak his mind and give honest advice, and, be by my side as I work very hard to reverse the destructive impact of the past seven years of the APC government.\n\n\u201cIn the United States of America from where we borrowed key aspects of our current Presidential system, a running mate is used to balance the ticket, complement the candidate and, after victory, assist the President with governance. Sometimes a candidate is chosen who generates a buzz and adds huge excitement to the campaign.\n\n\u201cBut today in Nigeria, we face huge challenges which leave us little room for drama. We have to win the elections and get to work immediately. My running mate has to be ready to start working with me, from day one, in addressing our country\u2019s challenges. Nigerians will not accept anything less. That is why I promised the Governors of our party that my running mate will come from among them. Our current challenges call for a government that is highly focused and disciplined.\n\n\u201cI have sought for the support, guidance, and counsel of the PDP in selecting a befitting Running Mate who meets all or most of the qualities enumerated above. The wisemen and sages of the Party, put together by our NWC, have gone fishing and brought home an enviable group of awesome politicians that surpasses these qualities. Every one of the recommended persons is a fit and proper individual to hold this office. While this makes me marvel at the bundle of talents that abounds in our Party, it also compounded my task of choosing a single person from among them.\n\n\u201cLet me therefore pay tribute to my party and, most especially, to all those that made the shortlist that must now be narrowed down to a single person. They are all dedicated party-men suitable for this task. I wish all the recommended persons could be announced today as my Running Mates. Unfortunately, only one MUST be chosen.\n\n\u201cIt is a difficult decision that I am called upon to take. But, as someone hoping to lead a complex country such as ours, tough and difficult decisions would remain a part of my everyday life.\n\n\u201cLet me, therefore, start this momentous journey with a crucial decision about who, among the eminently qualified shortlist, would be my Running Mate.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, let me state that the person I have chosen as my Running Mate possesses all those identified qualities. He personifies not only the seriousness the current moment represents for our country but also the future that our young people yearn for and deserve. He is a serving State Governor who has demonstrated, in his State and through his conduct, that governance is about service to the people.\n\n\u201cI know that he will not only add excitement to our already energized ticket and campaign, but will also help to bring focus, discipline and stability to our government, come 2023. I am pleased, therefore, to announce here my choice of Running Mate who will help to lead us to victory next year not only in the Presidential election but also in the governorship and legislative elections. And he will be by my side as I work hard every day to provide our people with security, revive our economy, improve education and unite our country. He has both Legislative and Executive experiences. Please join me in welcoming to the ticket the next Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, His Excellency Governor Dr. Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa.\n\n\u201cYou know him to be a fighter; you know him to care about winning; you know him to care about good governance; and you know him to care about our people. Now, my dear friends, let\u2019s do the disciplined hard work necessary to win this election. Let\u2019s go. Thank very much.\u201d",

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nCrisis is brewing in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) following the nomination of Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as the opposition party\u2019s vice presidential candidate for the 2023 general election.\n\nFormer vice president and PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, yesterday, announced Okowa as running mate at a meeting of the national caucus at the PDP national Secretariat, in Abuja.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nAtiku said his choice was informed by Okowa\u2019s antecedent as former member of the National Assembly, two-term governor and appreciation of the dire strait the country was facing. He, however, said others recommended for the vice presidential slot \u2013 Governors Nyesom Wike and Udom Emmanuel of Rivers and Akwa Ibom states respectively \u2013 were eminently qualified, noting that only one person could have been chosen for the job.\n\n\u201cIn arriving at the decision, I held wide consultations with various stakeholders in our party, including our governors, National Working Committee, Board of Trustees, and other leaders to seek their inputs and their wisdom. In these consultations, I made clear that my running mate would have the potential to succeed me at a moment\u2019s notice, that is, a President-in-waiting.\n\n\u201cThe wise men and sages of the party put together by our NWC have gone fishing and brought home an enviable group of awesome politicians that surpasses these qualities. Every one of the recommended persons is a fit and proper individual to hold this office. While this makes me marvel at the bundle of talents that abounds in our party, it also compounded my task of choosing a single person from among them\u2026\n\n\u201cI know that he (Okowa) will not only add excitement to our already energised ticket and campaign but will also help to bring focus, discipline and stability to our government, come 2023. I am pleased, therefore, to announce here my choice of running mate who will help to lead us to victory next year, not only in the presidential election, but also in the governorship and legislative elections. And he will be by my side as I work hard every day to provide our people with security, revive our economy, improve education and unite our country.\u201d\n\nHowever, Daily Sun gathered that Okowa\u2019s choice has not gone down well with several party leaders, including governors and critical stakeholders. Mostly irked are supporters of Governor Nyesom Wike, who was originally tipped for the position.\n\nOkowa\u2019s emergence, it was learnt, also deepened the schism in the PDP Governors Forum, which had been polarised over who would be the vice presidential candidate.\n\nWhile Governors Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, Okezie Ikpeazu, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Ahmadu Fintiri and Samuel Ortom of Abia, Enugu, Adamawa and Benue states respectively, pushed for Wike, Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal; Taraba Governor, Darius Ishaku and Godwin Obaseki of Edo championed Okowa\u2019s course.\n\nThe division became glaring, yesterday, as only Obaseki, Bala Mohammed and Udom were present at the caucus meeting where Okowa was unveiled. Makinde, Ortom, Ikpeazu, Fintiri, Ugwuanyi and Wike were absent. Enugu governor, who showed up at the PDP secretariat left before the commencement of the meeting. Some NWC members including the National Vice Chairman (South South), Dan Orbih, were also absent.\n\nThe division, it was learnt, might not be unconnected with the result that came out of Tuesday\u2019s meeting from the special panel set up to shop for Atiku\u2019s running mate where 13 members voted in favour of the Rivers governors as opposed to three that voted for Okowa.It was learnt that those who supported Wike, especially among the governors, were vexed by the eventual choice of Okowa who came a distant second.\n\nDaily Sun, however, gathered that the pendulum tilted in favour of Okowa on Wednesday night, following the intervention of some northern leaders, among them a member of the NWC, who kicked against the choice of Wike, alleging he was anti-north.\n\nA top party source told Daily Sun that some of the grouse listed against Wike included alleged past anti-north speeches, move to domicile Value Added Tax (VAT) collection in Rivers State perceived to hold dire consequences for northern states\u2019 economy, alleged intolerance of Islam, among others.\n\nWike was also perceived as a hardliner as opposed to a more malleable Okowa who will work better with Atiku to achieve his goals.\n\nPDP chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, however, dismissed reports that the panel voted in favour of a particular person.\n\n\u201cThe committee recommended three names to us and we transmitted those three names to the candidate. Contrary to all the speculations in the social media, the NWC did not select one name for the candidate. The choice of running mate, who will be working with him is largely his. But he graciously consulted the party, which is how it should be. And the party has made inputs and narrowed it down to three people for him to select. \u201cAlso, I want to clarify one misrepresentation in the social media. The committee did not vote throughout its sitting. It was all by consensus.\u201d\n\n\u2022I\u2019ll stay loyal, says Okowa\n\nSpeaking after being named, Okowa said he would remain loyal and committed to the goal of the party to return to power.He said winning the 2023 presidential election would require great work and asked for support and commitment of party members to the cause of winning the general election.\n\n\u201cI want to pledge that I will stay loyal and committed to this battle and it\u2019s a battle God has a hand in. There is no doubt that there is a great work ahead for each and every one of us. The build-back process is going to be collective and we\u2019re trusting that all our party members would want to be part of that story at the end of the day.\n\nOkowa had while addressing journalists after appearing before the vice presidential screening committee, said Wike would not be disappointed with his emergence.\n\n\u201cGovernor Wike is a very strong party man. He has great love for our party, and I believe he is also a good democrat and he understands that when several brothers are in the race for a particular position, it has to be one at a point in time. I want to assure you that Governor Wike is a very good man and his interest for this country and party to rise up to the challenges at the moment is strong. I do not feel he is going to be disappointed.\u201d\n\n\u2022BOT hails\n\nChairman, Board of Trustees (BOT), Senator Walid Jibrin, said the decision to pick a Christian as Atiku\u2019s running mate will unite Nigerians better.\n\nJibrin advised Nigerians irrespective of religious differences to support PDP to win the election.\n\nThe second republic lawmaker noted that the opposition party is greater than the APC, and urged PDP members to take the decision arrived in picking the VP as an act of God.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "By Lukman Olabiyi\n\nOndo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, yesterday gave a strong warning to the Federal Government on the issue of insecurity across the country.\n\nThe chairman, South West Governors Forum, stated that if the federal government fails to find a lasting solution to the current insecurity ravaging the country, it would soon leave citizens with no choice than to arm themselves in self defence.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nAkeredolu, who gave the warning while delivering the keynote address at the meeting of the Attorneys-General of the 36 States of Nigeria, in Lagos, said the police were overwhelmed.\n\nHe asked the police to \u201cclose shop\u201d if the federal government could not meet its equipment needs. He said: \u201cThe current spate of insecurity in the country leaves us with no room for equivocation on the right of the states to maintain law and order through the establishment of State Police.\n\n\u201cThe growing distrust in the polity is a direct result of the disconnect between the federal government and the constituent units of the country.\n\n\u201cThe economic adversity, currently experienced in the country, points directly at the defective political structure.\n\n\u201cA unitary system cannot work successfully, in a country like Nigeria. The 1999 Constitution has been amended twice. There is another promise of further amendments arising from the manifest irregularity in many provisions.\n\n\u201cThis has compelled many lawyers and educated citizens to insist on having a new Constitution which will reflect the agitations of the various groups which make up the country.\n\n\u201cThe law is becoming increasingly less certain under these circumstances.\n\n\u201cThe crises created by the 1999 Constitution, as amended, have been unending. There have been agitations that the Exclusive Legislative List in this Constitution is limited to Nigeria\u2019s external trade, customs duties, export duties, tax on incomes, profits and capital gains, interstate commerce, external borrowing, mining rents and royalties from mineral resources, among others.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has, consistently, rejected this suggestion, presumably, because of the humongous 52% revenue allocation to it, while the 36 States and the 774 local governments share the remaining 48%,\u201d the governor stated.\n\nAkeredolu further challenged states to restructure the country by, among others, setting up their anti-graft agencies.\n\nHowever, in his address at the event, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), said governors cannot continue to agitate for restructuring and state police when they are responsible for the compromise and mismanagement of the current system.\n\nHe said that state governors, who have taken over the allocations of local government in their states, have no moral right to ask for restructuring.\n\nMalami also stated that \u201cstate police will not work because state governors would abuse it; look at the way they treat local government, imagine what will happen if they control the police.\u201d\n\nThe AGF advised the governors to utilise the existing structures through the National Assembly, to press on with their demands for restructuring and other constitutional amendments.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "Delta State Governor, Dr. Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa, has emerged as the vice presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party. The party\u2019s presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, named Okowa as his running mate Thursday afternoon in Abuja.\n\nThe announcement was made ahead of INEC\u2019s Friday 6pm deadline for the submission of names of vice presidential candidates by political parties.\n\nAtiku described him as vice president in waiting. He said he found him disciplined and committed enough to his ticket.\n\nThe vice presidential candidacy of Okowa, 62, a Christian from the oil rich Niger Delta region, will complement the presidential candidacy of former Vice President Atiku, a Muslim from the North east.\n\nBorn in Owa-Alero in Ika North-East Local Government Area of Delta State, Okowa attended the famous Edo College, from where he proceeded to the University of Ibadan where he obtained his degree in Medicine and Surgery. He started practice as a medical officer with the Bendel State Hospitals Management Board before he went into private practice in 1986 as director of Victory Medical Centre.\n\nHe began his political career in the aborted Third Republic when he became the Secretary of Ika Local Government, before serving as chairman of the council from 1991-1993. He also served as coordinator of the Grassroots Democratic Movement (GDM) for Delta North.\n\nOkowa, a founding member of PDP, served at various times as Delta State commissioner for Agriculture and Natural Resources, Water Resources Development, and Health. In the build up to the 2007 election, he resigned from office and vied for the PDP governorship ticket, which he lost.

          "text": "\u2022PDP screens vice-presidential nominees today\n\n\u2022Party\u2019s NWC meets over c\u2019ttee\u2019s recommendations on running mate\n\n\u2022Atiku speaks on how to free up funds for social investments\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren and Chuks Okocha in Abuja\n\n\n\nDesperate to beat deadline set by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has quietly submitted his forms, with the inclusion of a \u2018place holder\u2019 as running mate.\n\nAt the same time, the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has constituted a 12-man committee-led by Chief Tom Ikimi, to screen the presidential nominees of the party.\n\nAlso, following the meetings of the various elders and consultative committees of the party, on the choice of a vice presidential candidate, the National Working Committee (NWC), of the PDP, met to decide on the recommendations made by the various committees.\n\nThis is as the presidential candidate of the PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has said his main objective was to have Nigerians, who would be the beneficiaries of his policy framework to interrogate the policies on how to reduce infrastructure deficit and free up funds for social investments in the country.\n\nAn insider in the ruling APC told THISDAY last night in Abuja that the action by Tinubu and the APC was aimed at meeting the statutory requirement and beat the Friday, June 17, 2022 deadline by INEC for presidential candidates to submit names of their deputies to the commission.\n\nBut the choice of running mate is yet to be resolved hence the decision to include a \u201cplace holder\u201d instead as vice-presidential candidate, while Tinubu and the APC were still making consultations for a suitable deputy that would enhance the party\u2019s victory in 2023.\n\nThe controversy over the suitability of the APC running with a Muslim-Muslim ticket or otherwise, has been very intense in the last few days.\n\n\u201cThe name of the running mate submitted would be changed for another northern politician in the next few weeks. The one submitted is just holding the ticket in trust for another candidate to be picked by Tinubu and the party in the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cThe candidate is still widely consulting, because the issues around the choice of running mate are many and he is yet to address them all. So, he is still asking for more time to look into it all \u2013 whether he is running a Muslim-Muslim or a Muslim-Christian ticket.\n\n\u201cHe personally thinks there\u2019s a need for more consultation and that\u2019s what he is doing. The debate on the choice of deputy has assumed a level that is currently greater than the party and the candidate, hence the need for comprehensive consultation, which is what he is doing,\u201d a reliable party source hinted last night.\n\nThough some names had been mentioned as possible running-mate to the former Lagos state, it was gathered that no compromise have been reached yet.\n\nA source in the Tinubu\u2019s camp told THISDAY that all the northern governors want the position.\n\nThe source added that if Tinubu had his way, he would have loved to pick the former Governor of Borno state, Kashim Shettima as his running-mate, but he wanted the president and the governors to pick.\n\nThe source said: \u201cAll northern governors want it. If Tinubu has his way, it will be Senator Kashim. But he wants the president and governors to pick for him.\u201d\n\nAsked why Tinubu does not want to pick his running mate himself, the source stressed he didn\u2019t want to be a winner takes it all.\n\n\u201cHe does not want to be the winner takes it all. You need to respect the president. Buhari did not choose VP for himself in 2015.\u201d\n\nFrom the PDP camp, a credible party source, had disclosed that after an extensive deliberation, where Governors Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State and sacked former Imo State governor, Emeka Ihedioha, were considered, the vice-presidential nomination committee, settled for one of the governors.\n\nA statement by the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Hon. Debo Ologunagba, however, named Dr. Akilu Indabawa, as the Committee Secretary while Mr. Sunday Omobo, was nominated as Administrative Secretary.\n\n\u201cPursuant to Part VI, Paragraph 14 of the the Electoral Guidelines of our great Party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the National Working Committee (NWC), has approved the nomination of the following party members to serve on the Vice Presidential Candidate Screening Committee for the screening/verifying of the nominated Vice Presidential Candidate of our Party for the 2023 general election,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nOther members of the committee, the statement listed, were Chief Osita Chidoka, Member; Rt. Hon. Binta Bello, Member; Chief Mrs. Alh. Mutiat Adedoja, Member; Rt. Hon. Austin Opara, Member; Prof. Aisha Madawaki, Member; Mrs. Ayotunde George-Ologun, Member; Chief Mrs. Chidiebelu Mofus, Member; and H.E. Fidelis Tapgun, Member.\n\nThe party said the screening exercise would hold at the National Working Committee (NWC) Hall, PDP National Secretariat, Wadata Plaza, Abuja, today, June 16, 2022. at 10am.\n\nDeadline for the submission of presidential candidates and the vice-presidential candidates ends tomorrow, June 17, as the INEC website shuts down automatically by 6pm.\n\nAlso, deadline for the submission of governorship and state assembly candidates ended yesterday, Wednesday, June 15, while the submission for National Assembly candidates ends tomorrow, Friday June 17.\n\nSources close to the party informed THISDAY that the NWC will submit the names of three vice presidential nominees to Atiku for his consideration.\n\nThe three nominees were of South South and South East zones.\n\nHowever, based on the timetable by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the PDP is expected to submit the names of its presidential candidate and running mate today or before 6pm tomorrow, Friday, June 17, 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, Atiku, while reacting to the observations by the National Union of Electricity Employees (NUEE), said it was important to emphasise that actively promoting private sector participation in infrastructure development would be beneficial to the economy.\n\nHe also said it was inevitable that Nigerians incentivise the private sector to take risk and invest in the economy for obvious reasons.\n\nAccording to a statement by his media office, Atiku said, \u201cThere is no telling that Nigeria\u2019s huge infrastructure deficit is making businesses uncompetitive and stunting economic growth. The supply of efficient infrastructure, including roads and rail transportation, communication, adequate power etcetera is extremely important for the economy to grow and create much-needed jobs.\n\n\u201cTherefore, to build the economy of our dreams, we must increase the stock and improve the quality of our infrastructure. Inadequate infrastructure has been identified as the most problematic factor for doing business in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe PDP presidential candidate further said, \u201cIn terms of actual spending, Nigeria currently spends less than 1% of its annual GDP on infrastructure as against the required levels of between 3%-5% of annual GDP. This shortfall has created a deficit, estimated at USD 3 Trillion over the next 30 years. Our overwhelmed public sector does not have the resources or expertise to deliver.\n\n\u201cWhile our financing requirement is approximately 100 billion USD per annum, Nigeria\u2019s entire budget is only USD 30 billion. The National Development Plan envisages that 80% of all investments will come from the private sector.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, Nigeria\u2019s core infrastructure sectors are not operating efficiently. Almost all the infrastructure sectors from roads, railways, housing, power, and energy are operating below potential. Over the years, we have observed how these enterprises consume huge public resources, while offering poor quality services.\n\n\u201cMany of these state-owned Enterprises have become a source for political patronage, corruption, and rent-seeking to the detriment of Nigeria\u2019s long-term economic growth\n\n\u201cFor example, Nigeria\u2019s refining infrastructure remains poor despite the perennial injection of unending public resources for turnaround maintenance. The country\u2019s refining capacity per capita is 0.002 bpd/capita compared to Libya\u2019s 0.06 bpd/capita and South Africa\u2019s 0.01 bpd/capita.\n\n\u201cAs of today, Nigeria imports over 80% of its refined products to meet its current needs and is said to be the largest importer of PMS in the world, with significant balance of trade implications,\u201d Atiku explained.\n\nSadly, he contended that, \u201cThe fiscal cost of maintaining these state-owned Enterprises is enormous, and it comes with even greater opportunity costs. By holding unto these underperforming enterprises, Nigeria is sacrificing investments in critical areas, including education, health, water, sanitation, and rural infrastructure.\n\n\u201cFor example, the first phase in the rehabilitation of Nigeria\u2019s refineries is expected to gulp US$1.55 billion! With its current precarious fiscal position and daunting development challenges, Nigeria cannot afford to forego productivity enhancing investments in human capital development and channel scarce resources to moribund enterprises.\u201d\n\nSpecifically on his policy document tagged: \u201cMy Covenant With Nigeria\u201d, Atiku said, his objective was to drive private investment to shift Nigeria from being a \u201cnet importer\u201d to a \u201cnet exporter\u201d of petroleum products and become the refining hub of the entire West Africa region.\u201d\n\nAccording to the former vice president, \u201cWe cannot hope to achieve this without extensive reforms to restore investor confidence, which is currently at its lowest ebb. The active participation of the private sector in the downstream sector will help drive efficiency and healthy competition in the oil and gas sector.\u201d\n\nThe Bureau of Public Enterprises, had stated that 67% of the 142 privatised firms were performing, explaining that it must be noted that several firms, not just liberalised enterprises, were facing business environment challenges in Nigeria.\n\nMany have closed and or being forced to relocate to neighbouring countries, because of the poor business environment.\n\nTo this end, Atiku said, \u201cThere is no denying the fact that Nigeria has derived enormous benefits from the creation of a liberal environment to facilitate private sector participation in key sectors of the economy. Today, the IT sector is undeniably the fastest growing services sector in the Nigerian economy. We need to replicate these efforts by extending the reform initiatives to other sectors.\n\n\u201cOf course, different countries have implemented liberalisation programmes with varied outcomes and over time and space just as other policies. But it is easier to point to success stories around the world: from Vietnam to Mexico; from Indonesia to South Africa and Egypt etcetera than outright failures.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, liberalisation and deregulation programmes, have supported the private sector to unleash its growth potentials and enabled these governments focus on investing in education, healthcare, poverty alleviation, water and sanitation with such proceeds.\n\n\u201cEvery reform measure has the potential to create difficulties especially, in the short-term, but with a positive impact on incomes, employment, and poverty, over the medium and long-term. Liberalised firms may face difficulties as they transit from the old culture of rent-seeking and dependence on government for survival, to a new business culture that is driven by efficiency and competition.\n\n\u201cBut Atiku Abubakar will ensure that his economic reform measures are accompanied by a series of mutually supportive activities aimed at easing these difficulties and making the reform measures impactful.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022NERC, Discos, Gencos, TCN seal deal on compulsory supply of 5000mw of power from July 1\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja and Peter Uzoho in Lagos\n\n\n\nAs Nigerians continue to contend with erratic power supply, the World Bank has said the country would need about $100 billion in the next 10 years to tackle the challenge which has defied all efforts by administrations since 1999.\n\nHowever, as part of efforts to address the challenge in the power sector, the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) yesterday said effective from July 1, 2022, there would be remarkable improvement in the nation\u2019s power sector as market participants have committed in contracts to ensure the generation, transmission and distribution of 5000 megawatts (mw) of electricity in the country.\n\nCommenting on the $100 billion needed by the country over the next 10 years, World Bank\u2019s Regional Director for Infrastructure, Africa West and East of the global bank, Ashish Khanna, who spoke at a programme organised by The Electricity Hub, an organisation which provides insights on the sector, stated that a large chunk of the investment was expected to come from the private sector.\n\nHe added that Nigeria has the highest number of people without electricity worldwide, which has led to about four per cent loss of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nKhanna said the issues of subsidy, gas-to-power as well as energy access would have to be sorted out before a headway can be achieved in the sector.\n\nOn a comparative basis, he noted that Ghana already has 85 per cent electricity access while Senegal was on its way to achieving 100 per cent access by 2025, stressing that Nigeria has all it takes to move from less than 50 per cent access to universal energy provision.\n\n\u201cOur estimation is that Nigeria will need at least $100 billion in the next 10 years, and it will be very difficult for government or the world Bank to plug that hole.\n\n\u201cAnd the private sector will do a lot of funding and will look out for whether the sector is financially viable. But they will ask \u2018if I set up a plant, will they pay for it\u2019? Is the policy and regulatory environment for the sector certain?\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, if the government gets the distribution side of the industry right, the private sector would be willing to come in. However, he added that Nigerians must begin to see improvement in supply, which is important for their buy-in.\n\nHe further revealed that the World Bank\u2019s engagement in Nigeria is still largest by the organisation anywhere in the world, adding that the country remains an important development partner.\n\nIn his comments, the Minister of Power, Mr. Abubakar Aliyu, argued that the sector was now receiving more attention especially on infrastructure from generation, to transmission and distribution as well as the interfaces with gas producers.\n\nHe admitted that the sector hadn\u2019t had enough focus in the past leading to decay, but said President Muhammadu Buhari was determined to upgrade the infrastructure because the country cannot move forward without it.\n\nAliyu said the Siemens project was on course, stressing that it is meant to take generation to 25,000 megawatts by 2025. He assured that between September to December, a number of infrastructure will be arriving from abroad.\n\nHe disclosed that the national grid remains unstable and wouldn\u2019t take the other sources of planned energy, saying that therefore off-grid electricity was being planned in silos.\n\nThe minister further stated that the federal government was planning 14 projects which will give the country 1,000 megawatts with 10 state governors already collaborating for an additional 100 mw each to hit 2,000mw off-grid.\n\nDeclaring that Nigeria was also looking at newer sources of power like hydrogen, Aliyu explained that the current focus on solar is in line with the 30:30:30 vision to ensure that by year 3030, 30 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s total power generation will be based on renewable sources.\n\nHe said the industry was undergoing reform, which he said will take time to manifest, insisting that comparing Nigeria with other countries like Senegal was fundamentally flawed because of size and other differences.\n\nAccording to him, the Right of Way (RoW) issue had been a big challenge, taking years to resolve and halting some projects , which eventually will undergo variation because of delays.\n\n\u201cWe want to raise our base-load to a level where we can later integrate these other energy sources,\u201d he said, adding that the federal government was discussing with 14 solar developers to execute projects off-grid.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria\u2019s biggest hydropower plants, Kainji and Jebba, could barely produce 130MW of power, despite having a combined installed capacity of around 1,300MW.\n\nAlso speaking, Country Director, World Bank, Shubham Chauduri, explained that as a development agency, the World Bank was committed to helping the government lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty.\n\n\u201cSo in the last two years, between 2020 and 2022, our board has approved $8.5 billion financing for Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond financing, he noted that officials of the bank also exchange ideas on how to get these things done, adding that the areas of power, human capital, domestic revenue mobilisation, among others remain very critical.\n\nHe noted that Nigeria needed to bring the missing pieces in the industry together, including the technical side, accountability , financing and regulatory clarity.\n\nOn top of the existing support , he stated that there\u2019s another $1.5 billion for which approval has been given , plus the energy transition plan which could take another $2.5 billion,.\n\nNERC, Discos, Gencos, TCN Seal Deal on Compulsory Supply 5000mw of Power from July 1\n\nMeanwhile, NERC has said from July 1, 2022, there would be remarkable improvement in the nation\u2019s power sector as market participants have committed in contracts to ensure the generation, transmission and distribution of 5000 megawatts (mw) of electricity in the country.\n\nThe commission also disclosed that the phase 1 of the National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP) where four million locally manufactured meters would be rolled out for customers would begin by the end of August this year.\n\nThe Chairman of NERC, Mr. Sanusi Garba, disclosed this yesterday during a media briefing in Lagos, saying the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), generation companies (Gencos) and distribution companies (Discos) have committed to sign contracts which mandates them to ensure that 5000wm generated was bought and paid for, and the gas for generation of that capacity is also paid for as and when due.\n\nHe said the contracts were part of the result of the ongoing reforms in the power sector which are being initiated and supported by the government, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and other stakeholders pushing for improvement in the nation\u2019s electricity industry.\n\nGarba said this was the first time market participants were coming together to commit to pay for energy produced by entering a contract to ensure payment or consequences for default.\n\nNigeria\u2019s power sector has been enmeshed in multiplicity of challenges even after the privatisation of the distribution and generation aspcts of the sector in 2013, resulting in poor supply to Nigerians.\n\nGrid collapse has become a regular occurrence in the sector with the power grid recording its latest collapse just a few days ago, throwing Nigerians in darkness, despite trillions of naira pumped into it by the government to improve its performance.\n\nThe country now barely delivers 2000mw power supply to its citizens, with the situation worsening the condition of living of Nigerians and jerking up cost of production.\n\nGarba said this new development would lead to improved service delivery to consumers who require improvement in supply.\n\nHe said any of the parties in the deal that fails to play its part according to the terms of the contracts will receive the consequence, stressing that the targeted 5000mw will only be achieved when all parties comply.\n\nHe said, \u201cSo, what we are trying to do is, consumers require the service, the Discos should commit to buying this electricity from those who are generating it. Gencos that are generating the power must commit to buy the fuel to generate that electricity, and the only way it can be done and in a sustainable manner is if it is underpinned by contracts.\n\n\u201cAnd if any of the market participants defaults, then obviously, there will be consequences for not providing what you said you will do.\n\n\u201cThat is the basic explanation of what we are doing which will take effect from first of July. So, we are going to start with 5000mw. Discos will commit to buy and Gencos will commit to generate and ensure that gas is there to provide this power by paying for gas. So, there will be no stories of I don\u2019t have gas to produce.\u201d\n\nGarba also informed that apart from committing to deliver 5000mw on July 1, they would also see an opportunity to increase that contracted volumes from 5000 to 5,500 up to 7000mw.\n\nThis, he said, would make Nigerians to be able to see a trajectory of improvement in not just maintaining the targeted volume of power but to also ensure stability of supply and then assess if there is enough infrastructure to ramp up to 7000mw.\n\nHe assured categorically that power consumers woulf begin to see improvement in supply by \u201cfirst of July\u201d.\n\nHe said TCN has confirmed that it could deliver 5000mw and that even the Discos had successfully distributed 5000mw before but that they couldn\u2019t continue delivering that 5000mw because of commercial reasons.\n\nThe NERC chair added, \u201cSo, the commission decided that this commercial issues militating against low distribution must be sorted out. For Nigerians to have 5000mw, there must be a commitment to buy 5000mw. That hasn\u2019t happened before. This is the first time you have Discos committing to this.\n\n\u201cAnd the TCN will be committed to deliver that 5000mw. And we have identified power plants that will come and contract for the gas to deliver 5000mw. It hasn\u2019t happened before.\n\n\u201cNow, the second leg is, will there be payments because a contract without payment doesn\u2019t work? So, we have sat down working with the Discos, with everybody to ensure that there will be sufficient cash flow to undertake the contracts, because if I sign a contract to deliver gas to you and you default to pay for it, tomorrow, I will shut the power out.\n\n\u201cSo what we are saying is, this is something that has been done to just steer back the market to a way it was designed to work in the first place.\u201d\n\nAlso, the commission disclosed that the phase 1 of the National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP) where four million locally manufactured meters will be rolled out for customers will begin by the end of August this year.\n\nIt said about 45 local prepaid electricity meter manufacturers have submitted their bids and that the programme was still on the procurement stage.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "\u201cAnd the private sector will do a lot of funding and will look out for whether the sector is financially viable.\nHowever, he added that Nigerians must begin to see improvement in supply, which is important for their buy-in.\nNigeria\u2019s power sector has been enmeshed in multiplicity of challenges even after the privatisation of the distribution and generation aspcts of the sector in 2013, resulting in poor supply to Nigerians.\nThe country now barely delivers 2000mw power supply to its citizens, with the situation worsening the condition of living of Nigerians and jerking up cost of production.\nHe assured categorically that power consumers woulf begin to see improvement in supply by \u201cfirst of July\u201d.",

          "text": "\u2022Adoke: court verdict vindicates me yet again\n\nDeji Elumoye and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\n\n\nThe federal government yesterday reacted to the United Kingdom Commercial Court judgement that ruled that there was no evidence of fraud in the OPL 245 transaction between Nigeria and JP Morgan Chase Bank, saying it was studying the judgement.\n\nHowever, former Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Mr. Mohammed Adoke said the judgment once again vindicated him of any wrong doing in the Operating Oil License 245 otherwise known as Malabu Oil.\n\nThe Commercial Court of England and Wales had on Tuesday June 14, 2022, ruled on the matter in Case No CL-2017-000730 as contained in its 137-paged judgement.\n\nAn Italian court in 2021 also dismissed all corruption charges in the OPL 245 deal, discharging and acquitting all the defendants.\n\nThe Nigerian government in the judgement lost $1.7 billion claims against JP Morgan Chase Bank over the transfer of proceeds from the sale of OPL 245 in 2011.\n\nReacting to the judgement on behalf of the Federal Government, Minister of information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who spoke with newsmen at the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja, said the government\u2019s lawyers would study the ruling and decide whether to appeal or not.\n\nCommenting on the Court judgement, Mohammed said: \u201cI also read the judgement. Malabu oil and I think strangely enough, the judge said we were not able to establish that we lost $1.7 billion.\n\n\u201cBut I also read further that the lawyer said that they are studying the judgement and they will take the appropriate step on whether to appeal or not.\u201d\n\nAdoke said the judgement has once again vindicated him of any wrong doing in the Operating Oil License 245 otherwise known as Malabu Oil.\n\nReacting to the judgment, Adoke said, \u201cit is very gratifying that foreign courts have declared over and over again that there were no fraudulent or corrupt practices involved in the OPL 245 Settlement Resolution.\u201d\n\nAlthough, he had maintained that he was not expecting a contrary judgment knowing well that he did no wrong and had served Nigeria with all honesty and every sense of duty and patriotism.\n\nHe observed that although he was not a party in the suit, the federal government through the office of the Attorney General of the Federation, had, \u201ccaused all manner of false depositions to be made against me to paint the transaction with the tar of corruption to justify the spurious criminal proceedings instituted against me in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn a statement dated June 14, the former AGF said he was particularly pleased with the outcome of the suit because if it were to be Nigerian courts, he would have been accused of buying justice by those who he claimed are hell-bent on tarnishing his name and destroying him for political reasons.\n\nAccording to him all he did was to advise former President Goodluck Jonathan on the outcome of a consent judgment of a Federal High Court, Abuja, which was implemented.\n\n\u201cPresident Jonathan asked me, as the Chief Law Officer of the Federation, to give him legal advice on the validity and enforceability of the Out-of-Court Settlement entered by the Obasanjo Administration. After reviewing all the documents related to the oil block, I advised him that the Settlement Agreement dated 30th November 2006 had already been reduced into a subsisting Consent Judgment of the Federal High Court, Abuja.\n\n\u201cMy involvement in the entire OPL 245 saga was carrying out the lawful directives/approvals of President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, GCFR, to the effect that the Settlement Agreement was implemented.\n\n\u201cHowever, when President Muhammadu Buhari assumed office in 2015, some influential figures in his government deceived him into believing that Nigeria could get back the $1.1 billion that Shell/ENI paid to Malabu for OPL 245. They thought that by impugning the transaction and painting me with the tar of corruption, they would have a great chance in court,\u201d he said.\n\nAdoke claimed that part of the scheme, involved eliciting some activists and anti-corruption crusaders at home and abroad to scandalise his name by forging all kinds of documents to be used against him in local and foreign jurisdictions where the OPL 245 transaction was undergoing judicial scrutiny.\n\nHe expressed joy that in all the cases where he was a party and others where his name was severally mentioned had been dismissed by the respective courts.\n\n\u201cGod is so good that in March 2021, an Italian court dismissed all corruption charges in the OPL 245 deal, discharging and acquitting all the defendants. Although I was not on trial, my name was frequently mentioned, but I came out unscathed. The court findings exonerated me of any blame or corrupt act.\n\n\u201cNot satisfied, the current Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mallam Abubakar Malami, engaged lawyers to make all kinds of mindless and libellous allegations against me in Commercial Court in the UK in an attempt to make JP Morgan refund the $1.1bn paid to Malabu, along with supposed interests totaling $1.7 billion.\n\n\u201cThe UK court has now dismissed the allegations of fraud. My name is cleared yet again. It is also worthy of note that the US Department of Justice (DoJ) investigated the OPL 245 deal and brought it to a close in October 2019 without any charges.\n\n\u201cAlso, in April 2020, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it could not prove any allegations of fraud or corruption and decided to close the investigation into the transaction.\n\n\u201cIt is gratifying that those respected authorities in the US, the UK and Italy have all scrutinised the OPL 245 deal extensively and exhaustively without a single conviction whatsoever.\n\n\u201cI have been unjustly defamed locally and internationally, and my livelihood has been taken from me; however, I am grateful to friends, colleagues and well-wishers who have stood by me throughout this challenging and depressing period.\n\n\u201cNow that it is clear to all discerning minds that no fraud was perpetrated in the OPL 245 Resolution Agreement, the Attorney General of the Federation should be advised to refrain from wasting Nigeria\u2019s hard-earned foreign exchange by way of legal fees on local and foreign counsel in a bid to prove the existence of a fraud that never was\u201d, he added.\n\nMeanwhile, at FEC yesterday, the federal government further approved the enactment of the Federal Fire and Rescue Service Establishment Act 2022.\n\nMinister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, told newsmen that the proposed law was meant to replace the old law establishing the Fire Service, which has been in existence for 60 years.\n\nAccording to him, the Council directed the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, to fine tune the bill for onward transmission to the National Assembly for passage.\n\nAlso briefing, Works and Housing Minister, Babatunde Raji Fashola, said FEC also approved N66.9 billion for the rehabilitation of Kashimbila-Takum-Chahchangi road in Taraba State, North-East Nigeria.\n\nFashola said the project would help boost the transportation network in Taraba State and the entire north-east.\n\nThe Council also approved N23.9 billion for the procurement of equipment for airports across the country.\n\nBriefing on behalf of the Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said the equipment to be procured include radio communication system for some control towers and instrument landing systems for some airports.\n\nMohammed said the communication tower had to be upgraded because the ones currently in use have aged and also to enhance better performance in the 12 airports in line with technological advancements and aviation industry\u2019s best practices.\n\nHe added that N14 billion for the procurement of instrument landing systems for Lagos Abuja, Katsina and Portharcourt airports.\n\nHe also said the move was necessitated by the recent increase in the fleet of passengers across the four airports.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A lecturer in the Department of Sociology, Faculty of Social and Management Sciences of the Nigeria Police Academy (POLAC), Wudil, Kano State, Dr. Goddy Osa Igbaekemen has accused the First City Monument Bank (FCMB) of conspiring with the principal officers of the academy to withhold his monthly salary, make illegal deductions in his account and unlawfully withhold his bank transaction alerts.\n\nIgbaekemen obtained a loan from the FCMB on the 27th June, 2014 which was due to be paid up in August 2021 from the bank's successive deductions from his salary account.\n\nBut after the duration of repayment, as contained in the agreement between him and the bank, and subsequent intervention by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), FCMB denied him access to his account and all attempts to get the bank to explain to him in writing the reason for the blockage were not successful.\n\nIn a petition submitted to the Assistant Inspector General of Police, Zone 1, Kano State on August 7, 2020, Dr. Igbaekemen explained that on June 24, 2020, he was compelled by three staff of the FCMB including Jimoh Mutiu, Waheed Olabode and Mamu Mohammed to write and they approved his request for palliatives of 3% of his monthly salaries.\n\nHe said he received the 3% of his salaries until the management of the academy (the Nigeria Police Academy) released his salaries arrears, but when he went to FCMB branch in Abuja in anticipation of the approved palliatives of 3%, the payment failed. When he called Mr. Jimoh, he said that they had reneged from the initial palliatives arrangement and that the bank requested for restructuring of the loan.\n\nDr. Igbaekemen said that while he was processing the restructuring with Mr. Jimoh, Mohammed, Waheed and FCMB Abuja branch, \u201cFCMB unlawfully withdrew all the salaries in my account, N500,000 without adherence to CBN guidelines and extant rules on salaries loan.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, Jimoh confirmed that they are restructuring the loan for three years as against the initial five years the salaries loan lasted till July 2019.\n\nHe fulfilled the restructuring requirements on August 4, 2020, but he did not have access to his bank account and the money in the account.\n\n\u201cTill date, I do not have access to my bank account\u2026. as a result of the observed conspiracy between the above named FCMB staff and POLAC leadership.\u201d\n\nDr. Igbaekemen said he has also petitioned the principal officers of the academy and the Bank \u201cfor Criminal Breach of Trust, Cheating, Deceit, Abuse of powers and unlawful acts by the staff of the bank, in conspiracy with the management of the Nigeria Police Academy, Wudil.\u201d\n\nHe said he reported the matter to the Director, Consumer Protection Unit of the CBN in a letter dated 24th February, 2022 and also sent a reminder letter dated 4th April, 2022. He also wrote to the head of Collection and Recovery Unit of the FCMB in a letter dated 26th January, 2022.\n\nHe alleged that the FCMB staff in Kano in his explanation had, among other things, said that CBN formally stopped the loan deductions from August 2021 but they decided to engaged in manual deductions in order not reflect in CBN platform and his personal bank account alerts.\n\n\u201cThey initially stopped to cover the fraud, hence they placed non indebtedness on my bank account account and it reflected in all the branches nationwide and FCMB marketers began to call me for a fresh loan.\n\n\u201cI went to FCMB Bank in Central Business District, Abuja to collect and I filled non-indebtedness form on January 11, 2022 but this bank staff failed to document his explanation in writing for further interrogation and he declined same so it could not be used as evidence.\u201d\n\nHe also reported the issue to the FCMB Managing Director through the Manager of Central Business District, Abuja in a letter dated January 10, 2022.\n\nDr. Igbaekemen said that he formally wrote to the Deputy Inspector General of Police, in a letter dated 22nd July 2021, where he reported that investigation into the gross misconduct with respect to his salary account was compromised.\n\nHowever, till date, \u201cthe illegality still continues without POLAC management intervention in the issue.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that despite all the efforts he made, no attempt has been made by the authorities of the FCMB to resolve the issue which, according to him, has caused him a lot of financial discomfort.\n\nHowever, when SaharaReporters contacted Mr. Jimoh of the FCMB about Dr. Igbaekemen\u2019s complaints, he said that the matter is complicated.\n\n\u201cHe had a loan and the loan was bad because it was illegally suspended by the POLAC and it was reinstated.

          "text": "The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), through its harmonisation exercise, has allegedly denied some officers promotion for about 20 years, while some of their colleagues recruited much later after have been promoted up to two times.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the affected officers include CNA conversion course 1/2008 which comprised NA courses 7/94, 8/96, 9/97 and 10/98, who were already on CNA rank earlier before January 2004; with effective dates of promotion to ASNII dating back to 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 for NA courses 7/94, 8/96, 9/97 and 10/98 respectively.\n\nHowever, sources in the agency told SaharaReporters that while the affected officers\u2019 promotions have been stagnated for more than 15 years, those employed in \u201c2011, mostly candidates of political office holders, enjoyed double promotions ahead and above their older colleagues whom they met on the job and were stagnated on level 7 and below\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe sources said that their promotions have been cumulatively stagnated for about 10 to 20 years which translates to a loss of three to six ranks.\n\n\n\nWhile admitting that they were promoted by one rank in the 2021 harmonisation exercise, one of the sources, however, pointed out that the promotion still kept them below their juniors who have received multiple promotions backdated accordingly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe most recent NA course who were recruited as SNAs 13 to 17 years after our recruitment, and 4 to 7 years after our ideal ASN II effective dates, were promoted ahead of us going by their effective dates,\u201d one of the sources said.\n\n\n\nHe explained that the stagnation of their careers and distortion of their seniority in the service predates 2014, adding that \u201cby 2014, some of us were already stagnated for up to 10 years\u201d.\n\n\n\nExplaining the process of conversion and how their promotion has been lopsidedly stagnated, another source said, \u201cThe criteria for successful conversion to the superintendent cadre is that the officer should have additional qualifications and attend mandatory conversion course.\n\n\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the requirement of additional qualifications was waived for conversion courses 1 and 2 in favour of years of service and attainment of 50% cut-off mark as against 40% in normal promotion examinations.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have served and kept fate with the agency in deprivation, and denied most of our benefits for 23 to 27 years, giving our youths, bearing the scars, dangers of the lowest level of servitude while aligning our aspirations to the vision of the agency.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe further explained that against its standard of conducting promotion examinations yearly, NDLEA did not conduct the examinations in 2006 and 2007, thereby denying CNAs who had resit the opportunity of promotion to ASN II with 2005 and 2006 effective dates their due opportunity to be promoted.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, all CNAs with earlier or 2004 effective dates were made to go through conversion course 1/2008 with no cognizance of the fact that some older NA courses 7/94 and 8/96 were on re-sit. This, the source, said is in contradiction to the normal promotion condition that those on re-sit need only retake their papers to be promoted.\n\nThe imposition of the conversion course on these unprepared sets of officers made them unsuccessful in conversion course 1, it was learnt.\n\n\n\nAlso, though the NDLEA Scheme of Service provides that the conversion course should be yearly, one of the sources said it was not conducted in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, and \u201cthis also denied the unsuccessful candidates of conversion course 1, the opportunity of getting back on track with our career progression\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe negative impact was heightened thus,\u201d the source said.\n\n\n\nBy 2014 when they were eventually promoted to ASN II by virtue of CNA conversion course 2013; their promotion which would have been with effective dates of 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 were still on CNA for 10, 9, 8, and 7 years after.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe cumulative effect is loss of up to three ranks, meaning that as at 2013/2014 promotions, we would have been on the ranks of CSN, SN and DSN respectively. Though the effective dates of promotion of successful candidates of CNA conversion course 1 were backdated appropriately, that of CNA course 2/2013 converted officers were not backdated,\u201d the source continued.\n\n\n\nHe lamented that the negligence has affected them both financially and psychologically, especially as many of them draw closer to their retirement age.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cAs our juniors are being promoted far ahead of us, we struggle daily with low self-esteem, ridicule, disgrace, indiscipline and shattered self-confidence. Going by our years of service and staring retirement in the face, the bleakness of our service life aspirations confronts us daily. The instances of career stagnation have excluded us from any serious service responsibility like mid-level command responsibilities.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmongst other things, one of the sources on behalf of the affected officers appealed to the Chairman/Chief Executive of the NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Mohammed Buba Marwa (Rtd), to place them on their ideal ranks of CSN and ACN and DCN, as this will help them rectify the distorted seniority issues.\n\n\n\nHe also appealed that their effective dates of promotions should reflect their ideal career progression save for the loss of seniority through re-sit, and in the event of challenges of federal character and vacancy in their placement, harmonization or promotion to ACN and above, the CSN effective date should reflect their ideal career progression.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, they want the date of their first appointment and subsequent years of service to be used to place them accordingly, while individual service records are sought and used to place them properly with the correct effective dates according to individual peculiarities.\n\n\n\nHe also appealed that in line with the NDLEA conditions of service 2019, the issue of additional qualifications should not affect the career progression of converted officers in the area of pegging, considering the fact that it was waived in favour of higher cut-off marks.",

          "text": "Bianca Ojukwu, a former ambassador and widow of Chukwuemeka Ojukwu, has narrated her 2009 encounter with Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP).\n\nIn a post on her Facebook page on Thursday, Bianca was responding to a recent comment by Ejike Mbaka, spiritual director of Adoration Ministries, Enugu, who had described Obi as a stingy person.\n\nSpeaking on the reference to the LP candidate, the former ambassador said Obi\u2019s prudence with resources is something that Nigeria needs for a more \u201chumane\u201d society.\n\nAccording to her, during the encounter with Obi in 2009, the balance of $3,800 which he could have spent on a suit for an international event was offered instead to charity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSometime in 2009, \u2018Mr\u2019 (as he preferred to be addressed) Peter Obi, Governor of Anambra State at the time, visited Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu and myself at Dallas, Texas. He came to deliver a get well message from Dr Goodluck Jonathan and was billed to attend a black tie event at the Dallas Marriot,\u201d Bianca wrote.\n\n\u201cCuriously, he flew into Dallas airport with one small carry-on luggage which he insisted on wheeling around himself, and on getting to our residence, requested to freshen up. He opened his carry-on, filled with files and paperwork and a few toiletries and an extra shirt, when the Ikemba and I asked if he was expecting another item of luggage, and he said no.\n\n\u201c\u2018Then, what will you be wearing to the event tonight?\u2019, we inquired. It was at that point that it struck him that he couldn\u2019t show up in his casuals at such a ceremony.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI insisted on taking him to the luxury men\u2019s emporium at Nieman Marcus to buy a smart black suit. When we got there, he was busy doing the Dollar to Naira currency conversions. The suit that was a perfect match for him was a dapper Tom Ford suit with a price tag of 3,985 dollars plus tax. He did the calculations and told me \u2018Do you know how many students this amount of money can train in Nigeria?\u2019 I reminded him that he was the governor as well as the special guest, and for the caliber of guests expected at that evening\u2019s occasion, including the mayor, senators and captains of conglomerates amongst others, he needed to be dressed in top form.\n\n\u201cTo cut the story short, he refused to pay what he termed \u2018that outrageous price\u2019 for the Tom Ford suit and that was how we ended up at Steinmart where he agreed to pay a more acceptable price of 220 dollars, tax inclusive, for a basic men\u2019s suit which he was happy to wear to that evening\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cWhat struck me, was that as we were on the way to the airport to see him off for his return flight back to Nigeria, he reached for his pocket where he brought out an envelope of crisp hundred dollar bills. The amount in the envelope was 3,800 dollars.\n\n\u201cHe said \u2018Anyanwu, this is the balance of the money I would have paid for the \u2018Ford\u2019 suit. If the label on the suit was \u2018Peter Obi\u2019, I am wondering if anybody in America will pay that amount for it. I have deducted the amount we paid for that suit we eventually bought. Please use this balance for your Charity foundation to help those in actual need. I trust you will do so\u2019. We all laughed heartily. Vintage Peter Obi!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe eventual beneficiaries of that largesse were Madam Theresa Agbo, a yam seller who became penniless and displaced when her yam shed was gutted by fire, Callistus Egbe who was bedridden due to illness, and needed help with the school fees of his young children, and the Mgbemena family of six who were thrown out of their one room accommodation (which we subsequently doubled to two rooms) because their breadwinner fell upon hard times and could no longer afford the rent.\n\n\u201cIn Life, You either live by your creed or you desecrate the mould by which the Almighty created you. Any progressive nation measures an individual by his values, not his vaults.\n\n\u201cIf this way of life is what is derided as \u2018stinginess\u2019 on the part of Peter Obi, then we all need to adopt this mould for a more sustainable and more humane environment.\u201d",

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: How Funfere Koroye designed his way from China to the UK",
          "text": "Today\u2019s digital nomad is a design engineer who has worked in 4 continents: Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. After designing tech-enabled devices and shoes for Tecno, AFA Sports, and Thando\u2019s, Funfere Koroye now lives in the UK where he is an Ambassador for TechNation and CEO of hardware and innovation startup Nupay Technologies (Nupay Tech)\n\nIn an hour-long conversation on Google Meet, Koroye shares with TechCabal how he\u2019s ended up earning \u00a35,000 per project working as a freelance hardware engineer.\n\nFirst, what exactly does a design engineer do? I\u2019ve heard of graphics designers, UI/UX designers, and even art directors. Design engineering is a first for me.\n\nIt\u2019s exactly what it sounds like: we design the hardware of things; how they look, how they feel, and the materials used. We\u2019ll direct the look and feel of the things you use, from laptops and phones to shoes and even toys.\n\nSo you guys are basically architects, but for everyday objects. How does one become a design engineer?\n\nWith a design engineering degree, you\u2019re taught a facet of things. I should say that design engineering, as a degree, is not specific to one industry. You have to specify what industry you prefer while doing the course. Typically, in America where I studied, there are 4 industries for design engineers: furniture, footwear, transportation, and the tech industry. But within the Big 4, there are subsets like jewellery, bags, even boats. Regardless of the industry you specialise in, it all starts on pen and paper, as with any design work, whether UI/UX engineering or hardware engineering. You draw out the idea that you want to create, make a 3D version of that design, and a prototype of the 3D design is created at the factory. Most times, the prototype is a mould that\u2019s used to create the pattern of hardware. Companies everywhere use design engineers. Nike and Adidas both hire design engineers and product designers to help them make their shoes. The funny thing is that the UI/UX folks have stolen product design from us; design engineers are the true owners of the term product design.\n\nIs design engineering what you\u2019ve always wanted to do though? Or is it something you stumbled upon?\n\nYes! I\u2019ve always dreamed of being an inventor. When I decided on becoming an inventor, there weren\u2019t really any options in Nigeria to help me achieve that goal so I had to look elsewhere. I looked at the US, I looked at Europe, the UK, and then finally settled on San Francisco. I was 17, in 2007, when I first made that journey, so that in itself was a bit crazy because I had never travelled out of Nigeria prior to that point. And, you know, that was the beginning for me.\n\nSo what was your first professional experience as a design engineer like?\n\nMy first real professional experience had me move all the way to China to intern for a shoe manufacturing company, and I loved it. In my last year in school in the US, I transferred to my college\u2019s campus in China, and I fell in love with the country. There, I interned as a junior designer for a shoe company. Then after I graduated in 2012, I left the US and moved to Italy for a bit to work as a shoemaking apprentice which is also a part of design engineering. So with my first professional experiences, I dabbled a bit in a few aspects of design engineering.\n\nWow, the US, Italy and China in your early career. How long were you in these countries?\n\nIn the US, I was there for 5 years, but I had to leave once my student visa expired. I lived in Italy for a year, and in China, I\u2019d say a total of 4 years. My first year in China was as a transfer student. Then, after I left Italy, I moved back to China to work for the same shoe company I had interned with. During that period [I was] shuffling between China and Nigeria. I finally had to leave China in 2016.\n\nOh, why did you leave? Sounds like you loved China.\n\nIt was difficult to get residence in China. China\u2019s work and business visas only grant you 30 days\u2019 residence, and after it expires, you have to go back to your country and reapply. You and your employer can apply for a temporary residence permit, but that often takes 6 weeks to process and even then is not a sure thing. Around the time I was there, the Chinese government also had strict rules, something to do with Nigerians flouting the rules, so it was even difficult to get Chinese employers to sponsor you. So after shuffling for a few years, my re-entry request was declined and I found myself back in Nigeria in 2016.\n\nThat must have been hard, moving back to Nigeria full-time right after your career had taken off.\n\nNot really. Like I said, I was already shuffling between Nigeria and China so it wasn\u2019t really hard for me to adapt. When I got back, I was applying for jobs in the most random of places. But I got an email one day from Tecno Mobile and they wanted me to join their design lab as a phone developer and industrial designer. The job gave me enough time to freelance in my role. That\u2019s actually what led me to start specialising in one area of design engineering\u2014tech-enabled handheld devices. So yeah, leaving China was sad but it put me on the path I am now which has seen me even found my own tech startup.\n\nAnd how was the money through all this? How much does a design engineer earn?\n\nIt\u2019s different for everybody, of course. When I was at Tecno, I was earning about \u20a6400,000 (~ $1,500) a month and this was in 2016, I believe, and I was 26 at the time. And it wasn\u2019t exactly ideal because I initially asked for \u20a6800,000 ($3,000) a month, but they wouldn\u2019t agree. After I left Tecno, I worked in other places where I was earning about \u20a6800,000\u2013\u20a61 million ($3,800) a month. This continued right up until the pandemic when I moved to the UK. For freelance projects though, it depends on how much input they need for me, but it\u2019s at least \u00a35,000 per project. I\u2019ve earned as high as \u00a320,000 for a project.\n\nOh, so your taste for Nigeria didn\u2019t last very long then. What changed?\n\nCOVID came, basically. I\u2019d visited the UK before but I never really saw myself living there. But around the time the pandemic was winding down, I decided to build a hardware product for the LPG industry called Nugas (Nupe energy). Sadly, it didn\u2019t take off but we did get some funding and traction. So it just dawned on me that I needed to leave Nigeria and get a different perspective on building products.\n\nHow did that pan out?\n\nShort version, I\u2019m now a Visa Ambassador for TechNation, the company that endorses visas for UK\u2019s Global Talent Visa in the digital technology industry. So I\u2019d say it really worked out well.\n\nAnd the long story?\n\nI had to think about how I could get into the tech space in London. That\u2019s how I came across the Global Talent Visa and TechNation which is open to tech people with no less than 5 years of tech experience who can add to the UK economy. The great thing about this is that there are 2 categories, Exceptional Talent, for recognised leaders, and Exceptional Promise, for emerging leaders. And the requirements were quite minimal: I needed a stellar CV, a reference for good work, and my name in the press. And you know the best part?\n\nAirport food?\n\nErr, no. The best part about the Visa was that I wouldn\u2019t need to stay in the UK for the duration of the Visa. The Global Talent Visa only requires you to stay in the UK for 6 months out of every working year you\u2019ve applied for, and you can apply for up to 5 years. It means that I have 6 months to explore other countries, and do more things.\n\nSo you\u2019re basically the poster boy for digital nomads. What\u2019s been your favourite part of it?\n\nI\u2019ve worked in 5 countries now, but I\u2019ve visited almost 20. To date and project, my favourite has to be my time freelancing for a solar hardware solar company in Tanzania called Jaza Energy. They DMed on LinkedIn and said they were looking to create the Tesla battery pack for Africa. So they flew me out to Zanzibar where I lived for a couple of months, all expenses paid. I think that\u2019s one of the beautiful parts of being a digital nomad; your profile is out there on the internet, you\u2019re not just in Nigeria, or wherever you are; you have access to the whole world. As long as somebody is willing to give you work somewhere. You literally are a citizen of the world, you know? I\u2019ll say Zanzibar is my favourite place I\u2019ve been to. But China is my favourite place I\u2019ve lived in.\n\nAs an ambassador for TechNation, I also get to help other people experience this. It\u2019s a non-monetary role but my job is basically to create awareness about the Visa and help applicants craft their applications.\n\nWhat\u2019s your least favourite part?\n\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s been settling somewhere legally. As Nigerians, we often use studying to gain entry and residence in different countries. Lately, that has become more difficult. Even today, people have a hard time settling even after doing STEM degrees.\n\nFinding a career path has also been tricky because no matter what you study, you still have to sort of pick where you want to see yourself within that industry, especially in the tech industry.\n\nBut it seems like you\u2019ve found a trajectory that works for you. Are there any fears you have?\n\nLike everyone else, I\u2019m afraid of failure. What if I don\u2019t live up to this, this whole tech bro thing, you know? I\u2019ve got a number of eyes on me, and people who often reach out to say they want to do what I do. But I\u2019m still afraid of failing, which is normal.\n\nEverybody in the tech industry knows that in order to succeed, you have to fail a few times. We don\u2019t discuss it enough but that fear is there in all of us.\n\n* Dollar rate is equivalent to Nigeria\u2019s exchange rate in 2016.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to share your digital nomad story, please reach out to me at timi@bigcabal.com.\n\nEnjoyed this article?

          "text": "12 million.\n\nThat\u2019s the estimated number of motor vehicle drivers that Gozem, a Francophone Africa-focused super app, says operate in informal markets across West and Central Africa. But there\u2019s a problem: these drivers do not have access to traditional banks or micro-finance institutions to finance their vehicles. Instead, they rely on money lenders that charge ridiculous interest rates\u2014some are as high as 70% annually.\n\nGozem, which provides a suite of mobility, e-commerce, and financial services to drivers, retailers, and other consumers, announced on Friday that it has partnered with the International Financial Commission (IFC) to solve these headaches for drivers.\n\nIFC has dedicated a $10 million investment into Gozem\u2019s vehicle financing project. This investment will enable Gozem to provide access to affordable vehicle financing in Togo and Benin, its operating markets.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThis deal comes about 6 months after Gozem closed a $5 million funding and 14 months after it started its vehicle financing program. The company said it has already helped more than 2,000 drivers acquire vehicles with affordable financing. This new partnership will finance new vehicles for 6,000 more drivers.\n\n\u201cMotor vehincle drivers in West and Central Africa will need access to $3 billion dollars of credit facilities annually to finance their vehicles and we are excited that IFC is placing their trust in Gozem to be at the forefront of providing affordable financing solutions to these underserved communities,\u201d Gregory Costamagna, co-founder and co-CEO of Gozem, said in a statement.\n\nUnlike banks that require credit history, asset collateral, or guarantors before issuing loans, or third-party lenders who charge cut-throat interest rates that are only increasing, Gozem simply uses drivers\u2019 data already available on its platform. The company provides this service by leveraging what Costamagna called its \u201csophisticated\u201d KYC process, financial and behavioural data, like the number of trips completed using its app\u2014which can be accessed in a matter of minutes\u2014to calculate drivers\u2019 credit worthiness. This alleviates drivers from keeping track of their bank statements and records; simply by using the app to find riders and gigs, Gozem knows how much they earn and how long they are likely to take to make their payments.\n\nGozem said in a statement sent to TechCabal that for the next year, they will also work with the IFC to test electric bikes in motovehicle operating conditions and \u201cbuild a green battery-swapping station network in Togo and Benin to demonstrate electric bikes can save drivers money.\u201d\n\nGozem\u2019s Raphael Dana, Costamagna\u2019s counterpart as co-founder and co-CEO told TechCabal over the phone that IFC is starting a pilot investment to test the impact and scalability of this model and will double down based on the result of the pilot.\n\nHe added that this partnership also factors in electric vehicles (EV). \u201cWe have set aside 10% of the investment for our EV pilot phase. There\u2019s a dedicated team working on our EV ambition and we need to ensure that the bikes, battery swapping, economic units, etc. work at scale,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s statement, the project will \u201cvalidate electric bikes and that their adoption at scale will not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly, but it will also help drivers save money through lower energy and maintenance costs.\u201d\n\n\u201cElectric vehicles have the power to said Aliou Maiga, IFC\u2019s Regional Director for West and Central Africa, emphasised that EVs have the potential to \u201ctransform the moto-taxi market in West and Central Africa by lowering carbon emissions and lowering operating costs for drivers.\u201d She said that by partnering with Gozem, together they could \u201cincrease affordable and green financing solutions for moto-taxi drivers to shift to electric bikes.\n\n\u201cWe hope IFC\u2019s investment for these underserved communities will encourage other investors and accelerate the reduction of poverty and greenhouse gasses emissions in these markets,\u201d she added.\n\nThere\u2019s been a significant uptick in access financing initiatives lately. Last year, Asaak went into a partnership with Untapped Global to finance 2,000 bikes in Uganda\u2014both EV and fossil-fuel vehicles. Untapped Global had also entered a similar partnership with South African Flexclub.\n\nLooks like Gozem is gearing up for some big funding. In March, Dana told Africa Report that the company was seeking an $80m Series B\u2014$50 million in equity, $20m in debt, and a $10 million pre-series B\u2014fundraising as it prepares to expand to new markets like Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Senegal.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",
          "summary": "At our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup.\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\nYou need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that.\nA better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design.",

The plan is that, when you have the pre-germinated nuts, we plant it and nurse it for three months. So, when it\u2019s three months, we will now transfer to the nursery in a bigger bag.\n\nTeam Lead of the Edo State Oil Palm Programme (ESOPP), Mr. Churchill Oboh, said Saro Oil Palm Limited has recorded impressive progress with the project\u2019s implementation in Evboesi community, calling on other communities to urgently key into the industrialization drive of the state government so as not to be left behind.\n\n\u201cWhen we started our engagements with communities to cooperate with the investors, some community leaders refused to cooperate with the investors. But Evboesi is a success story because the leaders saw well ahead of time that Governor Obaseki means well for Edo people. I urge such leaders to cooperate with the government and investors to transform all the communities in the State,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ohenosa of Evboesi, Chief Billy Akongie, said \u201cObaseki is our son, we are pleased with what Saro is doing in Evboesi because we had had situations in the past where previous governments brought investors and the investors did not deliver the projects.\n\nHe added: \u201cThey will go and buy project vehicles and brand them and after a while, the contractors will disappear, and that will be the end of the project. But with Obaseki as governor, the story is different. He promised he would develop Orhionmwon local government area when he was campaigning for re-election and he brought Saro to partner with us on this project.\n\n\u201cWe are pleasantly surprised at what Saro is doing in Evboesi; our youths have been gainfully employed on their farm and we are very happy about the 500 KVA transformer that Saro Oil Palm gave to us. They have delivered all the things we requested from them and Saro and our people are partners on this project that will cater for our children and grandchildren.

          "text": "Sometime in 2009, \u2018Mr\u2019 (as he preferred to be addressed) Peter Obi, governor Of Anambra State at the time, visited Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu and myself at Dallas, Texas. He came to deliver a get well message from Dr Goodluck Jonathan and was billed to attend a black tie event at the Dallas Marriot. Curiously, he flew into Dallas airport with one small carry on luggage, which he insisted on wheeling around himself, and on getting to our residence requested to freshen up. He opened his carry on, filled with files and paperwork and a few toiletries and an extra shirt, and when the Ikemba and I asked if he was expecting another item of luggage, he said no.\n\n\u2018Then, what will you be wearing to the event tonight?\u2019, we inquired. It was at that point that it struck him that he couldn\u2019t show up in his casuals at such a ceremony.\n\nI insisted on taking him to the luxury men\u2019s emporium at Nieman Marcus to buy a smart black suit. When we got there, he was busy doing the dollar to naira currency conversions. The suit that was a perfect match for him was a dapper Tom Ford suit with a price tag of $3,985 plus tax. He did the calculations and told me, \u2018Do you know how many students this amount of money can train in Nigeria?\u2019 I reminded him that he was the governor, as well as the special guest, and for the calibre of guests expected at that evening\u2019s occasion, including the mayor, senators and captains of conglomerates, amongst others, he needed to be dressed in top form.\n\nTo cut the story short, he refused to pay what he termed \u2019that outrageous price\u2019 for the Tom Ford suit and that was how we ended up at Steinmart, where he agreed to pay a more acceptable price of $220, tax inclusive, for a basic men\u2019s suit, which he was happy to wear to that evening\u2019s event.\n\nWhat struck me was that as we were on the way to the airport to see him off for his return flight back to Nigeria, he reached for his pocket where he brought out an envelope of crisp hundred dollar bills. The amount in the envelope was $3,800.\n\nHe said \u2018Anyanwu, this is the balance of the money I would have paid for the \u2018Ford\u2019 suit. If the label on the suit was \u2018Peter Obi\u2019, I am wondering if anybody in America will pay that amount for it. I have deducted the amount we paid for that suit we eventually bought. Please use this balance for your Charity foundation to help those in actual need. I trust you will do so\u2019. We all laughed heartily. Vintage Peter Obi!\n\nThe eventual beneficiaries of that largese were Madam Theresa Agbo, a yam seller who became penniless and displaced when her yam shed was gutted by fire; Callistus Egbe, who was bedridden due to illness, and needed help with the school fees of his young children; and the Mgbemena family of six, who were thrown out of their one room accommodation (which we subsequently doubled to two rooms) because their breadwinner fell upon hard times and could no longer afford the rent.\n\nIn life, you either live by your creed or you desecrate the mould by which the Almighty created you. Any progressive nation measures an individual by his values, not his vaults.\n\nIf this way of life is what is derided as \u2018stinginess\u2019 on the part of Peter Obi, then we all need to adopt this mould for a more sustainable and more humane environment.\n\nBianca Odumegwu Ojukwu, widow of Dim Chukwuemka Odumegwu Ojukwu, shared this write up on her Facebook page",

Just between 1999 and now, I have served Ogun State for 15 years of my lifetime.\n\n\u201cLet anybody that has done that come out, I am not talking of our referred fathers. I accept that there are so many giants that came before me, we stood on their shoulders and we are still standing on their shoulders, but the truth must be told and we must say it.\n\n\u201cSince 1999, Ibikunle Amosun has paid his dues in Ogun State and I am still paying it. Put your mind at rest, we are APC, APC is ours.\u201d\n\nIt would be recalled that Amosun and other presidential aspirants from the South including the Governor of Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi and former speaker of the House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole, stepped down for Tinubu at the APC convention held in Abuja on June 8.",

          "text": "The Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has approved July 1 for power generating companies (GenCos) to reach 5GW of electricity generation.\n\nEngr. Sanusi Garba, NERC chairman disclosed this in a statement to Journalists in Lagos on Wednesday.\n\nEngr. Garba noted that the entire value chain of the power sector \u2013 Generation, Transmission and Distribution Companies of Nigeria has committed to signing a contract to deliver 5000MW of energy to electricity consumers.\n\nHe stated, \u201cthis is the first time this kind of contract will occur among all parties. In the past, there have been complaints of lack of gas from generation companies, Discos complain of unpaid tariffs, and then the TCN would say also they transmit whatever they get.\n\n\u201cBut now, the entire value chain has committed to signing contracts to meet the power needs of electricity consumers. GenCos will sign contracts with gas producers to buy gas to produce. We have also involved gas suppliers who are committed to making gas available. Under the contract, DisCOs are not allowed to buy less than 5000MW, and TCN has also said they can transmit at least 5000 megawatts. So this time around, there will not be a flop by any party.\u201d\n\nGarba said the DisCos would this time commit to making funds available for GenCos to pay for gas. On plans put in place to ensure compliance, Garba noted that there would be stringent penalties for non-compliance. \u201c Whoever does not meet up with their part of the contracts will be fined\u201d, he said.\n\nThe NERC chairman added that the proposed contracts already have the support of the Federal Government and the Central Bank of Nigeria. He listed major reasons for the recent grid collapses as vandalism of gas pipelines and attacks on transmission towers by vandals. On what the commission is further doing to stabilise the power grid, he said the Federal government was planning to invest in the national grid through capital expenditure to ensure stability",

          "text": "Barely 24 hours to the deadline issued by the Independent National Electoral Commission, the bid to get a running mate for presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has been narrowed down to the North East and North West.\n\nWhile Tinubu and the governing party may likely unveil the party\u2019s vice presidential candidate today, it was gathered that as of last night, interested members from the two geopolitical zones, including state governors, were still engaged in intense lobbying to become running mate to the APC standard bearer.\n\nThis is even as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will screen its vice presidential candidate today.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere were also feelers that the APC may have favoured the North East zone to produce Tinubu\u2019s running mate.\n\nA presidency source told this paper that President Muhammadu Buhari and Tinubu yesterday met behind closed doors to conclude on who emerges as running mate to the former Lagos State governor.\n\nLEADERSHIP had reported yesterday that while Tinubu holds the ace in respect of the choice of his running mate for the 2023 presidential election, he has to factor in the position of the governing party, which is to take into considerations all the indices that would promote fairness and unity of the country in his choice of a running mate.\n\nImo State governor, Hope Uzodimma, had told State House correspondents after meeting with President Buhari that the decision of a running mate lies with Tinubu.\n\nSome of party members scrambling for the VP position in the North West and North East are Kaduna State governor, Nasir El-Rufai; his Kano and Kebbi counterparts, Abdullahi Ganduje; Jigawa State governor, Mohammed Badaru Abubakar and Atiku Bagudu.\n\nOthers are secretary to government of the federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha; former Borno State governor, Ibrahim Shettima; former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara; former secretary to government of the federation (SGF), Babachir Lawal, and a new entrant, Dr. Ibrahim Bello Dauda.\n\nDauda, a former secretary of the Buhari Support Group (BSG) and an ally of the president during the All Nigerian People\u2019s Party (ANPP) era, is said to also be in the mix since he is from Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) block.\n\nDauda, a management consultant from Borno State, is said to have the support of party chieftains, especially the CPC bloc since the New PDP and the ACN have taken the National Chairman and Presidential ticket respectively.\n\nPlateau State governor, Simon Lalong, from the North Central is among those being considered for the VP slot.\n\nThere are also unconfirmed reports that the leadership of the APC may have settled for Senator Binta Masi Garba, a former senator as running mate to Tinubu.\n\nShe is from the North East and also a Christian who has won elections in Kaduna State as well as Adamawa State.\n\nSenator Garba who was on Channels Television (Politics Today) last night, made a strong case for a female vice president, saying she is ready and qualified to be the running mate to Tinubu.\n\nShe noted that it has been her ambition to become the vice president of the country and if the time is now she is ready to do the job, even as she said the APC should give the ticket to a woman, just as she is well ready to be the woman.\n\nIf she gets the slot to run with Tinubu in the general election and APC goes ahead to win the election, Binta would become the very first woman in Nigeria to clinch that position.\n\nTinubu, while reacting to rumours of picking a Muslim as his running mate, had hinted at picking a Northern Christian as his running mate.\n\nAddressing journalists at the APC governorship rally in Ekiti State, Tinubu dispelled rumours of a Muslim-Muslim ticket, saying those spreading the rumours carriers are undemocratic elements that are already threatened by his impending victory in the coming presidential election.\n\n\u201cThe VP slot belongs to the Northeastern region and particularly the Christians, but consultations are yet ongoing as to who will be decided,\u201d he declared.\n\nTinubu assured Nigerians that no group, institution or person can impose a running mate on him.\n\nAPC Youths Rally Support For Boss Mustapha\n\nAlso, the APC Consolidated Network (APCCN) yesterday made a case for the secretary to the government of the federation, Boss Mustapha, to clinch the party\u2019s vice president slot.\n\nThe group, in a communiqu\u00e9 issued and signed by its national coordinator,\n\nBarr Mahmud Afegbua, and secretary general, Engr Sylvia Onu, after the executive meeting in Abuja, argued that Mustapha\u2019s antecedents singled him out among others.\n\nTinubu\u2019s Deftness In Politics Won Him APC Presidential Ticket \u2013 Bamisile\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 stated that the choice of Mustapha, a devoted Christian, as clamoured by APC stakeholders would further boost the candidature of the party\u2019s front-liner, Tinubu, and give the ruling party a higher leverage in the polls.\n\n\u201cWe know the person of Boss Mustapha over the years; we are also abreast of his capabilities and political acceptability across the borders. He championed the Presidential Task Force on Covid-19 and the exercise was a huge success. We also commended him for always playing a supportive role in the policies of the Federal Government. His emergence will give APC an edge of emerging victorious in the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the opposition PDP will today screen its vice presidential candidates.\n\nThe PDP leadership yesterday set up an advisory committee to screen its vice presidential candidates.\n\nThe committee is led by former minister of external affairs, High Chief Tom Ikimi.\n\nThe committee was set up barely a day after Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, was picked by some party leaders as the running mate to former Vice President Atiku Abubakar who emerged the party\u2019s presidential candidate in May.\n\nAlthough the position has not been made official, sources at the meeting told LEADERSHIP that Wike emerged a preferred candidate of the majority of the stakeholders at the meeting which was held on Tuesday as the party\u2019s national secretariat.\n\nHowever, a statement by the national publicity secretary of PDP, Hon Debo Ologunagba, noted: \u201cPursuant to Part VI, Paragraph 14 of the Electoral Guidelines of our great Party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the National Working Committee (NWC) has approved the nomination of the following Party members to serve on the Vice Presidential Candidate Screening Committee for the screening/verifying of the nominated Vice Presidential Candidate of our Party for the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nThe members of the Committee are High Chief Tom Ikimi \u2013 Chairman; H.E. Capt. Idris I. Wada (rtd) \u2013 Member; Chief Osita Chidoka \u2013 Member; Rt. Hon. Binta Bello \u2013 Member; Chief Mrs. Alh. Mutiat Adedoja \u2013 Member; Hon Austin Opara \u2013 Member; Prof Aisha Madawaki \u2013 Member.\n\nOthers are Mrs Ayotunde George-Ologun \u2013 Member; Chief Mrs Chidiebelu Mofus \u2013 Member; H.E. Fidelis Tapgun \u2013 Member; Dr Akilu Indabawa- Secretary; and Mr. Sunday Omobo \u2013 administrative secretary.\n\nOlogunagba stated that the screening exercise for the candidate will hold at the party\u2019s national secretariat today.\n\nMeanwhile, a pan northern group under the auspices of Arewa Youth Awareness Forum (AYAF) has declared its support for the proposed pairing of Atiku and Wike for the election.\n\nThe group said Atiku and Wike as presidential candidate and running mate respectively will win the 2023 presidential race without stress.\n\nIn a statement yesterday signed by the group\u2019s chairman, vice-chairman and secretary-general, Mohammed Sani-Kabir, Salisu Abdurrahaman and Ben Alege respectively, the group emphasised that they pairing has the capacity to roll back poverty, insecurity, illiteracy and other indices of underdevelopment.\n\nThe statement reads in part: \u201cWe applaud the choice of Governor Wike whose numerous passionate infrastructural projects in Rivers State have been commissioned by eminent persons across the federation, including our revered Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar.\n\n\u201cIn view of deep-rooted economic, security and other challenges of nation-building that the nation faces today, one thing that is more needed than religious and ethnic sentiments is good, impactful governance characterised by mass inclusion and leadership that has capacity to move mountains.\u201d",

          "title": "Reps Move To Override Buhari On Electoral Act Amendment",
          "text": "The House of Representatives yesterday resolved to move a motion to override President Muhammadu Buhari for failing to assent to Clause 58(8) of the Electoral Act (Amendment) bill, 2022, which provides for statutory delegates.\n\nThe lawmakers representing Ethiope federal constituency of Delta State, Hon. Ben Igbakpa, at the plenary yesterday raised a constitutional point of order, citing section 58 (8) of the 1999 constitution which empowered the National Assembly to enact laws and also override the president with two-thirds majority of the members\u2019 vote.\n\nIgbakpa, who was among the lawmakers that lost out in the just concluded primaries, said there was no need for the House to fear anyone.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe, therefore, urged his colleagues to rise up, take the pen, collect signatures and override President Buhari and give Nigerians the enabling electoral law.\n\nAddressing the leadership of the House, he said: \u201cOn the 11th of May, with your colleagues, you brought all of us back from our various constituencies so that we can work on the electoral act, as amended. Graciously that was done on the 11th of May. And by 12th, this amendment was transmitted to Mr. President. Mr. President did not just ignore, he travelled out of the country on a condolence visit to Dubai and that created a lot of problems for the country. Nigerians are crying for good leadership and the leadership recruitment process starts with our primaries.\n\n\u201cYou have worked hard and that is why I took us to Section 58. We are to make laws and present them to Mr President, and where he does not sign, that same Section 58 gives us the powers to make sure that we pass that law without Mr. President\u2019s assent. There\u2019s nowhere that is said that one arm of government is subservient to the other,\u201d adding that after it tenure Nigerians will remember the House leadership for the good work it had done.\n\nHe further insisted that the legislature cannot continue to act as if it was under the executive arm of government.\n\nHe went on: \u201cThis Constitution gave us the powers just as it gave to them. We must wake up as a Parliament where we pass our laws, and we are sure we have done the right thing we should start overriding Mr. President because this is just the beginning.\u201d\n\nHe recalled that the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) Act came into being because the parliament, which the Speaker was part of, overrode President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nWhat are we afraid of? Mr. President has not committed an offence, what he has done is the rule of law and the Constitution and I believe by the time we do our own by overriding veto, we would not have committed any offence.\n\n\u201cW we will be working according to the constitution and the rule of law. This parliament must stamp their feet and tell Nigerians that we are working for them and not for the party or any individual.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the deputy minority leader, Hon. Toby Okechukwu, had said that the electoral act had been weaponised, calling for activation of relevant Constitutional powers to address the lacuna.\n\n\u201cSomething is wrong in an environment, in an institution where the two leaders of the Senate would have to cross to other parties because of inherent inclement conditions.\n\n\u201cAnything that occasions it, anything that warrants it, if it is our Electoral Act, if it is our politics, if it is the environment where we operate, we need to retool. And like you said, we got to do better work and we have to fight on. For me, it is just a battle that is lost, the war is on and we should go ahead to make sure that law is retooled, made clear. And if it requires this parliament to take action to override what has not been signed, we should be willing to do so,\u201d Okechukwu said.\n\nIn his ruling, the Speaker Gbajabiamila, who affirmed that the president was in breach of the 30 days provided to communicate his decision to withhold assent, urged Hon. Igbakpa to formally present a motion in that regard.\n\n\u201cClearly the Constitution says it is 30 days\u2019 leeway and we have gone beyond the 30 days. But the Constitution also says that it is not automatic that you override, but if you are convinced as a House that that amendment must stand.\n\n\u201cIf you are not convinced with the argument advanced by the president or in some cases \u2013 and in this case, there are no arguments advanced, then you can override. But for us to override I believe you need the required two-thirds, and it cannot be by voice votes.\n\n\u201cSo, what I will suggest is that you bring the application, the formal motion notice, perhaps tomorrow \u2013 whenever you are able to do that \u2013 and we will determine whether or not this House is ready to override or not, I think that\u2019s the proper procedure,\u201d Gbajabiamila said.",

We need to put our resources together and improve the Nigeria Police, so that what happened in Owo should not happen in other places.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Senator Istifanus Gyang (PDP, Plateau North), blamed the attack on St Francis Catholic Church, Owo, on religious extremism.\n\nHe urged religious leaders in the country to desist from inciting their followers through religious messages preached in places of worship, adding that doing otherwise poses great security threat to the country.\n\nThe Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, in his remarks, said, \u201cThis is one sad event that took place, and we are all united in grief.\n\n\u201cOne thing that is so imperative is for security agencies to continue to protect our citizens, and where we encounter breeches, the perpetrators must be fished out and then the law takes its full course.\u201d\n\nThe Senate, in its resolutions, accordingly, urged security agencies to intensify efforts to investigate the matter with the aim of bringing perpetrators to book and as well deploy drones and helicopters to monitor forests and ungoverned areas in Nigeria, to identify illegal camps of armed bandits throughout the country.\n\nThe chamber urged for collaboration amongst her various security agencies on intelligence gathering and sharing in very discreet and organised form, at local government and state levels, and nationwide.\n\nIt also commiserated with the families of the victims, the Catholic Church, the people and government of Ondo State.\n\nThe chamber also observed a minute silence in memory of the victims killed during the attack.usly create criminal offences as the document states unequivocally that any platform or internet intermediary responsible for violating its provisions will be liable to prosecution and conviction.\u201d\n\nHe argued that NITDA\u2019s misuse of the term \u201cCode of Practice\u201d to describe the document amounts to acting under false pretences to dupe Nigerians into believing that the government is seeking to protect them when its real intention is so obviously to control social media and other internet platforms by compelling them to register with the government and thereby muzzle the right to freedom of expression online.\n\nLonge contended that the document is a breach of Articles 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and Nigeria\u2019s treaty obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which gives everyone the right to freedom of expression, including the \u201cfreedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers\u2026.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe name is problematic. Although it is termed a code of practice, it is in fact not intended to provide guidance for the implementation of any specific law or regulation.\n\n\u201cRather, it creates criminal offences which are not contained in any existing law and attempt to legitimize them by a vague reference to its enabling Act and other laws, which is beyond the remit of any such administrative document.\u201d\n\nHe argued that the underlying rationale and the provisions of the document are unrealistic and unreasonable as they defy logic and common sense.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s globalised world, is it possible or realistic to expect global Internet platforms like Facebook, Twitter and others to register with the government of every country in the world where they have users and set up offices in all those countries, which is the implication of the federal government\u2019s demand?\n\n\u201cConversely, Nigeria\u2019s external broadcaster, the Voice of Nigeria, broadcasts its signal and content to dozens of countries around the world and runs a website that is accessible globally; is it registered and does it have offices in all the countries where its signals are received as Nigeria is now demanding of platforms registered in other countries?\u201d\n\nHe, however, described many of the provisions of the document as arbitrary and draconian.\n\nHe further said the requirement that platforms take down \u201cunlawful content\u201d within 24 hours after receiving a notice or complaint from any authorised government agency constitutes an attempt by the government to control content published on social media and other online platforms while bypassing the judicial process and usurping the functions of the courts which should legitimately determine what content that is illegal or unlawful.\n\nHe said, MRA therefore, rejected the \u201cCode of Practice\u201d in its totality. It called on the government to abandon it and approach the National Assembly with an appropriate bill if its genuine intention is to address legitimate issues rather than violating the rights of Nigerians and other members of the public on the pretext of protecting them from fake news and misinformation.",

          "text": "Sometime in 2009, \u2018Mr\u2019 (as he preferred to be addressed) Peter Obi, Governor Of Anambra State at the time, visited Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu and myself at Dallas, Texas. He came to deliver a get well message from Dr Goodluck Jonathan and was billed to attend a black tie event at the Dallas Marriot.\n\nCuriously, he flew into Dallas airport with one small carry on luggage which he insisted on wheeling around himself, and on getting to our residence requested to freshen up. He opened his carry on, filled with files and paperwork and a few toiletries and an extra shirt, when the Ikemba and I asked if he was expecting another item of luggage, and he said no.\n\n\u2018Then, what will you be wearing to the event tonight?\u2019, we inquired. It was at that point that it struck him that he couldn\u2019t show up in his casuals at such a ceremony.\n\nI insisted on taking him to the luxury men\u2019s emporium at Nieman Marcus to buy a smart black suit. When we got there, he was busy doing the Dollar to Naira currency conversions. The suit that was a perfect match for him was a dapper Tom Ford suit with a price tag of 3,985 dollars plus tax. He did the calculations and told me \u2018Do you know how many students this amount of money can train in Nigeria?\u2019 I reminded him that he was the governor as well as the special guest, and for the caliber of guests expected at that evening\u2019s occasion, including the mayor, senators and captains of conglomerates amongst others, he needed to be dressed in top form.\n\nTo cut the story short, he refused to pay what he termed \u2019that outrageous price\u2019 for the Tom Ford suit and that was how we ended up at Steinmart where he agreed to pay a more acceptable price of 220 dollars, tax inclusive, for a basic men\u2019s suit which he was happy to wear to that evening\u2019s event.\n\nWhat struck me, was that as we were on the way to the airport to see him off for his return flight back to Nigeria, he reached for his pocket where he brought out an envelope of crisp hundred dollar bills. The amount in the envelope was 3,800 dollars.\n\nHe said \u2018 Anyanwu, this is the balance of the money I would have paid for the \u2018Ford\u2019 suit. If the label on the suit was \u2018Peter Obi\u2019, I am wondering if anybody in America will pay that amount for it. I have deducted the amount we paid for that suit we eventually bought. Please use this balance for your Charity foundation to help those in actual need. I trust you will do so\u2019. We all laughed heartily. Vintage Peter Obi !\n\nThe eventual beneficiaries of that Largesse were Madam Theresa Agbo, a yam seller who became penniless and displaced when her yam shed was gutted by fire, Callistus Egbe who was bedridden due to illness, and needed help with the school fees of his young children, and the Mgbemena family of six who were thrown out of their one room accommodation (which we subsequently doubled to two rooms) because their breadwinner fell upon hard times and could no longer afford the rent.\n\nIn life, you either live by your creed or you desecrate the mould by which the Almighty created you. Any progressive nation measures an individual by his values, not his vaults.\n\nIf this way of life is what is derided as \u2018stinginess\u2019 on the part of Peter Obi, then we all need to adopt this mould for a more sustainable and more humane environment.\n\n-Iyom Bianca Odumegwu Ojukwu, 16 June 2022.",

          "text": "Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2023, says he chose Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa as his running mate because he has the characteristics to be President.\n\nWaziri Adamawa, who announced Okowa as his running mate on Thursday, said the Delta State Governor represents the importance of reuniting the country.\n\nThe PDP presidential candidate for 2019 further stated that unity is necessary not only to run a successful campaign, but also to give the country with the good administration it deserves.\n\nExplaining how he arrived at the decision, the former Vice President said, \u201cI held wide consultations with various stakeholders in our party including our Governors, National Working Committee, Board of Trustees, and other leaders to seek their inputs and their wisdom.\n\nHe continued \u201cIn these consultations, I made clear that my running mate would have the potential to succeed me at a moment\u2019s notice, that is, a President-in-waiting.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the person must have the qualities to be president. The person must have an appreciation of the deep rot which our country has been put into by the rudderless APC government; understands the great suffering that most of our people are going through and the urgency of relieving them of that suffering; understand the critical importance of economic growth and development to provide our young people with jobs, hope, and a pathway to wealth.\n\n\u201cThe person must appreciate the critical importance of education in the development of modern societies so we can prepare our young people to be able to compete in the increasingly competitive and globalized world.\n\n\u201cMy running mate must understand that without security, the development will be very difficult because local and foreign investors who have been scared away already, would not return to invest in our economy. Thus, my running mate will be a person who will stand by me as I confront the frightening level of insecurity in our land.\n\n\u201cToday in Nigeria, we face huge challenges which leave us little room for drama. We have to win the elections and get to work immediately. My running mate has to be ready to start working with me, from day one, in addressing our country\u2019s challenges. Nigerians will not accept anything less\u201d.\n\nHe acknowledged that though the decision was a difficult decision.\n\nAtiku said Okowa possessed all the identified qualities needed, saying \u201che personifies not only the seriousness the current moment represents for our country but also the future that our young people yearn for and deserve.\u201d\n\nHe expressed hopes that Okowa will not only add excitement to the energized ticket and campaign but will also help to bring focus, discipline and stability to our government, come 2023.\n\nIn his remarks, the 2023 presidential candidate\u2019s running mate, Okowa who thanked the party leadership for the opportunity, said Atiku has the solution to Nigeria\u2019s problems.\n\nOkowa expressed hopes that the PDP Government will begin the rebuilding process of the nation right from May 29 2023.\n\nHe said \u201cMr President-in-waiting, I must truly thank you for finding me worthy to be on this ticket. I do know that it was a very tough decision, even as you have spoken this afternoon. But I thank God that amongst my very qualified colleagues, even those more qualified than myself, I found favour and I\u2019m here today as the vice presidential candidate of the party.\n\n\u201cWhile thanking you, I do understand that it\u2019s a great work that is ahead of us. By the special grace of God, we will work hard to ensure victory for the party. There is no doubt that there is great work ahead of every one of us. The building back process is going to be collective and we\u2019re trusting that all of our team members will want to be part of that story at the end of the day.\n\n\u201cThe story which will obviously be positive and will yield positive results will require that each one of us must support our principle as we move forth in the next few months and that at the end, we will win the elections with a landslide victory\u201d.",

          "text": "Former Vice President and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential Candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has buried the seeming tension in the ranks of the party as regards his choice of running mate in the forthcoming general elections.\n\nAtiku picked the Delta State Governor, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa, ahead of the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, believed to have got the nod of the party\u2019s National Working Committee for the vice president joint ticket slot.\n\nFor many analysts, Atiku\u2019s choice might not have come as a surprise with recourse to the personalities of the two options, their antecedents and the prevailing political climate in the country as the PDP aims at regaining power at the central from the All Progressives Congress (APC) after eight years of being \u2018displaced.\u2019\n\nDespite Wike\u2019s huge influence in the party, News Direct highlights four possible remote and immediate political calculations that could have made Atiku choose Okowa over him.\n\nBuildup to presidential primary\n\nAlthough the PDP presidential primary was contested by 13 aspirants, it was obvious that either Atiku or Wike were poised to clinch the ticket. Wike was all out for the ticket and did not hesitate to use every available opportunity to convince Nigerians he deserved it more than any other aspirant, including Atiku, his main contender.\n\nHe gave Atiku a run for his money and it took last minute scheming by the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, to swing the pendulum in Atiku\u2019s side.\n\nDays to the PDP presidential primary, Wike, while addressing delegates in Oyo State, said the party ticket should not be given to any of the aspirants who defected from PDP in 2015.\n\nHe had said, \u201cSome aspirants caused disunity in the party in 2015, formed the nPDP and sold out the party\u2019s goodwill and electoral opportunities. The issue is, who are those who made PDP to lose election in 2015 that today we are suffering? Today, we are in opposition and trying to take power back.\n\n\u201cBut see what the country has been turned into. Who are those who told Nigerians that President Buhari is a saint, that President Buhari will salvage Nigeria? What is their sense of judgment? Who are those aspirants who abandoned PDP, betrayed PDP and went to support President Buhari?\u201d\n\nThough Wike didn\u2019t mention any name, Atiku and former Senate President Bukola Saraki were among aspirants who defected from PDP to APC preparatory to the 2015 elections.\n\nWike\u2019s personality\n\nAnyone who has keenly kept an eye on the trajectory of the Rivers State governor would know he\u2019s a politician who may not be comfortable with cool-headedness expected of a subordinate. The fear that Wike may be difficult to tame or render passive in Aso Rock and national politics if Atiku eventually wins the election might be a deciding factor for picking Okowa, who is known for his calm posture.\n\nOkowa\u2019s role in Atiku\u2019s emergence\n\nWhile his support for Atiku in the buildup to the presidential primary was not pronounced, many believed the Delta State governor rooted for and worked towards emergence of Atiku as the PDP presidential candidate.\n\nFormer lawmaker, Senator Shehu Sani, hinted at this on Thursday in his tweet shortly before it became known that Atiku had picked Okowa as his running mate.\n\n\u201cOkowa played a key role in the victory of Atiku at the primaries and he is a cross between the South East and the South-South.\n\n\u201cWike strongly emerged second, committed so much in sustaining the party and his ruggedness is an asset in the battle when it turns dirty. Any can be VP,\u201d Sani tweeted.\n\nAtiku-Wike cold relationship\n\nFollowing Atiku\u2019s victory at the primary, Wike promised to support the former vice president in winning the election. However, this does not necessarily erase the cold relationship between the duo which might have discouraged Atiku from choosing him for the joint ticket.\n\nWike unrepentantly backed Tambuwal against Atiku who eventually won the PDP presidential ticket in 2019. And in an interview with Channels in May, Wike defended his stance against Atiku\u2019s candidacy in 2019.\n\n\u201cI did not support Atiku for my reason that \u2018look, Atiku listen, the way your antecedents, your politics, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for them. I supported Tambuwal. But he [Atiku] won,\u201d he said.\n\nThough he consequently teamed up with Atiku during the general election which the latter lost, the relationship between them hovers delicately around the realm of what could be likened to that of cat and mouse.",

Fr. Ejike Mbaka, had on Wednesday, described Obi as a stingy man and his comments elicited harsh reactions from his supporters.\n\nIn a post on her Facebook page titled, \u2019On Peter Obi\u2019s supposed \u2018Stinginess\u2019\u2026\u2019 the matriarch, recalled when Obi, then, a governor of Anambra State, visited Texas and had refused to buy a designer suit for an event instead opting for a $220 suit.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe suit that was a perfect match for him was a dapper Tom Ford suit with a price tag of 3,985 dollars plus tax. He did the calculations and told me \u2018Do you know how many students this amount of money can train in Nigeria?\n\n\u201cTo cut the story short, he refused to pay what he termed \u2019that outrageous price\u2019 for the Tom Ford suit and that was how we ended up at Steinmart where he agreed to pay a more acceptable price of 220 dollars, tax inclusive, for a basic men\u2019s suit which he was happy to wear to that evening\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cWhat struck me, was that as we were on the way to the airport to see him off for his return flight back to Nigeria, he reached for his pocket where he brought out an envelope of crisp hundred dollar bills. The amount in the envelope was 3,800 dollars.\n\n\u201cHe said \u2018Anyanwu, this is the balance of the money I would have paid for the \u2018Ford\u2019 suit.

They include: inadequate brokerage services to policyholders, poor claims handling service, price based competition among players, lack of innovative products that meet customer\u2019s needs, concentration of operations in few locations, focus on big ticket businesses, as well as poor distribution channels and skills.\u201d\n\nHe said the theme for the retreat \u201cBusiness Strategy for Sustainability \u2013 Personal Mastery and Self Leadership\u201d couldn\u2019t have come at a better time than now that we have to look beyond all the challenges we are facing as a sector, economy, nation and the globe.\n\nNAICOM CEO enjoined the CEOs of broking firms to continually explore ways with other stakeholders to facilitate economic prosperity; ensure environmental sustainability and social development to drive long term sustainable growth in the Nigerian insurance industry for the overall lasting benefits to the society, pertinent to our national and institutional growth.\n\nHe also emphasised that the insurance industry as a business is not outside of the same pressures as businesses in other industry or sectors.\n\nThomas listed some of the initiatives of the Commission to include: reaching out to the state governments, reaching out to Agencies of government, enhancing its technology infrastructure, as well as binging the Nigerian insurance industry into the mainstream of continental and global relevance.\n\nHe reiterated NAICOM\u2019s commitment to continuous development and growth of the Nigerian insurance sector thus, always prepared to collaborate with all stakeholders in promoting and entrenching good business strategies for sustainability of the Nigerian Insurance Industry.",

Access to financial services enables prosperity and allows disadvantaged and vulnerable people to improve their lives, create wealth and reduce poverty. So, we will continue championing and executing initiatives that deepen access to affordable and sustainable financial services in our local communities to empower individuals and businesses\u201d.\n\nIn driving financial inclusion, First City Monument Bank embraced partnerships as critical success criteria. Last year, the Bank partnered with the World Savings Banks Institute (WSBI) to deepen agency banking and financial inclusion by rolling out an integrated savings account \u2013 \u2018Easy Account\u2019- to empower two million farmers by 2023. Under the first phase of the partnership, covering over 150,000 unbanked and under-banked farmers across five states, beneficiaries are provided funds and training support through agricultural agents operating under FCMB\u2019s agency banking proposition. The states are Kaduna, Kano, Nasarawa, Ogun and Oyo. In addition, FCMB also recently signed a partnership agreement with Shee-Coops, an international organisation that raises women\u2019s active participation in cooperatives around the world, to provide funding to millions of women in the next five years to pursue opportunities that improve their livelihoods.\n\nFCMB has invested in close to 10,000 agency bankers that bring financial services to the streets and doorsteps of millions of Nigerians in peri-urban and rural areas. They are currently driving the onboarding and empowering of unbanked and under-banked Nigerians.\n\nBank accounts are now being opened through agency bankers by hitherto unbanked and underbanked citizens. As a result, they now conveniently and securely make cash deposits, transfer funds, make withdrawals, obtain loans, buy airtime, and pay bills, among other financial transactions. In addition, they also have opportunities to access the Bank\u2019s Agric value chain platform (EasyClub) and microloans to boost their standard of living and grow businesses.\n\nA purpose beyond profit commercial banking institution, First City Monument Bank is a member of FCMB Group Plc, led by Ladi Balogun as Group Chief Executive.

          "text": "The presidential candidate of the People\u2019s Democratic Party, Atiku Abubakar has ended the speculation over the choice of his running mate.\n\nThe former Vice President on Thursday announced a governor of Delta State, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa as his running mate.\n\nBelow is the full text of his remark while unveiling his running mate.\n\n================================================================================\n\nRemarks by Atiku Abubakar, GCON, Former Vice President, Federal Republic of Nigeria and Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 Election, while introducing his Running Mate, at the PDP National Headquarters, Wadata Plaza, Wuse Abuja.16 June, 2022.\n\nProtocol:\n\nLet me begin by, once more, commending our great Party for organizing and concluding, arguably, the best and rancour-free Convention, which produced me as our flag-bearer for the next year\u2019s Presidential Election.\n\nOnce more, I commend my fellow aspirants in that contest. I thank them for their sportsmanship. They put up spirited fights because they cared and care for our country. I have personally gone around to thank them and to seek their cooperation for the struggle ahead.\n\nParty unity is critical not only for us to prosecute a winning campaign but also to provide good governance that our country seriously deserves and our people earnestly yearn for. The task of winning the coming elections will be a tough one and we must not take anything for granted.\n\nWith the convention behind us, we have arrived at the stage for me to pick a Running Mate because this is a joint ticket. I am very happy to announce today that I have reached a decision on that.\n\nIn arriving at the decision, I held wide consultations with various stakeholders in our party including our Governors, National Working Committee, Board of Trustees, and other leaders to seek their inputs and their wisdom.\n\nIn these consultations, I made clear that my running mate would have the potential to succeed me at a moment\u2019s notice, that is, a President-in-waiting.\n\nIn other words, the person must have the qualities to be President. The person must have an appreciation of the deep rot which our country has been put into by the rudderless APC government; understands the great suffering that most of our people are going through and the urgency of relieving them of that suffering; understands the critical importance of economic growth and development to provide our young people with jobs, hope, and a pathway to wealth.\n\nThe person must appreciate the critical importance of education in the development of modern societies so we can prepare our young people to be able to compete in the increasingly competitive and globalized world.\n\nMy running mate must understand that without security, development will be very difficult because local and foreign investors who have been scared away already, would not return to invest in our economy. Thus, my running mate will be a person who will stand by me as a I confront the frightening level of insecurity in our land.\n\nAs you know, the APC government went to sleep as huge swathes of our country\u2019s territory fell into the deadly hands of gangs of criminals, including those masquerading as freedom fighters or pastoralists, while our farmers and genuine pastoralists are unable to go about their businesses. The costs in precious human lives and properties have been enormous. My running mate must also not only symbolize the imperative of reuniting our country but also be able to work with me to achieve that objective. This is because a united Nigeria is a potentially stronger, more prosperous, and more secure country able to lead Africa and give hope to the Black race.\n\nIn addition, my Running Mate has to be someone who is not afraid to speak his mind and give honest advice, and, be by my side as I work very hard to reverse the destructive impact of the past seven years of the APC government.\n\nIn the United States of America from where we borrowed key aspects of our current Presidential system, a running mate is used to balance the ticket, complement the candidate and, after victory, assist the President with governance. Sometimes a candidate is chosen who generates a buzz and adds huge excitement to the campaign.\n\nBut today in Nigeria, we face huge challenges which leave us little room for drama. We have to win the elections and get to work immediately. My running mate has to be ready to start working with me, from day one, in addressing our country\u2019s challenges. Nigerians will not accept anything less. That is why I promised the Governors of our party that my running mate will come from among them. Our current challenges call for a government that is highly focused and disciplined.\n\nI have sought for the support, guidance, and counsel of the PDP in selecting a befitting Running Mate who meets all or most of the qualities enumerated above. The wisemen and sages of the Party, put together by our NWC, have gone fishing and brought home an enviable group of awesome politicians that surpasses these qualities. Every one of the recommended persons is a fit and proper individual to hold this office. While this makes me marvel at the bundle of talents that abounds in our Party, it also compounded my task of choosing a single person from among them.\n\nLet me therefore pay tribute to my Party and, most especially, to all those that made the shortlist that must now be narrowed down to a single person. They are all dedicated party-men suitable for this task. I wish all the recommended persons could be announced today as my Running Mates. Unfortunately, only one MUST be chosen.\n\nIt is a difficult decision that I am called upon to take. But, as someone hoping to lead a complex country such as ours, tough and difficult decisions would remain a part of my everyday life.\n\nLet me, therefore, start this momentous journey with a crucial decision about who, among the eminently qualified shortlist, would be my Running Mate.\n\nAccordingly, let me state that the person I have chosen as my Running Mate possesses all those identified qualities. He personifies not only the seriousness the current moment represents for our country but also the future that our young people yearn for and deserve. He is a serving State Governor who has demonstrated, in his State and through his conduct, that governance is about service to the people.\n\nI know that he will not only add excitement to our already energized ticket and campaign, but will also help to bring focus, discipline and stability to our government, come 2023. I am pleased, therefore, to announce here my choice of Running Mate who will help to lead us to victory next year not only in the Presidential election but also in the governorship and legislative elections. And he will be by my side as I work hard every day to provide our people with security, revive our economy, improve education and unite our country. He has both Legislative and Executive experiences.

          "title": "Ukraine Pleads for More Weapons as European Leaders Head for Kyiv",
          "text": "Ukraine said it urgently needed more weapons to fend off Russian advances in the south and the east, an appeal aimed at the West as the leaders of Germany, France and Italy headed to Kyiv by night train for a visit on Thursday.\n\nRussia has focused most of its firepower on the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk while also trying to consolidate control over southern territory encompassing the strategic city of Kherson, north of the Black Sea.\n\nUkrainian soldiers are fighting to retake ground in wheat fields and empty villages along a deserted motorway between the city of Mykolaiv and Russian-occupied Kherson.\n\nMajor-General Dmytro Marchenko, who leads Ukraine\u2019s forces in Mykolaiv, said his troops could achieve victory over Russia if they are given the right weapons.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that this will not end soon. But then again, if we are given all the weapons that we need, the counter-offensive could well be over by the end of the summer,\u201d Marchenko told U.S.-backed broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.\n\nKherson fell to Russian forces in March, soon after Moscow invaded on Feb. 24 in what it describes as a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to disarm and \u201cdenazify\u201d Ukraine. Kyiv and its allies call this a baseless pretext for a war that his killed thousands and uprooted millions.\n\nSIEVIERDONETSK\n\nAfter being pushed back from the outskirts of Kyiv in May, Russia\u2019s troops have focused their efforts on capturing the entirety of the Donbas, an industrial region where fighting has focused in recent weeks on Sievierodonetsk, now largely in ruins.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin appears intent on asserting complete control over the Donbas, parts of which are held by Moscow-backed separatists in Luhansk and Donetsk provinces.\n\nBut British military intelligence said in a briefing note that Russian forces in the region were believed to be operating in an increasingly \u201cad hoc\u201d way in undermanned groups.\n\nUkrainian troops holed up alongside civilians in a Sievierodonetsk chemical plant ignored a Russian ultimatum to lay down their arms on Wednesday. The city\u2019s mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk, says Ukrainian troops were still defending the city, even though all of its river bridges had been destroyed.\n\nUkraine says more than 500 civilians, including 40 children, remain alongside soldiers inside the Azot chemical factory, sheltering from weeks of Russian bombardment. Separatists in the area say up to 1,200 civilians may be inside.\n\nRussia said it had opened a humanitarian corridor from Azot on Wednesday to allow civilians to escape territory it controls. It accused Ukraine\u2019s forces of disrupting that plan and using civilians as human shields, which Kyiv denies.\n\nSerhiy Gaidai, governor of the Luhansk region, said Ukraine\u2019s army was defending Sievierodonetsk and trying to stop Russian forces from taking its twin city Lysychansk on the opposite bank of the Siverskyi Donets river.\n\nBritish military intelligence said that with all main bridges destroyed, Russian forces would have to conduct a \u201ccontested\u201d crossing of the river.\n\nA Russian air-launched rocket hit a suburb of the northern city of Sumy overnight, killing four and wounding six, the governor said.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify battlefield accounts.\n\nARMS PACKAGES\n\nLeaders including U.S. President Joe Biden have announced new arms packages for Ukraine in recent days, following appeals by Kyiv for help.\n\nBiden pledged $1 billion worth of new aid on Wednesday, including anti-ship rocket systems, artillery rockets and rounds for howitzers.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was \u201cextremely focused on stepping up support\u201d for Ukraine.\n\nWhile Ukraine has welcomed the new pledges, it says deliveries are not coming fast enough.\n\nRecent deliveries of M777 howitzers from the United States have been too few and that Ukraine remains numerically outgunned, officials said.\n\nWeapons provisions are likely to dominate discussions during Friday\u2019s visit to Kyiv by leaders of the European Union\u2019s three biggest countries.\n\nThe visit by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi has taken weeks to organise with the three looking to overcome criticism within Ukraine over their response to the war.\n\nDetails of the trip were not announced for security reasons but Ukraine\u2019s state rail company head posted a picture of Macron, Scholz, and Draghi on a train used for high-profile visitors. \u201cI was not the only one to spend last night on a train,\u201d he wrote in a message.\n\nThe French presidential office confirmed that Marcon was due in Kyiv on Thursday. Speaking in Romania on Wednesday, Macron said it was time for Europe to reassure Ukraine over its EU ambitions.\n\n\u201cWe are at a point when we need to send clear political signals, us Europeans, towards Ukraine and its people when it is resisting heroically,\u201d he said, without giving details.\n\nOn Friday, the European Commission is due to make a recommendation on Ukraine\u2019s status as an EU candidate.\n\nDespite the state of relations between Russia and the United States, the two powers must discuss the extension of the START nuclear arms reduction treaty, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the RIA news agency in an interview on Thursday.",
