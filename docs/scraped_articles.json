I left for Lagos on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI was in a taxi when my phone rang and the next thing I heard was this is a call from the hospital and the caller informed me that my COVID-19 test came out positive, I was shocked and I thought it was a set up but the guy insisted that it was my result and advised that I should quickly to the next isolation centre.\n\n\u201cSo I quickly went to another hospital in Lagos to do another test, they said the result will be out later that day and my flight was on Sunday. Within six to seven hours, the result came and it was also positive and immediately I started feeling feverish, and then a horrible headache. From there I went to my hotel where I isolated myself for ten days taking my medications. I am a nurse by profession registered in the UK.\n\n\u201cMy PA was with me and he has to be taking medication as well since he was the one who was always with me. I had to reschedule my flight. Close to that time I have to do another test because the UK authorities require a 72 hours post COVID-19 test before coming into the UK so before the end of the ten days, I started feeling well, I now had my sense of smell back because I could no longer feel any taste or smell. My test eventually became negative before I could go back to the UK.\n\n\u201cIt was a really horrible experience but I don\u2019t have any underlying ailment so there was no breathlessness and because of the vaccination, it was better for me to recover compared to patients I have dealt here in the UK, compared to friends I have seen or heard of having COVID-19 who had it when they were not vaccinated.\u201d\n\nShe said \u201cMany died from it but mine was different because of the vaccination and I encourage people out there to get their vaccination because it is going to help them health wise, it is going to help the public, it is going to help family members\u201d",

          "text": "By Grace Obike, Abuja\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThe United Nations (UN) says women representation in the country has been on a steady decline.\n\nAccording to the UN, Nigeria is at the bottom of Africa in terms of the representation of women in elective offices.\n\nThe Country Director UN Women in Nigeria Ms. Comfort Lamptey said Nigeria globally sits within the 0.1 \u2013 4.9 per cent range for women\u2019s representation in government.\n\nLamptey spoke yesterday in Abuja at a breakfast meeting with media executives on\n\nthe Gender and Equal Opportunities Bill (GEOB)\n\nShe said the bill provides an invaluable window of opportunity to implement legal frameworks to address gender inequalities and redress gender-based violence.\n\nHer words: \u201cIn fact, women\u2019s representation in Nigeria has been on a steady decline since Nigeria\u2019s return to democracy in 1999. Nigeria globally sits within the 0.1 \u2013 4.9 % range for women\u2019s representation in government and it is at the bottom of the whole African continent in terms of representation of women into elective offices yet another State of Emergency.\n\n\u201cPassage of the Gender and Equal Opportunities Bill provides an invaluable window of opportunity to implement legal frameworks to address gender inequalities and prevent, protect and redress gender-based violence. This includes the disenfranchisement of women through inheritance laws and discriminatory practices within employment and education all of which are stipulated in the GEO Bill.\n\n\u201cThe GEO Bill is a robust framework that prohibits discrimination based on gender and\n\nproposes measures for women\u2019s inclusion within society. Passage of the GEOB will ensure promotion of equal opportunities, full development and advancement of persons in\n\nNigeria particularly marginalized and vulnerable groups\u201d\n\nAustralian High Commissioner to Nigeria, John Donnelly said Gender equality and women empowerment is not just the right but smart thing to do.\n\nHe said: \u201cGender equality and women\u2019s empowerment is not just the right thing to do,\n\nit is the smart thing to do, the economic and development benefits are clear: protecting women and girls, investing in their rights, and providing opportunities for them to prosper benefits not only their communities, but the whole country\n\n\u201cWith the COVID-19 pandemic having a disproportionate impact on women and girls globally, we have been presented an opportunity to recalibrate, collaborate, and build on past efforts to pass the GEOB.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly, the far-reaching benefits of diversity and gender equality in\n\nleadership and decision-making are being recognised. But it\u2019s not just legislation and policies that effect change.\n\n\u201cThe media is front and centre of any attempt to effect change in society. The way the media presents issues, and your awareness of issues, is vital for creating an informed public.\u201d\n\nSenator Biodun Olujimi stated: \u201d Let me just say something brief about the Bill. It is development-oriented and includes provisions which will promote equal access for women and men for instance across all sectors. The Bill also has key provisions such as the adoption of temporary special measures to eliminate discrimination of women and widen the space for women to occupy leadership positions in politics and public office.\n\nREAD ALSO: Women push for law against gender violence in states\n\n\u201cIt also seeks to address several forms of discrimination against women such as land ownership, inheritance, education, employment, and sexual and gender-based violence.\n\n\u201cAs already noted, the Bill has had a very long journey, and during this period, it has faced much resistance and criticism along the way. This may be put down to the lack of awareness and misunderstanding/ misinterpretation about its aims and goals amongst other reasons.\n\n\u201cThe philosophy behind today\u2019s breakfast meeting is to bring us together, for a heart-to-heart informative dialogue that will conclude on actionable commitments towards creating awareness, sensitisation, clarify misconceptions and mobilise wider public support to strengthen chances of passing the Bill into law. We would also like to hear your thoughts.\u201d",

          "title": "2023: Afenifere, Middle Belt, Ohanaeze, others slam Northern govs, traditional rulers over power rotation",
          "text": "From Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu, Godwin Tsa, Abuja, Sola Ojo, Kaduna, Chijioke Agwu, Abakaliki and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nMiddle Belt Forum (MBF) and Ohanaeze Ndigbo have slammed northern governors and traditional rulers for opposing power rotation, saying it was strange that the region under whose leadership Nigeria has continued to perform woefully would contemplate the idea of retaining power beyond 2023.\n\nThe Northern Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) and Traditional Rulers\u2019 Council after a meeting in Kaduna on Monday had declared that it was opposed to power rotation because the Nigerian constitution does not provide for it.\n\nBut responding to this position, MBF said it was shocking that instead of harping on the bloodshed ripping across the country, northern governors and traditional rulers were concerned with which of the zones would take over power in 2023.\n\nOn its part, the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation described the northern governors and monarch\u2019s position as indicating a bleak future for Nigeria. It also expressed regret that the north was \u201cundisturbed that Nigeria is fast collapsing under its leadership.\u201d\n\nNational President of MBF, Dr. Pogu Bitrus, in a statement, said it was in the best interest of equity and justice for President Muhammadu Buhari to hand over power to a candidate from the Middle Belt or southern Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have been consistent in insisting that for equity and justice to hold sway, power rotation is irrevocable. We deplore a situation where the Middle Belt is completely excluded in the power sharing arrangement in the country. We have called and demanded that the 2023 Presidency be zoned to the Middle Belt. In the event that such demand is unrealisable, all ethnic nationalities of the Middle Belt region are resolved to support any presidential candidate from the South. The best the present administration of President Muhammadu Buhari should do now is to prepare ground for the conduct of transparent polls that would either usher in a presidency to be headed by a Middle Belter or Southerner. Anything short of that is unacceptable to the Middle Belt peoples.\u201d\n\nIt lamented that the last six years of northern leadership has brought Nigerians to a catastrophe that is unprecedented.\n\n\u201cNot only has the prosperity for a bright tomorrow retarded, insecurity, unemployment and other societal vices have left its toll on national life. We find it incomprehensible to understand the basis upon which the North is clamouring for power retention. By 2023, the North should have forfeited all moral rights to retain power in line with the zoning arrangement of political parties. We cannot allow the North which is now throwing decorum into the air and continue to pursue a selfish agenda that could capsize the ship of the Nigerian State.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Ohanaeze in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Alex Ogbonnia, expressed shock that leaders of the North had failed to recognise that Nigeria, at the moment, was confronted with the most precarious omens full of uncertainty, doubts, insecurity and bloodshed, and instead of seeking solution, they were busy strategising on how to hold on to power in 2023.\n\nOhanaeze recalled that the issue of the presidency shifting between north and south was a gentleman agreement reached between the two regions in 1998 and wondered why the north which had enjoyed the cruise would want to sink the ship.\n\n\u201cNorthern governors, the Sultan and the emirs instead of seeking solution to Nigerian problems were busy strategising on how to retain power in 2023. This is most unconscionable, to say the least. Let it be made abundantly clear that if Presidency is a panacea to people\u2019s problems, the North would have become the Netherlands of Africa. This is because the north had Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Yakubu Gowon, Murtala Mohammed, Shehu Shagari, Muhammadu Buhari, Ibrahim Babangida, Sani Abacha, Abdulsalam Abubakar, Musa Yaradua, Muhammadu Buhari, yet the problems of the north are on the increase.\n\n\u201cThe position of the southern governors is simply restating the obvious. A gentleman agreement was reached at the NUC Conference Centre, Abuja in 1998 between the North and the South. The late Dr. Chuba Okadigbo spoke for the entire south and Alhaji Abubakar Rimi also of blessed memory spoke for the north. It was agreed that after Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar as Head of State, that the presidency should shift to the south. That accounted for the emergence of the presidential flag bearers of the mainstream political parties from the South West. Chief Olusegun Obasanjo respected the agreement, handed over to the north in the person of Musa Yar\u2019Adua. Again, Goodluck Jonathan, a southerner, respected the gentleman agreement, handed over to the north in the person of President Muhammadu Buhari. Therefore, the least that is expected from the north is a show of profound gratitude to the entire south for their large heart, equanimity and sportsmanship.\n\n\u201cNigeria has two major groups of people. Those that cherish the corporate existence of Nigeria on one hand, and those that do not value the unity, peace and progress of Nigeria on the other. The latter indulge in reckless nepotism, ethnocentrism, avarice, supremacist mentality, hollow expansionism and poor judgment of history. It is the law of nature that light illuminates and that in religion, both the Lord Jesus Christ and Prophet Mohammed stood for truth.\u201d\n\n\u2022Warns PDP against zoning ticket to north\n\nOhanaeze asked the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to be wise and not think it could regain power from the All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2023 by zoning the presidency to the north.\n\nIt informed the PDP that it would be wrong to zone its ticket to the north given that from the late Dr. Alex. Ekwueme, the South East people had carried the party on their shoulders and ensured its successes in polls in the region.\n\n\u201cThe exponents of this agenda, in their jaundiced calculations, believe that it is a sure way of regaining power from the All Progressives Congress (APC). Experience would have taught them that to zone their presidential position to the North is an orchestrated requiem for the party; because more PDP Governors and grassroots will surely desert them.\n\n\u201cMay we remind the PDP that the South East has made unquantifiable sacrifices for PDP beginning from the time of Dr. Alex. Ekwueme. If by way of politics without principles, the southerners in PDP place their personal narrow interests over the interest of their people, the verdict of history will surely be harsh on them.\u201d\n\n\u2022Afenifere, Sani knock Northern govs\n\nPan-Yoruba organisation, Afenifere and Senator Shehu Sani, chairman, Committee on Local and Foreign Debts in the 8th National Assembly both asked the northern governors to respect the power rotation agreement.\n\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, Afenifere accused the northern governors of insincerity in their utterances.\n\n\u201cAs far back as February 2020, Governor Nasir el Rufai of Kaduna State said openly that there was nothing wrong in the presidency returning to the south in 2023. In July this year 2021, he not only reiterated this position but also said fairness and justice demand that the south should produce the president in 2023. Five other governors from the same northern zone supported Rufai\u2019s position on this matter. This new position by the said governors indicated that they were not sincere when they expressed their opinion earlier on.\n\n\u201cWhile Afenifere concedes that presidential material can come from any part of the country, equity, fairness and justice demand that the next occupant of the exalted office must come from the South since the North would have occupied that office for unbroken eight years by 2023. It is by so doing that unity and sense of belonging the country needs would be fostered.\u201d\n\nSani said though the rotational presidency is not constitutional, it is necessary for peace and unity. He cautioned both the northern governors and their southern colleagues to watch their utterances to avoid throwing the country into crisis with the agitation for power shift.\n\nHe berated the northern governors for preoccupying themselves with where the presidency should be zoned in 2023 when their states were in turmoil.\n\n\u2022Lobbying best strategy for S\u2019East \u2013Rep\n\nIn the view of member of the House of Representatives, Chinedu Ogah, the five eastern states of the country should lobby other zones to produce the next president.\n\nOgah, who represents Ikwo/Ezza South federal Constituency of Ebonyi State, said the South East states alone did not have the capacity to clinch presidency without the support of other states and zones.\n\n\u201cI want our people to understand that it is not about Igbo presidency, it is about the president of the country. I am supporting a south eastern person to be president and we are begging that the position should be zoned to South this time around. When it is zoned to south. The south will be able to meet to zone it to where it has not gone.\n\n\u201cIt is not about Igbo presidency because we don\u2019t have Igbo president in the constitution, what we have is the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and that is what is contained in the constitution. We should lobby other zones to get south east president because the five eastern states cannot win the position without the support of other zones. We should be appealing to other states and zones to give the five eastern states a chance to produce the president of Nigeria and not Igbo President,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Don\u2019t set Nigeria on fire \u2013Northern youths\n\nThe Northern Youths Council of Nigeria (NYCN) cautioned governors not to set the country on fire over their recent divisive positions on which region should produce the next president.\n\nNYCN, in a statement by Isah Abubakar and Mock Samuel Kure, president and director general of media and publicity respectively, noted with \u201cgrave concern\u201d the war of words between northern and southern governors\u2019 fora over zoning or otherwise of presidency come 2023\n\n\u201cIt is a common knowledge that most of the leaders sending threat on media won\u2019t be here when things spiral out of control. Whether the next president comes from the North or South, it is the same elite from both regions that will derive maximum benefits from the system while the poor man\u2019s challenges will always dwell with him. Therefore, our governors should channel their energy towards developing their various states and coming with formula on how they lift poor Nigerians from the current challenges of poverty, insecurity and total hopelessness rather than trying to further set them against one another along regional, religious and tribal lines.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "From Ndubuisi Orji and Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nThe House of Representative has drawn the battlelines with Senate over stalled Bills sent for concurrence.\n\nThe House, yesterday, received two bills from the Senate for concurrence but they were stepped down. One of them is a Bill for an Act to Establish Chartered Institute of Directors of Nigeria to Provide Professional Training to Directors and Promote Effective Governance, Public Accountability and Professional Efficiency and the other a Bill for an Act to provide for the Establishment of Federal University of Agriculture and Technology, at Aboh, Delta.\n\nMiffed by the attitude of the Senate towards Bills sent to it by the House of Representative, members became agitated, claiming that the Bills should be stepped down.\n\nAbout 69 Bills passed by the House were awaiting concurrence by the Senate.\n\nOsai Osai (PDP-Delta) in his opinion said that the two Bills should be given concurrence, adding that if there was any grey areas to be sorted with the Senate, the principal officers should handle such.\n\nAccording to him, stopping Senate\u2019s Bill will amount to building a clash that is not needed in a democracy and trying to stop enactment of law that is within the powers of the lawmakers will not augur well.\n\nReacting to the development, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, decried the refusal of the Senate to give concurrence to Bills sent to it by the House.\n\nResponding to Osai\u2019s submission, Gbajabiamila said \u201cIf you have a Bill you have laboured hard to work on and it has been in the Senate for six months, you won\u2019t be saying what you are saying.\n\n\u201cBills that come to this House from the Senate for concurrence should be given the same treatment as is done in the Senate.\n\n\u201cAs I speak, we have only four Bills from the Senate awaiting concurrence in the House, while we have 69 bills awaiting concurrence in the Senate.\u2019\u2019\n\nGbajabiamila said stepping down the Bills did not suggest that there was a rift or problem between the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n\nHe said the issue could be due to administrative challenges and ordered the Clerk of the House to liaise with the Clerk of the Senate to resolve the logjam.\n\nBenjamin Kalu, spokesperson of the House had on September 24 said there was no frosty relationship with the Senate over delays in concurrence on Bills passed by either of the two chambers.\n\n\u201cThere is no friction between us; we should stop building mountain out of a molehill. There is no supremacy contest,\u2019\u2019 he had said.\n\nWhen contacted, Senate spokesman, Basiru Ajibola, said he was not in a position to criticise a decision taken by the House of Representatives.\n\nHe said they were at liberty to decide, insisting that the Senate cannot interfere in their personal dealing.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t expect me to comment on that. The House of Representatives is an independent chamber. They\u2019re at liberty to take any decision. I\u2019ve nothing to say,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the House has set up a seven- member Conference Committee on the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nGbajabiamila who announced this said the conference Committee would work with that of the Senate on the electoral Act to achieve concurrence.\n\nThe members are Akeem Adeyemi as the Chairman, James Faleke, Chris Azubogu, Abdullahi Kalambaine, Blessing Onuh, Aisha Dukku and Unyime Idem.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "\u2022Inaugurates police quarters, boasts FG has invested substantially in NDDC\n\n\u2022NDDC is cash cow for politicians, says Wike\n\n\u2022Akpabio hints agency to fix 13,777 abandoned projects\n\n\u2022IG describes project as significant to force\n\nBlessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, described the funding of the Nigeria Police as a huge challenge for government. Although, Buhari said it was the reason government set up the Police Trust Fund, he maintained there was still need to source more funding avenues for the police in order to enhance the security of the society.\n\nThe president spoke at the commissioning of a block of 66 flats built by the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) for officers of the Nigeria Police Special Protection Unit Base 6, at Omagwa, Ikwerre Local Government Area of Rivers State. He boasted that the federal government on his watch had invested significantly in the NDDC, as could be seen in the many projects across the Niger Delta states.\n\nBut Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike, in his remarks, said NDDC had become a cash cow for politicians.\n\nIn his speech, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, disclosed that NDCC was struggling to complete 13, 777 abandoned projects across the Niger Delta states.\n\nInspector General of Police Alkali Baba Usman commended Buhari for the police quarters, saying it is a key security project.\n\nBuhari, who was represented by the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, at the inauguration, advised that the resources pumped into the commission should be justifiable and must impact positively on the people of the region. The president stated that the Nigeria Police had been effective in their role of protecting lives and property. He restated the federal government\u2019s commitment to providing a fair and convenient ground for police personnel to operate in their fight against insecurity.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cFunding of the police force remains a huge challenge, which is why we work with the National Assembly to enact the police trust fund Act. We are looking at other measures to improve funding for the police.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s event meets two objectives: the first is, it is an important part of our government\u2019s effort to improve the lives and livelihood of our police officers and men. And it is also another important milestone in our administration\u2019s pursuit of the peace, prosperity and the development of the Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cWe recognised that establishing adequate security is absolutely integral to the fulfilment of this administration\u2019s objective, which is why we have committed significant resources to projects such that we are about to commission.\u201d\n\nBuhari added, \u201cOur police force is a crucial component of our law enforcement architecture. They are the civil force, the closest to the people in the various communities. In the past months, we have been undertaking a major reform of the police. For us, we believe that we must increase the number of police personnel. So, we are also in the process of re-equipping our personnel, both in personal gear and hardware.\n\n\u201cAn important feature of the reform is the accommodation for men and officers. I have directed that the building of barracks for men and women of the police force should be done in collaboration with the social housing effort or the family homes fund. This will ensure speedy execution of all of the projects, and all of the barracks that need to be provided.\u201d\n\nThe president also said, \u201cThe federal government has invested significantly in the NDDC and we recognise that this outplay of resources must be justified with very viable projects and will improve the living standard of the people of this region.\n\n\u201cAnd as we hand over this facility to the Nigeria Police force, let me reiterate that with our security, there would be more development. This is the basis of my administration\u2019s commitment to continue to provide various platforms for all the security agencies and the fight against terrorism, banditry and all forms of criminality.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Wike observed that NDDC had become a cash cow for politicians. He accused the management of NDDC of sidelining the Niger Delta states in the execution of its projects. The governor said inclusion of the states would reduce the rampant incidence of abandoned projects across the region.\n\nHe said the commissioned project, which was supposed to be completed within one year, lasted about 10 years.\n\nWike stated, \u201cNDDC has been a cash cow for politicians. You will see competition for position, because of political interest. The problem of NDDC is not just for the Niger Delta but the entire Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis project shouldn\u2019t last one year if NDDC was committed to effective service delivery. There is no collaboration we have had with NDDC. And why would NDDC not be abandoning the project? You (NDDC) declare projects without conceptualisation, without funding, no commitment.\n\n\u201cMy problem with NDDC is, no synergy with the mandate states. You distort the development plans of the states. Sometimes, you go into our schools, health centres to build. Who told you it is our priority?\u201d\n\nWike, however, commended the Interim Sole Administrator of NDDC, Effiong Akwa, for his impactful effort so far in actualising development in the region since he assumed office.\n\nAkpabio disclosed that NDCC was struggling to complete 13, 777 abandoned projects across the Niger Delta states. He noted that the region was the safest and most peaceful in the country.\n\nThe minister said, \u201cThe Niger Delta region is the most peaceful region to live and do business today. Everything will be done to ensure the completion of the East/West Road. Presently, we have 13,777 abandoned projects but we thank Mr. President for making this event (commissioning of the police quarter) possible.\u201d\n\nUsman, said, \u201cThe project demonstrates the (determination of the) leadership of the Niger Delta Ministry to support the effort of the police in security in the region.\u201d\n\nMaintaining that the outcome of the project would change the narrative of the police, he assured of the maintenance of the property. The Inspector General added that he would monitor usage of the building.\n\nThe building has one commander\u2019s residence, one second-in-command\u2019s residence, 64 one-bedroom flats, one armoury, underground cells, and gate house.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says it could fund 46 per cent of 2021 budget deficit of N5.6 trillion\n\n\u2022NNPC set to deduct N149.2bn from October FAAC\n\n\u2022Oil price climbs above $80 per barrel\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nAs Nigeria continues to grapple with revenue shortfall and has gone borrowing to finance its huge budget deficit with debt service gulping as much as 98 per cent of its revenue, it has been revealed that 77 oil and gas companies operating in Nigeria are indebted to the country to the tune of N2.659 trillion.\n\nThis is just as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is expected to once more make a huge deduction of N149.2 billion from the federation\u2019s joint account when the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) meets next month, a document seen by THISDAY yesterday revealed.\n\nThe Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) which disclosed that 77 oil and gas companies were indebted to the federal government, attributed the debt to their failure to remit petroleum profit tax, company income tax, education tax, value added tax, withholding tax, royalty and concession on rentals.\n\nSpeaking in Abuja during an interaction with the media on the status of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) implementation in Nigeria, the Executive Secretary of the organisation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Orji, stated that when converted to dollar, the government was being owed $6.48 billion at today\u2019s official exchange rate of N410.35.\n\nHe noted that a breakdown of the figures showed that a total of $143.99 million was owed as petroleum profit taxes, $1.089 billion as company income taxes and $201.69 million as education tax. According to him, others included $18.46 million and \u00a3972,000 as VAT, $23.91 million and \u00a3997,000 as withholding tax, $4.357 billion as royalty oil, $292.44 million as royalty gas, while $270.187 million and $41.86 million were unremitted gas flare penalties and concession rentals respectively.\n\nIn view of the government\u2019s current search for revenues to address citizens\u2019 demand for steady power, access to good roads, quality education, fighting insurgency and creating of job opportunities for the country\u2019s teeming youths, Orji stressed that the monies needed to be recovered.\n\nAn analysis of what the sum of N2.65 trillion could contribute to economic development, he said, showed that it could cover the entire capital budget of the federal government in 2020 or even service the federal government\u2019s debt of $2.68 billion in 2020.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, if the money is recovered, the N2.659 trillion, it could fund about 46 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s 2021 budget deficit of N5.6 trillion and is even higher than the entire projected oil revenue for 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is why NEITI is set to work with the government to provide relevant information and data to support efforts at recovering this money.\n\n\u201cThe disclosure of this information is in line with NEITI\u2019s mandate to conduct audits, disseminate the findings to the public to enable the citizen\u2019s, especially the media and civil society to use the information and data to hold government, companies and even society to account.\n\n\u201cIt is important that the process of recovering this humongous sum be set on course to support government in this period of dwindling revenues,\u201d the NEITI helmsman said.\n\nThe executive secretary called on the companies to ensure that they remit the various outstanding sums against them before the conclusion of the 2020 NEITI audit cycle to the relevant government agencies responsible for collection and remittances of such revenue.\n\n\u201cNEITI will no longer watch while these debts continue to remain in its reports unaddressed. We will provide all necessary information and data to sister agencies whose responsibilities are to recover these debts into government coffers. We will do also share the information and data with our partner anti-corruption agencies with whom we have signed MoUs,\u201d he added.\n\nWithin the short period the new management was appointed, Orji disclosed that his team had succeeded in ensuring the reconstitution and inauguration of the NEITI board and commencement of process of reviewing of NEITI Act to strengthen its powers and functions. In addition, he listed the timely publication and presentation of the reports; securing permanent office accommodation for the agency after 17 years of squatting on rent; sustained and diversified partnerships with key stakeholders and partners as part of the initiative\u2019s achievement.\n\nAccording to him, the appointment of NEITI into the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA); commencement of the development of a five-year NEITI strategic plan (2022-2026); NEITI audit automation project and Nigeria\u2019s involvement in opening extractives programme, were further modest strides made by the organisation.\n\nHe stated that NEITI\u2019s had further been appointed to lead the global EITI contract transparency network; designing of a new, functional and interactive website and reconstitution of the civil society and communication sub-committee, among others.\n\nEarlier in his welcome remarks, the Chairman of the NEITI board, Mr. Olusegun Adekunle, assured that a lot more needed to be done in the EITI implementation in Nigeria, especially under the new PIA regime. He maintained that the solid minerals sector was begging for coordination, noting that the civil society and the media, being the third leg of the EITI tripod have critical roles to play in the Initiative.\n\n\u201cTo effectively undertake this task of ensuring prudent management of extractive resources, there is need for effective oversight of the implementation of the EITI standard by all relevant frontline agencies of government and companies.\n\n\u201cNSWG looks up to you for you to effectively monitor these guidelines and to ensure that the standards are mainstreamed in the covered entities\u2019 daily operations\u201d, he said.\n\nHe reiterated the commitment of President Muhammadu-led administration to EITI implementation in Nigeria, noting that the administration was passionate about the EITI process.\n\nThe chairman assured members of the civil society and the media that the NEITI board under his watch would do all within its power to sustain the existing partnership and ensure a more robust and cordial relationship with civil society groups.\n\nIn his goodwill message, the Programme Manager, British Council/ Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption Programme (RoLAC), Mr. Emanuel Uche, commended NEITI under the current management for the modest achievements made within a short period.\n\nNNPC Set to Deduct N149.2bn from October FAAC\n\nMeanwhile, the NNPC will again make a huge deduction of N149.2 billion from the federation\u2019s joint account when the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) meets next month, according to a document seen by THISDAY.\n\nThe NNPC FAAC presentation held on September 21, which detailed the corporation\u2019s operations for the month of August, disclosed that as reported by THISDAY last month, the national oil company also withheld about N173.1 billion during the month to pay for what it terms under-recovery or value shortfall. An analysis of the document showed that net revenue to FAAC from the NNPC rose to N80 billion in August as against N67.280 billion in July, an increase of about N13.28 billion.\n\nYear-to-date, the NNPC FAAC presentation showed that N714.7 billion had been paid as subsidy from January to August, with the eight month getting the lion\u2019s share of N173.1 billion, while June came next with N164.3 billion, followed by May with N126 billion, then July in which N103.2 billion was spent on what the government terms under-recovery.\n\nIn the same vein, while no subsidy was paid in January, N24.3 billion was paid in February, N60.3 billion in March and N61.9 billion in April this year.\n\nAccording to the NNPC, a pending N40 billion from June under-recovery would be subsequently subtracted from the federation account jointly run by the federal, state and local governments.\n\nWhen the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) begins in earnest and the federal continues in its hesitation to stop payment of subsidy on petrol, it would be double jeopardy for the sub-nationals which would also be hugely affected by the deduction of the controversial 30 per cent frontier exploration fund.\n\n\u201cThe value shortfall of N173,131,639,213.61, for July 2021 was charged. The balance of N40,000,000,000.00 for the June 2021 value shortfall will be deducted subsequently.\n\n\u201cThe August, 2021 value shortfall of N149,283,084,869.20 is to be deducted from the September, 2021 proceeds due for sharing at the October, 2021 FAAC meeting,\u201d the document disclosed.\n\nIn all, the overall NNPC crude oil lifting of 8.71 mbbls (export & domestic crude) in July 2021, recorded 0.87 per cent increase relative to the 8.66 mbbls lifted in June 2021, the corporation stated, with Nigeria maintaining 1.554 million bpd Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production cut in July, 2021.\n\nCrude Oil export revenue received in August 2021 amounted to $7.78 million, equivalent to N2.98 billion, while domestic gas receipts in the month was N5.69 billion.\n\nAccording to the NNPC, feedstock valued at $64.66 million was sold to Nigeria LNG during the period, out of which $54.40 million was received during the month, the difference being Modified Carry Agreement (MCA) obligations, gas reconciliation and credit notes.\n\nNLNG arrears amounting to $3.09 million was received during the period, while the sum of $151.26 million being miscellaneous receipts, gas and ullage (the amount by which a container falls short of being full) fees and interest income was received in August 2021.\n\nIn its July operations, for monies which were shared in August, NNPC had deducted a cumulative N215.3 billion from its contribution to joint Federation Account, being a combination of N175 billion value shortfall or subsidy and N40 billion Joint Venture (JV) cost recovery.\n\nThe data earlier obtained by THISDAY showed that NNPC paid N67.280 to the joint account in July, in contrast to the N47.162 in June. The July payment was about N20 billion higher than that of June.\n\nFurthermore, in January, net revenue to FAAC was N90.8 billion, it was N64.161 billion in February, N41.184 billion in March, zero in April, N38.608 billion in May, N47.162 billion in June and N67.280 billion in July.\n\nIn June, the NNPC told the nation that Nigeria was losing about 42 million litres of petrol to the activities of smugglers across the country\u2019s borders, increasing Nigeria\u2019s estimated daily consumption of 60 million litres to 103 million litres, thereby worsening the subsidy payment regime.\n\nMeanwhile, Brent oil, Nigeria\u2019s crude benchmark, rose above $80 a barrel on Tuesday, the latest milestone in a global energy crisis, on signs that demand was running ahead of supply and depleting inventories.\n\nThe international crude benchmark hit the highest since October 2018, before paring some earlier gains to trade close to $80, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) also climbed above $75.\n\nHowever, the jump to $80 was adding inflationary pressure to the global economy at a time when prices of energy commodities are soaring, especially in Europe and America.\n\nOther things being equal, oil has rebounded from its collapse last year amid record output curbs from the OPEC+ group and a global economic recovery that has boosted demand.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022States how Balewa, Gowon, Mohammed, Shagari, others under-developed north\n\n\u2022Says another northern president will destroy nation\u2019s unity\n\n\u2022Atedo: Zoning is about political expediency, compromise\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and Christopher Isiguzo in Enugu\n\nThe dust generated from Monday\u2019s statement by the northern governors as well as traditional rulers in the region that, zoning of the presidency was unconstitutional, has attracted the ire of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, which not only condemned the northern governors and the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), but further warned against the north insisting on producing President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s successor in 2023.\n\nOhanaeze, Ndigbo\u2019s apex socio-political association, also went the memory lane to educate the northern political elite and refresh their memories about how their former leaders like Alhaji Tafawa Balewa, Yakubu Gowon, Murtala Mohammed, Alhaji Shehu Shagari and others underdeveloped the north despite running the affairs of the country for a long time.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Secretary-General, Ohanaeze, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, another northern president would fuel the agitation for Oduduwa Republic as well as Biafra nation and therefore warned that such a narrow disposition threatened the unity of the country.\n\nThis was, however, in sync with the position of the President and Founder of Anap Foundation, Mr. Atedo Peterside, who while weighing-in on the matter, wrote on his official Twitter handle that, \u201cSome Governors say zoning is unconstitutional. Will they accept a President and Vice President coming from the same zone? Or a governor and deputy governor from the same local government area, though these are all \u2018constitutional\u2019? No, zoning is about political expediency and compromise.\u201d\n\nThe Northern States Governors Forum (NSGF), umbrella body for 19 elected governors in northern Nigeria, had signaled its determination to retain power in 2023, when it argued that power rotation was unconstitutional.\n\nIt, therefore, condemned the position of the Southern Governors Forum (SGF), stating that their position contradicted \u201cthe provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (1999) as amended that an elected President shall score the majority votes; score at least 25 per cent of the votes cast in two-third of the states of the federation.\u201d\n\nBut Isiguzoro, in the statement accused the northern governors of being the instigators of Nigeria\u2019s breakup and that another northern president would be faced with challenges that would make it difficult for him to rule Nigeria.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cThe Ohanaeze Ndigbo worldwide maintained that attempts to jettison the rotational presidency in 2023, and the north insisting to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari will be unfavorable and weaknesses towards sustaining the unity and stability in the country as it will favour the declarations of Oduduwa and Biafra nations by 2024.\n\n\u201cNorthern Governors\u2019 miscalculation on 2023 and meandering on blind excitements of opposing the position of southern governors\u2019 standpoints had put the northern governors as exponents of Nigeria\u2019s breakup.\n\n\u201cIf another northerner succeeds President Buhari in 2023, he or she might not be able to superintendent over the affairs of the country as Nigeria might face brutal challenges from secessionist groups with full backing up from ethnic groups as a result of a revolt against the injustice against South and excesses of the North.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, Ndigbo, \u201cmay join with IPOB, to declare for Biafra restoration in the event of any conspiracy against the 2023 Igbo Presidency.\n\n\u201cNorthern governors should apologise to Nigerians for these subversive and provocative responses to 2023 Southern Presidency or should face the consequences of unable to read the mood of the nation which favours the southern presidency of Igbo bloc.\u201d\n\nIn yet a separate statement, the National Publicity Secretary, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Chief Chiedozie Alex Ogbonnia, said the position taken by the northern leaders was a clear indication that the country was facing a bleak future.\n\nIt noted that the northern leaders failed to recognise that Nigeria was confronted with uncertainty, doubts, insecurity and bloodshed presently, adding that by unanimously condemning the statement by the SGF that the Presidency must go to the south in 2023, the northern leaders had shown that they cared less whether Nigeria survives or not.\n\nAccording to the statement, the Chairman of the Northern States Governors Forum, Governor Simon Lalong, could attest that the people of Plateau State, had never in history witnessed the number of deaths that had taken place under his watch as governor, noting that banditry in Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna and Jigawa States was terrifying.\n\n\u201cBenue State has turned into a killing field. The states of Yobe and Borno are worst hit by the menace of Boko Haram; etc. Several schools in the North could not open because of kidnappers and millions of children are on the street as beggars.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian currency has lost its value. Unemployment has skyrocketed; and Nigeria has become the poverty capital of the world and the Northern Governors, the Sultan and the Emirs instead of seeking solution to Nigerian problems were busy strategising on how to retain power in 2023. This is most unconscionable, to say the least.\n\n\u201cLet it be made abundantly clear that if Presidency is a panacea to people\u2019s problems, the north would have become the Netherlands of Africa. This is because the North had Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Yakubu Gowon, Murtala Mohammed, Shehu Shagari, Muhammadu Buhari, Ibrahim Babangida, Sani Abacha, Abdulsalam Abubakar, Musa Yaradua, Muhammadu Buhari, yet the problems of the North are on the increase,\u201d he noted.\n\nIt reiterated the position of the Southern Governors, saying a gentleman agreement was reached at the NUC Conference Centre, Abuja, in 1998 between the north and the south.\n\n\u201cThe Late Dr. Chuba Okadigbo spoke for the entire south and Alh. Abubakar Rimi, also of blessed memory, spoke for the North. It was agreed that after Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar as the Head of State, that the presidency should shift to the South.\n\n\u201cThat accounted for the emergence of the presidential flag bearers of the mainstream political parties from the South West. Chief Olusegun Obasanjo respected the agreement and handed over to the North in the person of Musa Yar\u2019Adua.\n\n\u201cAgain, Goodluck Jonathan, a Southerner, respected the gentleman agreement and handed over to the North in the person of President Muhammadu Buhari. Therefore, the least that is expected from the North is a show of profound gratitude to the entire South for their large heart, equanimity and sportsmanship.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, it is in the interest of every Nigerian that there should be a paradigm shift to governance techniques,\u201d the group noted, reiterating its support for the 17 Southern Governors.\n\nContinuing, the statement stated: \u201cOhanaeze uses this singular opportunity to express disappointment over the unholy manouvres and alliances by the members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to zone the presidential seat for the 2023 general election to the Northern Nigeria. The exponents of this agenda, in their jaundiced calculations, believe that it is a sure way of regaining power from the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cExperience would have taught them that to zone their presidential position to the North is an orchestrated requiem for the party, because more PDP governors and grassroots will surely desert them,\u201d it added.\n\nThe organisation, which has Prof. George Obiozor as its President General further reiterated that the bane of Nigeria was injustice, which it claimed was targeted at the Igbos.\n\n\u201cUntil we begin to wean ourselves of the Igbophobia and rather harness individual and group resourcefulness, creativity, ingenuity and initiatives wherever they are found, Nigeria will remain on the downward spiral,\u201d it added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Alongside Softbank, the round included Whale Rock, a new investor and existing investors like Generation Investment Management, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and Spark Capital.\n\n\u201cAndela has always been the high-quality option for those building remote engineering teams. Now that the world has come to embrace remote work, Andela has become the obvious choice for companies because we can find better talent, faster,\u201d said Jeremy Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Andela. \u201cIf you are a talented engineer, Andela opens up a world of possibilities for you, no matter where you are based.\u201d\n\nIn view of this announcement, Lydia Jett, Founding Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers and one of the most respected consumer technology investors in the world, will join Andela\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\nLaunched in Nigeria in 2014, Andela started as an African-focused software developer training and outsourcing company. Notorious for being harder to get into than Harvard, Andela grew to become a premier source for talented, well-rounded developers in Africa thanks to its curriculum and developer training methodology. Two years after it launched the company got a $24 million infusion, led by Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, who followed up with a visit.\n\nL \u2013 R: Brice Nkengsa, Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, Ian Carnevale, Christina Sass, Jeremy Johnson, and Nadayar Enegesi co-founded Andela in September 2014. Image credit: Andela\n\nIn July 2020, Andela changed its model, closing its physical offices in Nigeria, Uganda and Rwanda to become a fully remote company. The particular rationale at the time was to increase the number of Africans who could apply to work for the company as software developers. Almost a year later, it expanded its talent pool to welcome Latin and South American developers.\n\nToday, the company boasts of a network of engineers from more than 80 countries and six continents. Through Andela, thousands of engineers have been placed with leading technology companies including Github, Cloudflare and ViacomCBS.\n\n\u201cHiring remote technical talent is one of the top challenges that companies face today. We believe Andela will become the preferred talent partner for the world\u2019s best companies as remote and hybrid work arrangements become the norm,\u201d Lydia Jett said. \u201cWe are delighted to support Jeremy and the Andela team in their mission to connect these companies with brilliant engineers, and in the process, unlock human potential at scale.\u201d\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "Researchers at a new bionics centre established at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) plan to pilot a mobile imaging and delivery system of prosthetic limb services for disabled Sierra Leoneans.\n\nThe project \u2013 meant to ensure patients in medically underserved communities have access to prostheses \u2013 is listed as one of the four priorities for the research centre set up with $24 million in funding from philanthropist Lisa Yang.\n\nA statement released by MIT reveals that investigators will field-test a system that uses a mobile clinic to 3D-print and deliver customized prosthetics to disabled individuals.\n\nThe service will initially roll out in rural Sierra Leone, a West African country where thousands of people suffered amputations during an 11-year civil war. According to estimates, roughly 27,000 Sierra Leoneans were disabled or had one or more of their limbs amputated during the 1991-2002 war.\n\nMIT adds that while the population of people with amputated limbs continues to increase each year in Sierra Leone, less than 10% of that population currently benefits from functional prostheses.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cThrough the mobile delivery system, a key centre objective is to scale up production and access of functional limb prostheses for Sierra Leoneans in dire need,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nSierra Leone President, Julius Maada Bio, describes the mobile prosthetics service fueled by the K. Lisa Yang Center for Bionics as \u201can innovative solution to a global problem.\u201d\n\nThe MIT project aligns with President Bio\u2019s plans to make Sierra Leone a hub for technology and innovation.\n\nOne of the first things he did after assuming office in 2017 was set up a Directorate of Science, Technology, and Innovation (DSTI) led by David Moinina Sengeh, the country\u2019s first-ever chief innovation officer who doubles as the Minister of Basic and Senior Secondary Education.\n\nSengeh is an MIT and Harvard inventor whose research work to improve prosthetic limbs in Sierra Leone will be leveraged by the MIT bionics centre.\n\nA crucial figure in the government\u2019s digitisation drive, he\u2019s introduced President Bio to TED Talks and tech activities at the universities of Oxford, Yale, and Harvard.\n\nOver the past four years, the President has participated in dialogues centered around using innovation and technology to transform food systems in Africa; given presentations on blockchain and the fourth industrial revolution; as well as visited MIT, where he detailed plans to make his nation a digital centre.\n\n\u201cI am proud that Sierra Leone will be the first site for deploying this state-of-the-art digital design and fabrication process,\u201d Bio said.\n\n\u201cAs the leader of a government that promotes innovative technologies and prioritizes human capital development, I am overjoyed that this pilot project will give Sierra Leoneans (especially in rural areas) access to quality limb prostheses and thus improve their quality of life.\u201d\n\nMore on the bionics centre\n\nThe K. Lisa Yang Center for Bionics will be run by Hugh Herr, an MIT professor and double amputee. Broadly, it aims to develop technologies and surgical methods to mitigate disability because of injury, aging, or disease using interdisciplinary research.\n\nExperts from three MIT schools \u2013 Science, Engineering, and Architecture and Planning \u2013 as well as clinical and surgical collaborators at Harvard Medical School, are expected to work together at the new centre.\n\nFurthermore, the center will provide four endowed fellowships for MIT graduate students working in bionics or other research areas focused on improving the lives of individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe new K. Lisa Yang Center for Bionics at MIT, made possible by a US$24 million gift from philanthropist Lisa Yang (center), will be led by Hugh Herr, professor of media arts and sciences at the MIT Media Lab (left), and Ed Boyden, the Y. Eva Tan Professor in Neurotechnology at MIT (right). Image source: MIT News\n\n\u201cI am thrilled to support MIT on this major research effort to enable powerful new solutions that improve the quality of life for individuals who experience disability,\u201d said Yang, a former investment banker and a major supporter in autism research at MIT and Cornell University, among other institutions.\n\n\u201cThis new commitment extends my philanthropic investment into the realm of physical disabilities, and I look forward to the centre\u2019s positive impact on countless lives.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "text": "The Chinese government plans to distribute digital satellite television and reception kits in 200 villages across Togo.\n\nChina\u2019s deputy trade minister Qian Keming said late last month the Asian powerhouse was \u201ccommitted to assisting in the implementation of this programme\u201d in Togo. It will cover more than a third of villages in the country, which is one of the smallest by land area and population in Africa with approximately 8 million people.\n\nThe project aligns with a separate plan by the West African country to switch to digital terrestrial television (DTT) broadcasting.\n\nDTT, which will replace analog television, is a technology that improves image quality and reduces operating costs inherent in broadcasting. In October 2019, the Togolese parliament passed a law authorising the DTT migration, a process that began a few years before the regulation was approved.\n\nThe government\u2019s plan was expected to kick off with the construction of nine digital transmission sites. However, it has stalled as DTT coverage in the French-speaking country remains low, and non-existent in rural areas.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nChina\u2019s 10,000 Villages Plan\n\nThe Chinese government\u2019s provision of satellite TV in Togo is part of a more extensive program in Africa, through which 10,000 villages in 20 countries are expected to receive DTT kits, with the aim of reducing the digital divide in rural Africa.\n\nSelected villages get solar-powered projector TVs, digital TV sets, satellite dishes, and decoders where they can watch 20 international and local channels free of charge. Local technicians also receive training on the installation and maintenance of the equipment.\n\nChinese media conglomerate StarTimes, contracted for the project, carried out the installation in neighboring West African countries Benin and Nigeria, where the company claims to have equipped public areas with satellite reception kits in 200 and 1,000 villages respectively. The same deployment was done in Uganda and Kenya.\n\nChinese presence in Africa\u2019s media\n\nStarTimes is one of the most popular pay-TV operators on the continent. Although it is technically a private company with no known government affiliation, the pay-TV operator plays a vital role in China\u2019s diplomacy push in Africa.\n\nChina\u2019s significant presence and influence in Africa, mainly in the areas of infrastructure development and trade, has expanded to include the media sector. Over the years, Beijing has invested significantly in the African media landscape, through projects like the DTT coverage.\n\nSeveral Chinese media organisations also boast a significant presence on the continent.\n\nThe state-funded Xinhua News Agency established a regional office in Nairobi in 2006 with a massive foreign correspondent network in Africa. It currently allows local media outlets to get content via its newswire without charge.\n\nThe China Global Television Network (CGTN) also has an African bureau headquartered in the Kenya capital, where it offers free and reduced broadcasting to television providers.\n\nBoth the China Daily publication and China Radio International have bureaus in Nairobi as well.\n\nA major aspect of StarTimes\u2019 ambitions in Africa is its ability to promote state broadcasters from the Asian nation, enabling easier access to Chinese content \u2013 from soap operas to news programmes. For instance, it broadcasts CGTN for free and offers the station with every subscription package.\n\nHowever, not all content on the platform is Chinese-produced. In addition to broadcasting Chinese and African national channels, StarTimes produces its own content in local languages, including Swahili, from its production facility in Nairobi.\n\nIn some ways, China\u2019s presence in the African media landscape has benefitted the region. The investment in the media industry has reportedly created hundreds of jobs and provided international training courses to many journalists, often in China.\n\nBut the Asian power\u2019s increasing investment in African media is seen as a strategy to positively shape its image, which is key to achieving Beijing\u2019s longer-term ambitions.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "This is the time to build the architecture for Africa\u2019s future \u2013 Ndubuisi Ekekwe on funding startups in Africa",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a child, Ndubuisi Ekekwe realised that excelling in his education was a guaranteed path to influence. That realisation drove him to apply himself, eventually resulting in him studying electrical and electronics engineering at the Federal University of Technology, Owerri.\n\nAfter graduation, he worked at various companies, including Diamond Bank and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) before moving to the US where he obtained a PhD in electrical and electronics engineering from Johns Hopkins University. Subsequently, he taught at Carnegie Mellon University before founding companies operating in the technology space.\n\nIn December 2020, Professor Ekekwe published an article on the Tekedia website, which he titled, \u201cFintechnolization of Platforms \u2013 Expect this Redesign in Startups.\u201d In the article, he argued that every digital platform would have to offer a financial service at some point if it must capture massive value.\n\nIn January 2021, he launched Tekedia Capital, an investment syndicate that allows individuals to invest in companies operating largely in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I made that postulation, I thought, \u2018if I have written this, how do I demonstrate that I\u2019m walking the talk?\u2019 So, that is how I started thinking about building our fintech solution within our ecosystem since, to a large extent, we have a couple of thousands of people here. That was how Tekedia Capital came about.\u201d\n\nStarting Tekedia Capital was not just about making money though. It was also driven by a desire to support a generation of African entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cI will say, to a large extent, that I am optimistic about this Cambrian moment of entrepreneurial capitalism in Africa. That this is the time to build the architecture for the new African future and having the right capital will make sure that the entrepreneurs will be successful in doing that.\u201d\n\nEkekwe is quick to point out that Tekedia Capital is not a VC fund but an investment syndicate. On the reason for choosing this model, he points out that becoming a VC fund increases ticket sizes and could result in worrying about big exits, adding that investing smaller amounts improves the chance of being bought out by bigger investors at subsequent raises.\n\nWith most members of the syndicate being angel investors, this flexibility is key.\n\n\u201cMost people who are still investing at a personal level want to have that flexibility but VCs may like it to get very big.\u201d\n\nEven with this, the firm does not invest less than $70,000 in startups, often going as high as $700,000.\n\nHow Tekedia Capital works\n\nWith an annual fee of $1,000, or its local equivalent, investors get access to Tekedia Capital\u2019s deal flow for four investment cycles or 12 months in situations where Tekedia Capital does not have up to four investment cycles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor investors in the syndicate, the minimum investment in a startup is $10,000 or its local equivalent. In addition to the $1,000 required to gain access, Tekedia Capital charges a 20% carried interest of the invested amount.\n\nSince its launch, the syndicate has invested in up to ten startups, including Y Combinator portfolio company, Mecho Autotech; on-demand helicopter booking startup Vetifly; and online checkout startup, OurPass. Investments in startups are determined by members of the syndicate and not Tekedia Capital.\n\nIt operates a lean model with a small team that sources and vets deals before presenting them to the syndicate\u2019s members.\n\nMembers of the syndicate come from various professional backgrounds, and this means that Tekedia Capital can get professional advice from someone with experience in a sector before investing.\n\nInvestment thesis\n\nTekedia Capital invests in early-stage technology-anchored startups with most of their operations based in Africa. It is also sector-agnostic although there is a bias towards startups that are hard to automate.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to invest in a company that someone in Silicon Valley will automate. So, you\u2019re not going to see us invest in businesses like Twitter or Instagram because there is no inherent geographical advantage that it gives you as an innovator in Lagos. You have to be physically present.\u201d\n\nWhen choosing startups to invest in, Ekekwe discloses that the syndicate picks startups with teams that show the required technical and managerial abilities. The team must also be able to go beyond customer acquisition to making fans of their customers.\n\nIn my conversations with early-stage investors, a common thought expressed is how there is very little data available on a startup that could aid the due diligence process and so in many cases, the decision on whether to invest in a startup could come down to the founder.\n\nEkekwe reveals that beyond a founder\u2019s technical or managerial capabilities, it is important to know what motivates the person.\n\n\u201cI like to know our startup founders. I don\u2019t want to invest in someone whose motivations I don\u2019t understand. I just want to know if this is a guy that will stop picking calls if you send him $300,000 so we put significant effort into trying to understand exactly who our founders are.\u201d\n\nFounders who meet Tekedia Capital\u2019s requirements can apply for investment by sending an email to capital@fasmicro.com.\n\nBuilding Africa\u2019s future\n\nAfrica still suffers a huge infrastructural deficit and the capital required to plug the hole means that only a few entrepreneurs would bother with it. Ekekwe understands this and points out that despite the growth experienced by software startups, those are not the innovations that would ultimately drive Africa\u2019s economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe biggest opportunity in Africa today is building infrastructure but they don\u2019t bring in a lot of money. We need to build seaports, better broadband in rural communities, a better logistics system that will make eCommerce work, and we also need electricity that works. These are the infrastructure that power innovation but you don\u2019t expect small VCs or entrepreneurs to deal with that. However, those are the things that will facilitate Africa\u2019s growth.\u201d\n\nWhile conceding that entrepreneurs cannot be expected to drive this growth, he expressed hope that as more exits are recorded in the startup scene, more founders will be willing to take on projects of this nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry*, a 9-year-old student, was diagnosed with dysgraphia when he was seven years old. He has trouble gripping a pencil, which always leads to hand cramps and fatigue.\n\n\u201cHenry\u2019s handwriting was unusual and inconsistent. It was sad to see him struggle to write at home because it seemed like his teachers were punishing him by having him write in class,\u201d Henry\u2019s dad recalls.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), writing necessitates a complex set of motor and information processing skills which includes the ability to organise thoughts coherently and then write them down on paper.\n\nHowever, dysgraphia impairs these abilities in varying degrees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPrior to the diagnosis, I had received numerous reports from his teachers indicating that my son was lazy and unable to write. They advised me to withdraw him. But Henry was a natural communicator. He could speak and express himself clearly in words. I knew something was wrong. So, in 2019, I took him for diagnosis,\u201d his dad says.\n\nDysgraphia is a neurological condition that impairs writing and fine motor skills. It is a learning disability that affects both children and adults, and it affects almost every aspect of the writing process, including spelling, legibility, word spacing, and sizing.\n\nLiving with dysgraphia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDysgraphia is a condition that has received little attention from researchers globally. As a result, estimating the prevalence of dysgraphia is difficult.\n\nHowever, according to research, Dr Reynold Cecil Randy, an American psychology professor, estimates that the prevalence of dysgraphia ranges from 5 to 20% in the world. Besides, men are more likely to suffer from dysgraphia than women.\n\nTypically, dysgraphia appears when children are first introduced to writing. Despite thorough instruction, they write incorrectly sized and spaced letters or misspell words, resulting in poor handwriting.\n\nNevertheless, dysgraphia may remain unnoticed from childhood until adulthood.\n\nWhen dysgraphia appears in childhood, it is usually due to a problem with orthographic coding.\n\nThe International Dyslexia Association (IDA), a non-profit education and advocacy organisation devoted to issues surrounding dyslexia, describes orthographic coding as the ability to store written words in working memory while the letters in words are analysed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe IDA also describes it as the ability to form long-term memories of written words associated with their pronunciation and meaning.\n\nAdditionally, children with dysgraphia do not have a primary developmental motor disorder, another cause of poor handwriting. Nonetheless, they may struggle to plan sequential finger movements without visual feedback, such as touching the thumb to successive fingers on the same hand.\n\nAccording to a study, students with dysgraphia may struggle to learn, complete coursework, communicate, record ideas, demonstrate knowledge, and keep up with their peers and teachers\u2019 instructions.\n\nThis can also cause or exacerbate emotional, academic, and social development deficits in students, as well as \u201cimpact factors like self-efficacy, self-esteem, anxiety, and depression, all of which are linked to educational motivation, achievement, and persistence.\u201d\n\nIn adults, it is most prevalent following a traumatic event and is usually associated with damage to the brain\u2019s parietal lobe.\n\nIndividuals with dysgraphia frequently use incorrect words to convey their message. For instance, instead of saying \u201cchild,\u201d they say \u201cboy.\u201d\n\nEven so, children with dysgraphia may have good oral skills, but they may be misunderstood as lazy and uninterested or indifferent because they cannot write.\n\nIn summary, dysgraphia makes it difficult for children and adults to plan and execute a sentence, words, or even letters in writing. Therefore, it\u2019s not as if individuals with dysgraphia can\u2019t read, spell, or recognise letters and words. It\u2019s just that their brains struggle to process words and write.\n\nSo, it is critical to understand that dysgraphia is a neurological disorder, not a cognitive impairment.\n\nRelationship between dysgraphia and dyslexia\n\nDysgraphia was initially grouped with dyslexia until 1936 when Anna Gillingham \u2014 an educator and psychologist best known for her contributions to the Orton-Gillingham method of teaching dyslexic children to read \u2014 led a series of workshops on reading, spelling, and handwriting, according to a study.\n\nDyslexia and dysgraphia are language-based disorders. However, while dyslexia affects reading, dysgraphia affects writing.\n\nMoreso, both disabilities make it difficult for people to convert phonemes (sounds) into graphemes (letters in written form). That is, they affect the ability to spell.\n\nAccording to Lexercise, a Structured Language Therapy programme based on the Orton Gillingham methodology for children with learning disabilities, language disorders can occur independently or in conjunction with other problems.\n\nTherefore, dysgraphia can coexist with other learning disabilities such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\n\nAssistive technology for Dysgraphia\n\nSome beneficial assistive technologies (AT) can help students and adults with dysgraphia access information and demonstrate what they know in writing.\n\nA study by the University of Washington shows that finding a set of appropriate AT tools and techniques for a specific individual may necessitate some trial and error.\n\nTherefore, a person with a learning disability should be involved in the selection of their technology. They should assist in determining what works for them.\n\nHere are five AT tools that can be tested, discarded, adapted or refined by students with dysgraphia.\n\n1. Pencil Grips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Consortium\n\nDesigned in 1992 by Dr Lois Provda, an educational therapist, the Pencil Grip is used extensively in classrooms, homes, and therapeutic settings.\n\nPencil Grips are small attachments that are placed at the end of a pencil. They assist a child in grasping a pencil practically and accurately.\n\nWhen used correctly, a Pencil Grip can help develop fine motor skills and handwriting control. Its distinctive, one-of-a-kind design gently allows the fingers and hand to rest in the correct gripping position.\n\nWith a Pencil Grip that fits over the pencil, the thumb, index, and middle fingers are perfectly positioned. When a child grasps a pencil correctly, they write faster and neater without tiring out their hand muscles.\n\nBecause there are so many different Pencil Grips, it\u2019s critical to understand a child\u2019s specific needs.\n\nFor example, there is a Pencil Grip with built-in guards for students who wrap their thumbs around their index fingers. With this type of Pencil Grip, their fingers may find it easier to maintain proper posture with the protectors on.\n\n2. Slant boards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Amazon\n\nWriting on a slanted surface is a common biomechanical strategy occupational therapists employ to promote proper wrist position and improve handwriting.\n\nAccording to a recent study by Nova Southeastern University (NSU) in Florida, \u201cthe handwriting task is modified by elevating the upper extremity to stabilise the wrist in extension while also allowing the hand and forearm to rest on a supportive surface when using a slant board set at 20 degrees.\u201d\n\nThe slant board aids handwriting by facilitating proper posture and gradually developing proximal stability.\n\nThe concept behind using a slant board to improve pencil grip is based on wrist position.\n\nTo produce legible written work, a student must move their wrist and elbow in a fluid motion. To be effective, the wrist must be extended or up-bent.\n\nSo, the slant board promotes wrist extension when writing by causing the wrist to extend while the fingers flex and naturally fall into a better writing position.\n\n3. Graphic Organisers\n\nPeople with learning disabilities are often visual learners and thinkers, according to the Learning Disabilities Association of America. This means when ideas, words, and concepts are associated with pictures, diagrams, charts, and maps, they understand and remember such information better.\n\nHence, the need to adopt graphic organisers.\n\nGraphic organisers are simple but powerful tools that can help people with dysgraphia, executive functioning issues, or other issues that cause writing difficulties.\n\nGraphic organisers are visual thinking tools that help individuals visualise their ideas. The images show relationships between facts, concepts, or ideas and guide their thinking as they create the map or diagram.\n\nThese graphic organisers range from Venn diagrams, concept maps, mind maps to flowing charts.\n\nVenn diagrams demonstrate how different things or ideas can overlap to show, compare, or contrast relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: The Data Science Venn Diagram \u2014 Drew Conway\n\nConcept maps help organise information, brainstorm ideas, visualising them, and planning what you want to write.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: PM-Training.net\n\nMind maps are graphical representations of hierarchical data that include a central idea surrounded by connected branches of related topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Venngage\n\nThey\u2019re excellent for generating new ideas, solving problems, and illustrating relationships and/or process components. XMind, Mindly and Coggle are examples of mind mapping software.\n\nFlow charts are graphic organisers that show how different steps in a process interact with each other. This makes them valuable tools for communicating how methods work and documenting how a particular job is done.\n\nMapping a process in a flow chart format can help clarify the process and show where the process can be improved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Hubspot\n\n4. Keyboards and touchscreens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Tech News Inc\n\nHandwriting can be painful and tiring for people with dysgraphia, so typing written work on a computer is essential.\n\nUsing keyboards and touchscreens allows them to enter letters and words by typing or touching the screen. So, a keyboard with alphabetical keys or vowels and consonants in different colours may be the perfect fit for someone with dysgraphia.\n\n5. Dictation\n\nDictation technology, also known as speech-to-text, voice-to-text, voice recognition, or speech recognition technology, assists people who have difficulty writing. It converts spoken words into text.\n\nInstead of writing by hand or with a keyboard, dictation allows people to write words by speaking them aloud. People can use dictation to write, edit, and revise their work.\n\nWhile there are built-in dictation tools in devices such as computers, smartphones, digital tablets, and Chromebooks, there are also web-based, app-based, and software dictation tools.\n\nOther tools that can be used\n\nTools like predictive text, writing guide, raised-line paper, lettering stencils, electronic dictionaries and Thesaurus, and Word Banks are examples of other tools that can help people with dysgraphia.\n\nGrammarly is an app that assists people with spelling and grammar that they might overlook because they focus on content rather than writing.\n\nEvernote is a note-taking app that allows people to photograph worksheets and type answers directly into the blanks. It can also be synchronised across devices, giving users access to notes and other items no matter where they are working.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that a person with a learning disability cannot be cured with AT as there is no known cure for any learning disability.\n\nRegardless, rather than focusing on a person\u2019s disabilities, AT tools allow them to demonstrate and apply their intelligence and knowledge.\n\nConsequently, with occupational therapy and support from parents, teachers, and loved ones, AT tools can help people with dysgraphia to reach their full potential in school and at home.\n\n* \u2013 not real name\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest , a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nCelebrating access to information\n\nHome for the homeless\n\nMeeting Abake Adenle\n\nGokada in Ibadan\n\nOn this day for universal access to information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Sara Kurfe\u00df on Unsplash Photo by AbsolutVision on Unsplash\n\nWait, is that even a thing? Yes, it is. In 2015, at the 74th United Nations (UN) General Assembly, September 28 was declared the International Day for Universal Access to Information (IDUAI).\n\nFor what? You might ask. Access to information is a core part of the fundamental right of freedom of expression. I mean, what do you express without access to information?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a problem. In 2021 alone, Africa lost an estimated $454 million between January and August due to varying degrees of Internet blackouts and social media shutdowns by governments. Add to this zero transparency in governmental activities, and what you have is freedom of access to information dragged in the mud.\n\nWait for it. Going by the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act passed by the National Assembly in 2011, Nigerians are entitled to know the budget for projects executed by their local government chairmen. This also includes money collected in tax and how it was spent. Sadly that isn\u2019t the case today.\n\nOur reporters, Oluwanifemi and Emmanuel, did a deep dive, where they extensively discussed the right to access information, with opinions from senior journalists from different companies in between. Read here.\n\nA foundation\u2019s move to empower homeless children in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Destiny Trust Children Foundation Webpage\n\nIt\u2019s the 21st century, the age of technology. There is access to information, and yes, there are still homeless people trying to make it from one day to the next. Reports show that there are an estimated 24.4 million homeless people in Nigeria alone. Sadly, this number takes children into account.\n\nStatistics don\u2019t bleed. There\u2019s a tendency to downplay the severity of situations when figures are bandied around. In the comfort of one\u2019s bed, it\u2019s easy to feel like homeless statistics are just figures. But these figures speak of actual people \u2014 adults and children.\n\nEnter The Destiny Trust Children Foundation. In 2012, Abimbola Ojenike, a practising lawyer in Lagos, noticed children roaming the streets during school hours, and after some investigation, he discovered they were homeless. Getting friends in on the vision, they co-founded a foundation to help house, educate, and empower these children with tech skills.\n\nSix years and outlets in three Nigerian cities later, the foundation has established two innovative hubs and reached out to about 15,000 children in Nigeria.\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeeting Abake Adenle, an African speech recognition engineer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbake Adenle Source: Supplied\n\nThe question \u201cwhat do you want to be in future?\u201d is one that we all probably heard a zillion times while growing up. That people ask with good intentions doesn\u2019t change the fact that the future isn\u2019t set in stone; adventure, curiosity, and diversity are unavoidable parts of life.\n\nNigerian-American software engineer, Abake Adenle, went from studying electrical engineering to working 9-5 at a UK-based investment bank to taking the road less travelled \u2014 building a speech recognition API for five African languages. Add to the mix a passion for teaching, adventure, and solving problems.\n\nIn came the accolades. In July 2021, she was recognised by the Women in Voice (WiV) for her outstanding contributions to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in voice.\n\nOn yesterday\u2019s episode of The Experts, a bi-weekly series where tech career specialists take us on their journey from newbie to expert, Oluwanifemi had an exciting chat with Abake. Read her story here.\n\nGokada wants to replicate past Lagos traction in Ibadan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage credit: Gokada\n\nThe same Gokada? Well, if you mean the bike-hailing and last-mile delivery platform whose motorcycle transport services growth in Lagos was halted mid-flight by the state government-imposed ban on bikes in February 2020, then yes, it\u2019s the same Gokada.\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? Well, the Nigeria-based startup has announced its launch in the Southwestern city of Ibadan. For now, inhabitants can access food delivery (GFood) and logistics services (GSend) via the Gokada SuperApp while waiting for ride-hailing and a proposed eCommerce store to be launched later this year.\n\nReplication and competition. Their logistics services seem to have gained traction in Lagos, as the company says it has completed more than 1.5 million deliveries on behalf of 30,000 merchants. The startup is looking to replicate that growth in Ibadan in both its logistics and forthcoming transport services.\n\nWith the established presence of SafeBoda in Ibadan, will we see a power tussle, or is it a case of the sky being big enough for every bird to fly?\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nThe Internet Dream.

          "title": "Nigerian airlines go to Ethiopia for cheaper maintenance costs",
          "text": "Nigerian airlines are seeking cheaper locations to repair and maintain their aircrafts as dollar scarcity persists and worsen.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s aviation analyst on a trip to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and has seen that Ethiopian Airlines maintenance facility has aircrafts and engines belonging to some Nigerian airlines undergoing routine and other levels of maintenance.\n\nPeople familiar with the matter say Nigerian airlines get foreign exchange from unofficial sources at about N550 per dollar, making it difficult to carry out their scheduled maintenance as at when due. This development has made airlines to re-strategise on affordable options to get their maintenance done.\n\nSome of Nigeria\u2019s domestic carries have plans to start local Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul, (MRO) facilities. This is not a reality yet and airlines are ferrying their aircraft to facilities offering cheaper rates.\n\nFor instance, some airlines are ferrying their aircraft to Ethiopia for periodic maintenance as the country offers them cheaper maintenance options than Europe and America, BusinessDay\u2019s findings show.\n\nBusinessDay also learnt that some Nigerian airlines recently took their aircraft back to Nigeria from Ethiopia after completing comprehensive maintenance.\n\nRead also: Airport ground handlers to earn extra N15bn annually\n\nHenok Yazew Haile, acting manager, sales and marketing Ethiopian Airlines told BusinessDay that Nigerian airlines are bringing their aircraft for maintenance in Ethiopia airline\u2019s MRO facility because aircraft maintenance are cheaper here than in Europe, America and other continents.\n\nHaile disclosed that they had just carried out maintenance on Medview aircraft and Air Peace Boeing 777 in Ethiopia, while Arik Air is currently rebranding its aircraft the paint hangar section of Ethiopia Airlines\u2019 MRO.\n\nHe further disclosed that the firm is receiving orders to maintain more aircraft from Nigerian airlines and other countries.\n\n\u201cMore Nigerian airlines come here because of cost. We are cheaper than Europe or US. We are the first choice for aircraft maintenance of African airlines. We are Africans, we have to grow each other and support each other. Ethiopian Airlines is the pride of Africa. So every African carrier should come to Ethiopia, he said.\n\nHaile however declined to speak on the average cost to maintain an aircraft in Ethiopia.\n\nEthiopian MRO performs the base and line maintenances under the approval of Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority (ETCAA). The base maintenance (Airframe, Engine and Component shops) has the FAA PART 145 Repair Station approvals since September 1968 and currently approved for B737, B757, B767, B777, B787, Q400 and MD11.\n\nEthiopian MRO also holds EASA PART 145 approvals for both base and line maintenance at Addis Ababa for B737NG, B757, B767 and B777\n\nIn addition, the Ethiopian MRO base facility has the accreditation of Boeing as well as Bombardier as approve service facility.\n\nHowever, Obi Mbanuzuo, chief operating officer, Dana Air said Dana Air has not maintained its aircraft in Ethiopia but when its B737 was due for C-check Dana sent a Request for Quote (RFQ) to all its accredited MROs that it hoped to work with.\n\nAccording to Mbanuzuo, Ukraine, Ethiopian airlines and a maintenance facility in Naples Italy quoted for the job, adding that these quotes are not just a function of price but also turnaround time, warranty, who supplies parts and other things.\n\nHe said after careful evaluation of all the quotes, it awarded the job to Naples and the aircraft went and is already back in Nigeria.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s checks show that it takes airlines an average of 30 to 50 days to carry out aircraft maintenance in Ethiopia depending on the work scope.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that if we request RFQ, what Ethiopian Airlines give to Arik (NG Eagle) might be much lower than what they give us (Dana) as they already have a relationship with Arik. In the same way we have done business with Atitech in Italy for at least 10 years and get food rates from them,\u201d Mbanuzuo disclosed.\n\nGeorge Uriesi, chief operating officer at Ibom Air said Ibom Air hasn\u2019t maintained its aircraft in Ethiopia so it is difficult to say how affordable maintenance is at Ethiopia\u2019s MRO.\n\nUriesi told BusinessDay that strategically though, to avoid exorbitant maintenance costs, Ibom Air is focused on ensuring that all its maintenance is done in Uyo in the shortest possible time.\n\nA C- check on a Boeing 737 which is conducted between 12 to 18months cost the airlines between 800,000 dollars to 1million dollars. This amount does not include the cost of ferrying the aircraft abroad and other charges which will amount to over 200,000 dollars.\n\nJohn Ojikutu, member of aviation industry think tank group, Aviation Round Table (ART) and chief executive of Centurion Securities, told BusinessDay that one single C-check on one Boeing aircraft cost between 800,000 to 1million dollars.\n\nOjikutu said this amount is enough to wipe out one year profit made by an airline, so if they get cheaper maintenance options, they will explore these options.\n\nNigerian airlines are also setting up MRO facilities in a bid to reduce capital flight, save cost and create job opportunities locally.\n\nAirPeace, United Airlines and Ibom Air have concluded plans to set up MROs in Anambra Enugu and Akwa Ibom States respectively, with other airlines expected to pool into this as a way of getting the local industry to thrive better.\n\nAir Peace is partnering with the Anambra State Government to get Embraer of Brazil, the world\u2019s fourth largest civilian aircraft manufacturer, to locate an MRO service centre for Africa in the state.",

          "text": "Crude oil prices have risen nearly 45 percent from January\u2019s price of $54.77 per barrel to the current $80.12 as of Tuesday, but Nigeria\u2019s petrol subsidy costs have risen 10 times faster at 488 percent, wiping out the gains of higher oil prices.\n\nThe Federal Government spent an estimated N149.28 billion subsidising petrol in August, an increase of 488 percent compared with the N25.37 billion spent in January.\n\n\u201cThe economic case for the removal of Nigeria\u2019s fuel subsidy regime is mounting by the day and the present administration seems undecided on how to proceed,\u201d Joe Nwakwue, former chairman, Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), told BusinessDay.\n\nA higher oil price is a double-edged sword for Nigeria, who on one hand hopes for higher oil prices to be able to implement its budget and on the other hand spends more to maintain an expensive petrol subsidy regime when oil prices go up.\n\nBetween January and August, a total of N905.27 billion has been incurred as subsidy cost, according to presentations to Federation Account and Allocation Committee (FAAC) meetings seen by BusinessDay.\n\nAccording to the document, Nigeria incurred a subsidy cost of N60.40 billion in February, N111.97 billion in March, N126.30 billion in April, and N114.34 billion in May.\n\nThe subsidy cost rose from N143.29 billion in June to N175.32 billion in July, but fell to N149.28 billion in August, according to NNPC\u2019s records.\n\nAnalysts have long said the subsidy cost is denying the country value that could have accrued from higher oil prices.\n\nRead also: Nigeria will struggle to meet OPEC oil quota till 2022\n\nThe UN Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) says Nigeria\u2019s 13.2 million out of school children are the world\u2019s highest. But the cost of subsidising petrol is 10 times larger than the entire 2021 budget of N94.4 billion meant to pay for free Universal Basic Education.\n\nThe implication of this is that Nigeria is spending less money providing basic education than it spends subsidising the cost of petrol, which experts have severally described \u201cas economic waste amid scarce resources.\u201d\n\nThis also means less investment into the healthcare sector where in the last 56 days, resident doctors across public health facilities in the country have been on strike demanding higher pay from the government.\n\nAlthough the recently signed Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) provides for the deregulation of the downstream sector, President Muhammadu Buhari had ordered that petrol subsidies remain in place for the next five to six months to enable the government carry out wide consultations before reaching a final decision on the issue.\n\nWith oil prices soaring, experts say the Federal Government may have to start borrowing to sustain subsidy payments as more volumes of imported petrol get smuggled across the border where it is sold for twice the pump price in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe cost of stopping smuggling is getting higher than the cost of subsidy, which is unsustainable,\u201d Niyi Awodeyi, CEO at Subterra Energy Resources Limited, said.\n\nThe Federal Government had mobilised some federal agencies like the Customs, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Police, Civil Defence Corps and others, to curb the menace of fuel smuggling, but it is not clear how much this has had.\n\nSmugglers are constantly devising new tactics to outsmart the system and create other routes of transporting petroleum products to neighbouring countries where they sell at higher prices.\n\n\u201cThe fuel subsidy is a mess, a mess that President Buhari, who marketed himself as a mess cleaner, has had problems with cleaning up,\u201d noted Awodeyi, saying, \u201cWe are yet to see any significant changes either in the pattern of petrol consumption or subsidy payments.\u201d\n\nSeveral efforts to reach EFCC\u2019s spokesman Wilson Uwujaren through calls and text messages proved abortive as at close of business on Tuesday.\n\nOver the years, Nigeria, Africa\u2019s top oil exporter, has made producing its own fuel a priority, but efforts to revamp its refineries have failed, leaving it almost entirely reliant on imports.",

          "text": "At the end of a meeting Monday by governors of Nigeria\u2019s Northern states, where the contentious Value Added Tax (VAT), rotational presidency and other issues were focal, it appeared the group may have mistaken the VAT for sales tax.\n\nWhile a communiqu\u00e9 following the meeting claimed Southern governors agitating to administer VAT were confusing it for sales tax, BusinessDay findings show that sales tax was what transformed into VAT in 1993.\n\n\u201cVAT is being confused by these state governments as a sales tax,\u201d said Simon Lalong, chairman, Northern Governors\u2019 Forum, in reference to increasing agitations and some legislations by Southern Governors to control VAT administration.\n\n\u201cIf every state enacted their own VAT law, multiple taxations will result in the increase of prices of goods and services and collapse inter-state trade. VAT is not a production tax like excise terminal tax, which is paid by the ultimate consumer,\u201d he further said.\n\nHowever, the antecedents of VAT in Nigeria indicate that it was formerly the Sales Tax administered by states, which was transformed into VAT in 1993. In essence, sales tax stopped to exist following the commencement of VAT.\n\nRead also: VAT dispute is constitutional, not capacity of states to collect\n\nAccording to the VAT Tax of 1993, \u201cThe tax shall be charged and payable on the supply of all goods and services (in this Act referred to as \u201ctaxable goods and services\u201d) other than goods and services listed in the first schedule to this Act.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Ijewere, who was chairman of the committee that established VAT in Nigeria, had said in an interview that it was a recommendation by the World Bank when it was observed that a lot of the states were not financially viable but could raise a lot of capital as tax from their own bases.\n\n\u201cThey recommended that Nigeria should replace sales tax with value added tax,\u201d he said, subsequently, leading a 28-man team he called \u2018modified value added tax committee.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe salient point is first and foremost, VAT was the replacement of sales tax, which was conceived by the states, and therefore that revenue was meant for the states,\u201d he emphasised.\n\nAccording to Ijewere, the thinking was to create competition between states, so that they can do well and improve on their collection capacity.\n\nHowever, while his committee recommended every state retain 95 percent of whatever was collected and 5 percent goes to the collection body, it was not followed.\n\nWhat emanated is the current sharing formula, which sees states getting 50 percent, local governments 35 percent and the Federal Government, 15 percent.\n\nThe sharing of the portion that accrues to states has in particular been contentious; with some state governments alleging that what they get following monthly disbursements is lower than what they contribute to the national pool.\n\nIt would be recalled that a communiqu\u00e9 issued following an earlier meeting by Southern governors had indicated support for states collection of VAT, stating, \u201cThe meeting resolved to support the position that the collection of VAT falls within the powers of the states.\u201d",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nAs we approach Osun 2022 governorship election, I want to advise Governor Oyetola to explore responsible and result oriented channels to resolve his perceived dispute with Aregbesola. This advice has become necessary to prevent Governor Oyetola from being used as an attack dog by certain unscrupulous political cabal that is hell bent on taking Osun State back to the dark days of multifaceted high profile of lawlessness and political thuggery.\n\nI want to remind Governor Oyetola of the robust relationship he once had with Aregbesola as his chief of staff. I urge Governor Oyetola to thread with caution so as not to expose him to further public ridicule and media fireworks capable of making him politically irrelevant during Osun 2022 and 2023 elections.\n\nOsun policy reversal and recent persistent media attacks on Aregbesola is purely political and a planned blackmail strategy by a political caucus in Osun to deliberately undermine the landmark achievements of Aregbesola both as governor and as present minister of interior and the process of building popularity for this unscrupulous caucus.\n\nThe strong desire by Governor Oyetola to pull down Aregbesola at all cost for personal and the cabal interest was responsible for his group recent misleading comments about Osun debt and policy reversal.Governor Oyetola group cannot on the basis of losing out in ministerial appointment resort to cheap policy reversal and character assassination.\n\nYou cannot kill the truth about Aregbesola\u2019s achievements in Osun State. It is worrisome to hear supporters of Governor Oyetola casting unmerited aspersions on Aregbesola whom they once had robust and rewarding relationship.\n\nOsun policy reversal is ignoring facts and promoting conspiracy. The policy reversal is ignoring Rauf Aregbesola developmental legacy in Osun for 8 years and promoting conspiracy against Aregbesola as Osun approaches 2022 governorship election. Osun policy reversal has failed because it has not be back-up by any meaningful project and it has no impact on the great people of Osun State. School children are attending schools built by Rauf Aregbesola and few people are talking about policy reversal without projects to back it up. The recent Osun government\u2019s education and planned local government policy reversal are political decision. The present government in Osun did not campaign with education and local government administration reversal during the 2018 election but it campaigned with consolidation. Is Policy reversal Supporting projects of Sustainable development in Osun?\n\nOsun policy reversal has failed to capture the aggregate projects of the general standard of living of the people in terms of access to education, health care, housing, security, potable water and high life expectancy etc . Osun policy reversal will not improve and to some extent will lead to deteriorated standard of living. Osun Policy reversal has become an issue of blackmail and smear campaign against Aregbesola\u2019s legacy\n\nI look forward to the day that President Buhari will be invited to commission projects that have been executed under the Osun policy reversal whether in education or local government administration. Osun policy reversal must be matched by projects execution and I wonder whether President Buhari will be invited to Osun to commission policy reversal without a single project to show for it. I am surprise that there is no single project that is attached to policy reversal in Osun. I do not understand whether policy reversal will be a strategy to win Osun 2022 governorship election. Promoters of Osun policy reversal must match it with sustainable development projects.\n\nWhat could have propelled a state rich in human capital in the last 10 years to prefer the choice of policy reversal over sustainable development projects since 2019? What could have precipitated the rejection of a manifesto-driven development in preference for \u201cI will put smile on your faces\u201d sloganeering?\n\nThe emerging smear campaign which is a clear copy of few people propaganda against the erstwhile Aregbesola administration is planned to unfold in stages between now and 2022 Osun governorship election with out-right character assassination photo-shopped pictures and condemnation of the former governor, and his programmes to whittle-down impact of his achievements by recruiting many unwary third-parties both in the media and even amongst pastors to act as cannon-fodders in furtherance of the lies discrediting the former governor.\n\nOsun policy reversal is rather a divisive political schemes and blackmail which is a new orchestrated campaign of calumny and smear tactics launched by a vicious few people who are amassing armada of falsehood, misinformation and fabrications aimed at discrediting the person, government and programme of the former governor of Osun State, His Excellency Rauf Aregbesola with a view to distorting and discrediting his widely acknowledge stellar performance in 8 years as governor of Osun State.\n\nI wish therefore to advise those employing desperate antics of blackmail, and smear campaigns against Rauf Aregbesola, to have a rethink because their campaign would not change the stands of the good people of Osun State. I have been drawn to the antics of some few elements in the social media, employing desperate antics of blackmail, and smear campaigns against Aregbesola\u2019s good and developmental legacy in Osun State. For his courage, consistence and never-say-die spirit, Aregbesola, would undoubtedly, have a tribe of hard critics, cynics and bitter foes. However, it is uncharitable to link him with \u2018policy reversal\u2019 and failure.\n\nRecent blackmail, smear campaign won\u2019t distract Aregbesola. The decision by the Osun State Government to introduce a bill against parliamentary system for local government administration in the state has sparked off controversy in Osun State. Policy reversal is a calculated attempt to blackmail former Governor Rauf Aregbesola and showed some people are jealous of Aregbesola\u2019s achievements in Osun state in 8 years. Many people are aware of past and present developments in Osun state.\n\nPolicy reversal has deliberately resorted to cheap propaganda, mischief and blackmail to cause division between Osun people and Aregbesola.\n\nThis can only be part of the unrelenting campaign of calumny and the ceaseless peddling of pernicious propaganda against former Governor Aregbesola. Aregbesola\u2019s preoccupation has been and continues to be how to develop Osun and deliver on his promised rescue Agenda to the good people of Osun when he came to office. And he has received applause and commendations from far and near for being so focused and unrelenting in the pursuit of his vision for the state. Aregbesola will not be distracted by any form of organised and orchestrated blackmail from any quarters, God willing; he will continue to deliver on his promises as minister of interior.\n\n______________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald, writes from Osogbo, Osun State.\n\n...",
          "summary": "You cannot kill the truth about Aregbesola\u2019s achievements in Osun State.\nOsun policy reversal has failed because it has not be back-up by any meaningful project and it has no impact on the great people of Osun State.\nOsun policy reversal will not improve and to some extent will lead to deteriorated standard of living.\nOsun policy reversal must be matched by projects execution and I wonder whether President Buhari will be invited to Osun to commission policy reversal without a single project to show for it.\nThe decision by the Osun State Government to introduce a bill against parliamentary system for local government administration in the state has sparked off controversy in Osun State.",

          "text": "The Managing Director/CEO of Heritage Bank Limited, Mr Ifie Sekibo, has said the Nigerian government must resolve the identity management system challenges in the country to empower commercial lenders to extend credit to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with less worry.\n\nSpeaking at the Finance Correspondents Association of Nigeria\u2019s (FICAN) 30th-anniversary conference and awards with the theme: \u201cFinancing infrastructure & SMEs for inclusive growth in the post-COVID-19 economy\u201d, which was held in Lagos at the weekend, Sekibo noted that until the country developed an identity management system that delivers value to the citizenry, SMEs will continue to grapple with financing challenges.\n\nThe Heritage Bank boss, who was represented by Olusegun Akanji, Divisional Head, Strategy and Business Solutions, explained that \u201cThough the banking industry has financed a lot of SMEs in terms of count, it is the sector that has the largest numbers of bad loans and frauds in terms of count.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the government needs to also put in place enabling policies that will support the private sector to complement the government\u2019s efforts at bridging the country\u2019s infrastructure deficit.\n\nHe added that the government alone cannot solve the country\u2019s infrastructure challenges, noting that it is the private sector that will deliver the solution.\n\n\u201cWe need the global private sector intervention to help us achieve a vision of infrastructural development,\u201d Sekibo also said.\n\nIn her own remarks, the Managing Director/CEO, Fidelity Bank Plc, Mrs Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe, who was represented by Osaigbovo Omorogbe, Divisional Head, SME Banking, said though banks are willing to support SMEs, many of them lack capacity.\n\nHe argued that, \u201cCommercial banks are not running away from supporting SMEs but joining hands with the government and other stakeholders to refinance all of what you see around infrastructure which is critical to the economy.\n\n\u201cI think the questions that should be answered for every proposal are, \u2018Is it bankable? If you are going into this, what structure should be in place to ensure that the funds we are going to put in will be recovered back because we have stakeholders and investors who are also looking towards a good result\u2019?\u201d\n\nThe former Acting Managing Director, Bank of Industry (BOI), Dr. Waheed Olagunju, called on the government and the private sector to boost the capacity of the SMEs sector.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWe need to build the capacity of our people; the government and the organised private sector have a role to play.\u201d\n\nHe added that there must be a way of helping the SMEs as the engine of growth in the economy, pointing out that the demand side and the absorptive capacity of the SME must be looked into.\n\n\u201cI believe that the government and private sector development partnership will help. We need to work on the ecosystem looking at what other countries have done: they invested in industrial parks and technology as a short-term measure\u201d.\n\nHe said the world is awash with investable funds of more than $17 trillion, stressing that Nigeria is one of the best investment environments in the world.\n\n\u201cInvestors are looking for where to invest and return-on-investment in Nigeria, prior to COVID-19, was one of the highest in the world. According to UN statistics, Nigeria was ranked between 21 and 35 per cent on Return-on-Investment, Nigeria has the highest foreign direct investment in Africa. The world wants to do business with Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, Mr Bola Koko, Managing Director of FMDQ Group, represented by Yomi Osinubi, said, \u201cIf you want SMEs to get the best benefits of infrastructure development in the country, the CBN Governor mentioned the largest areas to focus which is energy; the second-largest is the logistics \u2013 movements of cargo around the country,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Roger Hunt, a member of England\u2019s 1966 World Cup winning squad and Liverpool\u2019s second-highest goalscorer ever, has died at the age of 83.\n\nHunt was central figure in Sir Alf Ramsey\u2019s England squad that delivered the nation\u2019s first and only World Cup win in \u201966, playing in attack alongside Sir Geoff Hurst. He played in all six games for England in the tournament and scored three goals.\n\nHunt was overlooked for a knighthood, prompting Liverpool fans to affectionately coin the nickname \u2018Sir Roger\u2019. Hunt received an MBE in 2000.\n\nHunt, who was born in Glazebury in Lancashire in 1938, scored 285 goals in 492 matches for Liverpool, with his debut coming in September 1959. On the international scene, Hunt played 34 times for England and netted 18 goals.\n\nHe was key man under the guidance of legendary Liverpool manager Bill Shankly, scoring 41 goals in 41 games in the side that won the second tier in 1961-62. His partnership in attack with Ian St John, who passed away in March, is fondly remembered in Liverpool\u2019s glittering history.\n\nHunt also enjoyed the distinction of scoring the first goal ever shown on the BBC\u2019s Match of the Day highlights programme, a looping volley into the top corner during a 3-2 win over Arsenal on August 22, 1964.\n\nHe lived near Warrington with his wife Rowan, having previously been married to Patricia O\u2019Brien, with whom he had two children.\n\nIn 1965 Hunt opened the scoring when Liverpool beat Leeds 2-1 after extra-time at Wembley to win the FA Cup for the first time. Three years later, Hunt became Liverpool\u2019s leading scorer in January 1968 with a goal against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.\n\nHunt and Liverpool would also become the champions of England twice, winning the First Division in 1964 and 1966.\n\nDespite his relentless scoring record, one of the Shankly quotes that is engraved into Anfield folklore came when the Reds boss was quizzed about the forward missing chances.\n\n\u2018Yes Roger Hunt misses a few, but he gets in the right place to miss them,\u2019 Shankly said.\n\nHunt recalled his fondness of Shankly in an interview with the Liverpool Echo in 2020.\n\nThe death of Roger Hunt at the age of 83 leaves just three surviving members from the England team that won the World Cup in 1966.\n\nSir Bobby Charlton, Sir Geoff Hurst and George Cohen are now the only living players from the team that famously and thrillingly defeated West Germany 4-2 after extra time at Wembley.\n\nIt remains England\u2019s only major tournament triumph, though Gareth Southgate\u2019s current crop were agonisingly close to beating Italy in the Euro 2020 final this summer.\n\nHunt started the \u201966 final in attack but his industrious performance was always likely to be overshadowed by the hat-trick scored by his strike partner Hurst.\n\nHowever, Hunt netted three times during the tournament \u2013 once in the 2-0 win over Mexico during the group stage and twice in the victory over France by the same scoreline that followed it.\n\nHe is a club legend at Liverpool, where he scored 261 goals in 416 matches and remains their all-time leading scorer in league competition.\n\nFans affectionately referred to Hunt as \u2018Sir Roger\u2019 even though he was never formally knighted. He received the MBE in 2000.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened to the rest of the England team that started the 1966 World Cup final.",

Many young people and professionals are grabbing every available opportunity to flee abroad for greener pastures, because their fatherland or motherland is unable to provide adequately for them.\n\n\u201cWith the church\u2019s limited resources, we cannot provide employment for all the youths we know, but we will continue to do what we have been doing in favour of the youth, the poor and the needy, believing that one day, the government will truly partner with us and support us as a faith-based organization, as it is done elsewhere.\n\n\u201cIn addition to our scholarship scheme for indigent students, I urge the Youth Commission to dialogue with the Justice, Development and Peace Commission on how part of the proceeds of the Lenten campaign can be used for youth empowerment.\n\n\u201cAs COVID-19 is real, so are unemployment and poverty very real. We know this because we meet many people in our parishes and outstations looking up to the Church for the basic necessities of life, and the Church is not materially equipped to handle their needs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Archbishop of Abuja also condemned the challenges posed by insecurity which has left several people poor in the country.",

          "text": "The Federal High Court sitting in Lagos has fixed October 15, to hear all applications relating to a N20 billion bailout loan allegedly belonging to the Kogi State government, and said to be warehoused by Sterling Bank Plc.\n\nJustice Chukwujekwu Aneke fixed the date on Tuesday following an application made by counsel to the Kogi State Government, Professor Sam Erugo (SAN), who told the court that he needed time to study the counter affidavit filed by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to the processes.\n\nOn August 31, vacation judge, Justice Tijjani Ringim granted an exparte application for an interim forfeiture of the sum after taking arguments from the EFCC\u2019s counsel.\n\nWith the vacation over, the suit was reassigned to Justice Aneke and at the resumed hearing on Tuesday, counsel to Kogi State government, Professor Erogbo (SAN) told the court that his client had filed processes challenging the interim order granted by Justice Ringim.\n\nHe also told the court that the EFCC had filed its counter objections to the processes.\n\nThe counsel then asked the court to give him more time to respond to the EFCC\u2019s counter processes.\n\nCounsel to the EFCC, Rotimi Oyedepo, admitted to the court that he had been served with the processes and had equally filed his documents to counter the arguments raised.\n\nAfter listening to both parties, Justice Aneke, adjourned the matter till October 15, for the hearing of all applications.\n\nThe EFCC had approached the court on August 31 for the order in an ex-parte application brought pursuant to section 44(2) of the Constitution and section 34(1) of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission Act and under the inherent jurisdiction of the court.\n\nCounsel to the EFCC, Abass Muhammed, told the court that the order was necessary so as to preserve the \u2018res\u2019 and abate further dissipation of the funds in the account.\n\nIn his submissions, Muhammed informed the court that the N20 billion loan meant to augment the salary payment and running cost of the State Government was kept in an interest-yielding account with Sterling bank.\n\nHe added that instead of using the money for the purpose it was meant, Sterling Bank Plc acting on the instruction of the Kogi State Government transferred the money from the loan account and placed some in a fixed deposit account.\n\nHe concluded by saying that Sterling Bank Plc is yet to present any credible evidence to show that the facility is well secured.\n\nIn his ruling, Justice Tijjani Ringim granted the order to freeze the account pending the conclusion of the investigation or possible prosecution by the EFCC.\n\nIn granting the application, Justice Ringim directed the EFCC to publish the court order in a national newspaper. He also asked the commission to make a quarterly report to the court on the progress of its investigation.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Senate on Tuesday bemoaned the deplorable condition of over 33,000 kilometres of federal highways spread across the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nIt has, therefore, sought for N300 billion intervention particularly for the deplorable federal roads in Niger state alone.\n\nThis is coming just as the Works and Housing Minister, Babatunde Raji Fashola, Tuesday directed contractors to move to sites to effect immediate repairs on some of the federal highways nationwide.\n\nThe Red Chamber had at plenary called on the federal government to as a matter of urgency make provision for N300 billion for rehabilitation and reconstruction of highly deplorable federal roads in Niger State.\n\nThe deplorable condition of Trunk A roads in the power state stretching over 2,000 kilometres was brought to the attention of Senators by the Senate Deputy Whip, Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi via a motion of urgent national importance he sponsored along with six other Senators.\n\nAbdullahi, who cited Orders 42 and 52 of Senate standing rules to move the motion lamented that due to bad shapes of the roads articulated vehicles\u2019 drivers used their trucks to block the roads from last Friday to early hours of Tuesday with attendant untold hardships on other road users.\n\nNiger State, he explained, has the longest federal road network of 2,263km out of a total of 32,000km of national federal roads network.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe federal roads in Niger state stretched from the Abuja \u2013 Kaduna end to the Jebba \u2013 Mokwa \u2013 Makera \u2013 Tegina \u2013 Birnin Gwarimpa \u2013 Kaduna road to the Mokwa \u2013 New Bussa \u2013 Agwara \u2013 Kigera end which lies to the border with the republic of Benin.\n\n\u201cOverall, the following are critical linkage roads within Niger state that provide logistical and vehicular movements between the North and South; especially the South West and North West Corridors.\n\n\u201cBecause of the massive land area of Niger State at 76,363km (representing about nine percent of the total land area of the country), all movements from North to South substantially traverse the State.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the massive haulage of heavy industrial goods such as petroleum products, iron rods, cement, finished manufactured goods, machines and equipment, electronic materials and goods, building materials etc, in which trucks and tankers are overloaded pits great pressure on the roads and thus are seriously devastating to the state of the roads\u201d.\n\nThe ranking Senator stressed that all the major link roads have totally failed with fatal accidents occurring on a daily basis with loss of lives, goods and vehicles adding that the current rate of funding of federal roads in the state is unfortunately dismal and cannot deliver, which has led to many of the projects abandoned by contractors.\n\nHe, therefore, called for emergency action from the federal government on the road in the mode of N300 billion special fund which was adopted by the Senate in its resolutions.\n\nSenator Lekan Mustapha also moved a motion for urgent rehabilitation of all federal roads across the country noting that the problem of bad road is not peculiar to a zone but cut across all zones.\n\nThe Senate in response to the motion urged the Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning and Budget to release funds for emergency repair of all federal roads nationwide.\n\nOther resolutions adopted by the Senate as sought for as prayers in Abdullahi\u2019s motion are that the Federal Government should declare a state of emergency on the critical roads in Niger state linking economic corridors in the North and South.\n\nIt also resolved that a National Legislative Roundtable on the State of Infrastructure for Economic Development be convoked, so as to bring all critical stakeholders in the transport and logistics industries together with a view to identifying urgent actions to address the current challenges.\n\nThe Red Chamber also urged the federal government to direct the Federal Ministry of Works to carry out emergency stabilization of the failed portions of Bida \u2013 Lapai \u2013 Lambatta road to ease the current suffering and rate of accidents and loss of goods and investments in the road.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, in what appeared like the government heeding to Senate\u2019s motion, Fashola, directed contractors handling the various roads, to move to sites immediately.\n\nFashola in a statement signed by the Ministry\u2019s Director of Press and Public Relations, Boade Akinola, specifically directed the contractor handling the construction of Lambata -Lapai \u2013 Bida Road to immediately embark on remedial works with boulders on the critical section of the road in order to bring relief to commuters.\n\nThe minister noted in the statement that the inclement weather condition was adversely affecting the progress of work on the ongoing 124.8km thereby making the road unmotorable especially between Km 45 \u2013 50 kilometres to articulated vehicles and trailers conveying petroleum products and others.\n\nThe ministry, according to the statement, has contacted the leadership of the Union of Truck Owners and Operators to appeal to their drivers to vacate the road to allow the contractor access to the work sites.\n\nThe Minister also appealed to Niger State Government to reconsider the decision to close Bida \u2013 Minna and Lapai -Paiko roads to articulated vehicles while construction is equally going on to decongest and distribute the traffic on Bida -Lambata road to the other adjourning state roads.\n\nHe reiterated the commitment of the federal government to continue to respond to the needs of the people, even as infrastructure development is given top priority just as he sympathises with all who have been adversely impacted by this development and urges them to remain hopeful as help is on the way.\n\nDeji Elumoye and Juliet Akoje in Abuja",

          "text": "The dust generated from Monday\u2019s statement by Nigeria\u2019s northern governors as well as traditional rulers in the region that, zoning of the presidency was unconstitutional, has attracted the ire of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, which not only condemned the northern governors and the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), but further warned against the north insisting on producing President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s successor in 2023.\n\nOhanaeze, Ndigbo\u2019s apex socio-political association, also went the memory lane to educate the northern political elite and refresh their memories about how their former leaders like Alhaji Tafawa Balewa, Yakubu Gowon, Murtala Mohammed, Alhaji Shehu Shagari and others underdeveloped the north despite running the affairs of the country for a long time.\n\nAccording to a statement by the Secretary-General, Ohanaeze, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, another northern president would fuel the agitation for Oduduwa Republic as well as Biafra nation and therefore warned that such a narrow disposition threatened the unity of the country.\n\nThis was, however, in sync with the position of the President and Founder of Anap Foundation, Mr. Atedo Peterside, who while weighing-in on the matter, wrote on his official Twitter handle that, \u201cSome Governors say zoning is unconstitutional. Will they accept a President and Vice President coming from the same zone? Or a governor and deputy governor from the same local government area, though these are all \u2018constitutional\u2019? No, zoning is about political expediency and compromise.\u201d\n\nThe Northern States Governors Forum (NSGF), umbrella body for 19 elected governors in northern Nigeria, had signaled its determination to retain power in 2023, when it argued that power rotation was unconstitutional.\n\nIt, therefore, condemned the position of the Southern Governors Forum (SGF), stating that their position contradicted \u201cthe provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (1999) as amended that an elected President shall score the majority votes; score at least 25 per cent of the votes cast in two-third of the states of the federation.\u201d\n\nBut Isiguzoro, in the statement accused the northern governors of being the instigators of Nigeria\u2019s breakup and that another northern president would be faced with challenges that would make it difficult for him to rule Nigeria.\n\nThe statement read: \u201cThe Ohanaeze Ndigbo worldwide maintained that attempts to jettison the rotational presidency in 2023, and the north insisting to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari will be unfavorable and weaknesses towards sustaining the unity and stability in the country as it will favour the declarations of Oduduwa and Biafra nations by 2024.\n\n\u201cNorthern Governors\u2019 miscalculation on 2023 and meandering on blind excitements of opposing the position of southern governors\u2019 standpoints had put the northern governors as exponents of Nigeria\u2019s breakup.\n\n\u201cIf another northerner succeeds President Buhari in 2023, he or she might not be able to superintendent over the affairs of the country as Nigeria might face brutal challenges from secessionist groups with full backing up from ethnic groups as a result of a revolt against the injustice against South and excesses of the North.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, Ndigbo, \u201cmay join with IPOB, to declare for Biafra restoration in the event of any conspiracy against the 2023 Igbo Presidency.\n\n\u201cNorthern governors should apologise to Nigerians for these subversive and provocative responses to 2023 Southern Presidency or should face the consequences of unable to read the mood of the nation which favours the southern presidency of Igbo bloc.\u201d\n\nIn yet a separate statement, the National Publicity Secretary, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Chief Chiedozie Alex Ogbonnia, said the position taken by the northern leaders was a clear indication that the country was facing a bleak future.\n\nIt noted that the northern leaders failed to recognise that Nigeria was confronted with uncertainty, doubts, insecurity and bloodshed presently, adding that by unanimously condemning the statement by the SGF that the Presidency must go to the south in 2023, the northern leaders had shown that they cared less whether Nigeria survives or not.\n\nAccording to the statement, the Chairman of the Northern States Governors Forum, Governor Simon Lalong, could attest that the people of Plateau State, had never in history witnessed the number of deaths that had taken place under his watch as governor, noting that banditry in Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna and Jigawa States was terrifying.\n\n\u201cBenue State has turned into a killing field. The states of Yobe and Borno are worst hit by the menace of Boko Haram; etc. Several schools in the North could not open because of kidnappers and millions of children are on the street as beggars.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian currency has lost its value. Unemployment has skyrocketed; and Nigeria has become the poverty capital of the world and the Northern Governors, the Sultan and the Emirs instead of seeking solution to Nigerian problems were busy strategising on how to retain power in 2023. This is most unconscionable, to say the least.\n\n\u201cLet it be made abundantly clear that if Presidency is a panacea to people\u2019s problems, the north would have become the Netherlands of Africa. This is because the North had Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, Yakubu Gowon, Murtala Mohammed, Shehu Shagari, Muhammadu Buhari, Ibrahim Babangida, Sani Abacha, Abdulsalam Abubakar, Musa Yaradua, Muhammadu Buhari, yet the problems of the North are on the increase,\u201d he noted.\n\nIt reiterated the position of the Southern Governors, saying a gentleman agreement was reached at the NUC Conference Centre, Abuja, in 1998 between the north and the south.\n\n\u201cThe Late Dr. Chuba Okadigbo spoke for the entire south and Alh. Abubakar Rimi, also of blessed memory, spoke for the North. It was agreed that after Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar as the Head of State, that the presidency should shift to the South.\n\n\u201cThat accounted for the emergence of the presidential flag bearers of the mainstream political parties from the South West. Chief Olusegun Obasanjo respected the agreement and handed over to the North in the person of Musa Yar\u2019Adua.\n\n\u201cAgain, Goodluck Jonathan, a Southerner, respected the gentleman agreement and handed over to the North in the person of President Muhammadu Buhari. Therefore, the least that is expected from the North is a show of profound gratitude to the entire South for their large heart, equanimity and sportsmanship.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, it is in the interest of every Nigerian that there should be a paradigm shift to governance techniques,\u201d the group noted, reiterating its support for the 17 Southern Governors.\n\nContinuing, the statement stated: \u201cOhanaeze uses this singular opportunity to express disappointment over the unholy manouvres and alliances by the members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to zone the presidential seat for the 2023 general election to the Northern Nigeria. The exponents of this agenda, in their jaundiced calculations, believe that it is a sure way of regaining power from the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\n\u201cExperience would have taught them that to zone their presidential position to the North is an orchestrated requiem for the party, because more PDP governors and grassroots will surely desert them,\u201d it added.\n\nThe organisation, which has Prof. George Obiozor as its President General further reiterated that the bane of Nigeria was injustice, which it claimed was targeted at the Igbos.\n\n\u201cUntil we begin to wean ourselves of the Igbophobia and rather harness individual and group resourcefulness, creativity, ingenuity and initiatives wherever they are found, Nigeria will remain on the downward spiral,\u201d it added.\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja and Christopher Isiguzo in Enugu",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s state-owned oil company, the NNPC will again make a huge deduction of N149.2 billion from the federation\u2019s joint account when the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) meets next month, according to a document seen by THISDAY.\n\nThe NNPC FAAC presentation held on September 21, which detailed the corporation\u2019s operations for the month of August, disclosed that as reported by THISDAY last month, the national oil company also withheld about N173.1 billion during the month to pay for what it terms under-recovery or value shortfall. An analysis of the document showed that net revenue to FAAC from the NNPC rose to N80 billion in August as against N67.280 billion in July, an increase of about N13.28 billion.\n\nYear-to-date, the NNPC FAAC presentation showed that N714.7 billion had been paid as subsidy from January to August, with the eight month getting the lion\u2019s share of N173.1 billion, while June came next with N164.3 billion, followed by May with N126 billion, then July in which N103.2 billion was spent on what the government terms under-recovery.\n\nIn the same vein, while no subsidy was paid in January, N24.3 billion was paid in February, N60.3 billion in March and N61.9 billion in April this year.\n\nAccording to the NNPC, a pending N40 billion from June under-recovery would be subsequently subtracted from the federation account jointly run by the federal, state and local governments.\n\nWhen the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) begins in earnest and the federal continues in its hesitation to stop payment of subsidy on petrol, it would be double jeopardy for the sub-nationals which would also be hugely affected by the deduction of the controversial 30 per cent frontier exploration fund.\n\n\u201cThe value shortfall of N173,131,639,213.61, for July 2021 was charged. The balance of N40,000,000,000.00 for the June 2021 value shortfall will be deducted subsequently.\n\n\u201cThe August, 2021 value shortfall of N149,283,084,869.20 is to be deducted from the September, 2021 proceeds due for sharing at the October, 2021 FAAC meeting,\u201d the document disclosed.\n\nIn all, the overall NNPC crude oil lifting of 8.71 mbbls (export & domestic crude) in July 2021, recorded 0.87 per cent increase relative to the 8.66 mbbls lifted in June 2021, the corporation stated, with Nigeria maintaining 1.554 million bpd Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production cut in July, 2021.\n\nCrude Oil export revenue received in August 2021 amounted to $7.78 million, equivalent to N2.98 billion, while domestic gas receipts in the month was N5.69 billion.\n\nAccording to the NNPC, feedstock valued at $64.66 million was sold to Nigeria LNG during the period, out of which $54.40 million was received during the month, the difference being Modified Carry Agreement (MCA) obligations, gas reconciliation and credit notes.\n\nNLNG arrears amounting to $3.09 million was received during the period, while the sum of $151.26 million being miscellaneous receipts, gas and ullage (the amount by which a container falls short of being full) fees and interest income was received in August 2021.\n\nIn its July operations, for monies which were shared in August, NNPC had deducted a cumulative N215.3 billion from its contribution to joint Federation Account, being a combination of N175 billion value shortfall or subsidy and N40 billion Joint Venture (JV) cost recovery.\n\nThe data earlier obtained by THISDAY showed that NNPC paid N67.280 to the joint account in July, in contrast to the N47.162 in June. The July payment was about N20 billion higher than that of June.\n\nFurthermore, in January, net revenue to FAAC was N90.8 billion, it was N64.161 billion in February, N41.184 billion in March, zero in April, N38.608 billion in May, N47.162 billion in June and N67.280 billion in July.\n\nIn June, the NNPC told the nation that Nigeria was losing about 42 million litres of petrol to the activities of smugglers across the country\u2019s borders, increasing Nigeria\u2019s estimated daily consumption of 60 million litres to 103 million litres, thereby worsening the subsidy payment regime.\n\nMeanwhile, Brent oil, Nigeria\u2019s crude benchmark, rose above $80 a barrel on Tuesday, the latest milestone in a global energy crisis, on signs that demand was running ahead of supply and depleting inventories.\n\nThe international crude benchmark hit the highest since October 2018, before paring some earlier gains to trade close to $80, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) also climbed above $75.\n\nHowever, the jump to $80 was adding inflationary pressure to the global economy at a time when prices of energy commodities are soaring, especially in Europe and America.\n\nOther things being equal, oil has rebounded from its collapse last year amid record output curbs from the OPEC+ group and a global economic recovery that has boosted demand.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "title": "NEITI: 77 Oil Companies Owing Nigeria N2.659tn Unremitted Funds",
          "text": "As Nigeria continues to grapple with revenue shortfall and has gone borrowing to finance its huge budget deficit with debt service gulping as much as 98 per cent of its revenue, it has been revealed that 77 oil and gas companies operating in Nigeria are indebted to the country to the tune of N2.659 trillion.\n\nThis is just as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is expected to once more make a huge deduction of N149.2 billion from the federation\u2019s joint account when the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) meets next month, a document seen by THISDAY Tuesday revealed.\n\nThe Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) which disclosed that 77 oil and gas companies were indebted to the federal government, attributed the debt to their failure to remit petroleum profit tax, company income tax, education tax, value added tax, withholding tax, royalty and concession on rentals.\n\nSpeaking in Abuja during an interaction with the media on the status of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) implementation in Nigeria, the Executive Secretary of the organisation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Orji, stated that when converted to dollar, the government was being owed $6.48 billion at today\u2019s official exchange rate of N410.35.\n\nHe noted that a breakdown of the figures showed that a total of $143.99 million was owed as petroleum profit taxes, $1.089 billion as company income taxes and $201.69 million as education tax. According to him, others included $18.46 million and \u00a3972,000 as VAT, $23.91 million and \u00a3997,000 as withholding tax, $4.357 billion as royalty oil, $292.44 million as royalty gas, while $270.187 million and $41.86 million were unremitted gas flare penalties and concession rentals respectively.\n\nIn view of the government\u2019s current search for revenues to address citizens\u2019 demand for steady power, access to good roads, quality education, fighting insurgency and creating of job opportunities for the country\u2019s teeming youths, Orji stressed that the monies needed to be recovered.\n\nAn analysis of what the sum of N2.65 trillion could contribute to economic development, he said, showed that it could cover the entire capital budget of the federal government in 2020 or even service the federal government\u2019s debt of $2.68 billion in 2020.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, if the money is recovered, the N2.659 trillion, it could fund about 46 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s 2021 budget deficit of N5.6 trillion and is even higher than the entire projected oil revenue for 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is why NEITI is set to work with the government to provide relevant information and data to support efforts at recovering this money.\n\n\u201cThe disclosure of this information is in line with NEITI\u2019s mandate to conduct audits, disseminate the findings to the public to enable the citizen\u2019s, especially the media and civil society to use the information and data to hold government, companies and even society to account.\n\n\u201cIt is important that the process of recovering this humongous sum be set on course to support government in this period of dwindling revenues,\u201d the NEITI helmsman said.\n\nThe executive secretary called on the companies to ensure that they remit the various outstanding sums against them before the conclusion of the 2020 NEITI audit cycle to the relevant government agencies responsible for collection and remittances of such revenue.\n\n\u201cNEITI will no longer watch while these debts continue to remain in its reports unaddressed. We will provide all necessary information and data to sister agencies whose responsibilities are to recover these debts into government coffers. We will do also share the information and data with our partner anti-corruption agencies with whom we have signed MoUs,\u201d he added.\n\nWithin the short period the new management was appointed, Orji disclosed that his team had succeeded in ensuring the reconstitution and inauguration of the NEITI board and commencement of process of reviewing of NEITI Act to strengthen its powers and functions. In addition, he listed the timely publication and presentation of the reports; securing permanent office accommodation for the agency after 17 years of squatting on rent; sustained and diversified partnerships with key stakeholders and partners as part of the initiative\u2019s achievement.\n\nAccording to him, the appointment of NEITI into the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA); commencement of the development of a five-year NEITI strategic plan (2022-2026); NEITI audit automation project and Nigeria\u2019s involvement in opening extractives programme, were further modest strides made by the organisation.\n\nHe stated that NEITI\u2019s had further been appointed to lead the global EITI contract transparency network; designing of a new, functional and interactive website and reconstitution of the civil society and communication sub-committee, among others.\n\nEarlier in his welcome remarks, the Chairman of the NEITI board, Mr. Olusegun Adekunle, assured that a lot more needed to be done in the EITI implementation in Nigeria, especially under the new PIA regime. He maintained that the solid minerals sector was begging for coordination, noting that the civil society and the media, being the third leg of the EITI tripod have critical roles to play in the Initiative.\n\n\u201cTo effectively undertake this task of ensuring prudent management of extractive resources, there is need for effective oversight of the implementation of the EITI standard by all relevant frontline agencies of government and companies.\n\n\u201cNSWG looks up to you for you to effectively monitor these guidelines and to ensure that the standards are mainstreamed in the covered entities\u2019 daily operations\u201d, he said.\n\nHe reiterated the commitment of President Muhammadu-led administration to EITI implementation in Nigeria, noting that the administration was passionate about the EITI process.\n\nThe chairman assured members of the civil society and the media that the NEITI board under his watch would do all within its power to sustain the existing partnership and ensure a more robust and cordial relationship with civil society groups.\n\nIn his goodwill message, the Programme Manager, British Council/ Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption Programme (RoLAC), Mr. Emanuel Uche, commended NEITI under the current management for the modest achievements made within a short period.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
