          "text": "Aregbesola and CGC Banana\n\nBy Omeiza Ajayi \u2013 Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has again ordered armed personnel of the Nigeria Correctional Service (NCoS) to make security at the nation\u2019s custodial centres impregnable and take out invading forces without giving them the opportunity to attack such facilities.\n\nMinister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola reiterated the directive on Thursday while inaugurating a vulnerability audit of the Nigerian Correctional Service NCoS custodial centres across the country.\n\nMedia Adviser to the Minister, Mr Sola Fasure in a statement issued Friday in Abuja said the report of the audit will identify the fault lines in the security setup and penetration levels of the custodial centres.\n\nAregbesola had at an emergency meeting with NCoS Squadron Commanders, Field Commanders and Heads of Armed Squads on April 30 in Abuja given a shoot at sight order to the personnel to eliminate any internal or external aggressor.\n\nHe also declared custodial facilities as \u201cred zones\u201d that must remain inviolable.\n\nAt the Thursday meeting, the minister said; \u201cThe vulnerability audit we have inaugurated today will identify the weakness in our security setup and will help to put in place an effective structure to assist us in better securing our facilities against future external aggression.\n\nALSO READ: How unemployment forced son, mother into tailoring and how it is paying off\n\n\u201cIn the past, the challenges to the facilities were usually internal insurrections which our system had been primed to deal with. But this new challenge, starting with the #EndSARS riots of last year, is an armed invasion by gunmen, in large numbers, bearing sophisticated weapons and military grade ordinances. They overrun the place, blow up huge holes on the perimeter fence and overpower our security system. We are determined to eliminate the threat from these attackers and ensure that our facilities are no longer vulnerable\u201d.\n\nHe said it is sacrilegious for anyone to breach any custodial facility in Nigeria as it tantamount to toying with the sovereignty of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe NCoS stands at the heart and end of Administration of Criminal Justice System. It is a critical and essential element in keeping those the Courts think must be kept away from our society. You must do all in your power to defend it.\n\n\u201cThe custodial centres represent Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty. They are sacred institutions that signify her authority. Anyone who aims to breach them is simply testing the might and will of the Nigerian state and must not live to regret such actions,\u201d the Minister declared.\n\nOn his part, Controller General of Corrections, CGC Haliru Nababa, noted that teams will be inaugurated in each of the geopolitical zones and an interim report submitted in the next one week.\n\n\u201cImmediately we leave this venue, we are heading back to the office to operationalize this assignment. In the next one week, we are submitting an interim report of the audit and the full report will be submitted in eight weeks time.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the embarrassment the frequent external attacks have on our reputation as a Service and as a country. We are assuring the Minister that our officers are ready to combat all attacks on our facility. Already, the Service has sent the first batch of 150 armed personnel for training at a military formation in Kontagora. Others are billed to complete their training in the next couple of weeks\u201d the CGC disclosed.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "It has been ascertained for democracy to thrive in Nigeria, journalists must be allowed to exercise their fundamental rights to freedom of press, speech and expression while performing their statutory duty of gathering and disseminating factual information.\n\nThis was said by Chief Yinka Fasuyi during the 2021 Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), Osun State Council Press Week and Award Dinner in Osogbo on Thursday.\n\nChief Fasuyi, who was the Chairman of the occasion, also disclosed that many journalists in the course of discharging their duties in time past have been marked, trailed, and afflicted while some have been detained illegitimately while discharging their constitutional duties.\n\nThe Chairman noted that many also have been pressurised to mislead the public while divulging information under death threats.\n\nIn his words, \u201cUnfortunately, physical threats are only the most visible dangers. However, Journalists and journalism itself are facing other threats such as censorship, political and economic pressure, intimidation, job insecurity and attacks on the protection of journalists\u2019 sources.\u201d\n\nHe lamented that the acts are anti-democratic as they cannot ensure a balanced and thoroughly informed society.\n\n\u201cMy admonition is that Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) has the prerogative to protect the interests and lives of journalists through the legal framework available in the country\u201d.\n\nFasuyi, who emphasised the important role of journalism in entrenching democratic values in a society, noted that hoarding information from journalists would only spell doom for the nation.\n\nHe also stressed that the so much-desired transformation in all the sectors of the nation\u2019s economy can only be achieved through genuine information.\n\nWhile identifying the lack of information, disinformation and a contempt for the truth as the bane of healthy journalism, he lamented that a large number of people were being stuffed with garbage everywhere.\n\n\u201cThis is disastrous for our collective survival. I task the pen professionals to religiously adhere to the ethical standards guiding the noble profession to avoid the \u2018Sword of Damocles\u2019 and gavel of the law.\n\n\u201cWhether it is law or journalism, finance or medicine, academia or running business communications to do their job, we count in the space of trust that confidentiality provides. When someone breaches that trust, we are all worse off for it,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, the state chairman of the NUJ, Wasiu Ajadosu had assured of members\u2019 commitment to the sustenance of peace and unity of the state and the nation in general by upholding best practices in character and service delivery.\n\nRecall that on Wednesday, October 20, 2021, Journalist Sikiru Obarayese of DAILY POST was violently attacked and molested by men of the Nigerian Police under the authorisation of the Divisional Police Officer, Dugbe Division, Osogbo, Akinloye Oyegbade, while covering the EndSARS protest in Osogbo.\n\nHe was also hurriedly arranged before an Osogbo Magistrate Court on alleged offenses which run foul of Sections 249(5) and 356 of the Criminal Code Cap 34. Laws of Osun State.\n\nHe was however discharged and acquitted after the Osun State Police Commissioner, Olawale Olokode discontinued the case.",

That is to say therefore that the commission\u2019s assurances are dead on arrival and repugnant to conditions for free and fair elections, particularly the referenced Anambra governorship election.\n\n\u201cIf the commission is truly ready to conduct all-inclusive and credible governorship election in Anambra State, it ought to be deeply worried and concerned and should not have given such \u2018assurances of the graveyard\u2019\u201d.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nRead Also: Why INEC is spending more on Anambra poll, by Okoye\n\nThe groups also said they had carefully analysed the clarifications given by the secessionist group on the seven-day sit-at-home and found the same not to hold water.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore correct to say that by all intents and purposes, the suddenly declared sit-at-home and its timing are targeted at scuttling the Anambra governorship poll and provide grounds for the poll to be massively and scientifically rigged by the establishment \u2026\u201d, the statement read.\n\nThe statement maintained that INEC had no other credible option than to shift the Anambra governorship election for one month.\n\nIt continued: \u201cThis is if the agitators(IPOB) insist on going ahead with their five days electoral disruptive sit-at-home threats.\n\n\u201cApart from proving the agitators right or wrong by shifting the date of the poll and if they target and impose another sit-at-home to disrupt the poll, this will also enable the tensions and fears created and inflicted on the general population especially the voters to drastically reduce and provide the commission and other stakeholders including security agencies, political parties, their candidates and agents to re-strategize including reducing fears and deploying peace and dispute resolution mechanisms and demilitarization of the electoral space\u201d.\n\nIt insisted that shifting the election would have no negative effect on the Constitution and Electoral Act.\n\nAccording to the statement, Section 178 (2) of the country\u2019s 1999 Constitution (as amended) and Section 25 (8) of the 2010 Electoral Act (as amended), \u201celection into the office of governor shall be held not earlier than 150 days and not later than 30 days before the expiration of the term of office of the last holder or outgoing governor\u201d.\n\nIt said, \u201cIn the case of Anambra governorship poll, therefore, the tenure of office of the outgoing governor of the state elapses on 17th March 2022. This means that INEC is on point by fixing the poll \u201cnot earlier than 150 days before the expiration of the term of office of the last or outgoing holder (William Mmaduabuchukwu Obiano).\n\n\u201cINEC is also on point if the poll is shifted to 6th Dec 2021 which is still within the literal letters or meaning of \u2018not earlier than 150 days\u2019 or \u2018not later than 30 days to the last holder\u2019s office term expiration\u2019.\n\n\u201cExcept INEC is determined to rig the poll otherwise the only credible option available to the commission is to shift the poll for one month; exception being unless the agitators rescind their sit-at-home call scheduled to start from 5th Nov. The meaningful timeline popularly appropriate for agitators to rescind or rewind is Monday, 1st Nov or Tuesday, Nov 2nd 2021\u201d.",

They should rather guide their utterances and actions because there is already tension in the land because of insecurity. Most Instructively, we want to urge you, politicians, on the Presidency.

Enabling environment should be created for investments and incentives or tax exceptions given to local manufacturers on some goods.\u201d\n\nHe commended the Federal Government for the wisdom in managing the COVID-19 pandemic, but cautioned against forcing the people to take COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nOmo-Agege thanked the CAN leadership for the visit and called for more of such interactions with a view to bridging the gap between the National Assembly and CAN.\n\nHe also appreciated the interest and support of CAN in the efforts of the government to promote peace and unity, and in its war against the COVID-19.

          "title": "Buhari: Destabilising Forces Weaponising Frustration of Marginalised Groups",
          "text": "*Urges African leaders to renew social contract with people\n\nDeji Elumoye and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has advised African leaders to deliberately develop policies and legislations that would guarantee human security in order to prevent forces of destabilisation from exploiting the frustration of the marginalised for the purpose of spreading discord. Buhari stated this yesterday in Abuja at the fifth Conference of the Network of African Parliamentarians for Defence and Security Committees of the House of Representatives.\n\nThe conference is a strategic platform that brings together lawmakers from across Africa, as well as representatives of the African Union (AU), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and the European Union (EU) to exchange ideas, share experiences, and deliberate on common approaches to addressing threats to the continent\u2019s collective security.\n\nBuhari stressed that it was vital for governments in the continent to renew their social contract with the citizens so as to improve governance, development, and build institutions that promote inclusive security and prosperity.\n\nThe president, in his speech delivered by the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, said his administration was actively pursuing policies to ensure that no segment of the Nigerian population was alienated and marginalised. He noted that mobilising the full spectrum of national assets also meant engaging the broad expanse of society.\n\nAccording to the president, \u201cWe recognise that having large segments of our population feeling alienated and marginalised is a critical vulnerability. The challenge then is for us to develop measures through policy and legislation that create an umbrella of human security over our people and thereby prevent the forces of destabilisation from weaponising the frustrations of the marginalised.\n\n\u201cIn doing this, we will also ensure that the human and material resources that we should be deploying for growth and development are not consumed in conflict.\u201d\n\nBuhari said the conference was timely, and urged African governments to engage in more strategic collaboration to tackle existential threats across the continent. He highlighted efforts by the Nigerian government to address its security challenges, particularly terrorism and insurgency.\n\nThe president told the gathering of parliamentarians that they had a crucial role in leading domestic advocacy for vital security partnerships in their respective countries.\n\nHe stated, \u201cGovernments across the continent are dealing with multiple threats, ranging from terrorism and piracy to transnational organised crime and insurrectionary challenges to the very legitimacy of our nations.\n\n\u201cAs part of our efforts in responding, we have prioritised our commitment to the constitutional imperative of guaranteeing the security and the welfare of the people. We have embarked upon an ambitious programme of reforming critical law enforcement institutions while sustaining consistently increased investment in our defence and security sectors.\n\n\u201cHowever, we recognise that the threats we face in this borderless age are often both local and transnational. We recognise that an insurrection or conflict in one country can spread like an infection across borders to destabilise neighbours and create even greater threats that jeopardise regional security and stability.\u201d\n\nThe president said the borderless nature of threats to security underscored the need for strategic multi-dimensional partnerships to guarantee peace, stability, and prosperity of African countries.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) is the most recent manifestation of our resolve to open our borders, increase intra-African trade and grow the continent\u2019s economy. It has long been established that deepening the trade links between our nations would serve as a propulsive engine for driving Africa\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cBut these objectives would be undermined by unchecked destabilisation and insecurity. In the light of this, it is clear that this Network has a key role to play in securing our collective prosperity.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Vanessa Obioha\n\n\n\nThe social network platform which rose to prominence over two decades ago announced Thursday that it is renaming itself. The Mark Zuckerberg company will now be known as Meta, a nod to its future digital frontier Metaverse, a fusion of different digital worlds.\n\nSpeaking at a virtual event to showcase Facebook\u2019s technological plans for the future, Zuckerberg stated that he has been thinking a lot about the company\u2019s identity. \u201cOver time, I hope we\u2019re seen as a metaverse company.\u201d\n\nMetaverse became a buzzword following the pandemic as augmented, virtual and online realities fused to create experiences for users.\n\nZuckerberg is one of Silicon Valley top shots who believe that Metaverse will be the next major social platform and that several tech companies will build it over the next decade. Although at the moment, the technology is still a mirage. The company is said to have invested $10bn in its metaverse project in 2021.\n\nLast year, Facebook rolled out two of its metaverse projects in beta: Horizon World, which allows users to invite friends into their digital world, and Horizon Workrooms, which does the same in professional settings. Zuckerberg disclosed that the company plans to explore NFTs and crypto to help facilitate media that can be represented digitally and is working on gaming applications.\n\nDuring a presentation from his home, the Facebook founder shared his vision which includes a digital world in which users will feel they are with one another even though they may be apart. Users will be able to customize their avatars and digital spaces, decorating a digital office with pictures, videos and even books.\n\n\u201cWhen I send my parents a video with my kids, they\u2019re going to feel like they\u2019re right in the moment with us not peering through a little window,\u201d he said.\n\nWith the rebranding, Meta comes with a new logo designed like an infinity-shaped symbol. Other platforms of the company such as Instagram and WhatsApp will retain their names but will now come under the Meta brand.",

It is guaranteed because the technology uses cryptographic encrypted two factors of authentication.

Where is he going to make the money from? What kind of business is the person doing? Is the person regulated?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cThe first is to sensitise the Nigerian public because you are the greatest security for yourselves. So, when we sensitise you, you will begin to see some of these things (fake Ponzi operators) and avoid them. The moment you see them, you will know it.\n\n\u201cThe other thing is for us to work with the security agencies to ensure that those who gullibly defraud Nigerians must be brought to book \u2014 and we have done quite a number in this regard.

          "text": "Facebook on Thursday, October 28 announced that it has changed its company name to Meta. This change of name was announced by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook\u2019s annual Connect augmented and virtual reality conference.\n\nThe company said it chose the name \u201cMeta\u201d to serve as a reminder that there is always more to build. The rebrand is part of the company\u2019s efforts to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse \u2014 a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.\n\n\u201cRight now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can\u2019t possibly represent everything that we\u2019re doing today, let alone in the future,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cOver time, I hope that we are seen as a metaverse company, and I want to anchor our work and identity on what we\u2019re building toward.\u201d\n\nPer The Verge, \u201cZuckerberg owns the Twitter handle @meta and meta.com, which now redirects to a welcome page on Facebook outlining the changes. The site previously redirected to meta.org, a biomedical research discovery tool that was a project of the Chan Zuckerberg Science Initiative. That\u2019s part of the philanthropic arm Zuckerberg co-founded with his physician wife, Priscilla Chan, in 2015. In a Medium post on Thursday, the group says it\u2019s sunsetting Meta.org on March 31st, 2022.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going to change?\n\nAs expected, the new name implies that some things about the way Facebook operates would change. Facebook said its corporate structure is not changing, however, how the company reports its financials will. Starting with results for the fourth quarter of 2021, Facebook plans to report on two operating segments: Family of Apps and Reality Labs. The company also said that it will change its stock ticker from FB to MVRS, effective December 1. In addition, Facebook assured users that the announcement does not affect how the company uses or shares data.\n\nAt the Connect conference, Facebook also announced new tools to help people build for the metaverse, including Presence Platform, which will enable new mixed reality experiences on Quest 2, and a $150-million investment in immersive learning to train the next generation of creators.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in a letter on Thursday.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "For Satoshi Shinada, taking bets and investing is not something he just started doing.\n\nAt the age of 18, he took his first bet to invest in himself by leaving Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years. I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cThat\u2019s bold! Why did he do this?\u201d I had the same thought too, so I asked him about it.\n\n\u201cI was born and raised in Japan, so I wanted to expose myself to a different environment and culture. I also loved reading stories of adventures which exposed me to stories about Africa,\u201d he told me over a Zoom call.\n\nHow was he able to afford the trip? He had just won a pact he made with his grandma. The deal was if he got admitted to the best university in Japan, the University of Tokyo, she\u2019d give him an allowance. It turned out to be an allowance of $10,000.\n\nIn hindsight, Shinada believes he used the money for a better endeavour: instead of buying items, he bought experience. His experience crisscrossing Africa taught him that, even among diverse cultures, trading is a common language.\n\nBefore making the trip around Africa, he was conflicted on whether to become a researcher or a businessman. At the end of the trip, he had chosen to become a businessman.\n\nIn 2010, upon graduation from college, Shinada joined Sojitz, a Japanese company that led investment in infrastructure and energy projects in West Africa. At Sojitz, he was in charge of developing and investing in infrastructure and energy projects like the first desalination project in sub-Saharan Africa at a commercial scale. After seven years on the job, he itched to do something different.\n\nHe took some time off to return to Japan before heading to Harvard Business School for his MBA. Afterwards, he returned to Africa as a general partner at Kepple Africa Ventures.\n\n\u201cWhile at Sojitz, I had started becoming interested in Nigerian entrepreneurs starting their own businesses. I saw a lot of Africans who studied or lived in Europe and the US coming back to their home countries to start businesses that leveraged on new technologies. This was the opposite of the brain drain. I knew I had to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How did Kepple Africa Ventures start?\n\nSatoshi Shinada: The origin of Kepple dates back to when Takahiro Kanzaki, a certified public accountant, left KPMG to provide accounting and back-office support for startups in Japan. After a few years, he saw that his startups turned out to be well-established companies and unicorns. So, he came up with the idea of creating Fundboard, a portfolio management software-as-a-service (SaaS) company for venture capitalists and private equity firms.\n\nAs a result of that decision, today Kepple is at the centre of the startup community in Japan with this tool. This provided Kepple with access to a network of investors to raise $18 million for Kepple Africa Ventures.\n\nThere are three persons involved in Kepple Africa ventures. Takahiro Kanzaki is in charge of fundraising from Japanese investors. Ryosuke Yamawaki handles investing in East and Southern African startups while I focus on investing in West and North African startups. Yamawaki started investing in Kenyan startups in 2018 while I started doing the same in Nigeria the following year.\n\nDA: What\u2019s Kepple\u2019s investment thesis?\n\nSS: Kepple Africa Ventures came to bridge two gaps. The first was the deep gap between seed and Series A because investors are very fragmented. We wanted to become an anchor investor in the seed stage for startups in Africa.\n\nThe second was, we wanted to bridge the mismatch between what African startups needed and the type of investors available in the ecosystem. We wanted to solve this problem by bringing more Japanese companies to invest directly in African startups and providing strategic support/capital, and in the end becoming an acquirer of the startups.\n\nIn Africa, you usually find financial investors and impact-driven social investors from Europe or the US, but you don\u2019t find lots of strategic investors. These strategic investors are supported by the existing big businesses. They drive the growth of the startups through partnerships and end up even acquiring startups and giving exit opportunities to the ecosystems. You\u2019ll find more of these strategic investors in India or Southeast Asia than in Africa.\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve already facilitated Japanese companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to directly invest in our portfolio companies. In the past 10 months, we\u2019ve brought four or five Japanese companies to directly invest into our portfolio companies.\n\nDA: Hmm, that\u2019s good to hear. What do you look for in the companies you invest in?\n\nSS: First, I\u2019d like to point out that our big vision is to create new industries from Africa. So we don\u2019t consider our investment standalone. We want to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nNow to answer your question, we lookout for the quality of the founders; they have to have a big vision to tackle real problems. Beyond having a big vision, they need to understand the biggest pain points of their customers. And why I say so is that in Africa it\u2019s easy to mix up individual pains and social pains. For instance, deciding to tackle the pain point of poverty in Africa, although an important issue, doesn\u2019t really help you to monetise your business model. Africa is also a place where it is very difficult to make people pay for your service.\n\nSo, your service or product should be really laser-focused on the biggest pain points of your customers and then you monetise that solution. We are not charity investors; we are commercial investors, so monetisation and revenue growth are very important.\n\nDA: Are there any sectors you prefer to invest in?\n\nSS: We\u2019re sector agnostic, but we filter the startups we invest in based on four investment pillars. The first pillar is startups helping to complement or supplement the lack of public infrastructure. For example, we invested in a company called Flare. They are building an ambulance network for Africa. You know in Africa it\u2019s difficult to access a reliable ambulance network, but by providing an Uber-like platform to the owners of ambulances and hospitals, they can create that kind of public service infrastructure of the ambulance network to make people\u2019s lives better and safer.\n\nThe second pillar is startups that help businesses to digitise their operations and production, and make them more efficient. In this case, I\u2019m talking about helping companies with a business-to-business (B2B) model, because in Africa, business-to-consumer (B2C) models are not as active as other markets in Southeast Asia or India.\n\nThe third pillar is focused on startups pioneering innovation where Africa does not have legacy infrastructure yet. Sometimes you can find leapfrogging technology from Africa and that technology could be applicable to other parts of the world. An example of this is one of our portfolio companies called Shyft Power in Nigeria. They automate the management of different power sources: grid of generators, solar power or batteries. They could commercialise this technology because in Nigeria many people don\u2019t rely solely on power from the grid.\n\nIt\u2019s not the same in Japan. If we need to develop that technology in Japan, we have to create a very artificial environment where power is not stable enough. Interestingly, in Japan we are seeing more solar power sources being introduced in each home and now they need to get this power generated by solar to be combined with the power coming from the grid and sell to their communities.\n\nTo wrap this up, the fourth pillar is about startups that facilitate African content created by Africans for Africans. That\u2019s why we have invested in a company like Mdundo, which is seen as the African version of Spotify. We\u2019ve also invested in a company called Athlst, which publishes first-person narratives of African athletes from around the world.\n\nSatoshi Shinada, Maya Tada ( team member at Kepple Africa) and Lanre Aina, Co-Founder/CEO of ATHLST\n\nDA: You\u2019ve invested in almost 100 startups within 3 years. That\u2019s unusual. Why?\n\nSS: Yes, it\u2019s intentional for a number of reasons. We didn\u2019t start out early in VC investing in Africa; we entered this market in 2018. But I think we came to the market at the right time. When we came in, the ecosystem had matured, so we thought it would make sense to bet on great startups quickly.\n\nOur swift approach is modelled after one of the most successful VCs in Southeast Asia, BeeNext. BeeNext makes most of its returns from follow-up investments. So their first cheque is to get their feet in so many startups so they become an insider and know what\u2019s going on in their portfolio companies. Once they see signs of exponential growth, they double down on their investment.\n\nAnother reason we invested in many startups was that we were new to the ecosystem, so we had to establish a reputation by increasing our presence so that we would access greater deal flow. Moving very fast and efficiently did that for us.\n\nFurthermore, we wanted to challenge the perception that Japanese companies are slow. Japanese companies are notoriously known for their very slow decision-making process, compared to Indian or Chinese companies.\n\nDA: How have you been able to combine speed and quality while investing in startups?\n\nSS: That\u2019s a good question, It\u2019s always a balance between the quality and the speed. If you\u2019re investing in seed-stage startups, you don\u2019t have to do very detailed due diligence because one day the startup can decide to change its entire business model. This rarely happens in Series A. You just need to do more detailed due diligence on their product, tech, corporate governance and the founder.\n\nFor the seed-stage deals, it\u2019s more based on your conviction and trust in the founders. If you can build enough trust and conviction, with the minimum amount of due diligence, you should go ahead. And that\u2019s the strategy we took: we usually spend less than one month for due diligence when we invest in seed-stage deals. The quickest investment we\u2019ve made took two weeks, from the first introductory call to wiring the capital.\n\nDA: Tell me about some mistakes you\u2019ve made?\n\nSS: I\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\nAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\n\nDA: Have you had any bad experiences with the startups? Has any startup in your portfolio gone bankrupt?\n\nSS: I don\u2019t have any business that went bankrupt in my portfolio companies.\n\nWe\u2019ve had two companies that stopped operating, but it\u2019s not like the founders just disappeared. We understood how it happened and the founders were serious enough to explain to us what\u2019s going on. One of them even gave back 100% of the money that we invested. So, it wasn\u2019t a very bad situation.\n\nInitially, we thought we\u2019d have many cases of the stories you hear about startups going under or disappearing because our investment has been driven more by conviction and trust with our founders than anything else, but that\u2019s not happening yet. I think this is great validation.\n\nSatoshi Shinada, Maya Tada and the co-founders of Releaf\n\nDA: I see on your website it says you\u2019ve stopped accepting applications. What\u2019s happening?\n\nSS: Yes, that\u2019s true. Now we are in transition to our fund two. So we temporarily stopped accepting applications, but we still keep the form open and get about three to four applications per day. We think it\u2019s very important to keep our doors open to any new startups.\n\nInterestingly, about 85% of our investments was made into the startup that was introduced by one of our portfolio companies, or other co-investors. So the referral is the most important source of the deals. But if you just rely on that, you might miss someone coming from outside the network. So, we want to keep that door open for the outside.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your ticket size?\n\nSS: We are focused on seed-stage deals. Our first cheque is between $50K and150K. Once we invest, we look at the revenue growth in our portfolio companies, and if it shows very dramatic growth, we will do a follow-up investment, which could be somewhere between $200K to $1 million. Where we invest $1 million, it would be a syndicate between other Japanese investors.\n\nDA: Talking about Japanese investors, are there any other Japanese investors in Africa?\n\nSS: There are a few other Japanese VCs, but unfortunately, none of them have their cooperation in Africa. They just go back and forth between Japan and Africa; they\u2019re remote investors.\n\nCompared to them, we think of ourselves as very much committed to Africa because of our background of doing business in Africa. We\u2019ve noticed that a number of them just copy our investment deals. We don\u2019t like this and aren\u2019t comfortable with people just copying us while we\u2019re on the ground bearing the cost of making investments.\n\nDA: Hmm, so why are there not so many Japanese investors on the ground like Kepple?\n\nSS: Well, I think it\u2019s not as a result of the lack of capital or lack of willingness from the Japanese investors to invest in Africa; it\u2019s more about the shortage of capable and experienced talents who can manage the funds in Africa. It\u2019s very difficult to find talent who understand the African market and who can commit their lives to Africa.\n\nI\u2019m single, so it\u2019s very easy for me to move around, but my partner Ryosuke, who is based in Kenya, had to bring his wife and two kids along with him. He\u2019s really committed. His family has been around for a while such that his kids now speak Swahili.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "Nigeria became the first country in Africa to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) this week after President Muhammadu Buhari unveiled the eNaira at the State House in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nIssued by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the digital currency is built on a private blockchain technology developed by Bitt Inc and has the same value as the fiat or physical currency.\n\nThe new currency can be accessed and used via the eNaira wallet (named \u201cSpeed\u201d), a digital storage held and managed on a distributed ledger. The wallet is available for download via app stores like Google Play Store and Apple App Store.\n\nHowever, questions remain about the use cases of the eNaira.\n\neNaira use cases\n\nFinancial institutions are responsible for onboarding their customers and integrating the eNaira wallet feature into their digital banking channels.\n\nFor individuals and merchants/businesses, the wallet is required to access, hold and use the eNaira. Users can also dial a USSD shortcode and follow the required steps to perform transactions.\n\nGoing by CBN\u2019s guidelines, the requirements for opening a wallet, transaction and balance limits, as well as transaction types available, are based on the wallet tier a user belongs to.\n\nThe dedicated individual wallet for eNaira recorded over 100,000 downloads on Google Play Store less than 48 hours after its rollout, according to reports, before it was removed following a series of complaints and poor ratings. The merchant version had been downloaded more than 10,000 times.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor now, eNaira transaction types available to individual consumers via the wallet include person-to-person (P2P) transfers between friends and family; person-to-business (P2B) to pay for goods or services; and person-to-government (P2G) to pay for public services.\n\nNigerians can also transfer cash from bank accounts to the eNaira speed wallet and vice versa, receive support allowance directly from the CBN through government-to-person (G2P) transfers and carry out any other services as may be approved by the CBN from time to time.\n\nUsing the wallet, merchants can send money to their bank accounts and vice versa, as well as carry out merchant/business-to-person (M/B2P) transfers. Merchants also have to sweep their balance(s) into their bank accounts on a daily basis.\n\neNaira Merchant speed wallets can thus be used for receiving and making eNaira payments for goods and services as well as salary payments.\n\nCommercial banks like Stanbic IBTC and Guaranty Trust Bank already have how-to instructions on their websites. According to the banks, the wallet guarantees secure, faster, cheaper, and more convenient transactions for individual and merchant users.\n\nIn the long run, CBN envisions a scenario where financial institutions build an ecosystem of services, such as cross-border transfers, with eNaira as the base product. For instance, a Nigerian trader with a UBA account will be able to settle his import bills from China using eNaira.\n\nThe digital currency could also bring a significant majority of Nigerians without bank accounts into the formal financial economy. The minimum requirement for opening a tier 0 wallet is a phone number while the tier 1 category requires a mobile number and verified national identity number (NIN).\n\nThus, a plumber or vulcaniser in Oyo or Cross River State without a bank account can accept payments via his phone, store them in his wallet, and make transactions with any vendor.\n\nThe eNaira wallet tiers and conditions.

Image credit: CBN whitepaper\n\nIn addition, the CBN plans to integrate the eNaira into its forex process via international money transfer operators (IMTOs) to enable Nigerians easily receive remittances.\n\nTransactions on the eNaira platform are free for the first 90 days from Monday, after which banks will revert to applicable charges as outlined in the CBN\u2019s guide.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Estonian on-demand transportation company, Bolt, plans to launch electric taxi services in South Africa four months after introducing e-bike food delivery services in the country.\n\nBolt\u2019s plan comes on the heels of launching a \u201cgreen category,\u201d which allows riders to hail an electric or hybrid vehicle.\n\nHow would this be done? Per TechCrunch, Bolt plans to partner with banks in its African markets to assist its drivers in obtaining credit for buying electric vehicles and is exploring alternatives to its current scheme with leasing companies.\n\nThe company, which has operations in 45 countries \u2013 including seven in Africa \u2013 was launched in 2013 by Markus Villig, Bolt CEO.\n\nWhat does Bolt do? The company offers a variety of services such as ride-hailing, car, scooter, and bike rentals, food delivery, and, most recently, grocery delivery, branding itself as a transport and deliveries company.\n\nBesides, Bolt recently launched its food delivery service in Nigeria, and it has expanded its reach in South Africa to Johannesburg after moving to Cape Town in 2020.\n\nIs this familiar? Yes. The company provides a green card option in Kenya and also operates e-bike food delivery.\n\nThe company also plans to introduce food delivery e-mobility options in other East African markets, including Uganda and Tanzania.\n\naYo to modify business model to fuel growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Assistant on the Nokia \u2018Banana\u2019 8110 feature phone. Image: Screenshot from \u2018How KaiOS Is Becoming the 3rd Major Mobile OS\u2019.\n\naYo Holdings, a micro-insurance joint venture between MTN and Momentum Metropolitan Holdings (MMH), announced yesterday, Thursday, October 28th, 2021, that it will be transforming its technology backend and data management approach.\n\nWhat does this mean? This means aYo will be modifying its business model.\n\nWhy? The company plans to drive greater scale, better customer experience, and faster access to markets across the African continent in the coming years.\n\nWhy should you care? Launched in 2017, aYo offers hospital and life cover in Zambia, Uganda, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Also, the company says it currently has more than 15 million customers.\n\nMarius Botha, aYo Holdings CEO, said the company\u2019s vision is to become Africa\u2019s largest financial services technology platform by enabling the distribution of a diverse range of affordable and accessible microfinance products.\n\naYo and its shareholder, MTN, as of the time of writing, are currently finalising the details of a partnership with a new insurance group to gain access to more underwriter licenses and expand its product range and market penetration.\n\nAs part of this technological evolution, aYo has shifted to a cloud data warehousing approach, employing Snowflake as a solution to deal with growing volumes of customer data.\n\nBotha said, \u201cData is a key asset that we want to grow and leverage, as it will allow us to drive better outcomes and value for our customers.\u201d\n\naYo believes that experimenting with cutting-edge technologies will help them achieve their goal of providing disenfranchised Africans with access to financial services and bringing them into the economic mainstream.\n\nFacebook changes its name to Meta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? Yesterday, Thursday, October 28, 2021, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, announced at the company\u2019s Connect event that its new name will be Meta.\n\nWhy? Per The Verge, the rebranding is part of the company\u2019s efforts to shift its focus away from being known solely as a social media company and toward Zuckerberg\u2019s plans for building the metaverse.\n\nIn a blog post, Zuckerberg said its corporate structure would not change, but it would affect how financials are reported.\n\nNamibian government to reduce crime through SIM card registration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, October 26, 2021, the Namibian government announced that its plan to encourage citizens to register their identities when purchasing SIM cards is to aid the tracking down of criminals who use technology to commit crimes, among other things.\n\nIn March 2021, the government approved new regulations requiring all mobile phone subscribers to register their SIM cards before accessing network services.\n\nIs this common? Yes. 50 countries in Africa have introduced mandatory SIM card registration laws.\n\nBut Mbeuta Ua-Ndjarakana, Executive Director of the Information Ministry, has not set a date for the regulations to take effect.\n\nIn a statement, Ua-Ndjarakana stated that the request for information from stored SIM cards would be made following the regulations, including an order issued by a judge or magistrate authorising the obtaining of that information from service providers.\n\nUa-Ndjarakana said that the SIM card registration process would be done to protect consumers\u2019 privacy. He also mentioned that once the Communication Regulatory Authority of Namibia (CRAN) completes the consultation process and implementation modalities with operators, he will issue a start date for SIM card registration in the country.\n\nBut does SIM card registration reduce crime in Africa? Per The Citizen, information gathered from SIM cards during the registration process is unreliable in combating cybercrime.\n\nAccording to The Citizen, experts have warned of an increased risk of citizens being subjected to state surveillance due to this technology.\n\nHowever, according to Isa Pantami, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, incidents of terror like banditry and kidnapping have significantly decreased in the country due to the implementation of a policy requiring citizens to obtain a National Identification Number (NIN).\n\nWhat\u2019s your take? Do you think SIM card registration combats crime or increases surveillance in Africa?\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nLiving Below Your Means: The First Step to Wealth.

Well, on the one hand, her tech-enabled agribusiness recently raised a $3m Series A round to help accelerate global expansion. That\u2019s plenty validation. But then, it took her five years to build her first factory, and nine years in total to the Series A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiong Williams, founder and CEO, ReelFruit.\n\nBut how did someone who had dreams of becoming a medical doctor end up as an entrepreneur?

Source: Supplied,\n\nSouth African API fintech startup, Stitch has today announced its expansion into Nigeria and a $2M seed extension, with investment from Future Africa and Norrsken Foundation, among others.\n\nStitch announced an initial $4 million seed in February when it came out of stealth. This brings its total seed round to $6 million.\n\nThe startup launched officially in February 2021 with an API that provides software companies with identity verification tools and access to users\u2019 financial data.\n\nSince its launch, the company claims to have grown by 40-50% month-on-month.\n\nSpeaking about the company\u2019s expansion to Nigeria, Kiaan Pillay, Stitch CEO, says, \u201cNigeria is one of the most active markets on the continent, if not the world, for fintech. The opportunity we see here is endless.\u201d\n\nHe says the company plans to become the \u201cgo-to partner for any businesses building financial products in Africa.\u201d\n\nMore competition: Stitch would be facing off with other API fintech players such as Mono which announced a $15 million Series A earlier this month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMono, which launched in 2020, boasts partnerships with 270 businesses and 200 million financial data transactions.\n\nMeanwhile, this seed extension is to enable Stitch to grow its team in Nigeria as it prepares to expand into other African countries.\n\nCoup attempts in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\u2019s latest military coup occurred on Monday, October 25, 2021, in Sudan.\n\nThousands of Sudanese were met with bullets as they took to the streets to protest the dissolution of their democracy.\n\nPer Reuters, 7 people were killed by gunfire while 140 others were injured in clashes between soldiers and protesters.\n\nCoup \u2018pon coup: As a continent, Africa has experienced her share of challenges, deeply rooted in political tyranny and unaccountability, resulting in coups or dictatorships.\n\nAccording to Intelligence by Techpoint, Africa has witnessed 83 coup attempts since 1990, with 42 successful. Although rare today, coups still threaten democracy.\n\nRecoMed\u2019s $1.5m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tyck via Iwaria\n\nRecoMed, an online healthcare marketplace, has closed a $1.5 million financing round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the round was led by Vunani Fintech Fund with participation from others including, Growth Grid Venture Capital Partners and Push Ventures.\n\nWhat does RecoMed do? Look at it as an Amazon for healthcare professionals.\n\nLaunched in 2013, it is a platform where patients can request healthcare professionals across South Africa by searching practitioner profiles while checking reviews.\n\nRecoMed says its platform reduces the time it takes for patients to get the medical services they need. The startup takes a cut per requests made on the website.\n\nIs healthtech the next fintech? While fintech startups still get a significant chunk of African funding, healthtech startups seem to be attracting some serious cash.\n\nAccording to Disrupt Africa, funding for healthtech startups increased by 257.5% from 2019 to 2020.\n\nHowever, Africa\u2019s healthcare sector still needs more funding to increase access to quality and affordable health services. According to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), $25-30 billion in new investment will be needed to meet Africa\u2019s healthcare demand over the next decade.\n\nRecoMed plans to integrate new products into its platform with the funding.\n\nUnion54 raises $3m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnion54 Founders, Perseus Mlambo and Alessandra Martini. Credit: TechCrunch.\n\nZambian fintech startup, Union54 has raised $3 million in seed funding.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, The Y Combinator-backed startup saw investments from Tiger Global, ACE & Company, and Runa Capital.\n\nWhat does the startup do? Union54 owns an API that helps software companies issue debit cards without a bank or third-party processor.\n\nThe startup was launched by a couple, Perseus Mlambo and Alessandra Martini, this year. It is an offshoot of their previous company, Zazu, which launched in 2015 as a neobank in Zambia.\n\nThe duo launched Union54 after they encountered difficulty in issuing debit cards at Zazu. The cards had to be issued through partner banks, a process that took a lot of time.\n\nMlambo told TechCrunch that they \u201crealised that either the processor or the bank was not necessarily well equipped to be able to answer our questions or to be able to give us the product that we\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nThe funding will be channelled at building a strong engineering and product and sales team.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nNigeria\u2019s March to the Gallows.

Aside, our confidence is elevated by the team spirit and the capability of you all to deliver on the assigned mandate.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, the NURC Boss noted that with the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the Commission will deliver a 21st-century upstream petroleum regulator anchored on principles of effective and efficient services, transparency, professionalism, and cost-consciousness\u201d.\n\nHe disclosed that the Commission shall unveil its new outlook containing the regulation and the blueprint of its strategic plan in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cOur focus is to build a completely brand-new organization with a new vision, mission, culture, ethos in line with international best practices and this will entail our handshake across the border and frontier of Nigeria with similar international regulatory agencies.\n\n\u201cIn our drive to ensure best practices for a 21st-century regulator, we shall equally focus on digitalization of our activities at all levels. Our staff shall be given a sense of pride through the creation of enabling working environment.\u201d\n\nWhile once again reassuring staff and management of the Commission of the security of their jobs, he said \u201cwe shall be fair to all and sundry in our leadership approach, we shall do all in our capacity to address issues of worker\u2019s welfare and give priority to good industrial relations.

          "text": "The Federal Government will soon place a ban on further importation of barite, a move that would save $300 million every year in foreign exchange (FX).\n\nThis is as 12 barite processors have been found worthy to produce world-class barite that meets American Petroleum Institute\u2019s (API) standards.\n\nThis was disclosed in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Thursday, by Olamilekan Adegbite, minister of mines and steel development; Simbi Wabote, executive secretary, Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), and Godwin Emefiele, governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), who was represented by Anthony Ifechukwu, his special assistant, at the launch of the world-class barite product.\n\nBarite is indicated as a high gravity mineral used as sludge in the oil and gas industry to stop explosion of gas during drilling. It is mostly used by the oil and gas industry in Nigeria and this made the Ministry of Steel Development to select Port Harcourt for the launch of the product to bring the awareness closer to the users.\n\nThe major pronouncement on the proposed ban came from the executive secretary of the NCDMB who said a study was commissioned by the Board on Nigeria\u2019s readiness to produce it locally and stop importation.\n\nRead Also: FG to convince oil companies to patronise local barite producers \u2013 Fayemi\n\nWabote stated that the Board commissioned a study which eventually picked out 12 processors that can give Nigeria self-sufficiency in the product and help stop any further importation.\n\nHe said the 12 companies have thus been approved to carry on with the business at API standards. He said the FG would slam the ban in 2022, but he did not mention the specific date.\n\nThe SA to the CBN boss (Ifechukwu), while offering the support of the apex bank to the barite drive, said the CBN would no longer allocate foreign exchange as soon as the ban is placed.\n\nInstead, he said the ministers in charge of the mineral would meet with the CBN governor next week to agree on modalities for a finance package to boost local processing to meet international standards.\n\nThe concern of the CBN, he stated, is to promote whatever would help Nigeria to conserve forex use and rather earn foreign exchange as well as create jobs.\n\nSpeaking, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development (Adegbite), expressed happiness that the CBN was stepping into the mining sector with special funding, and called the launch a watershed moment in the journey to self-sufficiency in barite production.\n\nSaying the Ministry was pursuing a presidential directive as far back as 2016, Adegbite said collaboration has brought the drive to the point of success of using Nigeria\u2019s minerals to capture international market share and attract, saying the sector has already attracted $150m loans in 2017.\n\nHe said the drive also worked to reduce importation and create jobs in areas such as gypsum, kaolin, etc. He mentioned the Benue trough as the area rich in Barite while experts said the nation has mapped out 146 barite spots that can supply for the next 100 years.\n\nHe said Nigerian barite hub is being created for easy coordination with what he called Open Market System.\n\nThe director-general of the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency (NGSA), Garba, described Barite as an industrial mineral that has both upstream and downstream sectors, saying more studies were still ongoing.\n\nHe said, \u201cSoon, importation of Barite into Nigeria will stop because the processes that lead to such a policy are in progress.\u201d",

          "title": "Facebook rebrands, names itself Meta to emphasize \u2018metaverse\u2019 vision NEW",
          "text": "Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has said his company is rebranding itself as Meta.\n\nThe move comes as an effort to encompass its virtual-reality vision for the future.\n\nExperts point out that it also appears to be an attempt to change the subject from the Facebook Papers, a document trove that has revealed the ways Facebook ignored internal reports and warnings of the harms its social network created or magnified across the world.\n\nIn letter to Facebook public on Thursday, Zuckerberg described the move as the beginning of the next chapter for the internet, and the next chapter for the company.\n\n\u201cIn recent decades, technology has given people the power to connect and express ourselves more naturally. When I started Facebook, we mostly typed text on websites. When we got phones with cameras, the internet became more visual and mobile. As connections got faster, video became a richer way to share experiences. We\u2019ve gone from desktop to web to mobile; from text to photos to video. But this isn\u2019t the end of the line,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe next platform will be even more immersive \u2014 an embodied internet where you\u2019re in the experience, not just looking at it. We call this the metaverse, and it will touch every product we build.\n\n\u201cThe defining quality of the metaverse will be a feeling of presence \u2014 like you are right there with another person or in another place. Feeling truly present with another person is the ultimate dream of social technology. That is why we are focused on building this.\n\n\u201cIn the metaverse, you\u2019ll be able to do almost anything you can imagine \u2014 get together with friends and family, work, learn, play, shop, create \u2014 as well as completely new experiences that don\u2019t really fit how we think about computers or phones today. We made a film that explores how you might use the metaverse one day.\n\n\u201cIn this future, you will be able to teleport instantly as a hologram to be at the office without a commute, at a concert with friends, or in your parents\u2019 living room to catch up. This will open up more opportunity no matter where you live. You\u2019ll be able to spend more time on what matters to you, cut down time in traffic, and reduce your carbon footprint.\n\n\u201cThink about how many physical things you have today that could just be holograms in the future. Your TV, your perfect work setup with multiple monitors, your board games and more \u2014 instead of physical things assembled in factories, they\u2019ll be holograms designed by creators around the world.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll move across these experiences on different devices \u2014 augmented reality glasses to stay present in the physical world, virtual reality to be fully immersed, and phones and computers to jump in from existing platforms. This isn\u2019t about spending more time on screens; it\u2019s about making the time we already spend better.\u201d\n\nOutlining the role and responsibility of the company, he said: \u201cThe metaverse will not be created by one company. It will be built by creators and developers making new experiences and digital items that are interoperable and unlock a massively larger creative economy than the one constrained by today\u2019s platforms and their policies.\n\n\u201cOur role in this journey is to accelerate the development of the fundamental technologies, social platforms and creative tools to bring the metaverse to life, and to weave these technologies through our social media apps. We believe the metaverse can enable better social experiences than anything that exists today, and we will dedicate our energy to helping achieve its potential.\n\n\u201cAs I wrote in our original founder\u2019s letter: \u201cwe don\u2019t build services to make money; we make money to build better services.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis approach has served us well. We\u2019ve built our business to support very large and long term investments to build better services, and that\u2019s what we plan to do here.\n\n\u201cThe last five years have been humbling for me and our company in many ways. One of the main lessons I\u2019ve learned is that building products people love isn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gained more appreciation that the internet\u2019s story isn\u2019t straightforward. Every chapter brings new voices and new ideas, but also new challenges, risks, and disruption of established interests. We\u2019ll need to work together, from the beginning, to bring the best possible version of this future to life.\n\n\u201cPrivacy and safety need to be built into the metaverse from day one. So do open standards and interoperability. This will require not just novel technical work \u2014 like supporting crypto and NFT projects in the community \u2014 but also new forms of governance. Most of all, we need to help build ecosystems so that more people have a stake in the future and can benefit not just as consumers but as creators.\n\n\u201cThis period has also been humbling because as big of a company as we are, we\u2019ve also learned what it\u2019s like to build on other platforms. Living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry. I\u2019ve come to believe that the lack of choice for consumers and high fees for developers are stifling innovation and holding back the internet economy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to take a different approach. We want our services to be accessible to as many people as possible, which means working to make them cost less, not more. Our mobile apps are free. Our ads model is designed to provide businesses the lowest prices. Our commerce tools are available at cost or with modest fees. As a result, billions of people love our services and hundreds of millions of businesses rely on our tools.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the approach we want to bring to helping to build the metaverse. We plan to sell our devices at cost or subsidized to make them available to more people. We\u2019ll continue supporting side-loading and streaming from PCs so people have choice, rather than forcing them to use the Quest Store to find apps or reach customers. And we\u2019ll aim to offer developer and creator services with low fees in as many cases as possible so we can maximize the overall creative economy. We\u2019ll need to make sure we don\u2019t lose too much money along the way though.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers.\n\n\u201cAs we embark on this next chapter, I\u2019ve thought a lot about what this means for our company and our identity.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a company that focuses on connecting people. While most tech companies focus on how people interact with technology, we\u2019ve always focused on building technology so people can interact with each other.\n\n\u201cToday we\u2019re seen as a social media company. Facebook is one of the most used technology products in the history of the world. It\u2019s an iconic social media brand.\n\n\u201cBuilding social apps will always be important for us, and there\u2019s a lot more to build. But increasingly, it\u2019s not all we do. In our DNA, we build technology to bring people together. The metaverse is the next frontier in connecting people, just like social networking was when we got started.\n\n\u201cRight now our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can\u2019t possibly represent everything we\u2019re doing today, let alone in the future. Over time, I hope we are seen as a metaverse company, and I want to anchor our work and our identity on what we\u2019re building towards.\n\n\u201cWe just announced that we\u2019re making a fundamental change to our company. We\u2019re now looking at and reporting on our business as two different segments: one for our family of apps and one for our work on future platforms. Our work on the metaverse is not just one of these segments. The metaverse encompasses both the social experiences and future technology. As we broaden our vision, it\u2019s time for us to adopt a new brand.\n\n\u201cTo reflect who we are and the future we hope to build, I\u2019m proud to share that our company is now Meta.\n\n\u201cOur mission remains the same \u2014 it\u2019s still about bringing people together. Our apps and their brands aren\u2019t changing either. We\u2019re still the company that designs technology around people.\n\n\u201cBut all of our products, including our apps, now share a new vision: to help bring the metaverse to life. And now we have a name that reflects the breadth of what we do.\n\n\u201cFrom now on, we will be metaverse-first, not Facebook-first. That means that over time you won\u2019t need a Facebook account to use our other services. As our new brand starts showing up in our products, I hope people around the world come to know the Meta brand and the future we stand for.\n\n\u201cI used to study Classics, and the word \u201cmeta\u201d comes from the Greek word meaning \u201cbeyond\u201d. For me, it symbolizes that there is always more to build, and there is always a next chapter to the story. Ours is a story that started in a dorm room and grew beyond anything we imagined; into a family of apps that people use to connect with one another, to find their voice, and to start businesses, communities, and movements that have changed the world.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of what we\u2019ve built so far, and I\u2019m excited about what comes next \u2014 as we move beyond what\u2019s possible today, beyond the constraints of screens, beyond the limits of distance and physics, and towards a future where everyone can be present with each other, create new opportunities and experience new things. It is a future that is beyond any one company and that will be made by all of us.\n\n\u201cWe have built things that have brought people together in new ways. We\u2019ve learned from struggling with difficult social issues and living under closed platforms. Now it is time to take everything we\u2019ve learned and help build the next chapter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m dedicating our energy to this \u2014 more than any other company in the world. If this is the future you want to see, I hope you\u2019ll join us. The future is going to be beyond anything we can imagine.\u201d",
          "summary": "Feeling truly present with another person is the ultimate dream of social technology.\nWhile most tech companies focus on how people interact with technology, we\u2019ve always focused on building technology so people can interact with each other.\nIn our DNA, we build technology to bring people together.\nOver time, I hope we are seen as a metaverse company, and I want to anchor our work and our identity on what we\u2019re building towards.\n\u201cBut all of our products, including our apps, now share a new vision: to help bring the metaverse to life.",

Failure to recognise this may continue to damage the electoral prospect of APC.\n\n\u201cEngineering the evolution of the new regime of problem-solving information management is central to the resolution of Nigeria\u2019s security challenges\u201d, he said.\n\nHe further noted that part of the objectives of evolving a new problem-solving information management is to ensure synergy of activities of the party, government and as much as possible major national players in the business of mobilising Nigerians to contribute towards resolving national challenges.\n\nLukman added that in the context of such a coordinated strategy, there should be some regular consultations to review national challenges and develop common strategies.",

          "text": "Chief Dele Momodu, a prominent philanthropist, beloved traditional ruler, and celebrated writer, has taken yet another giant step. Ovation Media Group\u2019s Chairman has returned to politics, joining the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nThe guy who knows Nigeria like the back of his hands said his choice was based on the need to save the country from its \u2018dangerous and calamitous spiral\u2019 towards oblivion in a statement signed by himself.\n\nMomodu, who stated that he sought advice from a variety of sources before making the life-altering decision, also expressed regret to Nigerians for his role in bringing President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration to power in 2015, saying that he \u2018intends to serve Nigeria from within the PDP with all humility, purpose, vigour, and sincerity in whatever role the Party and God deem fit for me\u2019.\n\nMomodu\u2019s full statement can be found below:\n\n\u201cIt is with a deep sense of responsibility and commitment to a unified and developed Nigeria that I have decided to re-enter the political arena and join the fray of active politicking again. I have been very frustrated about the state of our country and the manner the ruling party APC has virtually returned and reduced Nigeria to the rubbles of Stone Age. I have decided to stop my perpetual lamentations and join hands with other patriotic Nigerians to rescue our nation from the brink of a calamitous collapse. Therefore, in line with practicing what I have preached for a few years now, I believe that only by joining mainstream politics and becoming a member of one of the leading opposition parties can I hope to make such meaningful difference as I have been demanding of others.\n\n\u201cI have consulted widely. And it is clear to me that given the dangerous and disastrous drift that our Nation has experienced in the past six years, the only Party from which amends can be made to rectify our situation is the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). This accords with my vehement opposition to the policies and practices of the All Progressive Congress (APC) and its leadership, which has denuded our country of everything we hold dear \u2013 National Unity, Cohesion, Security, Economic prosperity, Educational advancement, Social infrastructure, and above all, our cherished moral values.\n\n\u201cFor these reasons, I am happy to declare that I am now a full-fledged participating member of the great and patriotic Peoples Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cIt is deeply saddening and regrettable that some of the biggest and landmark achievements recorded under the PDP administration have been diluted, wasted or diminished by the present APC Government. I offer my sincere apologies on the role some of us played in 2015 in bringing President Muhammadu Buhari to power.\n\n\u201cI wish to salute the resoluteness and steadfastness of PDP members in staying strong despite the challenges being faced at all levels. I resolve to join the Party, its leadership and other members in redoubling our efforts to making Nigeria the giant of Africa it was once reputed to be. I wish to thank the leadership of my party, PDP, for fully accepting me with love and enthusiasm. I intend to serve Nigeria from within the PDP with all humility, purpose, vigour and sincerity in whatever role the Party and God deem fit for me.\n\nThank you.\n\nGod bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMomodu ran for president against the eventual winner, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, and the current president, Muhammadu Buhari, in 2011. He ran as a candidate for the National Conscience Party (NCP).",

          "text": "On Friday, students at Tai Solarin University of Education (TASUED) protested the kidnapping of their Students Union President, Sodiq Rabiu, and others by Nigerian Army soldiers.\n\nRabiu Sodiq was arrested on Thursday, according to SaharaReporters, for interfering in a dispute between students and military.\n\nAccording to sources, he and a large number of his colleagues were apprehended by soldiers stationed at Ilese Barracks.\n\nA student leader said, \u201cA few hours ago, uniformed men of Nigerian Military invaded the students\u2019 community of our dear University and melted absolute injustice, extortion and assaults on peace-loving students.\n\n\u201cTASUEDITES who are going by their legitimate and calm businesses were cornered at CONOIL Filling Station, the Express Road that leads to the university\u2019s second gate. They were arrested and assaulted for no reason. To make things worse, the soldiers asked students to bail themselves with N50, 000 and those who could not do that were detained and taken away (most likely to the barracks).\n\n\u201cAs responsible and responsive students\u2019 union officers, upon hearing the ugly development, we swung into action and made frantic efforts to mediate and rescue students from this injustice and assault cum fraudulent exploitation. This calm and ideal effort by the students\u2019 union was met with strong resistance by the military men, who, assaulted and abducted the Students\u2019 Union President.\n\n\u201cThe Senate President was also severely injured and many comrades were beaten, whipped and abducted by the military men. The Students\u2019 Union abhors this act in its totality, very displeased and frowns on the reaction of the custodian of the university to the matter when contacted.\n\n\u201cAs at the time of making this statement, the President of the Union was still in the custody of the military men. Very assertively, the Students\u2019 Union has declared lecture and exam free day tomorrow, Friday, October 29, 2021, to press home this unjust exploitation and assault. This is a total embarrassment and threat on our university community as a whole, and we will not let it go unchecked.\u201d\n\n\u201cEssentially, despite sporadic shootings at the peaceful students at the express and within the university communities, there was no gunshot injuries while we have video proofs of live ammunition used at the scenes.\n\n\u201cHowever, scores of students were brutalised and injured, including the Senate President. Meanwhile, the President is still in custody at the Ilese Barracks with other students. And we shall together make effort to release those still in the custody of this disgraceful and embarrassing men of Nigerian Army,\u201d the student leader added.",

          "text": "The Court of Appeal Division in Port-Harcourt, Rivers state, Thursday, reserved ruling till Friday in the suit brought against the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) by the immediate past chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus.\n\nThe appellate court had earlier fixed Thursday to hear and rule on a motion for an interim order of injunction brought by Secondus against the PDP and others.\n\nSecondus was removed from office by the party\u2019s National Executivuncil(NEC) following protracted crisis arising from alleged high-handedness among other \u2018sins\u2019 committed by him.\n\nDissatisfied with the decision, the PDP chieftain headed to court to challenge his removal, and also prayed the court to stop the party\u2019s national convention slated for Saturday.\n\nLegal fireworks\n\nJustice Haruna Tsamani, who leads the three-man appeal panel Thursday, however, reserved the ruling till Friday after various submissions by the party.\n\nThe embattled chairman who spoke through his counsel, Mr Tayo Oyetubo (SAN), pleaded with the court to preserve his rights as the party\u2019s national chairman by granting his application and restrain PDP from holding the convention scheduled for tomorrow (Saturday) until the substantive suit in the matter is determined.\n\nSecondus further argued that his tenure of office subsists till December 8, 2021, when he is expected to leave office.\n\nHe said if his prayers were not granted by the court, the PDP would proceed and hold the convention and elect new set of party leaders, saying this would permanently destroy his right as the party\u2019s national chairman.\n\nOyetubo submitted: \u201cI urge the court to preserve the case and the right of the national chairman, having regard for the facts of the case, the right of jurisdiction of the court to be able to deliver judgement on the main appeal.\n\n\u201cThe decision of the court today, will determine whether or not the party convention will hold, if the application is not granted, my right as national chairman will be permanently destroyed.\u201d\n\nCounter argument\n\nIn a counter argument, counsel for the first to fifth respondents, Mr Henry Bello, argued that the application can\u2019t stand the test of law and therefore can\u2019t be granted.\n\nBello contended that \u201cthe prayers made in the application by the plaintiff cannot be granted, in that the whole gamut of the five grounds of the amended notice of appeal has no iota of illusion to the national convention of the sixth respondent application.\n\n\u201cThe appeal is a clear deviation from the fact for which this appeal was instituted, which is the national convention. I urge the court to dismiss the application and award cost to the applicant for wasting the time of court.\u201d\n\nOther respondents in the suit backed Bello\u2019s submission, following which the appellate court deferred its ruling till Friday.\n\nPDP in fear\n\nMeanwhile, the court\u2019s decision to put its ruling on hold is causing some disquiet among party stakeholders, who are mostly worried by what could be the outcome of the legal tussle.\n\nBlueprint correspondent observed that the party headquarters was calm, as party faithful were seen around the Wadata Plaza in Abuja ahead of the National Convention.\n\nWhile governors elected on the party platform and a few other stakeholders appeared undisturbed, same could not be said of some others who are concerned about what tomorrow holds for the party and its future.\n\nSome of the stakeholders who spoke to Blueprint under anonymity are of the view that either way, the party will go through some challenges after the ruling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate we have found ourselves in this mess as a party. Yes, agreed, the only option left for the party was to restore peace ahead of the convention, considering the crisis of confidence that Secondus was enmeshed in.\n\n\u201cI am still of the view that things could be done better rather than putting ourselves in this suspense or anxiety if you like. A middle course would have been better for us. Secondus has a right to ask for his right. So, we will the fate that awaits our Saturday convention,\u201d said a party stakeholder.\n\nAnother member said: \u201cEither way, we will certainly face some challenges as a party. If he loses tomorrow, more work still needs be done. If on the other hand, he wins, greater work needs to be done as this would certainly constitute some setbacks of a sort in the party\u2019s strive towards 2023.\u201d\n\nScreening committee\n\nMeanwhile, the Screening Appeal Sub-Committee of the PDP National Convention Thursday submitted its report to the party\u2019s convention committee headed by Adamawa state Governor Ahmadu Fintiri.\n\nBlueprint reports that the committee had earlier disqualified three aspirants from participating in the national convention.\n\nChairman of the sub-committee and former Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu had Tuesday revealed that the committee \u201creceived about five appeals, one is in respect of the non-clearance of the deputy national secretary, by the aspirant himself, Hon. Akintan Kareem.\u201d\n\nIn related development, the PDP National Convention National Convention Organising Committee (NCOC) meets today (Friday).\n\nA statement by NCOC Secretary and Oyo state Governor Seyi Makinde said: \u201cAs part of our preparation for the forthcoming Saturday October 30 to Sunday 31, 2021 Elective National Convention of our great party, the PDP, all members of the NCOC (Main Committee), are hereby invited to a meeting as follows; Date: Friday October 29, 2021. Venue: Legacy House, Shehu Shagari Way, Maitama, Abuja Time: 3:00 pm.\u201d\n\nAlso, the committee Chairman, Governor Fintiri, his counterpart and Vice Chairman, Bayelsa state Governor Duoye Diri, have predicted that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) would collapse ahead 2023 polls.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen in Abuja Thursday, Fintiri said: \u201cI foresee that by the end of this convention, which will be adjudged as one of the best in the history, of not just the PDP but of any political party ever in this country. It is going to close down most of the political parties especially APC.\n\n\u201cWith their own democratic process, we saw what happened, from their wards and states congresses, they were really shattered. Instead of having 36 chairmen, they have about 90 something. So with this convention that we\u2019re going to deliver, I believe with the democratic process and procedures that we have followed diligently, it is going to open floodgate for all of them to come in. And I think this is not just because of the convention, also but because of the situation Nigerians are in today. Everybody is not just looking at PDP to rescue them, but they are looking at PDP as a platform that will bring in a new government in 2023,\u201d Fintiri said.\n\nOn his part, Governor Diri said: \u201cWe like to call on Nigerians and Nigerians abroad to say there is hope for this country, and this is the right time to rescue the country from the brink of collapse. Nigeria is bleeding and whether you are home or abroad, this is your country, and it is time for you to now join hands with the only main opposition party that has been reorganised, that is looking forward to having a brand new National Executive Committee elected come Saturday, so we call on our brothers and sisters home and abroad to join hands with the main political opposition party to rescue Nigeria.\u201d\n\nPDP govs meet Mimiko\n\nIn a related development, the PDP said the party was embarking on rescue mission across Nigeria to save the country from collapse.\n\nSpeaking in Ondo town, country home of the immediate past governor of the state, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, Chairman PDP Governors Forum and Sokoto state Governor Aminu Tambuwal, said the party, in continuation of their consultations across the country, was in the state to rub minds with the former governor and his people.\n\nAt the meeting which held behind closed door were Tambuwal, Governor Makinde, Governor Nyesom Wike of River state and his Abia counterpart, Okezie Ikpeazu.\n\nGovernor Tambuwal, who spoke on behalf of other governors said: \u201cWe are here in Ondo town, the resident of our leader, Olusegun Mimiko to re-invite him back to his political family, PDP and as you can see we have governors from Rivers, Oyo and Abia states and we have had a robust engagement with him.\n\n\u201cWe are very hopeful that we are going to have positive response from him soonest. Our message is simple; let us come back together to reposition the PDP towards rescuing Nigeria now.\u201d\n\nOn the 2023 general elections, Tambuwal posited: \u201cWe are to reposition the country for good and betterment of all Nigerians and to ensure that PDP is back to power in 2023.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to journalists after the meeting, Dr Mimiko said: \u201cThis is one of the series of interactions we had over two months ago and they have come at least to convince us why we should come back to join forces with them in PDP.\n\n\u201cWe have listened to them; we will go back to our stakeholders\u2019 meeting because it is them, stakeholders that will decide before we will take our decision on it.\u201d\n\nAt the meeting were former Deputy Governor of Ondo state, Hon. Agboola Ajayi, his running mate in the last governorship election, Engr. Gboye Adegbenro and other notable personalities in Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) and the PDP.\n\nThe rest were former member House of Representatives, Joseph Akinlaja; Speaker, Ondo state House of Assembly, Jumoke Akindele; former governorship aspirant, Banji Okunomo, former Chief Judge of Ondo state, Olasehinde Kumuyi; and Chief of Staff to Mimiko, Kola Ademujimi among others.",

          "title": "Revealed! How troops killed new ISWAP leader Bako, 37 others in 2 weeks",
          "text": "The Nigerian military Thursday said troops of Operation Hadin Kai in the North-east killed a total of 38 terrorists, including Bako, new leader of the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP).\n\nThe military also said a total of 1,199 terrorists and their families, comprising 114 adult males, 312 adult females and 773 children, surrendered to troops at different locations in the North-east between October 15 and 28, 2021.\n\nDirector Defence Media Operations (DMO) Brigadier-General Benard Onyeuko stated this in Abuja while briefing journalists on the update of military operations across the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cTroops of Operation HADIN KAI have sustained the aggressive posture with zest in the North East. The Theatre Command conducted a series of land and air operations in different locations have not only degraded the enemy\u2019s operational capabilities of insurgents, but have contributed to more terrorists surrendering with their families.\n\n\u2018In the course of the operations within the period, a total of 38 terrorist elements were neutralized, including the ISWAP\u2019s new leader, Bako. Also, a total of 11 criminal elements including terrorists and their informants and their logistics suppliers were arrested in the course of these operations.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, a total of 29 assorted weapons, 166 rounds of assorted ammunition, among other items were recovered. Others are; 2 gun trucks and 622 bags of fertilizer, used for production of IEDs; while 5 kidnapped civilians were rescued. Some of these feats were recorded at; Dar, Kumshe, Wulgo, Chabbol and Kijmatari villages in Borno State as well as locations along Ngala \u2013 Wulgo and Nguru \u2013 Kano roads. Other locations were; Dikwa and Mafa villages as well as Ngama village in Yobe state.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on Operation Hadarin Daji, Onyeuko said troops dominated the operations theatre with aggressive fighting patrols and other kinetic operations with the support of intensive air operations leading to various degrees of successes.\n\n\u201cCumulatively, a total of 15 kidnapped civilians were rescued; 9 armed bandits neutralized; 11 AK 47 rifles, 43 rounds of ammunition and 86 livestock were recovered as well as 34 armed bandits and other criminal elements were arrested within the period. The arrested criminals and recovered items have been handed over to appropriate prosecuting agencies for necessary action,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said both kinetic and non-kinetic efforts of the Armed Forces and other security agencies were yielding significant results, adding that the military would not relent nor rest on its oars in the fight against all forms of criminalities in the country.\n\nLai on The Economist\n\nMeanwhile, Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed has slammed a London-based news magazine-The Economist- over an article on insurgency in Nigeria.\n\nTitled \u2018Insurgency, Secessionism and Banditry Threaten Nigeria,\u2019 the piece accused the President Muhammadu Buhari administration of ineptitude, while lambasting the Nigerian military which it accused of sometimes selling weapons to insurgents.\n\nDebunking the claims at a media parley Thursday in Abuja, the minister described the publication as inaccurate.\n\nMohammed also said the claim by the medium that jihadists were carving out a caliphate in the North-east was wrong, particularly at a time terrorists were surrendering in droves as a result of pounding by the military.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs you are very much aware, there have been various reactions to the stereotypical story on Nigeria by The Economist. So, we are not about to rehash what has been said about that publication. But before dwelling on the focus of this press briefing, let me make a quick observation.\n\n\u201cThe Economist Group, of which The Economist magazine is an integral part, has been wrong about Nigeria before, just as it is wrong about Nigeria this time around. Recall, gentlemen, that shortly before the 2019 general elections, The Economist Intelligence Unit, also from the stable of The Economist Group, predicted that the presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar, will win the election. Well, The Economist was wrong. President Muhammadu Buhari won re-election by over 3 million votes. So, The Economist and other arms of the group are not infallible.\n\n\u201cNow, to the focus of today\u2019s briefing. Gentlemen, the Nigerian press is reputed to be one of the most vibrant in the world. This is not a fluke. The Nigerian press has indeed earned its epaulets, and its vibrancy has been honed by years of fearlessly taking on whoever crosses its path, whether they are colonialists or military rulers. It is therefore not a surprise that the media was assigned a role by the 1999 Constitution. Section 22 of the 1999 Constitution tasks the press, radio, television and other agencies of the mass media to, at all times, be free to uphold the responsibility and accountability of the government to the people.\n\n\u201cIn simple English, the Nigerian press has a watchdog role assigned to it by the framers of our Constitution. Please note the catchphrase, WATCHDOG. The Cambridge English Dictionary defines \u2018watchdog\u2019 as\u201da person or organisation responsible for making certain that companies obey particular standards and do not act illegally:\u201d The Constitution never envisages or mandates the Nigerian press to be a LAPDOG, which is defined by the same dictionary as \u201dsomeone who is willing to do anything that a more important person tells them to do. As a matter of fact, the Nigerian press cannot and must not play the role of a LAPDOG.\n\n\u201cThe idea of the Nigerian media, especially the traditional media, regurgitating anything and everything published or reported by its foreign counterpart is totally antithetical to its reputation of independence and vibrancy. The Nigerian media does itself a great disservice by turning itself into an echo chamber of the foreign media.\u201d\n\nExpressing his angst with the local media, the minister said: \u201cWhen The Economist reported its patently-wrong and badly-researched story, it was immediately amplified by the local media, without even interrogating its content? This is totally unconscionable! For example, The Economist reported that the Jihadist threat in the North-east has \u2018metastasized\u2019, and everyone knows that this is totally inaccurate. Prior to the time it was dislodged, which was before Dec. 2015 when I led a team of local and international journalists to Bama in Borno State, Boko Haram established the headquarters of its so-called Caliphate in that town (Bama), where it hoisted its flag, collected taxes as well as installed and removed Emirs at will. Today, Boko Haram has no Caliphate anywhere in Nigeria. Yet, the Nigerian press regurgitated that report by The Economist.\n\n\u201cAgain, at a time that Boko Haram and ISWAP are taking on each other in a mutually-destructive lockstep, and at a time that the terrorists are surrendering in droves as a result of heavy pounding by the military, it is wrong to say that Jihadists are carving out a Caliphate in the North-East, as the Economist reported. In any case, why would the Nigerian media become an echo chamber for a foreign newspaper that denigrates the Nigerian military and makes light of the sacrifices of our valiant troops? Would the British or American press regurgitate a report in the Nigerian press denigrating their militaries?\n\n\u201cGentlemen, I do not believe that the Nigerian media hates this country, neither will I agree that the media does not appreciate our military. But I appeal to you to stop endorsing the denigration of our country, our military, our institutions by some unscrupulous foreign media. By regurgitating their inaccurate stories about Nigeria, you are endorsing their stand. The Nigerian media was mandated to be a watchdog, not a lapdog.\u201d",

Less than 5 per cent of the African population is fully vaccinated, leaving many countries at high-risk of further outbreaks.\n\nAs leaders prepare to meet for the G20 Summit in Rome this weekend, 48* UNICEF Africa ambassadors and supporters from across the continent have united in an open letter. They are calling for leaders to honour their promises to urgently deliver doses, writing that \u201cthe stakes could not be higher.\u201d\n\nThe letter\u2019s signatories, including Angelique Kidjo, Arlo Parks, Davido, Tendai Mtawarira, Femi Kuti, Tony Elumelu, Ramla Ali, Kate Henshaw, Winnie Byanyima and others, are calling on leaders to donate the pledged vaccines by December, along with the necessary resources to turn the vaccines into vaccinations.\n\n\u201cEvery day Africa remains unprotected, pressure builds on fragile health systems where there can be one midwife for hundreds of mothers and babies,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cAs the pandemic causes a spike in child malnutrition, resources are diverted from life-saving health services and childhood immunization. Children already orphaned risk losing grandparents. Disaster looms for sub-Saharan African families, four out of five of whom rely on the informal sector for their daily bread. Poverty threatens children\u2019s return to school, protection from violence, and child marriage.\u201d\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, WHO, some 80,000 to 180,000 healthcare workers globally are estimated to have died from COVID-19 between January 2020 and May 2021. Less than 1 in 10 healthcare workers in Africa have been fully vaccinated and more than 128,000 have been infected with the virus. The agency has also found only one in seven COVID-19 infections are detected in Africa due to limited testing, meaning the true number is likely much higher.\n\n\u201cSaving lives in Africa starts by saving the lives of the life-savers,\u201d said Fore. \u201cToo many communities on the African continent were already grappling with stressed healthcare systems.

The kidnappers, who were joined by other tactical teams, felt threatened when they saw their numbers and the pressure mounted, so they abandoned their vehicle with the victims and fled into hiding. The victims were unharmed when they were rescued and have since been reunited with their families.\u201d Abattam stated\n\nHe added that the victim\u2019s G-Wagon jeep was later recovered at the scene with three expended cartridges.

When this issue of Kyari started, we took our own action by constituting a panel to look at the allegation that was made against the senior officer.\n\n\u201cThe allegation was based on receiving gratification and also fraternising with Hushpuppi and his group and even receiving some instructions and so forth.\n\n\u201cWe looked into all these allegations by a committee that was set up chaired by a DIG, we submitted our report to the SGF for vetting and advice on the finding we have gotten from the investigation.\u201d\n\nHe added that his office had received the legal advice from the office of the Attorney General, \u201cwhich we are working on what to do next in terms of asking the officer to account for what we have gathered in the investigation and what we will do next.\n\n\u201cBut as for extradition order, I have not received any, I\u2019ve not heard of any.\u201d\n\nThe socialite, Hushpuppi, was arrested in Dubai in June, 2020, over allegations of internet fraud and extradited to the United States where he was reported to have indicted DCP Kyari.\n\nOn the deployment of security personnel for Anambra gubernatorial poll, the IG stressed that although the heavy security presence may affect the turnout of voters, the measure was necessary to checkmate criminals disrupting the process.\n\nHe stated that in a bid to ensure that Anambra people come out to exercise their franchise, the police is deploying the use of jingles and talking to stakeholders to assure them of their safety.\n\nAccording to him, most officers that would be assigned to polling stations would be unarmed as they would be involved in checking vote rigging and illegal campaign at venues.\n\nOn the possibility of the mass deployment being counterproductive, the police boss said: \u201cAs for the massive deployment, yes, it has its advantage, and it has its disadvantage, and that is why knowing the fact that it has disadvantage of may be militarising the electoral process, we try to involve the engagement of public enlightenment, the engagement of stakeholders that our presence is to police the situation in two ways.\n\n\u201cIt is, while we are asking people to come out and vote, another group or other subversive elements are saying \u2018don\u2019t come. If you come, we\u2019ll do this, we\u2019ll do that.\n\n\u201cSo, there must be some level of assurance that we would give to these people to come out and that requires massive deployment of officers and men who would also ensure that the subversive elements do not take over the process.\n\n\u201cWhile we have other elements that would police the election, which is mostly\u2026we don\u2019t even deploy them with arms. Those we are deploying to polling stations to ensure orderliness and checking of electoral malpractices, like vote buying, campaigning in the place and so forth, this does not even require carrying of arms.\n\n\u201cBut you also need to put officers on standby, on patrol that would check the would-be persons that can carry arms against the state.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to educate and enlighten people that our presence is for the benefit of everybody; that our presence is for the benefit of ensuring that they come out and exercise their franchise of voting who they want.\n\n\u201cAnd that is the essence of the jingles we are doing, the essence of going to do community engagements, stakeholders, meetings, talking to their religious leaders and so forth.\n\n\u201cI think it has its advantage; it has its disadvantage, but we try to as much as possible ensure that it is for the advantage of everybody that the massive deployment should take place.\u201d\n\nBaba also emphasised that security forces have made efforts to stabilize the security situation in the southeast by launching various operations.\n\nThe IG said the police was maintaining its grounds and ensuring that crime and criminality were checked.\n\nEditor",

          "text": "Developer China Evergrande Group has made an interest payment for an offshore bond before a grace period expired on Friday, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said, narrowly averting a catastrophic default for the second time in a week.\n\nEvergrande, once China\u2019s top-selling developer, is reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities, fuelling worries about the impact of its fate on the world\u2019s second-largest economy as well as on global markets. read more\n\nThe property developer, which staved off a default last week by securing $83.5 million for the last-minute payment of interest on a bond, needed to make $47.5 million in coupon payments to bondholders by Friday.\n\nA failure to pay by the Friday deadline would have triggered cross-defaults on all of the company\u2019s $19 billion worth of bonds in international capital markets, in what would have been the world\u2019s second-largest emerging market corporate debt default.\n\nEvergrande did not respond to Reuters\u2019 request for comment. The people declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nReuters was not able to determine the source of the funds used to make the interest payments. Bloomberg News reported earlier this week that Chinese authorities had urged Evergrande\u2019s founder, Hui Ka Yan, to pay the developer\u2019s debts out of his personal wealth.\n\nShares of Evergrande gave up early gains to fall about 0.8% by late morning on Friday, versus a 0.3% decline in the Hang Seng Index (.HSI). The Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index (.HSMPI) fell about 0.9%, while an index of developers\u2019 mainland A-shares (.CSI000952) dropped 3.6%.\n\nPrices of the developer\u2019s bonds jumped higher on Friday, with its 11.5% January 2023 bond surging more than 9%, and its 12% January 2024 bond up nearly 8% on the day, data from Duration Finance showed.\n\nThat still left them trading at discounts of more than 75% from their face value, with the 2023 bond yielding nearly 190%.\n\nOne bondholder said he maintained a negative outlook for the developer despite it making the coupon payment.\n\n\u201cI only think they are buying time at this point,\u201d the bondholder said.\n\nEvergrande missed coupon payments totalling nearly $280 million on its dollar bonds on Sept. 23, Sept. 29 and Oct. 11, beginning 30-day grace periods for each.\n\nIt still has nearly $338 million in other offshore coupon payments coming due in November and December.\n\nThe New York Times earlier reported that the developer made an interest payment, citing a person speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cEvergrande has tried its best to solve liquidity problems, but it\u2019s a little bit difficult to gather enough capital to pay all the debt,\u201d said Cliff Zhao, chief strategist at China Construction Bank International in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cI think there (will) be some negotiations between Evergrande and its lenders, so some sort of haircut is still possible. The market still needs some time to digest and to price this in.\u201d\n\nDEBT CRISIS\n\nEvergrande\u2019s woes have snowballed for months and its dwindling resources set against its vast liabilities have wiped out 80% of its value, leading some analysts to consider default at some point inevitable. read more\n\nEven as Evergrande secures funds to make payments, other Chinese developers whose fortunes have been hit by market concerns over Evergrande\u2019s debt crisis have slid into formal default.\n\nFantasia Holdings Group Co Ltd (1777.HK), Sinic Holdings (Group) Co Ltd (2103.HK), China Properties Group Ltd (1838.HK) and Modern Land (China) Co Ltd (1107.HK) have all defaulted on dollar debt obligations this month.\n\nOther developers with significant dollar debt have proposed extending offshore bond maturities or undertaking debt restructuring in a meeting with regulators, sources have said. read more\n\nIn a meeting with developers this week, China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the State Administration for Foreign Exchange told developers facing large offshore debt maturities to evaluate repayment risk and report difficulties.\n\nThe NDRC also implored developers to meet offshore debt obligations, and maintain their reputations and market order.\n\n\u201cSelective defaults in the offshore market are emphatically not acceptable for the authorities, and the NDRC clarification this week should reassure offshore investors that they will be treated fairly alongside onshore investors,\u201d DBS strategist Wei Liang Chang said in a client note.\n\nEven developers who have not defaulted have seen their share and bond prices walloped. On Friday, Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd (0127.HK) said it would book an aggregate loss of HK$1.36 billion in the current fiscal year from the sale of all of its bonds issued by peer Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd.\n\nConcerns over the systemic impact of a default by Evergrande have widened spreads on Chinese high-yield dollar debt to record levels as investors demand higher risk premiums.\n\nInvestor worries have also kept the cost of insuring against default on China\u2019s sovereign debt elevated. That cost earlier this month touched its highest level since the height of the pandemic in 2020.\n\nBANK EXPOSURE\n\nFounded in Guangzhou in 1996, Evergrande epitomised a freewheeling era of borrowing and building. But that business model has been scuttled by hundreds of new rules designed to curb developers\u2019 debt frenzy and promote affordable housing.\n\nAny prospect of Evergrande\u2019s demise raises questions over the fate of more than 1,300 real estate projects it has ongoing in some 280 cities.\n\nBank exposure to developers is also extensive.\n\nA leaked 2020 document, branded fake by Evergrande but taken seriously by analysts, showed the developer\u2019s liabilities extended to more than 128 banks and over 121 non-banking institutions.\n\nReuters",

          "title": "\u2018Everything is at Stake\u2019 as World Leaders Gather for Climate Talks",
          "text": "More than one world leader says humanity\u2019s future, even survival, hangs in the balance when international officials meet in Scotland to try to accelerate efforts to curb climate change. Temperatures, tempers and hyperbole have all ratcheted up ahead of the United Nations summit.\n\nAnd the risk of failure looms large for all participants at the 26th U.N. Climate Change Conference, known as COP26.\n\nSix years ago, nearly 200 countries agreed to individualized plans to fight global warming in the historic 2015 Paris climate agreement. Now leaders will converge in Glasgow for two weeks starting Sunday to take the next step dictated by that pact: Do more and do it faster.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy. Except for a slight drop because of the pandemic, carbon pollution from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas is increasing, not falling.\n\nBetween now and 2030, the world will spew up to 28 billion metric tons (31 billion U.S. tons) of greenhouse gases beyond the amount that would keep the planet at or below the most stringent limit set in Paris, the United Nations calculated this week.\n\n\u201cEverything is at stake if the leaders do not take climate action,\u201d young Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate said. \u201cWe cannot eat coal. We cannot drink oil, and we cannot breathe so-called natural gas.\u201d\n\nHer words were echoed by a man tasked with steering one of the world\u2019s richest economic blocs through the climate transition.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting for the survival of humanity,\u201d European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans said. \u201cClimate change and the threatening ecocide are the biggest threats humanity faces.\u201d\n\nClimate change is fueling heat waves, flooding, drought and nastier tropical cyclones. Extreme weather also costs the globe about $320 billion a year in economic losses, according to risk modeling firm AIR Worldwide. And people die.\n\n\u201cThe unhealthy choices that are killing our planet are killing our people as well,\u201d said Dr. Maria Neira, director of public health and environment at the World Health Organization.\n\nHumanity and the Earth won\u2019t quite go off a cliff because of global warming, scientists say. But what happens in Glasgow will either steer the world away from the most catastrophic scenarios or send it careening down a dirt road with tight curves and peril at every turn. It\u2019s a situation where degrees, even tenths of a degree, translate into added risk.\n\n\u201cWe are still on track for climate catastrophe,\u201d United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Tuesday, even after some countries\u2019 recent emission pledges.\n\nFor months, United Nations officials have touted three concrete goals for these negotiations to succeed:\n\n\u2014 Countries must promise to reduce carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 compared with 2010.\n\n\u2014 Rich countries should contribute $100 billion a year in aid to poor countries.\n\n\u2014 Half of that amount must be aimed at adapting to climate change\u2019s worst effects.\n\nWorld leaders have recently softened those targets a bit, and they say the goals may not quite be finished by mid-November, when negotiations end. U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry told The Associated Press: \u201cThere will be a gap\u201d on emission targets.\n\nUnder the Paris pact, nations must revisit their previous pledges to curb carbon pollution every five years and then announce plans to cut even more and do it faster. Delayed a year by the pandemic, this year\u2019s meeting is the first to include the required ratcheting up of ambitions.\n\nThe hope is that world leaders will cajole each other into doing more, while ensuring that poorer nations struggling to tackle climate change get the financial support they need.\n\nThe headline goal set in Paris was to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times. The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since then.\n\nFormer United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said this month that the 1.5-degree mark \u201cis the threshold for our survival, humanity, our planet Earth.\u201d\n\nBut every analysis of current climate-change pledges shows that they are not nearly enough to stop warming at that point but will instead lead to at least another degree or a degree and a half Celsius of warming (about 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nAll five emissions scenarios studied in a massive UN scientific assessment in August suggest that the world will cross that 1.5-degree-Celsius threshold in the 2030s, though several researchers told the AP that it is still technically possible to stay within that limit or at least temporarily go over it and come back down.\n\nSmall island nations and other poor, vulnerable communities said in 2015 that 2 degrees would wipe them out, and insisted on the 1.5-degree threshold.\n\n\u201cOur way of life is at stake,\u201d said Tina Stege, the climate envoy for the Marshall Islands. \u201cOur ability to provide our children with a safe and secure future is at stake. Atoll nations like the Marshall Islands do not have higher ground to retreat to.\u201d\n\nIn Glasgow, divisions between nations are big, and trust is a problem, say several United Nations officials and outside analysts.\n\nRich countries like the United States and European nations developed carbon-belching energy and caused most of the problem historically, but now they ask poor nations to cut or eliminate the use of fossil fuels. In return, they\u2019ve promised $100 billion a year by 2020 to help developing countries switch to clean energy.\n\nSo far, the funding has fallen far short of that amount.\n\n\u201cFailure to fulfill this pledge is a major source of the erosion of trust between developed and developing nations,\u201d Guterres said.\n\nThe key to success may lie in the middle, with major emerging economies.\n\nThree days before the meeting starts, China, the world\u2019s largest carbon emitter, submitted a new national target that is only marginally stronger than what was previously proposed.\n\nChina is so important that if every other nation cuts back in line with the 45% global emission reduction and China doesn\u2019t, the world\u2019s total will drop only by 30%, according to Claire Fyson, a top analyst at Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists that monitor and analyze emission pledges.\n\nIn the end, every country, will be asked to do more in Glasgow, said United Nations Environment Programme Director Inger Andersen. But much of the effort, she said, comes back to China and the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe need these two powers to put aside whatever else and to show true climate leadership because this is what it will take,\u201d Andersen told the AP.\n\nBut realistically, she added, leaders in Glasgow, will take anything \u201cin terms of real, meaningful commitments that are backed by action \u2014 action that starts in 2022.\u201d",

          "text": "A criminal complaint charging former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo with a misdemeanor sex offense was filed on Thursday in a court in Albany, the state capital, the first prosecution stemming from a misconduct scandal that led to his resignation.\n\nThe filing from the Albany County Sheriff\u2019s Office, accusing Cuomo of groping a woman under her blouse, was confirmed by a spokesman for the New York state courts, Lucian Chalfen, in an emailed statement referring to the alleged offense as a \u201csex crime.\u201d\n\nCuomo, 63, who stepped down two months ago under mounting calls for his ouster from prominent fellow Democrats, including President Joe Biden, is to appear in court on Nov. 17 under a summons issued on Thursday but not yet served, the Albany Times Union newspaper reported.\n\nCuomo\u2019s lawyer, Rita Glavin, said in a statement to local media outlets that he was innocent and questioned Sheriff Craig Apple\u2019s handling of the case, saying he \u201cdidn\u2019t even tell the district attorney what he was doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not professional law enforcement; this is politics,\u201d she said.\n\nThe district attorney for Albany County, David Soares, issued a separate statement suggesting that the sheriff had acted independently of local prosecutors.\n\n\u201cLike the rest of the public, we were surprised to learn today that a criminal complaint was filed in Albany City Court by the Albany County Sheriff\u2019s Office against Andrew Cuomo,\u201d Soares stated. He declined to comment further.\n\nA copy of the complaint posted online by WNBC-TV in New York said Cuomo engaged in the misdemeanor offense of \u201cforcible touching\u201d on Dec. 7, 2020, at the governor\u2019s Executive Mansion by placing \u201chis hand under the blouse shirt of the victim \u2026 and onto her intimate body part.\u201d\n\nThe complaint goes on to say that Cuomo fondled the woman\u2019s breast \u201cfor purposes of degrading and gratifying his sexual desires,\u201d but the name of the woman has been redacted.\n\nThe week prior to his resignation, former gubernatorial staffer Brittany Commisso filed a criminal report with the Albany County Sheriff\u2019s Office alleging that the then-governor of groped her breast at the Executive Mansion in Albany late last year.\n\nThe New York Post said Cuomo was expected to be arrested next week and charged with a misdemeanor in the alleged groping of a former aide.\n\nIt said the anticipated charge resulted from a probe by the district attorney, citing a source briefed on the matter.\n\nCuomo resigned as governor in August after over 10 years in office, following a probe detailed in a 168-page report that found he had sexually harassed 11 women. read more\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James said a five-month independent investigation concluded that Cuomo had engaged in conduct that violated multiple federal and state laws. Her office did not pursue criminal charges, but local prosecutors in several counties, including Albany, said after the report\u2019s release that they were looking into the matter and requested evidence from the independent inquiry.\n\n\u201cThe criminal charges brought today against Mr. Cuomo for forcible touching further validate the findings in our report,\u201d James said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe former governor has long denied wrongdoing, though he has said he accepted \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for what he called ill-conceived attempts to be affectionate or humorous.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, I\u2019ve never crossed the line with anyone, but I didn\u2019t realize the extent to which the line has been redrawn,\u201d he said in announcing his resignation.\n\nCuomo\u2019s exit capped a months-long downfall, derailing the political career of a man once considered a possible U.S. presidential contender, and whose daily briefings early in the COVID-19 pandemic raised his national profile.\n\nCuomo\u2019s resignation spared him from possible removal from office through impeachment proceedings in the state legislature, which appeared likely even though that body is dominated by fellow Democrats.\n\nThe independent investigation found that Cuomo groped, kissed or made improperly suggestive comments to women, including current and former government workers, and retaliated against at least one woman who accused him of sexual misconduct.\n\nLike his father Mario Cuomo, Andrew Cuomo was elected to three four-year terms as governor.\n\nHe was hailed as a national leader last year at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic after delivering daily news conferences as his state became the U.S. epicenter of the public health crisis.",

It will premier in Argentina and around the world on Friday.\n\nFour different actors play Maradona at various stages of his life, and others appear as former players, coaches, agents and family.\n\n\u201cWould he have liked it?\u201d Nicolas Goldschmidt, one of the actors who plays Maradona, said in an interview with Reuters. \u201cI hope with all my heart the answer is yes.\u201d\n\nThe famously unpredictable Maradona approved the script before his death, prompting speculation that some of the details will surprise.\n\nIt certainly kicks off in dramatic fashion, with a 40-year-old Maradona on a beach, overweight and out of breath.\n\nAbout to be hospitalized after overdosing on cocaine, his business manager Guillermo Coppola tries to hide the event from the world\u2019s media.\n\nHIGHS AND LOWS\n\nMaradona\u2019s highs are well known: the successful years with Italian club Napoli, his spells with Boca Juniors, and of course the historic performances that helped Argentina win the 1986 World Cup.\n\nBut the lows \u2013 his battle with drugs and obesity \u2013 and the numerous controversies that seemed to follow him wherever he went, are not ignored.\n\n\u201cI think there are a lot of things that are still not known and that we are going to discover because this series deals with private and intimate moments,\u201d said Jean-Pierre Noher, one of the actors who plays Coppola.\n\nThe series was filmed in Argentina, Spain, Italy, Uruguay and Mexico and has already stirred debate in his homeland, where Maradona is a folk hero and considered as the greatest footballer of all time.\n\nHis former wife Claudia Villafane went to court to get some scenes removed and has said she will wait to see the final cut before deciding whether to take legal action.\n\nMercedes Moran, who plays his mother in the show, said when people see it that would help dissipate the concerns.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s something about Diego, some feeling, some light, something of the best of him,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is what we have tried to celebrate with this story.\u201d\n\nReuters",
