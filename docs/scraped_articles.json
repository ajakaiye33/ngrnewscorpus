          "text": "ThE Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Tuesday, said his administration is set to enforce a monthly tenancy on property occupancy from 2022 to alleviate annual financial pressure on tenants.\n\nSanwo-Olu said this during the inauguration of 744 units Lagos Home Ownership Mortgage Scheme (Phase one) in Sangotedo.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe state government is set for the enforcement of a monthly tenancy on property occupancy from 2022. It is confirmed that the percentage of residents depending on tenancy arrangement for housing in Lagos State is quite high.\n\n\u201cWhile building homes for those with home ownership dreams, we are also determined to cater for numerous others who may not have plans to own homes but have immediate needs for decent shelter.\n\n\u201cThe monthly tenancy is a pro-people plan to reduce financial pressure of yearly rent on tenants. The goal of this policy is to equate rental arrangements with mode of earning which is by and large monthly.\u201d\n\nThe governor added that legislative review was ongoing to reduce rent default.\n\n\u201cWe have talked through this policy and an agreement has been reached by representatives of tenants, financiers and the state government. This however should not be a cause of discontent or alarm for landlords or real estate agencies. Adequate legislative review is being done to ensure that rental default is reduced to the barest minimum,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Commissioner for Housing, Moruf Akinderu-Fatai, said, \u201cWithin the past 26 months, in line with its pledge and mandate, the state government has delivered 14 housing schemes in various parts of the state.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "\u2026as 5-point communique was signed\n\nBy Ndahi Marama\n\nThe Chairman of the North East Governors\u2019 Forum (NEGF) and governor of Borno state, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum has said with the establishment of the Forum under his leadership has helped tremendously in minimizing the atrocities posed by Insurgents due to the synergy displayed by the governors of the region and other development partners.\n\nZulum however reiterated that the restriction order he gave to Non Governmental Organisations, NGOs to henceforth desist from proving food and other relief items for people who have since relocated out of camps and resettled in their liberated communities still stand, as any violators will face the full wrath of the law.\n\nHe stated this on Tuesday during the NEGF\u2019s 6th periodic meeting which took place at the Multi Purpose Hall, Government House, Damaturu, the Yobe state capital.\n\nSince its formation last year, the Northeast governors usually meet at the end of every quarter to discuss common issues affecting the subregion with a view of reviewing challenges and cross-fertilizing ideas for better solutions, especially to the security challenges.\n\nZulum said, \u201cYour Excellencies, there is no doubt that the establishment of NEGF with its untiring and committed efforts have really impacted positively in restoring peace and hope in the entire sub region.\n\n\u201cIt has also raised the desired awareness and recognition in appropriate manners, as many NGOs and development partners have showed their sustained assistance towards our predicaments.\n\n\u201cYou may recalled that the British High Commission to Nigeria, Catriona Laing was with us during our last meeting in Jalingo, Taraba state to support the regional process of transiting from dependence on humanitarian assistance to social economic self-reliance.\n\n\u201cIt is inline with this principle that only last week, I ordered the ban on distribution of food and non food items in resettled communities of Borno state, this is to further emphasize the significance of self -reliance.\n\n\u201cYour Excellencies, we are indeed on a right track, as we have made a considerable progress in our collective efforts to bring about viable and sustainable peace and development in the zone.\n\n\u201cWhat is now required is our collective resolve towards unrelenting efforts and total commitment to the goals and objectives we have set for ourselves in tackling existing challenges, such as pockets of attacks by terrorists, kidnapping, banditry, Gender Based Violence and other social vices in the region and the country in general.\n\n\u201cWe shall also conduct regular meetings and consultations amongst ourselves in order to maintain the current momentum with our common interest.\n\n\u201cWith the current realities and development, the end to Boko Haram atrocities is near Insha Allah (by God grace).\n\n\u201cThis could be attested to the fact that recently thousands of Boko Haram insurgents and their families have willingly came out from their enclaves and surrendered to the authorities. This is a welcome development and gratifying, as we have started profiling them appropriately.\n\n\u201cI want to use this opportunity to thank our security agencies, men of the civilian Joint Task force/ Vigilantes and local hunters as well as the cooperation government recieved from the citizenry which has make our dream of peaceful co-existence a reality.\n\n\u201cI want to also use this medium to call on the Nigerian Military, the army, airforce, navy, paramilitary and other sister security agencies to use the kinetic approaches, take the fight to the enclaves of unrepentant Boko Haram terrorists, rather than remain defensive.\n\n\u201cWe as Governors of the region will continue to give our maximum support to the security agencies to ensure that the atrocities posed by criminals are subdued.\u201d Zulum said.\n\nEarlier in his welcome address, the host, governor of Yobe state, Mai Mala Buni, said, to ensure peaceful development, there is the need for the federal government to provide its maximum support and cooperation in recharging the Lake Chad basins and the actualisation of the Mambila Hydro Power Projects among other major issues.\n\nGovernor of Gombe, Inuway Yahaya was in attendance, while that of Adamawa, Bauchi and Taraba states sent their Deputies.\n\nOthers who graced the occasion include Secretaries to the six State Governments, SSGs, Commissioners, Permanent Secretaries of ministries and parastatals, some Security chiefs in the Theatre,, traditional Rulers and other critical stakeholders.

The Forum, noted the significant improvement in the security situation in the sub-region as evidenced by the mass surrender of Boko Haram fighters and commended the Federal Government for its various initiatives towards stabilising the sub region. However, the Forum urgedfor the establishment of a sustainable programme for the handling of the repentant terrorists. The Forum noted that kidnapping and farmer-herder clashes amongst others are worrisome in the sub-region and resolved to undertake the necessary measures to curtail the menace.\n\n\u201c2. The Forum deliberated on apresentation by the Hon. Minister of Power on planned and on-going Power Projects in the North East which highlighted the challenges of steady power supply to the sub-region and noted with dismay the near one year lack of electricity in Maiduguri and its environs. It urged the Federal Government to urgently find a lasting solution. The Forum further raised concerns over the non- commissioning of the Dadin Kowa and kashimbila hydro-power plants which is stalling development of the sub-region,and appealed to the Federal Governmentto increase its investments in the sub-region to guarantee peace and economic prosperity.\n\n\u201c3. The Forum deliberated extensively on the Mambilla Hydroelectric project. It called on the National Assembly and the Federal Government to make adequate budgetary provision in the 2022 appropriation bill for the implementation of the project.\n\n\u201c4. The Forum, while recognizing that the 2022 budget is in its final stages, calls on the National Assembly to look critically at the subregion with a view to ensuring that adequate budgetary provisions are made for all major capital projects in the Sub region.\n\n\u201c5. The Forum resolved to have its next meeting from 9th to 11th March 2022 at Gombe, Gombe State.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2026 Says only 20% of inbound passengers submit for tests\n\nBy Chioma Obinna & Gabriel Olawale\n\nThe Lagos State Government on Tuesday said it has commenced the prosecution of inbound international passengers who fail to submit themselves for Day 2 and Day 7 PCR tests as mandated by the Federal COVID-19 protocols and guidelines.\n\nThe state government also disclosed that from its data analysis, only 20 percent of inbound passengers who pay for the COVID-19 PCR tests prior to their arrival in Lagos actually submit themselves for the tests.\n\nDisclosing this in a press statement, the state Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi explained that the prosecution of defaulting inbound passengers has become necessary in order to reduce the rise in COVID infection in the fourth wave of the pandemic in the state.\n\n\u201cLagos State Government is concerned with the dramatic rise in cases seen in the evolving fourth wave. Identifying that our previous waves are associated with non-compliance of inbound passengers with the testing guidelines, we have commenced prosecution of inbound international passengers who fail to submit themselves for Day 2 and Day 7 PCR tests as mandated by the Federal COVID-19 protocols and guidelines.\n\n\u201cIn addition, unvaccinated inbound passengers and anyone testing positive for COVID-19 are mandated to self-isolate at home for seven days. We will be sanctioning anyone found to be disregarding these guidelines, which are designed to minimise the community transmission of COVID and its variants\u201d\n\nAbayomi said the State government has started contacting the defaulting passengers and patients for arraignment before a mobile court for special offenses.\n\nHe explained that defaulting recalcitrant persons who flout the testing and isolation guidelines has been ongoing for a while and is responsible for previous waves of infection in Lagos.\n\nThe Commissioner said that the alarming trend of defaulters constitutes a State and National public health and security threat, and sabotages all efforts to mitigate and reduce the impact of the fourth wave on citizens and the economy of the State.\n\nAccording to him, inbound passengers are likely to be carrying new variants of COVID-19 whose clinical implications and impact are not yet clearly understood amongst the population.\n\nAbayomi noted that any citizen with symptoms of COVID or who test positive for the virus and refuse to isolate, is inadvertently placing other innocent citizens at risk stressing that this can result in severe sickness and death particularly in vulnerable persons. He added that this also places undue burden on State health resources.\n\n\u201cFrom our data analysis, we discovered that only about 20 percent of inbound passengers who pay for the COVID-19 PCR tests prior to their arrival in Lagos actually submit themselves for the tests on the required day at our designated laboratories. Our data also shows that a significant number of inbound passengers who actually do the tests on the designated days are testing positive and if they don\u2019t self-isolate they pose a serious threat to the States ability to manage the fourth wave.\n\n\u201cTo protect the rest of our citizens from this irresponsible behaviour, the Lagos State Government is taking some decisive actions. We have started contacting all those that have not done their Day two and Day seven tests by text messages. These messages are not a scam. We advise that if you receive such a message please respond and present yourselves before the mobile court to explain why you did not do the Day two or Day seven PCR tests as required. If we are unable to reach you by SMS, it implies that you have given us false information on your data forms, this in itself is also an offense.\n\n\u201cIf we cannot reach you or you fail to present to a mobile court, your passport details will be forwarded to the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 and the Immigration Department who will in turn deactivate the passport of such persons for a year. And this basically means that they will not be able to travel out of the country for a period of one year\u201d.\n\nThe Commissioner noted that the State government will not fold its arms and watch the irresponsible actions of some citizens erode the success recorded in the war against COVID-19 stressing that the battle against the global pandemic is a shared responsibility and the State now has elaborate laws to protect its citizens from the impacts of contagious pandemics.\n\nAbayomi advised passengers coming into Lagos to obey and abide by the laid down protocols, noting that ignorance of the law will not be an acceptable excuse.\n\n\u201cIt is also important to note that if you are positive on day two of entry into Lagos it may be likely that you are in possession of a fake PCR test that you used to board the inbound flight. This will also be investigated through our international networks. Fake PCR tests certificates and vaccination cards from any part of the world can be verified and will attract severe sanctions. Please do not solicit or entertain any offers to provide fake results or certificates\u201d, he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".\n\nBy Bose Adelaja\n\nFEDERAL Medical Center FMC, Ebute \u2013 Metta\u2019 on Tuesday, reacted to an allegation levelled against it by the father of the late patient, Mr Bashiru Wahab that his four years old son, Bashiru Kehinde, died in the hospital due to the incompetence of its health workers.\n\nReacting to the publication of Sunday, 12 December 2021, published on Vanguard News website titled, \u2018\u2019 How I lost my 4-yr-old son to the incompetence of health workers in Lagos \u2014 Bereaved father\u2019\u2019, a statement signed by Dr Olorunfemi Ayoola, the Assistant Director, Corporate Services of the hospital described the narration of the bereaved father as inaccurate and capable to mislead members of the public.\n\nRecalled that the bereaved father, a businessman alleged that his late son, Bashiru Kehinde who was in Nursery Two, died of stomach complications at the hospital.\n\nThe resident of Egbeda in the Alimosho area of Lagos said he had taken the child to Ipinlerere Health Center, Alimosho and Lagos State University Teaching Hospital LASUTH before he got a referral to FMC, where the son was admitted, and unfortunately, died a few hours later.\n\nWahab attributed his son\u2019s death to the incompetence of the health workers a situation which made him cry out for justice over the death of his son.\n\nHowever, the hospital management on Tuesday expressed its deepest condolence to the bereaved father and his family over the loss of their beloved son but debunked the allegation that the boy\u2019s death was caused by the incompetence of the health workers.\n\nThe statement partly reads, \u2018We wish to express our deepest condolences to Mr Bashiru Wahab and his family on the loss of their beloved son.\n\n\u2018\u2019Master Kehinde Bashiru, a 4-year-old male child was presented to the emergency room of FMC Ebute-Metta at about 3:30 am on the 5th of December 2021.\n\n\u2018\u2019The complaints made by the parents suggested that the child had been sick for about six days before presentation at FMC Ebute-Metta in a very grievous state and symptoms were suggestive of a complicated surgical abdomen.\n\n\u2018\u2019Unfortunately, his parents had called an auxiliary nurse to initially treat the boy at home, and after two days of this sub-standard care by an unskilled person lacking appropriate training, then embarked on the unfortunate sojourn to Alimosho Health Centre, where he was referred to Ile Epo General Hospital and was managed for two days without resolution of symptoms and was referred to Lagos State University Teaching Hospital LASUTH. He was eventually referred to Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Ebute-Metta by LASUTH; the referral letter states that it was due to a lack of bed spaces.\n\n\u201cAs alluded to by Mr Bashiru, Master Kehinde Bashiru got prompt attention upon arrival. He was resuscitated and placed on intravenous fluids (\u201cdrip\u201d), intravenous antibiotics, and a nasogastric tube was passed. Prompt investigations were conducted to assist the managing doctors to confirm their suspected diagnosis.\n\n\u2018\u2019Despite arriving about 3:30 am, within 3hours of his arrival \u2013 all investigations had been conducted and reviewed and a diagnosis achieved and surgery was delayed only because of the very poor state of the patient.\n\n\u2018\u2019On review of the results including an abdominal x-ray, it was confirmed that he had a \u2018\u2019Severe complicated surgical abdomen\u2019\u2019 (Diagnosis withheld to respect patient\u2019s confidentiality) \u2013 the parents were informed, and preparation for surgery was made \u2013 including arrangements for blood in case transfusion is required intraoperatively, and some preoperative blood screening.\n\n\u2018\u2019While these arrangements were being made, unfortunately, Kehinde started gasping. Immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation was commenced, but unfortunately, he didn\u2019t respond positively, and was declared dead at 8 am on the same 5th of December 2021, just over 4 hours in our care. Due to the unexpected turn of events, the family of Kehinde Bashiru were advised that a proper postmortem examination by the Lagos State Coroner Service would be ideal to ascertain the true cause of death. But the family did not appear favourably disposed to that idea.\n\n\u2018\u2019The complaint we initially got from the parents was that the drug the nurse injected was the cause of death. The patient\u2019s medication was reviewed and the drugs were as prescribed and the same batch of drugs had been administered to very many other patients without any problem.\n\n\u2018\u2019The death of Kehinde Bashiru, while unfortunate and disheartening, could have been avoided if his parents had sought early treatment and presented to FMC Ebute-Metta much earlier. The disease process leading to Kehinde\u2019s death had been progressing over six or more days prior to presentation. By the time he got to us, his situation had become quite delicate. \u2018\u2019Even an adult with the diagnosis Kehinde had and the state he presented to us would likely have a similar outcome \u2013 the prognosis of treatment is known worldwide to be very poor.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2019The allegation of negligence made by Mr Bashiru against one of our nurses is completely a new dimension and is currently being investigated by us, and if he is found not to have performed his duties to the highest standard expected of him, he will be sanctioned appropriately.\n\n\u2018\u2019We will like to inform the health authorities in the state that all the investigations and documents of our late patient like the documents of all our patients are electronically secured and we are willing to subject our line of care to a properly constituted medical audit and review board.\n\n\u2018\u2019We wish to express once again our condolences, and appeal to our people to report promptly for treatment in a hospital whenever they feel unwell,\u2019\u2019\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Bauchi State chapter of the Federation of Muslim Women Associations of Nigeria (FOMWAN) has charged Muslim clerics in the state to use their vintage position to always preach against the menace of sexual and gender based violence, particularly against women and girls.\n\nThe charge was given by the state Amira of the association, Hajiya Aisha Ibrahim Kilishi, while speaking at a two-day capacity building for stakeholders to bridge the gap created by impunity towards sexual and gender based violence (SGBV) and how to mitigate the practice in the state organized by Attah Sisters Helping Hand (ASHH) Foundation.\n\nAccording to Kilishi, gender based violence was more of culture, tradition and attitude rather than religion, declaring that Islam had clearly stipulated the rights of women.\n\nIn her words, \u201cActually what I want mallams and the Ulamas to know is that gender based violence is not religious; it is more of culture, attitude and tradition. So we want them to be sensitising the people about the punishment and the rights of women as stated clearly in the Qur\u2019an and also in the hadith (sunnah of the Prophet).\u201d\n\nShe further submitted that, \u201cwhen we look at girl-child education and handling of the right of women to economic empowerment, all these are well stated and spelt out for the followers and if they are well informed about these, they will do well and the society will be a best place to be.\u201d\n\nThey asserted that women are given their rights as stipulated by Islam, they \u201cwill be well empowered to support their husbands, support their children\u201d.\n\nAccording to the FOMWAN Amira, \u201cif a woman is not well educated, actually she will not be able to contribute to the decision that is taken as enshrined in the Qur\u2019an.\n\n\u201cWe want to see our women well educated and also in terms of entrepreneurship, not about a woman going out of the house and work but it is for the woman to be an entrepreneur in her home so that she can contribute to the well-being of the family.\u201d\n\nKilishi submitted that religious leaders were not responsible for the misconception against women, adding that culture and tradition were responsible for this.\n\n\u201cActually, religious leaders are not responsible for the misconception. Religion and culture go hand in hand. If you look at the way we dress, our languages, these are all part of the culture and it is difficult to separate them from religion. So actually, that is the reason for the misconception.\n\n\u201cOn some of the negatives, people don\u2019t look at the positives of the culture but pay more attention to the negatives and erroneously place it under religion. So all of the negatives are termed to be culture,\u201d Kilishi submitted.\n\nAccording to her, rather than subjugating women, Islam did not only encourage women but also empower them, adding that it was also against violence against women.\n\n\u201cIt is our culture that a woman should be well covered and religion has now put more emphasis on that. But when it comes to some negatives sides of it like the violence against women, some are saying that the woman must not go out to interact, to engage in entrepreneurship, do some economic empowerment things. It is because it is not religious that prevented her from doing it.\n\n\u201cOne thing is that religion encourages women to be engaged in something that will enable them to support their husbands just as the Prophet (SAW) did when he married a well established entrepreneur woman, Nana Khadijah who used to send her caravan to far countries to sell and make money.\u201d\n\nShe submitted that rather than preventing women to engage in entrepreneurship, Muslim women should be allowed to engage in it for them to be well positioned to husbands and families.\n\nKilishi added that women should be allowed to have education and also have a say in decision making in the society, adding that this will eventually rub off positively on their children, especially the girls.\n\n\u201cWomen should be well educated, they should have a say in some of the social issues that affect them and their children. It is when they do so that they will be able to pass across issues that affect their children, especially the girls in the decision making within the family. They need to be given that opportunity so that they will be able to contribute.\n\n\u201cI am encouraging the Ulamas to use their sermons to preach against SGBV in the mosques because it is a serious issue, a menace that is affecting the entire society,\u201d the FOMWAN Amira urged.\n\nAccording to her, mosques should have counselling sections with a view to guiding children about marriage before they go into it, at least three months before the marriage.\n\n\u201cWe have seen how it is done in Malaysia, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and other countries. In our own context, we have to do something. It will help to avoid violence against women in marriage from domestic violence,\u201d Kilishi asserted.",

          "text": "Nobel Laureate Prof. Wole Soyinka foretold the controversies being generated by \u2018My Participation\u2019, the autobiography of ex-Osun State Governor Chief Bisi Akande.\n\nAkande, in his preface to the book, narrated how he met Soyinka in Glendale, California and he told him: \u201cWith that book, Bisi, be ready for war!\u201d\n\nSoyinka, in his foreword to the book, said: \u201cThere are books whose very handling must be done with heavily insulated gloves since, virtually every page sizzles with contradictions between attestable reality and impudent claims, attempts to cover past crimes and dodge responsibilities. Not so, this contribution from the Wise One of Ila-Orangun.\n\n\u201cIf there is any sizzling, it is simply the fire of truth\u2019s passion that leaps at the reader from between the covers. Akande\u2019s fire prurifies, being a flame of illumination carried over from real life to brighten the pages of saga of service to Nigerian humanity.\u201d\n\nAside Soyinka, Ambassador Dapo Fafowora also observed that the revelations in the scripts might provoke litigations.\n\n\u201cHe quickly constituted a committee of our children: Oluwafemi Akande, Esq., Oyewole Akande, Esq, and Ayobamidele Akande, Esq who are lawyers to have a second look at my presentation of facts,\u201d Akande wrote in the preface.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAmong many revelations, Akande claimed that the nonagenarian Afenifere leader Chief Ayo Adebanjo\u2019s Lekki home was built for him by Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. He also said President Muhammadu Buhari reneged on his promise to make Tinubu his running mate in 2015.\n\nHe also had harsh words for former President Olusegun Obasanjo and ex-Deputy Governor Iyiola Omisore. He added that N-PDP members snatched the leadership of the National Assembly in 2015.\n\nThe author also revealed how former Vice President Atiku Abubakar was nearly stopped from joining the then fledging APC by his former colleagues in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who had decided to team up with the new party in 2012 ahead of the 2015 elections.\n\n\u201cWhen the party (APC) was ready and we were going around to all the leaders, someone reminded us that we had not seen Obasanjo and Babangida and asked them to join us.\n\n\u201cWe also decided to extend the same courtesy to Atiku Abubakar, being a former vice president. But we were a bit reluctant about Atiku because he was being avoided by the new-PDP.\n\n\u201cIn the end, we decided to meet him. The team met him in Abuja. He did not make any demand on us. He participated actively in all the congresses and tried to help the APC grow in his area.\n\n\u201cWe wooed all the leaders of the new-PDP and visited all of them. They told us they needed to hold a meeting and take a decision.\n\n\u201cNyako of Adamawa told us at a stage that he would leave them behind and join us on his own.\n\n\u201cSome of them felt they were being stampeded.\n\n\u201cOne morning, Tinubu and I were in Abuja and we learnt that the leaders of the new-PDP were meeting at the Kano House, Asokoro, which was not far from where we were staying.\n\n\u201cWe decided to join them. We phoned Buhari to join us too. Ogbonnaya Onu joined us too.\n\n\u201cWhen we got there, it became a joint meeting between the APC and the new-PDP. It was a day of our National Executive Committee meeting and all our people were waiting for me at the APC national headquarters.\n\n\u201cWhen we got to Kano House, the New-PDP leaders had prepared a document listing conditions under which they would accept to join us. They gave us a copy. Tinubu read it and said all these were unnecessary.\n\n\u201cHe reduced the two-page paper to one page of about three sentences. After some discussion, it was agreeable to both sides. We reduced the agreement to a communiqu\u00e9 and both sides signed it.\n\n\u201cThough he also attended the meeting, Governor Babangida Aliyu of Niger State escaped and was not there when we were addressing the press. That was how the new PDP joined the APC,\u201d he wrote.",

It appeared they trusted each other,\u201d Akande wrote.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHe added that Buhari offered Tinubu the running mate slot in 2014 even when he had not secured the party\u2019s ticket. He explained that this was done in the presence of Governor Aminu Bello Masari.\n\n\u201cSo, when Buhari tabled the matter, I cautioned them that this must not get out beyond the four of us. \u2018How could he be talking of a running mate when he had not secured the ticket?\u2019 I mused.\n\n\u201cI thought such information if leaked to the general public, might affect the conduct of the party\u2019s congress at the presidential primaries, if not its choice of candidate.\u201d\n\nAkande said after the primaries Buhari insisted on Tinubu but other interests started coming up, adding that Admas Oshiomhole\u2019s position was that Buhari should be allowed to choose his running mate.\n\nHe said at a point Buhari asked for three names from which he would choose from.\n\n\u201cI was angry with him. \u2018General, this was not what we agreed upon,\u2019 I said in annoyance. \u2018You are changing our agreement?\u2019 He knew I was getting angry. He said he was under pressure from some governors from the North, including those who were Muslims.\n\n\u201cI told him the slot belonged to the Southwest and to the Yoruba, religion is not a factor in leadership. \u2018That is the burden the North has brought to national politics!\u2019 He did not like my remark but kept quiet about it.\u201d\n\nAkande said ex-Edo State Governor Adams Oshiomhole and ex-Osun State Governor Rauf Aregbesola came into the venue of the meeting and Oshiomhole said it would be unfair to renege on the agreement.\n\n\u201cBuhari now said he never meant it that way. What he meant originally was that Tinubu should partner with him,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe said Tinubu became angry with Buhari and refused to join a discussion on the running mate initiated by Senator Ibikunle Amosun.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust Buhari anymore. Even if we give him names, he may decide to go outside the list. So, let him choose on his own,\u201d Akande quoted Tinubu to have said.\n\nAkande later discussed with Tinubu on phone and he mentioned Prof. Yemi Osinbajo\u2019s name as the one suggested to Buhari during the 2011 race. The name was written on a sheet of paper for Amosun and Aregbesola to present to Buhari.",

          "text": "*\u2019Jonathan not sincere with National Conference\u2019\n\n*\u2019Adebanjo knows he lacks what it takes to aspire for high political positions\u2019\n\nEx-All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman Chief Bisi Akande has said the party did not have \u2018restructuring\u2019 in its 2015 manifesto.\n\nHe said the Goodluck Jonathan administration was not sincere with the National Conference.\n\nAkande, in his autobiography, \u2018My Participations\u2019, also accused Afenifere leader Chief Ayo Adebanjo, the late Sir Olaniwun Ajayi and Chief Olu Falae, who participated in the conference, of thwarting the efforts of the progressives in the Southwest.\n\nHe said Adebanjo \u201crecognises readily and always that he never has what it takes to aspire for high political positions\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs the national Chairman of the ACN, my first letter to President Jonathan in June 2011 was to begin the restructuring of the Nigerian polity by simple devolution of the security management from the centre to the states.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n\u201cI had also been invited to the Nigerian Senators\u2019 Retreat in Uyo, Akwa-Ibom State, in 2012, where I presented a paper on policing for security in a Federation.\n\n\u201cTherefore, as the interim National Chairman of APC, I knew that I should quickly place the invitation on the Jonathan Conference before my party\u2019s interim National Executive Committee.\n\n\u201cThe invitation was viewed as diversionary and convoluted and was, therefore, unanimously rejected by the party.\n\n\u201cIn spite of everything, Bola Tinubu and I, as Yoruba leaders within APC, deliberated with the governors of the South-West states and we agreed to sponsor delegates to the conference. It was not difficult for us to see, at that time, that President Goodluck Jonathan was not sincere about the representations to and about the outcome of the conference.\n\n\u201cSince it was not a Sovereign National Conference, it was sensible to know that whatever the resolutions of the conference, it would still have to be placed before the National Assembly for possible enactment into laws. President Jonathan truly and deliberately did not place the Conference\u2019s report and resolutions before the National Assembly throughout his years in power.\n\n\u201cFor him, the Conference was merely an instrument for political propaganda. It is sheer political illiteracy to think that the word, \u2018equitable\u2019 can be easily defined to convince those who might have had extra advantages under the military \u2013created order to surrender easily,\u201d Akande wrote.\n\nHe went on: \u201cAPC did not have \u2018Restructuring\u2019 in its manifesto for the 2015 elections but promised to support devolution of power from the centre to the states. While the President (whether Obasanjo, Yar\u2019Adua, Jonathan or Buhari) has the whole of Nigeria as his constituency, members of the National Assembly that have the powers to amend the Constitution imposed on Nigeria by the military represent constituencies individually from different ethnic nationalities.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore mischievous to place the responsibility for effecting \u2018Restructuring\u2019 on the APC or its Presidency and not to appreciate that it would require deft negotiations among such members from different ethnic nationalities and constituencies or zonal and religious background before any political party or any ethnic nationality could successfully issue any fiat on the National Assembly to make laws on power devolution or on \u2018Restructuring\u2019, whatever it might connote.\u201d\n\nOn the Afenifere leaders\u2019 participation in the Jonathan conference, he wrote: \u201cI was not surprised that three old men who were virulently opposed to our aspirations in the APC found their ways into the Jonathan Conference.\n\n\u201cThese men \u2013 Sir Olaniwun Ajayi, Chief Ayo Adebano and Chief Olu Falae were once our leaders in the old Afenifere until the passage of Papa Adesanya. They could not find any younger Yoruba to send to the conference to represent our interest.\n\n\u201cThey believed, even in their old age, that they were the only people who could have gone there. Sir Ajayi, who was close to 90 at the time of the Conference, has since joined his ancestors. Chief Adebanjo celebrated his 90th birthday in 2018. Chief Falae is in his 80s. Note that Jonathan paid the conference delegates generous allowances.\n\n\u201cChief Olu Falae, a trained civil servant, who after retirement became decorated into leadership by his former military bosses, has since been trying to blindly straddle Nigeria\u2019s complicated politics. The old Afenifere and PDP coalition was fronted by these three men and General Obasanjo.\n\n\u201cChief Adebanjo, the most vociferous of them, is a blank politically-minded leader who recognises readily and always that he never has what it takes to aspire for high political positions.\n\n\u201cHe constantly harbours lumps of yellow hate-bile in his heart for any co-political leader with brighter chances for any major public office within or outside his political party.\n\n\u201cAdebanjo detests all past governors produced by his party since the UPN days and proudly says so in his regular pontifications. I always passed him for a mere political agitator among the old local party paid canvassers euphemistically called \u2018organising secretaries\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe did not, however, allow the public posturing and grandstanding of these three men and their co-travellers to distract us.\n\n\u201cWe focused on our assignment of making the APC a formidable organisation so that it could fulfil its historic role of ending, once and for all, the 16-years misrule of the PDP.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigerians have been told to brace up as the Federal Government plans introduction of new tariffs and levies in 2022 \u201cas the economy hits a recovery path.\u201d\n\nMinister of Finance, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed made this known at a public hearing on the 2021 Finance Bill organsied by the House of Representatives Committee on Finance in Abuja.\n\nShe said a couple of reforms and amendments had been recommended in the draft 2021 Finance amendment bill saying more would be introduced in the middle of 2022.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nThe minister said modest changes had been proposed but that more fiscal reforms were still in view as the ministry could not take all the proposals collected from stakeholders.\n\n\u201cOur aspiration is to do a midterm review with a possibility of another Finance Bill in mid-year 2022 to bring in more amendments.\u201d\n\nThe minister said there were ongoing legal cases against the Federal Government on VAT and stamp duties which was why the ministry stayed off those areas.\n\nShe, however, expressed hope that by mid-2022, the cases might have been dispensed with and then reforms in those areas could be proposed for parliament to consider.\n\nAhmed said there might be need to revisit the antiquated stamp duties and capital gains tax for holistic reform by the parliament.\n\n\u201cWe prepared this draft bill along five reform areas, the first domestic revenue mobilisation, the second is tax administration and legislative drafting, third is International taxation, fourth is financial sector reforms and tax equity and fifth is improving public financial management reform.\n\n\u201cThe provision in the draft bill is proposing to amend the Capital Gains Tax Act, Company Income Tax, FIRS Establishment Act, Personal Income Tax, Stamp Duties Act and Tertiary Education Act, Value Added Tax, Insurance Police Trust Fund and the Fiscal Responsibility Act.\n\n\u201cThis is to amend the Police Trust Fund Act and the Nigerian Trust Fund Acts, the purpose is to empower the FIRS to collect the Nigerian trust fund levies on companies on behalf of the fund itself.\n\n\u201cCurrently, because there is no such provision, the FIRS is unable to start collecting on behalf of the fund. Also, it is to streamline the tax and the levy collection from the Nigerian companies in line with Mr President\u2019s administration ease of doing business policy.\n\n\u201cSo we do not have NASENI going out to collect that tax, the FIRS will collect on their behalf during their collection process and it will be passed through to them.\u2019\u2019\n\nAhmed said the bill was a product of the President Muhmmadu Buhari\u2019s commitment made while presenting the 2022 budget to the joint session of the National Assembly on October 8, 2021.\n\nHe said the ministry had worked with relevant stakeholders and Fiscal Policy Reform Committee to draft the 2021 Finance bill.\n\nSpeaker Femi Gbajabiamila said the 2021 Finance Bill seeks to introduce strategic and broadminded, positive reforms that will engender best practices and guarantee interest of the investing public and businesses.\n\nHe said the bill seeks to statutorily check borrowing by local, states and Federal Government, enhance transparency and accountability in the administration in various strata of tax and public revenue generation.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to state that the essence of the 2021 bill is to further reposition our finance system to plug wastes, close openings for corruption, create opportunities for employment as well as stimulate stability and growth in our productive sectors, within the wider context of our quest for economic recovery in our country.\n\n\u201cGiven the democratic credentials of the House of Representatives under my watch as well as the need to further deepen the credibility of the process through wider participation of stakeholders, this stakeholders meeting has been designed to give Nigerians and critical stakeholders in the industry the ample opportunity to own and drive the process.\n\n\u201cIn this hall, we have very proficient professionals and experts, who as stakeholders, investors, development partners and interest groups have submitted memoranda and are ready to make contributions to the bill.\n\n\u201cIt is on this backdrop that I charge this stakeholders meeting to extensively scrutinize the templates in the bill in the general interest.\n\n\u201cWe must strengthen the institution to strategically check reckless borrowings by ensuring accountability in the use of borrowed funds and ensuring that the borrowings shall be on concessional terms or at relatively low interest rates and subject to the rigorous of legislation,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, had on December 7, transmitted a letter to the Senate, urging it to consider and pass the Finance (Amendment) Bill 2021.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

He was earlier quoted to have said that Federal Government was going to retaliate the ban.\n\nSirika was further quoted to have said that the decision to ban these countries in retaliation would be made by the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 latest by Tuesday.\n\nHowever, during the briefing, yesterday, he said: \u201cThe PSC is working with mandate ministries to address the issues surrounding the restriction imposed by some countries on travelers from Nigeria on account of the omicron variant. While each country is entitled to put in place measures to protect its citizens. Nigeria has similar responsibilities. However, based on existing relationships, Nigeria has initiated diplomatic steps to make these countries reverse their course. This is on-going in the interest of all parties concerned and we expect that positive results would emerge within the next one week.\n\n\u201cThe PSC also evaluated the developments on the relationship between Nigeria and the UAE and we are pleased to inform you that the position of the federal government is in line with established ICAO protocols and the spirit of the BASA signed with the UAE. Our sovereignty remains paramount and mutual respects shall be our guiding principle in as much as it should be in the best interest of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe PSC will at its next regular briefing on Monday, December 20, 2021 brief you fully on developments.\u201d\n\nPart of the media report had also quoted the minister of Aviation as saying that \u201cthere is a case of Saudi Arabia, which put Nigeria on the banned list \u2013 no visa, no travel, etc. So also Canada. So, today (Saturday) there was a meeting, I participated in a zoom meeting, COVID-19 task force, just for your information also.\n\n\u201cWe have given our input in aviation, it is not acceptable by us and we recommend that those countries be also put on red list, as they did similarly to us.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t allow our citizens to go into their countries who are their airlines coming to pick from our country?\n\n\u201cSo, I am very sure that in the next few days, between now and Monday, or perhaps Tuesday, at maximum, all those countries will be put on the red list from the PSC from the task force of COVID-19. Once they are put on the red list, which means they are banned, of course, their airlines will be banned.

There will be no more MOUs or MOAs.\n\n\u201cWhen the macabre dance begins, there will be no stopping it until everything is fully implemented. The insincerity of the Federal Government is not just beyond understanding, it is beyond tolerance,\u201d ASUU said.\n\nThe Benin zone clarified that strikes were a last resort to draw government attention to their plights and not intended to derail academic activities.\n\nThe Benin Zonal Coordinator of ASUU, Fred Esumeh, described members renumeration as slave wage and demanded a new benchmark for condition of service, stressing that \u201cthe Nigerian universities are no longer attractive to foreign lecturers, including neighbouring countries.\n\n\u201cThis is due to the prevailing slave wage where the highest ranked professor earns less than a thousand dollars monthly,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Akure Zonal Coordinator, Olufayo Olu-Olu, who presides over Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife; Federal University of Technology, Akure and Ekiti State University, Ado Ekiti, said the Federal government has been insincere and deceptive, by reneging on the MoA signed with ASUU on December 23, 2020.\n\nCalling for swift interventions of the students\u2019 body, parents, traditional rulers, and other stakeholders in education sector, he added that the strike would be long and total until all issues raised are addressed.\n\n\u201cIt is rather unfortunate that government has to stretch ASUU beyond its elastic limit on this. To accept negotiation on every issue and for the agreement to be reached, strike must be embarked upon.

          "title": "UK Removes Nigeria, 10 Other Countries from Travel Red List",
          "text": "Chinedu Eze\n\nThe British High Commission has announced that Nigeria and 10 other countries have been removed from UK\u2019s red list effective Wednesday December 15, as Omicron becomes the dominant strain around the world.\n\nThis was conveyed in a statement released by the High Commission, saying that pre-departure tests and PCR testing measures on or before day 2 after arrival remain in place, with a review of all travel measures in the New Year.\n\n\u201cFollowing review of the latest risk assessment from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Nigeria and the other 10 countries and territories on the red list will be removed from 4am Wednesday 15 December.\n\n\u201cPassengers arriving from Nigeria, Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, and Zimbabwe will not have to stay in a managed quarantine hotel on arrival in England from this date,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIt noted that as Omicron cases rise in the UK and in countries around the world, \u201cthe travel red list is less effective in slowing the incursion of the variant from abroad and these temporary measures are no longer proportionate. The red list has successfully served its purpose in delaying the spread of Omicron into the UK to buy time for scientists to learn more about this variant.\u201d\n\nThe High Commission also said that all vaccinated passengers arriving in the UK must continue to take a pre-departure test two days or less before they depart for the UK and must take a PCR test on or before day two and self-isolate until they receive a negative result, stating that these testing measures are vital in helping to prevent any additional cases of Omicron from entering the UK and stopping people from passing it on to others.\n\nIt also observed that this was a critical phase in tackling the Omicron and the government\u2019s focus remains on slowing the spread of the variant in the UK \u2013 through maintaining testing requirements at the border, through the introduction of Plan B measures, and by turbocharging the booster rollout.\n\nBritish High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing CB, said: \u201cOn Tuesday 14th December, UK Ministers made the decision \u2013 based on scientific and public health data \u2013 to remove Nigeria from the UK\u2019s travel red list. The emergence of the Omicron variant is a reminder that the COVID-19 pandemic is not over, and like all countries around the world the UK has had to take difficult decisions to protect public health.\n\n\u201cWe took this necessary precautionary action to give us time to understand the challenge we and others faced, and to slow down the spread of Omicron while scientists urgently assessed what impact the variant has on vaccines, treatments and transmissibility. When we announced the heightened restrictions we made clear that we would remove them as soon as we could, and that is the decision Ministers have taken today.\n\n\u201cI know this will be welcome news for students, tourists, businesses and families in the UK and Nigeria, although I recognise the impact that these temporary health measures have had.\u201d\n\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid also said: \u201cThe red list bought our scientists time to learn more about Omicron and to slow the seeding of the variant from abroad into the UK. Now that there are high levels of community transmission, it is right to remove the red list and focus on our national effort to tackle Omicron.\n\n\u201cWith cases doubling every two to three days we\u2019ve turbocharged our booster programme, we\u2019re asking arrivals to keep testing to limit the spread of new cases, and we are introducing Plan B measures to protect the country from the threat of this new variant.\u201d\n\nThe High Commission remarked that while all countries had now been removed from the red list, the managed quarantine hotel policy remains in place to act as a crucial line of defence against the importation of variants of concern.\n\n\u201cRestrictions will be re-imposed should there be a need to do so to protect public health,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cAirlines will continue to check all passengers for pre-departure tests alongside their completed passenger locator form, and passengers will not be allowed to board a flight without providing evidence of a negative test result.\n\nThe government will take further action if necessary to contain the virus and the new variant, as has been the case throughout the pandemic. The UKHSA continues to monitor the situation closely, in partnership with scientific and public health organisations across the world, and the government is working collaboratively with the World Health Organisation and countries around the world to better understand the new variant,\u201d the statement added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Still lobbying president not to sign bill into law\n\n\u2022INEC warns delay may affect off-season polls\n\n\u2022More CSOs urge Buhari\u2019s assent\n\nObinna Chima in Lagos, Chuks Okocha and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nAfter crippling the local government system across the country, a situation believed to have laid the foundation for the current widespread insecurity, some governors have continued to do all within their reach to prevent President Muhammadu Buhari from signing into law, the Electoral Amendment Bill, adjudged to be in the best interest of the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nThe main reason the governors have been putting pressure on President Buhari not to sign the bill into law, as the December 19 deadline for the president\u2019s assent draws near, is because it would whittle down their powers as \u2018godfathers\u2019 in their respective states as well as break their selfish control and financial manipulation of the local government system, THISDAY can reliably report.\n\nThis, nonetheless, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has warned that a prolonged delay in assenting to the new Electoral Bill might hinder preparations and smooth conduct of upcoming elections, including the governorship elections in Ekiti and Osun States, scheduled for June and July, 2022.\n\nINEC has further expressed concerns over the proposed area election for the Federal Capital Territory in February next year, which it claimed could be affected too if the issues around the bill were not resolved and signed quickly.\n\nINEC\u2019s worry, however, came at the same time that the Convener of the Civil Society Situation Room, Mrs. Ene Obi and the Executive Director of the Policy and Legislative Advocacy Centre (PLAC), Mr. Clement Nwankwo made a case for the president to urgently sign the Electoral Bill into law.\n\nSimilarly, the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) on Monday, said proposals in the Electoral Bill 2021 would improve Nigeria\u2019s elections and the political party\u2019s candidate selection process and therefore urged President Muhammadu Buhari to sign it.\n\nUnfortunately, since the two chambers of the National Assembly harmonised their positions on the mode of election to be adopted for primary election and forwarded same to President Buhari for his assent, some governors had been uncomfortable and had been visiting the president to convince him on why the idea was not ideal not, especially, given its cost implications.\n\nAlthough the INEC too had once posited that direct primary was a far more expensive mode of primary election, however, noted quickly that it was not any of its business but that of the political parties to address, adding also that if the parties had been funding indirect primaries, then, it is their business to find a way to fund indirect primaries.\n\nInterestingly, last week, there were speculations that the president, after a lot of pressure, had rejected the amended electoral act bill as forwarded to him by the lawmakers, forcing the presidency and the legislature to issue rebuttals on the reports, saying, \u201cWe are not aware\u201d.\n\nYet, the governors were said not to have relented from stalking the president on why he should not sign the bill, even when this was believed to be stalling the INEC from preparing for other off-season elections, starting from January, when Ekiti State governorship primary election has been slated to hold and February, when the FCT area poll was billed to hold.\n\nAccording to THISDAY findings, \u201cThe 36 governors want to ensure that they continue to collect local government allocations, which they mismanage. And as we all know most of them are always in Abuja every month, they wait, collect fund from the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) and they disappear.\n\n\u201cTheir over 20 years of disinvestment in the local government system is what has led to the rise in insecurity, banditry, kidnapping and increase in social vices across the country.\n\n\u201cNow, these governors are moving to scuttle the electoral process for their own selfish gains. They control their election, they control the local government election, now they want to control the National Assembly and that of the president as well and they are putting pressure on Buhari not to sign and if Buhari does not sign the bill into law, it would have dire consequences for electoral reform,\u201d the source, who wanted to remain anonymous, claimed.\n\nHowever, corroborating THISDAY\u2019s findings, National President, Nigeria Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), Ambali Olatunji, recently alleged that the illegality perpetrated by governors was responsible for the destruction of the local government system in the country.\n\nAmbali argued that the root of insecurity as well as socio-economic challenges bedeviling the country was traceable to the mismanagement of the local government system by state governors.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAs at today, you can no longer move from one state to another without initially asking if you will get home safely. Insecurity in the south, east, west and north. This is not the Nigeria of our dream. We are bedeviled by abject poverty, joblessness, hopelessness, threat to the nationhood.\n\n\u201cEverybody now resorts to ethnic agitation. We have come this far, because Nigeria is no longer working. The nation has failed the masses. At 61, Nigeria has abandoned her constitutional role in guaranteeing security and peace in the country.\n\n\u201cThis can be traced to the systematic decay and destruction at the local government level. Local government system is the most strategic, most relevant, most popular and most acceptable tier of government in the country.\u201d\n\nHe also called for direct funding of the local governments, saying allowing state governments to be in charge of local government fund was synonymous to giving same food to a lion and a dog and you ask them to go and share them.\n\nAlso, an expert in Electoral Law and Justice, Dr. Akin Oluwadayisi and member of the Center for Socio-Legal Studies (CSLS), at the weekend, urged Buhari to sign the bill into law before the deadline expires.\n\nAccording to him, Section 14(2) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) declares that sovereignty belongs to the people of Nigeria from whom government itself derives all its powers and authority, adding that it would be through direct participation in political parties\u2019 primaries which the proposed legislation promotes, that the participation by the people in their governments shall be ensured.\n\n\u201cIndirect primaries deny them this right of grassroot participation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe law expert noted that political parties over the years had failed to allow direct election of delegates, when primaries are conducted, and argued that if INEC was given the powers to supervise the process, it would not only ensure credibility but also build confidence of the people in the future general elections that would be conducted.\n\n\u201cThe governors in Nigeria have been tested with the required true democratic involvement of local governments but failed through selfish interest, dominating control and financial manipulation of the local government authority,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, allowing indirect primaries into the legislative bodies was to further empower the governors to play the role of gods in determining the future of Nigeria\u2019s democracy, good governance and sacrifice direct participation of the electorate\u2019 desires.\n\nOluwadayisi, therefore, stressed that the bill would benefit the political parties, especially, the ruling party more in that when the party members were given the freedom to choose active and responsive legislators, their performances and delivery would go a long way to promote the party\u2019s image and collective interest of the people, who have chosen them.\n\nOn the dangers of delaying the bill, INEC\u2019s National Commissioner in charge of Voter Education and Publicity, Mr. Festus Okoye, while speaking as one of the panelists at a Situation Room Stakeholders Forum in Abuja, said the Commission would find it difficult to adjust its plans if the Electoral Bill was suddenly signed midway to the series of off-season elections scheduled within the first half of 2022.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe as the electoral management body need to be prepared early enough. As a today, we have a number of elections that we are going to conduct. We have the the FCT Area council elections that we are going to conduct in February and then we have the Osun and Ekiti governorship elections that are going to take place in June and July.\n\n\u201cSo we need to have a hold-on-to new electoral legal framework so we can begin to prepare, do procurement and also begin to design our guidelines and regulations before we get close to the 2023 general election,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the implications of a new Electoral Act would be that INEC would have to draw new guidelines and regulations in readiness for the 2023 general election in the country.\n\nAccording to him, INEC would reach conclusions on how to carry out monitoring of party primaries and the cost implications after the political parties would have decided on nature of primaries and submitted same to the commission.\n\nHe added that one of the landmark issues as far as the amended Act was concerned, was the deepening of the democratic process through the introduction of technology in the electoral process, adding that with a new electoral legal framework coming into effect, political parties would adjust their guidelines and processes to align with the law.\n\n\u201cIf the new electoral legal framework comes to force, political parties are going to conduct their primaries early in 2022 and presupposes that they will also have a guideline for the conduct of party primaries,\u201d he said.\n\nIn her remarks, Obi said though it might not be possible to have a perfect law for the nation\u2019s elections, but the new electoral legal framework was definitely something that could move the country forward in the right direction.\n\nAlso, Nwankwo said Buhari would be doing colossal damage to whatever legacy he might leave behind if he failed to heed the yearnings of Nigerians and sign the Electoral Bill into law.\n\n\u201cWe know that the President has spoken to everyone that he needed to and consulted with everyone that he wants to consult with, so if he doesn\u2019t sign the Bill, it is his decision and not that of anyone else,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother panelist and gender rights campaigner, Mrs. Ebere Ifendu, said women were excited about the newly amended Electoral Act, because some of innovative ideas brought in to further the cause of women participation in governance in Nigeria.\n\nIfendu, however, flayed the recently concluded national convention of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which she alleged failed to uphold the party\u2019s constitution that provided 35 per cent affirmative action for women inclusion in party offices.\n\nThe CDD Director, Idayat Hassan, in a statement in Abuja, also called on President Buhari to sign into law the Electoral Bill 2021, saying this was necessary to represent the most significant legacy of his presidency.\n\n\u201cWith the successful integration of technology into the electoral process, a legal backing for electronic voting and transmission of election results will further President Buhari\u2019s commitment to improving Nigeria\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cThis will surely be President Buhari\u2019s legacy for Nigerian people. CDD believes that the next critical step that must be taken is for the assenting into law, the Electoral Bill 2021. This is particularly as we head to two off-cycle elections in Ekiti and Osun States in 2022 and the 2023 general election,\u201d she said.\n\nHassan, who noted that the Senate had, on October 13, re-amended certain aspects of the Electoral (Amendment) Bill contained in Clauses 43, 52, 63, and 87, respectively, said, \u201cInterestingly, the legislative document represents another beautiful outcome from the collaborative efforts of the Senate and House of Representatives,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to her, with the direct primary election, every registered member of the parties will directly determine their candidates, adding that the CDD believed this would reduce the floodgates of litigation that usually trailed the idea of consensus or imposition of candidates by political godfathers and party owners.\n\nMeanwhile, the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) by INEC, has entered its 10th week in the second quarter, recording 4,681,206 as fresh registration while Completed Online and Physical Registration stood at 2,228,993.\n\nINEC in a weekly update, announced that the new update was as at 7:00 am yesterday December 13, 2021.\n\nA breakdown of the type of registration that made up the completed online and physical registrations of 2,228,993 showed that 922,188 were Online, while 1,306,805 were Physical.\n\nThe update also revealed that Male (Completed Registration) was 1,124,294 while Female (Completed Registration) was 1,104,699.\n\nFor Persons Living With Disability (Completed Registration) was 21,910 and for the Youth (18- 34 years) it stood at 1,586,018.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "1da Banton\u2019s \u201cNo Wahala\u201d blew up on Tik Tok. Now he knows its power",
          "text": "A few months ago, Nigerian artiste, 1da Banton, logged into his TikTok account, which he rarely used, only to discover that one of his songs, \u201cNo wahala\u201d, from his Original Machine Vibe album, was being used in videos captioned in French. Because he doesn\u2019t understand French, he Google-translated the captions, then smiled at himself.\n\nThe Afro dancehall artiste\u2019s song was being used in a TikTok challenge that would take his music straight to the ears of millions of fans around the world. Since the challenge began, \u201cNo wahala\u201d has been used as a soundtrack in more than 190,000 videos and was at some point the second most Shazamed song in the world. The song is also charting in over 10 countries, including the UK, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Uganda, and Kenya.\n\nSpeaking on the inspiration for the song, on a video call with TechCabal, from his Lagos apartment, 1da Banton said he set out to create a stress-free vibe and connect with people who just wanted to live their lives without worrying.\n\n\u201cWhen I recorded \u2018No Wahala\u2019, that was how I was feeling, so I put it into music. When my producer, Blaise Beats, played the beat for me, the only thing that came to my head was to write a song that talks about a stress-free life, not a love or party song. I just wanted to make music people could relate to; that no matter the situation or circumstance, you just have to live your life. So, I\u2019m glad we achieved that.\u201d\n\nBorn and raised in Port-Harcourt, 1da Banton, dropped his debut single in 2015. Since his debut, he has released one EP and collaborated with Ghanaian Afro Dancehall superstar, Stonebwoy.\n\n\u201cNo wahala\u201d means no stress in Nigerian pidgin, a language widely spoken in Port Harcourt.\n\nThe song is featured in videos of afro-dances; reactions or replies to challenges or questions, sometimes from a loved one or crush. Some of the funniest videos under the challenge feature videos of Nigerian social media influencers, James Brown and Idris Okuneye (popularly known as Bobrisky), dancing, kicking a football, or in the gym.\n\n\u201cMy TikTok video on the \u2018No Wahala\u2019 challenge gave me my highest views and engagement on TikTok. I didn\u2019t expect it,\u201d said Yewande Daranijo, an aspiring actress whose first viral TikTok video has over 300,000 views through this challenge.\n\n\u201cI jumped on the challenge, and boom it went viral. I was really excited, and I\u2019m glad I joined the challenge,\u201d said Daranijo who joined the app about seven months ago. Before the challenge, Daranijo did not know about 1da Banton, but now she knows him and believes he will get his due now that a lot of people know his song.\n\n1da Banton recalled that at the time his song was blowing up in France, he wasn\u2019t a regular user of Tik Tok and was still finding his way around the app.\n\n\u201cSo, \u2018No Wahala\u2019 doing so well on TikTok wasn\u2019t me; it was people. I just gave them the song. From now on, it would be a great idea to follow up on TikTok because of the influence it has on music today.\u201d\n\n1da Banton explained that all of his social media\u2014YouTube and Instagram\u2014is growing: \u201cEveryone is trying to check out who sang this amazing song, so all my numbers are going up.\u201d\n\nAnd as Nigerian artiste CKay did a few weeks ago, 1da Banton created a video on TikTok where he tried to claim ownership of the \u201cNo Wahala\u201d sound. He might have been successful with that, but his dance skills in the video were questionable, an assessment he agrees to and laughs about.\n\n\u201cUp until now, a lot of people still don\u2019t know that I am the owner of the song. It\u2019s a gradual process. I just had to make that video as a part of the process. I\u2019m not really a good dancer, but I still had to dance to the song. I needed them to understand that I am the original owner of the song.\u201d\n\nThis year alone, TikTok has taken at least three African songs to the global stage, and it is making Africans feel represented. Somali singer Nimco Happy\u2019s song, \u201cIsii Nafta\u201d, became an internet sensation, with celebrities like Cardi B, Trevor Noah, and Bella Hadid using the song in content. More than 100,000 videos have been created using the song. The viral song which switches between Swahili, English, Arabic, and Somali has left many Somalis celebrating the fact that their culture is in the global spotlight.\n\nCKay\u2019s \u201cLove Nwantiti\u201d also took over TikTok for weeks, earlier this year, with more than three million videos created using the song. As of September of this year, it was the most Shazamed song in the world and charting in 160 countries.\n\nTikTok\u2019s impact on music in Africa is growing and proving to be a massive support for artistes who may now create and strengthen the reach of their music beyond the continent, without a bank-breaking marketing campaign.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Can Kenya get out of the supply chain crisis?",
          "text": "Q4 is coming to a close, the holiday season is upon us, and Kenya\u2019s businesses are settling their accounts for the year.\n\nIn many ways, transport and logistics, which support numerous sectors of the Kenyan economy, seem to be on an upswing. The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) reported a 4.4% growth in container traffic during the first eight months of the year, and Kenya\u2019s all-new port at Lamu launched in May.\n\nBut, alongside positive figures and groundbreaking infrastructure projects that point to an optimistic outlook for the logistics industry, Kenya\u2014just like the US, UK, and other countries throughout the world\u2014is also feeling the impact of a COVID-19-induced supply chain shortage.\n\nWill tech offer a solution to help the industry sustain itself?\n\nA global meltdown\n\nOn a global level, the supply chain meltdown began with a container shortage that cropped up at the end of 2020, with freight rates rising higher than 264%, compared to previous years. Prior to this, containers moved from China to Europe and North America, but COVID-19 restrictions limited air freight, creating an increased demand that prevented the flow of containers back to East Asia.\n\nFollowing that, demand for Chinese exports skyrocketed after a pandemic-induced slump. At this point, global supply chains were already out of balance, and demand for exports exceeded the supply of shipping containers.\n\nBy March 2021, shipping container rates from China to the US and Europe had increased by 300%, compared to the year before.\n\nTrade under lockdown\n\nIn Kenya, it began with a lockdown.\n\nThe start of the pandemic led to a gridlock in Kenya\u2019s transport industry that had an immediate impact on the country itself, and the region as a whole.\n\nIndustries with markets outside of the East African community were among the hardest hit. East Africa\u2019s flower industry, for example, which ships fresh flowers via air to European countries, suffered an estimated $1 billion in losses when European countries sealed their borders. Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second-largest flower exporter, also reported an 80% reduction in flower export volume.\n\nDue to restricted sea and air routes, imports to Kenya decreased by 23%, but the permission of select land transport that allowed goods to flow by land between borders meant that \u201cother countries in the East African community benefited,\u201d said Manaseh Otieno, Trade and Policy Manager at the Kenya Association of Manufacturers (KAM). For example, trade between Kenya, an exporter of palm oil, petroleum oil, and salt, and Uganda, an exporter of milk, tobacco, cane, and energy, increased by 11.3%.\n\nBut transport by land between the countries was still slow and prohibitively expensive.\n\nAs positive COVID cases began to increase in East Africa, Rwanda, Uganda, and Kenya agreed to test all truck drivers entering and exiting the three countries. However, unequal distribution of COVID-19 resources and inadequate supply chains to get them to East Africa meant a scarce number of test kits. This led to a buildup of drivers along the border, lost goods, an overall decrease of truck inflows into Uganda, and an increase in shipping cost at around 48%.\n\nWhile the flower industry is rebounding and trucks are moving more freely, the temporary dismemberment of the supply chain industry may continue to have knock-on effects on businesses in the East African economy.\n\nShortages\n\nThe US is already feeling inflationary pressures caused by supply chain issues that have resulted in a 6.2% increase in the US Consumer Price Index\u2014a measurement used to estimate price changes in a basket of goods\u2014compared to last year.\n\nKenya is experiencing a similar phenomenon.\n\nIn April, the cost of bread in Kenya increased by $.044 for the first time in four years and is set to increase yet again. The Cereal Millers Association (CMA) points to lower global wheat stocks, marine freight issues, and the rising cost of fuel to its highest levels in the past 10 years as the causes of the price increase.\n\nReliability is key\n\nKenya\u2019s potential supply chain crisis and its impact can be mitigated.\n\nA major aspect of the rise in prices caused by the current meltdowns is uncertainty, which can be costly in the logistics industry.\n\nThe market is currently highly uncertain, which can present difficulties for even the most well organised businesses.\n\n\u201cThe shipping lines are like a small mafia,\u201d said Dr. Simeon Obidairo, co-owner of BoConcept, a contemporary, Danish, luxury furniture line in the process of reopening in Nairobi.\u201cThey tell you transit times for the shipping is going to be six weeks; the shipment leaves, and they end up delivering it 12 weeks later. So, we\u2019ve seen at least double the typical transit times.\u201d\n\nA typical method of organising and tracking shipments to lessen supply chain disruptions is through the use of technology, which, when underutilised, creates major operational kinks that can be cumbersome to correct.\n\nLogi-tech\n\nA new Personal Information Protection Law out of China, for example, is preventing the provision of real-time shipping information by some China-based shipping companies, triggering fears of further shipping disruptions. As China is home to six out of 10 of the world\u2019s largest container ports, this has caused a 90% drop in terrestrial shipping data that companies use to track the arrival and departure of essential goods.\n\nEast Africa\u2019s logistics industry is still growing to a place where it is similarly tech-reliant. At present, most trade in the region happens informally. But more reliability is highly desired: \u201cWe need frameworks to support digital trade,\u201d said Manaseh Otieno. \u201cWhatever the client has ordered should be what they actually get. And if it isn\u2019t, there should be a mechanism to address these issues.\u201d\n\nDue to pandemic-induced demand shocks, transporters in the region also cut back. As consumption rises amid holiday festivities, and businesses increase capacity, those who fail to become more tech-reliant may find themselves \u201cill-positioned across the country primarily due to the low adoption of technology by the industry,\u201d said Tayo Oyegunle, COO of Moove, a logistics platform that offers on-demand solutions to both customers and businesses within East Africa.\n\nInvestor appetite for the transport and logistics sector was still high in 2021, with a total of $200 million raised by the industry as a whole in Africa during the first eight months of the year. But, much of this has been attributed to the January commencement of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), a 34-member-state-strong agreement that aims to introduce non-tariff barriers throughout the African continent.\n\nBut, the AfCFTA\u2019s success for Kenya and the region as a whole also necessitates more coordination on a technological level. Without it, it may be years before we see supply chain issues corrected and an environment for freer trade realised.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How African startups can build multi-million dollar deals",
          "text": "The year 2021 has set many new standards for Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem. As reporter Alexander Onwukwue states, \u201cIt\u2019s the year African startups normalised $100 million rounds.\u201d It\u2019s the year francophone Africa produced its first unicorn, Wave, which raised $200 million at a $1.7 billion valuation.\n\nIt\u2019s also the year of mergers and acquisitions, with over 333 M&A deals worth $51 billion done in the first half of the year alone, a 567% increase in deal value from 2020\u2019s $8 billion. Following Stripe\u2019s acquisition of Paystack in a $200 million deal in 2020, quite a number of notable acquisitions have occurred. From Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha, MaxAB\u2019s acquisition of Morocco\u2019s WaystoCap, and even Piggyvest\u2019s acquisition of Savi, companies in the ecosystem are consolidating to solve some of the continent\u2019s taxing issues.\n\nOne of the biggest acquisition deals of 2021 is MFS Africa\u2019s deal with Capricorn. In October, MFS Africa\u2014the largest fintech interoperability hub in Africa\u2014signed a deal to acquire Capricorn Digital, one of Nigeria\u2019s largest digital solutions and distribution companies. While the amount is undisclosed, both parties confirmed that the deal is Nigeria\u2019s \u201csecond-largest\u201d fintech acquisition deal, second only to Paystack\u2019s $200 million acquisition deal with Stripe.\n\nBut how do hundred-million-dollar deals get made? And why are more startups hitching their wagons together? On December 3, TechCabal brought Dare Okoudjou, MFS Africa CEO, and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Capricorn together in a live session to answer some of these questions.\n\nBig deals start out small\n\nFor Dare Okoudjou\u2014who has led MFS Africa\u2019s growth in 35 African countries\u2014big deals and acquisitions don\u2019t always start out as big deals. \u201cBig deals are done over time, and sometimes, they start off as minority investments talks which evolve into acquisition talks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first time Degbola and I spoke in 2014, Capricorn had just started and we\u2014MFS Africa\u2014we\u2019re trying to help him raise money. Fast forward to 2020, and we\u2019re speaking about acquisitions.\u201d\n\nDare Okoudjou, founder and CEO of MFS Africa, and Degbola Abudu, co-founder of Capricorn.\n\nOn Capricorn\u2019s end, Degbola Abudu and his team had been fundraising for a while, and while they weren\u2019t planning on getting acquired, the deal was a realistic next step for them. \u201cInitially, MFS Africa was supposed to be an investor. Conversations for this present deal started even before COVID, and by the end of 2020, when it became clearer, we were more open to it. There were many conversations between myself and Dare, and many more between myself and the Capricorn board.\u201d\n\nWhile Capricorn\u2019s motivation for taking the deal was geared towards sustainability, MFS Africa\u2019s was targeted at growth and expansion. \u201cMFS has agent networks in 35 SSA countries and the opportunity to merge that with what exists in Nigeria isn\u2019t easily replicated,\u201d Okoudjou said. \u201cWe\u2019d been eyeing Nigeria for a while, hoping that the mobile money network would kick-off, but it didn\u2019t. On the other hand, there was Capricorn which had built a strong agent network of 90,000 agents. When we realised that, it was evident what the next steps were.\u201d\n\nBuilding trust and partnerships\n\nRecognising strategic partnerships is something that can be said of MFS Africa\u2019s earlier acquisitions. Prior to Capricorn, MFS Africa had acquired two other companies. In 2020, the company acquired Beyonic, a Ugandan fintech delivering payment management solutions to SMEs. That deal also started off with several conversations on strategic partnerships between Beyonic\u2019s CEO, Luke Kyouhere.\n\nIn 2016, MFS Africa acquired Sochitel\u2014a company that specialised in international airtime transfers into Africa\u2014and the acquisition, according to MFS Africa, helped create the largest transfer payment network which focuses on Africa.\n\nThe company has also made six minority investments in companies across the continent including Maviance, Numida, Julaya, and Inclusivity solutions. One crucial thing that has helped these relationships\u2014investments and acquisitions\u2014is trust.\n\n\u201cIn considering acquisitions at MFS Africa, we start with our destination, our North star. We want to be in all 54 African countries, and we don\u2019t want borders to matter. You can be in Benin and make transactions with people in Zambia, or in Nigeria. Over time, we\u2019ve calculated what that means, infrastructure and regulation-wise for us. And when we want to invest or acquire a company, we ask ourselves how or if that investment or acquisition will bring us closer to these goals. That\u2019s usually the starting point,\u201d Okoudjou said. \u201cThe thing that usually makes or breaks these things is the people. Because, in the end, if you can\u2019t work with the people, it doesn\u2019t matter what the spreadsheets say.\u201d\n\nAbudu also agrees that trust is a necessary ingredient to any big deal. \u201cOther than being realistic, trust was one thing we had to show, and for that to happen, we had to be open on our end. We had to be clear what the acquisition meant for our people and it was important to be open about everything. That\u2019s what startups need to understand. Hiding things won\u2019t help you in the long run, and with trust, you can even work towards solving some of those crucial points together.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

While some startups focus on building digital consumer banks, others focus on building banks for businesses, or for both.\n\nOne startup building for both is Kenya-based Kwara, a one-stop-shop core digital banking infrastructure for Savings and Credit Co-operatives (SACCOs) to manage all their activities, and it has raised $4 million seed funding.\n\nThe new investment will be used to facilitate the launching of its neobank; further develop its existing app; double down on its marketing efforts; and increase its talent pool.\n\nThe investment was led by Breega, with participation from SoftBank Vision Fund, Emerge, FINCA Ventures, New General Market Partners, Globivest, Do Good Invest, Raba Capital, Launch Africa, Norrsken Impact Accelerator, Future Africa, Samurai Incubate, DOB Equity, and fintech angels.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile many people think that SACCOs are a slow, vulnerable, and outdated way of saving and accessing credit, and that the market needs new agile products that could displace this model, Kwara, founded by Cynthis Wandia (CEO) and David Hwan (CTO), wants to keep it going by enhancing its efficiency through digitising all its core functionalities.\n\nA true cooperative guardian angel\n\nWendia had just rounded up her first startup and joined Finparx, a venture builder in Germany, to work as a venture developer; there she spent most of her days staring eye-to-eye at different problems. But what struck her the most was the problem of coffee farmers not getting much value for their hard work. Wendia\u2019s grandmother was a coffee farmer in Kenya so this was nostalgic.\n\nShe became curious and started digging. Her interest started off from a trade finance angle, looking at the supply chain, to see if there was something that could be done. But the more she looked at the value chain, starting from the farmer\u2019s point of view to export, she kept coming across this institution called the credit union or the cooperative, which is effectively like a financial institution or bank, but owned by its clients.\n\n\u201cI noticed, for example, that for my grandmother, the cooperative had walked with her on her entire economic journey. The more I looked into it, the more we saw just how incredible this institution is in offering extremely affordable financial products like savings, loans and pension,\u201d Wendia told TechCabal.\n\nSo, after further research on SACCOs in Kenya and across the world, Wendia and her team realised that these cooperatives are a sort of informal bank, \u201cthe fairest bank\u201d, in Wendia\u2019s words. But they saw how far behind they were in leveraging technology that could take their efficiency from zero to 100. \u201cSo, we launched Kwara as a technology infrastructure for SACCOs,\u201d Wendia said.\n\nIn 2019, the Kwara core banking product was launched and, ever since, has become a safe haven for Kenyan cooperatives. But the ambition has expanded from just being a banking infrastructure to becoming an operating system for every growth-oriented SACCO in Kenya.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nAccording to Wendia, the platform now powers over 50 cooperatives, with over 65,000 backend users. The company is reportedly growing its credit union customer base by 40% month-on-month, and the listed credit unions are growing their membership by 19% and their loan base by 46%, annually. There are currently more than $142 million assets under management at a $40 million monthly transaction across savings, loan disbursement, pension and lots more.\n\nBecause Kenya is a big market for cooperatives, the company is going through a product expansion as opposed to market expansion. Though it\u2019s reported to be courting some credit union clients in South Africa and the Philippines, which, according to the CEO, validates their solution across multiple markets. The company wants to focus on eliminating the existing frictions in the Kenyan market, a move that will somewhat guarantee seamless replication across other markets.\n\nFor instance, in a bid to become an operating system for SACCO, it has partnered with Workpay, a human resource management and payroll processing solutions company, to enable SACCOs automate their human resource (HR) processes as a complimentary service to Kwara\u2019s products. Onboarded SACCOs will be able to carry out seamless payroll processing into SACCO accounts and enjoy access to an HR module for efficient management of their staff.\n\n\u201cWe have also partnered with Lami insurance API provider, which plugs us into about 20 underwriters in Kenya. Now, our customers [SACCOs] can negotiate or choose fantastic insurance products right from our platform,\u201d Wendia said.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Kwara?\n\nThere are over 300 million people currently banking within emerging markets, and that number is growing at 6% year-on-year. Kwara aims to increase that to at least 1 billion by the end of the decade, positioning itself as the platform for $500bn in transactions between credit unions and their members.\n\nDue to that, it\u2019s launching a new bank that will be powered by its existing credit unions. The play here is to turn over 65,000 backend users into early users of its neobank while onboarding more credit unions to ramp up more users.\n\nThe neobank will allow members of credit unions to deposit money directly to their credit union accounts, repay their loans, and apply for instant loans while tracking their finances and payments, all in a seamless manner. In addition, Kwara is building an open banking infrastructure via an open API that allows credit unions to integrate with payment gateways, banks, and third-party vendors, enabling a full marketplace. Also, any unbanked individual can easily join a credit union and then enjoy the whole banking benefits.\n\nSpeaking on launching a neobank and on the investment that will make it possible. Kwara CEO, Cynthia Wandia, says, \u201cWe are building a solution for people\u2014an estimated 1 billion\u2014who do not currently have access to personalised banking services. This is the result of a gap in banking-grade technology and the lack of neobank-like experiences for the end clients.\u201d\n\nShe said they [Kwara] have been thrilled to see the \u201cexcitement around the Kwara brand among credit unions and their members, which is fast becoming synonymous with a superior user experience and the future of banking. Thanks to our investors, we will now be able to offer an end-client experience that is 100 times better than what they previously had access to\u201d.\n\n\u201cOver the years, we\u2019ve seen an increasing interest in how to build wealth through community, as well as a shift in consumer preferences towards digital-first banking,\u201d said Ben Marrel, Founding partner at Breega, who led the investment. \u201cKwara\u2019s unique approach is a catalyst for a new way of retail banking through digital-first credit unions. We are both proud and excited to be helping this outstanding team scale across Africa and other emerging markets.\u201d\n\nKwara aims\u2014without branching away from its core mission of empowering credit unions across Africa and the rest of the world\u2014to help 1 billion people benefit from credit unions through its neobank by the end of the decade.\n\n\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nAuthor Mu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 I bully myself because I make me do what I put my mind to.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve gone through the pains of child labour or are currently a parent, the chances are that you might be familiar with oxytocin.\n\nOxytocin is a hormone used to induce labour or strengthen uterine contractions or control bleeding after childbirth. It is also used to stimulate uterine contractions in a woman with an incomplete or threatened miscarriage.\n\nIt is one of the most recommended and affordable drugs for preventing postpartum haemorrhage (PPH).\n\nPPH occurs when there is heavy bleeding at the end of childbirth and is one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in low and middle-income countries (LMICs).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, although oxytocin is very effective in the Nigerian situation, there are issues with quality, dosages, and storage processes.\n\nAccording to a 2016 survey by the US Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) in collaboration with the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), about 74.2% of oxytocin samples in the country failed lab-quality evaluations. Essentially, three out of four oxytocin doses were of sub-standard quality.\n\nOxytocin is a temperature-sensitive drug and is to be stored at 2-8 degrees Celcius to maintain proper efficacy for at least a month. While it can last for three days at room temperature, it loses its potency after that. From the survey, only 52% of the 705 respondents knew the proper storage procedures.\n\nApart from this, however, is the challenge of poor supply chain management.\n\nAnd Nigeria-based healthtech, DrugStoc, is looking to solve the nation\u2019s poor drug supply chain problem.\n\nA DrugStoc for health care providers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R DrugStoc co-founders: Chibuzo Opara (CEO) and Adham Yehia (President) Source: Supplied\n\nFounded in 2015 by Chibuzor Opara and Adham Yehia, DrugStoc is a \u201ccloud-based health pharmaceutical distribution platform.\n\n\u201cWe basically connect manufacturers of good quality pharmaceutical products to hospitals and pharmacies. We are solving a fundamental problem in the market which is fragmentation in the pharmaceutical supply chain,\u201d Opara told Techpoint Africa.\n\nAccording to him, this fragmentation has resulted in three key issues: access, substandard and counterfeit medication, and non-transparent pricing and financing of the supply chain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou see that a lot of healthcare providers really don\u2019t know what is in the market. If you ask a doctor in Nigeria, for instance, how many brands of paracetamol are on the market, they\u2019ll probably tell you something like three, four, five. To be honest, there are over fifty with varying quality and price points, and they meet different needs.\u201d\n\nThese knowledge gaps can be quite harmful, especially in seemingly more severe cases like cancer and diabetes, where the healthcare provider has to prescribe quality drugs to the patient.\n\nBy providing a cloud-based platform that prevents infiltration of counterfeit or substandard drugs, DrugStoc appears to solve all three problems.\n\nThe idea is to help healthcare providers focus on their primary goal: giving the best service to the patient.\n\nAlso, as Yehia told TechCrunch in an interview for DrugStoc\u2019s recent $4.4 million Series A raise, apart from the tech, setting up important infrastructure like the company\u2019s fulfilment centres in 2017 \u2014 warehouses for distribution of drugs \u2014 and customer support units have been essential.\n\nThe company\u2019s services can be accessed via its website or app on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.\n\nThe journey to DrugStoc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DrugStoc team\n\nBoth Opara and Yehia have a medical background, with the former bagging a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) from the Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto, Nigeria. He also has a PhD in Medicine & Surgery and an MPH in Economics, Policy and Management from the University of Maastricht, The Netherlands.\n\nYehia, on the other hand, graduated from McMaster University, Canada, with a bachelor\u2019s degree in Genetics. Coincidentally, both chose to do their masters in the same school, albeit at different times and met as Yehia was looking for an advisor for his Masters in Health Innovation Management.\n\n\u201cWe had realised that we sort of faced the same challenges. He comes from a healthcare background with a family that has been in healthcare for about 40 years. So we were discussing the same challenges over and over again and decided, \u2018Let\u2019s do something about it.\u2019\u201d Opara told Techpoint\n\nOpara had spent the years after receiving his MBBS specialising in surgery but soon found what he called \u201chuge gaps affecting the ancillary operations\u201d of healthcare provision. Doing a 180, he decided to further his training in economics, working with international organisations like the World Health Organization, the European Union, the International Finance Corporation, and the World Bank.\n\nUpon moving back to Nigeria, the two co-founded Integra Health in 2010, a health consultancy and IT Lab based out of Lagos, focused on integrating efficient management practices and processes into healthcare through technology.\n\n\u201cWe were lucky enough to manage about 20 facilities, but we ran into the same challenges again when it came to sourcing medication, and we decided to do something about it. We discovered that \u2014 and this is common with sub-Saharan countries with open drug markets \u2014 facilities would send folks to the open drug markets to source drugs, and when these drugs came, you couldn\u2019t vouch for their safety, quality, or storage.\u201d\n\nThis led them to start DrugStoc. At the time, they used Excel sheets, but it only solved the problem for the 20 facilities. To scale and make this beneficial to more people, it became what it is now, a cloud-based warehouse/marketplace for quality drugs.\n\nBut it went through some phases. First incorporated in 2015, the company ran a pilot for about 12 to 18 months before sticking with its current model and building its first experience centre in 2017. They had also spent a year at the Stanford Institute for Innovation in Developing Economies.\n\nCrunching the numbers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nMaking a quip about DrugStoc being funded by blood, sweat, and tears, Opara told us that the company had received seed funding from Vested World, A VC firm based in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nThe company also participated in the Co-creation Hub (CcHUB) Growth Capital Fund, receiving some funding. In 2019, DrugStoc received a $65,000 grant from the Jack Ma Foundation\u2019s inaugural $1 million Africa Netpreneur Prize Initiative. They went on to get another grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nMore recently, in November 2021, the company announced a $4.4 million Series A led by Africa HealthCare Master Fund (AAIC). German Development Bank (DEG) and returnee investors, Vested World, also invested in the round.\n\nAs contained in DrugStoc\u2019s official statement, Opara, speaking on the raise, said, \u201cWe are committed to making an impact in the healthcare industry. This funding will enable us to expand and launch our tech-enabled products in more African countries where pharmaceuticals are critically needed.\u201d\n\nApart from funding, the company also makes money from a commission which it charges customers for its services. Opara believes that donor funding cannot be relied upon, and sustainability must be built into the business to stand the test of time.\n\nThe end goal is to make sure nothing affects the company\u2019s supply chain and, in turn, its ability to provide quality services to customers.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nDrugStoc\u2019s mantra is \u201cHow do we do it different?\u201d And with a team strength of 22, the mid to long term goal is to expand into other sub-Saharan markets with similar problems within the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nAccording to Opara, the Nigerian industry is underperforming in several key areas.\n\n\u201cIf you take manufacturing, for instance, we are currently utilising somewhere above 50% of our capacity, which means that we can actually supply the entire West Africa when it comes to pharmaceuticals that originate from Nigeria.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday, look out for:\n\nWorld Toilet Day\n\nLatest Internet censorship stats for Africa\n\nFacebook and Nigeria\u2019s 7.5% VAT increment\n\nSanitation tech is a THING!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn November 19, 2021, the annual World Toilet Day was celebrated. This year, the campaign\u2019s starting point was \u201cWho cares about toilets? 3.6 billion people do. Because they don\u2019t have one that works properly.\u201d\n\nHow much do you know about the history of toilets? It hasn\u2019t always been the traditional white porcelain water closet toilet, you know.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there\u2019s also the global menace of open defecation. In Africa, as of 2019, Nigeria was the second-worst country globally and the first on the continent where open defecation was prevalent. And as a survey by the National Bureau of Statistics revealed, 47 million Nigerians openly defecated during the year under review.\n\nApart from the structural elements \u2014 and aesthetics \u2014 what good is toilet waste? Here\u2019s where sanitation tech comes to play.\n\nFun fact: Africans are playing in the sanitation tech space.\n\nSo, how much do you care about toilets? I believe your interest will be piqued after reading this piece by Ogheneruemu.\n\nYour thoughts? 3.6 billion people don\u2019t have toilets worldwide; who\u2019s changing that in Africa?\n\nAfrica and Internet censorship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent happenings show that Africa could overtake Asia as the most Internet censored continent in the world.\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for it. A new report from global cybersecurity company, Surfshark suggests that Africa is the most censorship-intensive region globally, responsible for about 10 of the 19 countries that shut down or censored social media in 2021.\n\nSimilarly, a few months ago, in September, Comparitech also released a comprehensive report after surveying the countries that impose Internet censorship under a broad category of Internet restrictions like torrenting, pornography, social media, VPN, and Internet messaging. The report also analysed the extent of censorship on a continental basis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Asia, for instance, of the 49 countries surveyed, 32 restricted or outrightly banned social media. Meanwhile, in Africa, 25 out of 43 countries covered have restricted social media in some way in 2021. Globally, there are fewer cases of restrictions recorded compared to 2020, according to Surfshark. However, some new countries have joined the list in 2021, a la Nigeria.\n\nPolitical reasons are mostly behind these restrictions; protests and examinations also contributed. Also, financial implications arise from hours lost.\n\nBased on another cybersecurity company, Top10VPN\u2019s record, a whopping $237.4 million was lost in 2020 in sub-Saharan Africa due to numerous Internet censorship cases.\n\nFor context: Sub-Saharan Africa lost $237.4 million to Internet censorship in 2020\n\nUnfortunately, given how vital the Internet is for disseminating information in this age, these restrictions are taking a toll on press freedom and access to information which ordinarily should be recognised as a fundamental human right.\n\nWe expressed this pain point and more in an in-depth piece: Despite enacted laws, access to basic information remains a luxury in Africa. You should totally read this if you haven\u2019t.\n\nThe question remains, as more supposedly \u2018free\u2019 countries join the bandwagon of infringement on this fundamental human right for questionable reasons, how does the future look for citizens of other countries?\n\nAlso, where do we draw the line? Social media shutdown in Uganda: The thin line between moderation and outright censorship\n\nI\u2019d like to know your thoughts (in the comments section).\n\nFacebook to remit 7.5% VAT to Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Nigeria, global tech giants are finally complying with the increase in value-added tax (VAT) from 5% to 7.5% on all VATable items for online transactions. Recall, this increase followed the signing of the Finance bill into law in January 2020.\n\nCan\u2019t recall? Nigeria\u2019s Finance Act and an impending tax turf war between federal and state governments\n\nAlthough it seemed like everyone had moved on after the initial reactions, Facebook (the social media network) is reminding Nigerian advertisers on the platform of this reality after sending out an email that it would begin the 7.5% VAT deduction from January 1, 2022.\n\nIn the email, it says, \u201cAll advertisers with a business country of Nigeria will be charged an additional 7.5% VAT on advertising services purchased beginning 1 January 2022.\u201d\n\nIn July 2021, video conferencing platform, Skype sent a similar notification to subscribers.\n\nAs covered in the Finance bill, any \u201cforeign entity with respect to certain services or digital transactions tax foreign digital service providers offering services to Nigerians and earning revenue in naira\u201d must pay this tax. So, two possible situations: other platforms you\u2019ve subscribed to or use as a means to market have effected the VAT increase, or are planning to.\n\nFun fact: VAT accounts for about 30% of Nigeria\u2019s total tax collected. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, in 2020, VAT made up \u20a61.53 trillion ($3.7 billion) of the total \u20a64.95 trillion collected in tax.\n\nApparently, taxing the digital economy is no longer a big deal in Africa; not less than five countries already have something similar in place. But\u2026 digital taxes are hurting connectivity rates across Africa\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nBored Ape Yacht Club: Someone accidentally sold a $300k NFT for $3K.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile preparing to write this article, I took my editors\u2019 advice and watched the Nextflix Limited Series, Inside Bill\u2019s Brain. Although I never got past the first episode, it was enough to set me on the right path in my writing.\n\nIn 2011, Bill Gates, the world\u2019s second-richest man at that time, had just read the World Development Report \u2014 quite a hefty tome \u2014 and found some pretty disturbing information. Three million times a year, parents buried their children who had died of diarrhoea.\n\nBecause of a lack of access to toilets, clean water, and, most times, faulty drainage systems, human waste often ended up in the waterways where they obtained drinking water.\n\nThat same year, Gates decided to fund a $200 million research project to reinvent the toilet as we know it. Eventually, he and his team succeeded, designing a waterless toilet with a waste treatment system that could create clean water from poo, but not before shocking the whole world with a jar of human faeces.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the way to this, Gates had found some interesting inventions: solar-powered toilets, a screw toilet, and even a squat toilet.\n\nAlthough my decision to write an article about sanitation-tech startups in Africa had already been fully formed, this was the perfect head of steam to kickstart my engine.\n\nBut to understand where I was going, I needed a brief tour into the history of the toilet\n\nAn abridged history\n\nThe word \u2018toilet\u2019 hasn\u2019t always been in the English vocabulary as we know it. It was coined from the French word, toilette, which means \u2018a small piece of cloth\u2019. So, at that time, the word toilet evolved from \u2018a piece of cloth used for shaving\u2019 to one \u2018covering a table.\u2019 This was in the 15th century.\n\nIn the late 18th century, it became known as the room where grooming and washing took place. But it was not until the 19th century that it was first used to refer to the fixture, \u2018toilet\u2019.\n\nAccording to the Merriam Webster Dictionary, a toilet is \u201ca fixture that consists usually of a water-flushed bowl and seat and is used for defecation and urination.\u201d\n\nFollowing this definition, a hole in the ground is most definitely not a toilet; even a pit latrine is not a toilet. However, the first real invention for man to do the \u2018number two\u2019 was a hole in the ground.\n\nFrom there, we had a sea of highs and lows, with early civilisations in the Indus Valley, Egypt, Scotland, and Mesopotamia having some form of \u2018plumbing\u2019 which enabled them to carry out waste from their dwelling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkai Brae, a Neolithic village in Orkney, Scotland with home furnishings including water-flushing toilets 3180 BC\u20132500 BC. By Wknight94 \u2013 Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0.\n\nHowever, from these \u2018inventions\u2019, the world regressed to garderobes or commodes, which were essentially closets hanging over a wall and from there to disgusting but often beautifully designed little containers called chamber pots.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until 1596 that the first flushing toilet \u2014 the \u2018Jakes\u2019 \u2014 was invented by Sir John Harington. It used 7.5 gallons of water from an upstairs cistern to flush waste.\n\nFrom there, not much changed until the invention of the ballcock by Thomas Crapper in the late 19th century. It\u2019s that round ball in a water tank that keeps it from overfilling.\n\nFast forward to the present day, and we now have inventions like waterless toilets, toilets with FM Radio and LED lights, and toilets made entirely out of gold. They are so commonplace that most people have access to them, or so we\u2019d like to think.\n\nVisiting the numbers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are presently 3.6 billion people without toilets. This number has increased from 2.3 billion in 2018 when one in three people did not have access to toilets.\n\n892 million of the 2018 number openly defecated\n\nIn Africa, as of 2019, Nigeria was the second-worst country globally and the first on the continent where open defecation was prevalent.\n\nIn 2019, the Water, Sanitation, Hygiene National Outcome Routine Mapping (WASH NORM) was commissioned by the Federal Ministry of Water Resources (FMWR) and carried out by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), with technical and financial support from UNICEF, African Development Bank (AfDB), and the World Bank.\n\nThe survey revealed that 47 million Nigerians openly defecated.\n\nA lack of access to toilets is invariably linked to problems with clean potable water and, of course, diarrhoea.\n\nInterestingly, according to a study on the Variation in childhood diarrheal morbidity and mortality in Africa, 2000\u20132015, by Bobby Reiner, Simon Iain Hay, and others, diarrheal diseases were the third leading cause of death among children below the age of five in Africa.\n\nThe numbers spread unequally among the countries. The countries with the highest number of deaths were Benin, Lesotho, Mali, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. With a projected market cap of $13 billion by 2025, it does seem like there\u2019s more to this space than meets the eye.\n\nSo, who are the players in Africa\u2019s sanitation ecosystem, and what tech are they employing to help? I found quite a number but focused on just three.\n\nInnocrave\u2019s Ladies&Gents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLadies entrance to Innocrave Ladies&Gents. Source: Supplied\n\nFounded in 2014 by Saheed and Lola Awojide, Innocrave Solutions is a service solutions consulting firm in Lagos State, Nigeria, with solutions like its Turbowarshit steam technology and the Ladies&Gents tech-enabled toilet.\n\nFor the pair, the issue of open defecation and sanitation is something of a personal problem, having had harrowing experiences in the university.\n\nAs Saheed tells me, \u201cUnfortunately, two of us went to two different schools, but we had the same challenges of sanitation. Sanitation was a big problem for the two of us. You have a WC that\u2019s meant to be used by four people, and you\u2019d see fifty students using one.\u201d\n\nHaving moved to Canada in 2009, the couple decided this was an excellent opportunity to give back to the community \u2014 trying to solve the open defecation problem and create job opportunities in one fell swoop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutoflush bidet. Source: Supplied\n\nWith a beautifully designed interior, the Ladies&Gents is a tech-enabled facility with touchless toilets, soap dispensers, and water faucets. It is air-conditioned and uses steam technology for cleaning. The company employs an Android Access Management system that enables users to access the toilet using biometric technology.\n\nCurrently, the company operates two models, a subscription-based model and an advertising model. Users can pay from \u20a63,500 ($8) to \u20a68,000 ($19) for a limited number of entries a month. And companies can advertise on digital out-of-home billboards placed just outside the toilet facility.\n\nAccording to Saheed, since launching its prototype in the University of Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria, this year, the company has had over 100 users and is looking for its first advertising client.\n\nThe idea, really, is to prevent what both believe would be a disease outbreak of epic proportions.\n\n\u201cOur main goal is to prevent an outbreak of diseases due to open defecation because students end up openly defecating; it\u2019s not a secret. Everybody knows they do it on campus. So we foresee that an outbreak might happen if we don\u2019t solve this problem.\u201d\n\nBut what happens when the toilet fills up? This is the question Emily Woods and the Sanivation team are trying to answer in Kenya.\n\nSanivation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Foote (CEO) and Emily Woods (CTO). Sanivation\u2019s Co-founders. Source: FINCA International / Alison Wright\n\nIn Kenya, Emily Woods, Andrew Foote, and the 60-person Sanivation team are making briquettes \u2014 round blocks \u2014 from human faeces.\n\nFounded in 2011, Sanivation is a sanitation startup that claims to have served over 25,000 people in its almost 11-year existence.\n\nI spoke to Kate Bohnert, Sanivation\u2019s Investor & External Relations Manager to get a feel of the company\u2019s vision and processes. The company partners with governments and water utilities, which supply this waste via exhauster trucks.\n\n\u201cWe see waste at no cost from exhauster trucks or honey suckers and they deposit the waste at our site. It\u2019s quite liquidy so we want to separate liquids from the solids. So, we\u2019ll just do a liquid-solid separation process, where we then harness the solid waste and heat treat it to inactivate pathogens.\n\n\u201cThen we mix that with agricultural biomass like sawdust or rose waste and use a briquette press to actually produce the logs that replace firewood for customers.\u201d\n\nEmily\u2019s work at an NGO that focused on building toilets led her to ask questions about what is done with waste after toilets fill up. Initially, the focus was on how to make waste treatment cheaper, but eventually, they decided that a waste-to-value product would be a much more viable business model.\n\n\u201cSo they first were looking at ways in which they could lower the cost of waste treatment. They were looking at solar treatments as an option, and what they came to realise based on previous research that had been done is that there\u2019s a lot of value in waste.\n\n\u201cSo they realised that while you could also create lower waste treatment technologies, you could also find ways to generate revenue by creating a waste-to-value product. So it was building on the learnings of previous researchers to really come up with this idea.\u201d Bohnert says.\n\nHowever, Bohnert adds that this is flexible and can be done based on community needs or a model that would be much more valuable. If, for example, making toilets would serve \u2014 as the company at one time did \u2014 then they could do that.\n\nSanivation is currently looking to raise its Series A and welcomes investors interested in what it is doing.\n\nA Future Water Institute research project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBio brick made from urine. Source: Supplied\n\nThe Future Water Institute is based at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, and conducts research on water sensitive projects. I spoke with Professor Dyllon Randall, who supervises a host of researchers at the Institute.\n\nIn 2017, during the peak of the drought \u2014 a situation he regards as a blessing in disguise \u2014 in Cape Town, Randall and his team created a fertiliser-producing urinal that does not require any water to operate.\n\nThe urine is collected and used to make solid fertilisers. The urinals are periodically removed, and the remaining urine is used to make bio-bricks which can be used as building materials.\n\nAlthough we dwelled more on how bio-bricks are made, I was curious about how liquid fertiliser is made from the urine and found this video by a researcher at the Institute.\n\nEthanol is added to the urine to create urea \u2014 a key compound used in making fertilisers \u2014 that is about 91% pure. This can be used to create several things, including a niche urea fertiliser, calcium phosphate \u2014 another fertiliser \u2014 and even diesel engine fluid, which can be used to reduce air pollution caused by vehicles.\n\nThe process is quite different for making bio-bricks, as Randall explained to me.\n\n\u201cThe way the bio-bricks process works is a special bacteria breaks down the urea, and they form two components: ammonium ions or carbonate ions. And so the carbonate ions combine with calcium ions which are also present in the urine, and they form calcium carbonate.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s that calcium carbonate that essentially glues any loose material together. It\u2019s kind of like a cement, and so if you do this in a mould in the form of a brick, you essentially get a solid brick forming. You could get any solid you want.\u201d\n\nWhile we talked, he brought up an interesting fact about urine possibly being used to make explosives or hydrogen \u2014 a key ingredient in making jet fuel \u2014 or even chemicals like phosphoric acid.\n\nOf course, this depends on how the urine collection process can be implemented and the profit which could be made.\n\nRandall told me the bio-bricks project is currently being funded by a mining company but had its funding cut for other fertiliser-producing projects due in part to Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nA global problem\n\nWith 3.6 billion people without access to toilets worldwide, sanitation is not just an African problem.\n\nOn November 19, 2021, the annual World Toilet Day was celebrated. This year, the starting point of the campaign was \u201cWho cares about toilets? 3.6 billion people do. Because they don\u2019t have one that works properly.\u201d\n\nWe all should care more about toilets, especially persons who don\u2019t have any. And if you are moved to launch a sanitation startup, even better.\n\nYou can also check out organisations like the Toilet Board Coalition and the Container-based Sanitation Alliance.\n\nAuthor Ogheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "title": "Obaseki tasks on production, urges efforts to reduce wastes on importation \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBENIN CITY \u2013 The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has called for concerted efforts among stakeholders to address critical issues in the manufacturing sector, ensuring that the country is able to produce what it consumes so as to reduce excess wastes on importation.\n\nObaseki gave the charge while declaring open a workshop organised by Manufacturing Africa and Edo State Investment Promotion Office, at the Government House in Benin City.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe situation that we are in Nigeria today is so critical; critical not only because we are a poor country, but because the bulk of what we consume is imported. There is no manufacturing.\n\n\u201cThat was okay when we had money to import, but today we don\u2019t. The price of imported items will keep going up and many more Nigerians will not be able to afford these.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe solution is that we now have to begin to manufacture the things that we consume because if we don\u2019t, we will be in trouble in the next few years,\u201d he warned.\n\nReiterating the need to strengthen the manufacturing sector, Obaseki noted: \u201cWhy are we not manufacturing today? It is because the government and civil servants are not leading in that drive to encourage investors. When investors come to set up a business, it appears like you are doing the investors a favour, and most times, they don\u2019t even know where to go, they go from one ministry to another.\n\n\u201cThe ministry will just make things difficult for the investor. The process of doing business or manufacturing is difficult already, and because of our import mentality, we caused obstacles on the way.

From when I became a governor, I made it clear that one of our priorities is to empower young people, focusing on job creation. But who is going to provide the jobs? Is it the government? That\u2019s not possible, as the majority of the jobs in society are created by private businesses.\n\n\u201cWe hope that this exercise will take us a step forward. We will make our commitment as a government that whatever is going to encourage and make the investment process easy, that is what we are going to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will create the environment and make the land available; we will make infrastructure available and ensure government agencies put the investment processes in place. We challenge you to bring investors to us and see how the process will work,\u201d he noted.\n\nEarlier, the Country Coordinator, Nigeria Manufacturing Africa, Yasmin Osaghae, said the organization is keen on how best to drive investment in Edo.\n\nOsaghae emphasized that it was necessary to assist the state in removing bottlenecks that impede investments in order for investors to seamlessly set up in the state.\n\n...",

          "text": "The federal government has said marriages conducted at Ikoyi marriage registry and other federal courts are legal, debunking reports to the effect that the Federal High Court sitting in Lagos has declared all marriages conducted by the Ikoyi marriage registry illegal and invalid.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday evening, the Permanent Secretary and Principal Registrar of Marriages, Ministry Of Interior, Dr. Shuaib Belgore, described the reports as \u201cfalse, misleading and a deliberate distortion of the decision of the Court in Suit No: FHC/L/CS/816/18 between Eti-Osa Local Government Council & 3 others\u201d.\n\nThe statement argued that the court only ruled that the Federal Government, through the Ministry of Interior, is constitutionally empowered to conduct marriages in Nigeria and the Local Governments were only delegated by the Federal Government to conduct marriages, by virtue of Legal Notices issued pursuant to the Marriage Act.\n\nIt also stated that contrary to their (local government\u2019s) pleading, the trial judge held that nothing in the role of local governments, as defined in the Constitution, suggests that they can conduct or contract marriages. However, the only power is derived from the Legal Notices issued by the President.\n\n\u201cThe attention of the Ministry of Interior has been drawn to news making the rounds on social media claiming that the Federal High Court sitting in Lagos has declared all Marriages conducted by Ikoyi marriage registry to be illegal and invalid,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cWe would like to state that this statement is false, misleading and a deliberate distortion of the decision of the Court in Suit No: FHC/L/CS/816/18 between Eti-Osa Local Government Council & 3 others where the Honourable Court held that only the Local Government councils can conduct valid marriages in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy that, the same Federal High Court situated in Ikoyi, Lagos in Suit No. FHC/L/870/2002 between Prince Haastrup and Eti Osa Local Government held that the Federal Government, through the Ministry of Interior is constitutionally empowered to conduct marriages in Nigeria and held that the Local Governments were delegated by the Federal Government to conduct marriages, by virtue of Legal Notices issued pursuant to the Marriage Act.\n\n\u201cIn that case, the learned trial judge held that nothing in the role of local governments, as defined in the Constitution, suggests that local governments can conduct or contract marriages as alleged in their pleadings. The Court affirmed that powers of the local governments to contract statutory marriages is derived from the Legal Notices issued by the President.\n\n\u201cThe Court also confirmed that the role of local governments, as enshrined in the Constitution is limited to registration of all forms of marriages (including Islamic and customary marriages).\n\n\u201cRather than appeal this decision, the same claimants instituted another action in 2016 Suit no. FHC/L/CS/1760/16 Egor Local Government, EtiOsa Local Government and 2 others V Hon, Minister of Interior and 2 Others.\n\n\u201cThe Court held that the Suit was an abuse of court process, as it could not be invited to make another pronouncement on the same point, which would lead to conflicting decisions coming from the same court and struck out the case.\n\n\u201cThe same issue was adjudicated in the case of Olumide Babalola vs Ikeja Local Government and the Registered Trustees of the Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON) in Suit No. LD/1343/GCM/2016 delivered on 15th May, 2017.\n\n\u201cThe Court held that while registration of marriages are regulated by local governments, being under the concurrent list, formation of marriage is under the Exclusive Legislative List, within the jurisdiction of the Federal Government, regulated by the Ministry of Interior.\n\n\u201cIt is further worthy of note that the issue of formation, annulment and other matrimonial causes are by virtue of item 61 of the 1st Schedule of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria exclusively reserved for the Federal Government. The General Public is invited to note that these judgments are all still subsisting, competent and have not been appealed against till date.\n\n\u201cFurther to the above, the current decision of the Federal High Court delivered by Hon. Justice D. E. Osiagor of Court 6, cannot set aside a previous decision of the same Court, which is of coordinate jurisdiction, as that would amount to the court sitting on appeal over its own judgment.. In the circumstances, the Federal Government through the Ministry of Interior, has applied for a certified true copy of the judgement and will take appropriate further action including but not limited to filing of an appeal in respect of this conflicting and confusing decision, in line with the provisions of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cWe would like to appeal to the general public, the international community, to couples who had hitherto had their marriages solemnized at Federal Marriage Registries by duly licensed places of worship and to all intending couples to be calm and continue transacting their normal businesses at all Federal Marriage Registries subsisting throughout the federation in line with statutory and constitutional provisions.\n\n\u201cThe general public is to please note the foregoing and maintain status quo ante.\u201d",

Whilst many businesses are either closed or waiting for the economy to open up, others have weathered through the storm created by the pandemic, leveraging on their continuity plans built on sustainable business models. The theme of this year\u2019s forum is aptly couched to reflect the realities of our today\u2019s world. With the increasing levels of shareholders\u2019 activism and greater levels of scrutiny on financial performance, the qualitative aspect of information disclosure is becoming more imperative for businesses as much as the quantitative form of information.\u201d\n\nIt would be recalled that NGX released its Sustainability Disclosure Guidelines in December 2018. The Guidelines provide the value proposition for sustainability as well as a step-by-step approach on integrating sustainability in organisations, and detail indicators that should be considered when providing annual disclosure to NGX. The Securities and Exchange Commission also recently introduced its Guidelines for Sustainable Financial Principles for the Nigerian Capital Market in April 2021. These and other efforts by the government, market regulators and policy makers in the sustainability space point to the increasing importance of sustainability reporting in the context of enhanced corporate disclosures.\n\nThe event also featured a Keynote Address from Professor Kenneth Amaeshi, Visiting Professor of Leadership & Financial Markets in Africa & London, School of Economics & Political Science. There was also be a panel session featuring Dr. Innocent Okwusa, Visiting Associate Professor, Caleb University & 1st DVP, ICAN; Professor Carol Adams, Professor of Accounting, Durham University Business School; Ms. Eunice Sampson, Director, Climate Change and Sustainability West Africa, Ernst & Young; Mr. Elan Theebom, ESG Specialist, Arise; with Mr. Olumide Lala, Co-Founder and Director, Climate Transition Limited serving as panel moderator.\n\nEngagement such as this are particularly important because the capital market is information driven. NGX RegCo, therefore, continues to encourage Issuers to show transparency in their business activities through timely disclosure of price sensitive information to the market to prevent information asymmetry. Furthermore, the Regulation company has expressed its committment to working with Issuers to guide them through complying with Nigerian Exchange Limited\u2019s (NGX) post listing obligations as well as other regulatory requirements for public listed companies, particularly with regards to upholding good governance practices that thrive on accountability and enhanced information disclosure.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer (MD/CEO), Sterling Bank Plc, Mr. Abubakar Suleiman, has said the bank is deeply committed to deploying resources in support of Nigeria\u2019s healthcare system.\n\nSpeaking at the National COVID-19 Summit in Abuja recently, Suleiman disclosed that Sterling Bank provided technical support for the Presidential Steering Committee and other stakeholders in the planning of the summit.\n\nHe also acknowledged the outstanding work of the genome sequencing team of South Africa who helped to identify and mapped out the Omicron variant of COVID, remarking that the qualities of their resilience, perseverance and innovation have birthed work that has given the world a chance to get ahead of the new dimension of the on-going pandemic.\n\nThe CEO also highlighted the key numbers on Nigeria\u2019s healthcare, which is projected to contribute three percent to the nation\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 2021 with three quarters of those contributions coming from the private sector.\n\nOn the role of private sector financing in health emergencies, Suleiman said there was a need to expand the private sector\u2019s role from a funding channel to full partner that assesses the current national and sub-national frameworks for healthcare delivery.\n\nHe also advocated for a push in Public Private Partnerships (PPP) to achieve framework redesign and improve delivery, efficiency and cost of medical assistance as well as the need to introduce the constructs of public good and positive externality as reasons for continued private sector financing in healthcare, adding that the secondary role for the private sector includes monitoring and evaluation functions for the sole objective of continuously improving on the progress made in the past two years.\n\nHe said the bank had been working with Lagos, Cross River, Bayelsa, Kaduna and Ekiti state governments on building more robust and resilient structures to manage emergencies better, remarking that in Cross River, the bank and a consortium of partners have been heavily involved in the design and implementation of a health insurance scheme, along with other policies, to digitize and improve access to records and ensure availability and delivery of pharmaceutical to create a de-risked health care value chain.\n\nThe bank is also working with the Lagos State Government on its newly launched Lagos State Mass Vaccination program that expands vaccination points beyond publicly run primary healthcare centers to include privately owned facilities.\n\nThe Sterling Bank CEO commended the public and private sectors for the role they played in the nation\u2019s response to this current emergency, adding that this response is proving a moderate success, given the circumstances and as evidenced by the optimistic economic growth. He said there was need to consolidate these successes by encoding them as part of the national healthcare architecture going forward and calling on continuous participation from the private sector.\n\nAlso speaking, Sterling Bank\u2019s Divisional Head for Health Finance, Mr. Obinna Ukachukwu, said the health sector can always count on the support of the bank, adding that the bank\u2019s intervention in the economy covers other sectors, including education, agriculture, renewable energy and transport.\n\nUkachukwu said, \u201cWe don\u2019t just sit out there as a financial institution to make money without impact. We are impact-led, believing that as we contribute our quota to developing the country, we would build an economy that is sustainable for everyone. And I will like to reaffirm our commitment, especially to the health sector.\u201d\n\nFurther highlighting the role of the bank in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, Ukachukwu said, in an interview, that the bank paid for 100, 000 people to have access to healthcare through tele-medicine and set up a Health Workers\u2019 Fund to assist frontline health workers in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He said the bank also helped to build testing platforms for COVID-19 during the initial phase of the pandemic.\n\nHe asserted, \u201cNow, we are going into a phase where we need to plan for the future beyond COVID-19. How do we reach the finishing line of the COVID-19 pandemic? And are there going to be other pandemics?\n\nUkachukwu added: \u201cAnd it is not just for COVID-19 at the national stage but right down to state levels. We tell anyone that if you are doing anything in healthcare where you need support, not just financials, you should be speaking to Sterling Bank because we are here not to make money but to make impact. We believe that when impact is made, sustainable wealth is created for everyone.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU! You need to login to view and post FB Comments!",

(\u201cExxon\u201d) .\n\nThey also separately signed an SPA with PETRONAS (E&P) Overseas Ventures SDN. BHD. (\u201cPETRONAS (E&P) Overseas Ventures\u201d) relating to the purchase of each of their entire upstream and midstream assetportfolios in Chad and Cameroon (respectively, the \u201cExxon Acquisition\u201d and the \u201cPETRONAS Acquisition\u201d).\n\nThe SPAs both have an economic effective date of 1 January 2021. This follows Savannah\u2019s initial announcement on 2 June 2021 regarding the proposed transaction with Exxon, and Savannah\u2019s earlier announcements today regarding the Exxon Acquisition and the PETRONAS Acquisition.\n\nCompletion of both the Exxon Acquisition and the PETRONAS Acquisition would result in the Company acquiring a 75 per cent controlling interest in the Doba Oil Project and an effective c. 70 per cent indirect controlling interest in the Chad-Cameroon export transportation system.\n\nThe remaining 25 per cent interest in the Doba Oil Project is held by the national oilcompany of Chad,\n\nSHT Petroleum Chad Company Limited (\u201cSHT\u201d).

These assets have generated billions of dollars of critical taxrevenues for their host countries and free cashflow to their owners since the onset of first oil production in 2003. Further, under our stewardship, we expect these assets in aggregate to generate positive freecashflow and fiscal revenues for Chad andCameroon for a further 25 plus years.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor Savannah, these deals are expected to see ourproduction levels and reserve base more than double. Further, we see strong potential to significantly increase upstream production and midstream throughput volumes from current levelsthrough incremental investments and look forward to providing more information around our forward plans for the assets, and their potential, uponpublication of our AIM Admission Document and theCompany\u2019s restoration to trading on AIM on or around December 17.\n\nI would also like to this opportunity to welcome the incoming employees to Savannah and acknowledge with gratitude the support we have received from our stakeholders in government.

          "text": "*Urge the Minister to uphold decorum, as one of it\u2019s leaders in Anambra state\n\nBy OBI TRICE\n\nStakeholders of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Anambra State Chapter, have cautioned Ngige Nwachukwu, media aide to embattled former leader of the party, Senator Chris Ngige, to desist from spreading deliberate falsehood, but rather concentrate on the task of profering quality advise to the Honourable Minister.\n\nSpeaking against the backdrop of series of Facebook posts wherein he trolled certain individuals whom he claimed Senator Ngige had assisted in the past, as been responsible for the Minister\u2019s current political woes in the APC, the stakeholders remarked that it is only a lazy workman that quarrels with his tools.\n\nSpeaking in almost one voice, the stakeholders observed that typical of the Minister, he has resorted to a deliberate avoidance of pertinent issues plaguing the growth of the Party in the state; instead, enacting dramatic occurrences and scenes in other to digress from the issue of his widespread removal as leader of the party in the state.\n\nSaid one of the stakeholders:\u201dLast week, the APC in Anambra state scheduled a State Caucus meeting at the office of Senator Andy Uba. But eager to flex muscles, Ngige also convened same Caucus meeting at his Asokoro, Abuja residence and at the same day and time as that of Senator Uba. It flopped. Stakeholders rather attended the meeting called by Uba, whereupon about 90 percent of constitutionally recognized state caucus members affirmed Uba as the Anambra state leader of the APC. The Ngige event was left desolate, requiring him to hire non members to fill the vacant seats. Irked by the outcome of the event, Ngige has instructed his cousin and media assistant, Ngige Nwachukwu, to attack those he feels are his imaginary enemies.\u201d\n\nReacting, Hon. Ebele Obi, a former member of the Anambra State House of Assembly, who was one of the four persons named in the incendiary post, stated that contrary to Ngige\u2019s phantom claims, he funded his own campaigns and subsequent court cases when he ran for elections in 2011, cautioning the Ngiges to always seek to relay events as they are.\n\nReplying to Ngige\u2019s post on Facebook through a series of comments, Hon. Obi accused Sen. Chris Ngige of extorting N500,000 before he was handed over the party ticket for the House of Assembly election in 2011 and yet was abandoned by him on the day of the election. In spite of this, he said, he remained loyal to Sen. Ngige, rejecting entreaties and inducement to abandon the APC to join the rival All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA. He further stated that the only reason Ngige is after him is his disagreement, on principle, with the various ill-treatment meted out to Sharon Ikeazor, the Minster of Environment, especially when she wanted to stand for senatorial bye-election.\n\nAlso reacting, Basil Ejidike, Caretaker Chairman of the APC in Anambra state, refuted the charge that it was Sen. Ngige that brought him from obscurity, noting that he had already made a positive name for himself in politics, long before Ngige resigned as a Deputy Director in the Civil service to join politics in 1997.\n\nEjidike:\u201dI was a lecturer at the Sokoto College of Arts in the mid 80\u2019s before I was appointed Deputy Chairman of old Onitsha( Onitsha North, Onitsha South and Ogbaru) in 1990 by the then Military Governor of Anambra state. By 1994, I was a Supervisory Councillor in Onitsha. In 1997, I had campaigned and won the Chairmanship position of the Congress for National Consensus, CNC and by1998, I went ahead to contest and win a seat to represent Onitsha North and South in the House of Representatives. We were waiting for inauguration when Abacha suddenly died, thus halting our inauguration.\n\n\u201cIn the year 2000, I was one of the commissioners, under the Anambra State Education Commission under the administration of then Governor Chinwoke Mbadinuju. When Mbadinuju moved to the Alliance for Democracy, AD in the run up to the 2003 Anambra Gubernatorial Election, I was offered the Onitsha South Chairmanship position, so as to move with him. I refused, preferring to support Ngige instead. When Ngige came to campaign at Onitsha South in 2003, it was in my office at Zik\u2019s Road, Fegge that he was hosted. I offered one ram to him and another to Chris Uba. I also took care of the logistics of everyone who came for that rally, alongside other stakeholders. We told Ngige not to worry about it. To now say Ngige brought me from obscurity is a feeble attempt at fairytales,\u201d the APC chairman said.\n\nCommenting on Ngige Nwachukwu, Ejidike said:\n\n\u201d That boy writing this fairytale used to be a freelance journalist at Onitsha. He started his day in my house and ended in my office. He was following me to my campaigns and reporting events from my campaign. He has benefitted from my generosity. I wonder why he is now been sponsored to write falsehood. I guess it\u2019s the influence of blood ties.\u201d\n\nAlso commenting, another stakeholder who doesn\u2019t want his name in print, stated that Ngige should be ashamed if the only thing he can claim to have done for Uche Momaife(Uduakomili), after almost 20 years of being loyal to him is to make him a Youth Leader and a member of a redundant Federal Board.\n\nThe stakeholder further added that no one in Anambra has any issue with Sen. Ngige, besides the fact that every party member in Anambra is desirous of the party winning elections \u2013 a legitimate craving which Ngige has not been able to assuage with even a Councillorship position.\n\n\u201cThe APC in Anambra state is the only one that hasn\u2019t won any elections in Nigeria since formation. This is not good for the party and for the aspirations of many of its members. Ngige has refused to provide leadership. In 2017, he abandoned the party despite a free and fair primaries been held. In 2021, he repeated the same thing. This has become a pattern. What you see in Anambra APC is an internal revolt of those members who hold Ngige responsibe for the party\u2019s inability to win elections.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted, Sir Paul Chukwuma, immediate past National Auditor of the APC refused to make any comment, stating that he wouldn\u2019t join issues with the Ngiges.\n\n* Obi Trice is Secretary, Media and Publicity Committee of the Senator Andy Uba Governorship Campaign Organisation, SAUGCO\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

When there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s well done, it\u2019s not individualities that fail, but the conduction and organisation. There\u2019s no justification I can offer.\n\n\u201cEverything that happened was what we wanted to avoid. As there\u2019s nothing to take from it, it\u2019s inevitable I have to take responsibility for a defeat of this type. We\u2019ve never had a performance like the one today,\u201d he said.\n\nCity have 41 points with Liverpool and Chelsea, who both play on Thursday, on 37 and 36 points respectively.\n\nDe Bruyne, whose return to fitness was hampered by COVID-19, said the win was a \u201cbooster\u201d for the side.\n\n\u201cI think we played incredibly well, especially against the way they pressed. We found the right times to attack them. When we were 3-0 or 4-0 up it gets tough for them and they tried to keep it tight in the second half, but we had a lot of chances to score more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for everybody, a lot of people who maybe didn\u2019t play a lot played today and chipped in. For the whole team it is a booster,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "The Ministry of Interior has debunked reports making the rounds that the Federal High Court sitting in Lagos has declared all marriages conducted by the Ikoyi marriage registry illegal and invalid.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday evening, the Permanent Secretary and Principal Registrar of Marriages, Ministry Of Interior, described the reports as \u201cfalse, misleading and a deliberate distortion of the decision of the Court in Suit No: FHC/L/CS/816/18 between Eti-Osa Local Government Council & 3 others\u201d.\n\nAccording to the statement, the court only ruled that the Federal Government, through the Ministry of Interior, is constitutionally empowered to conduct marriages in Nigeria and the Local Governments were only delegated by the Federal Government to conduct marriages, by virtue of Legal Notices issued pursuant to the Marriage Act.\n\nIt also stated that contrary to their (local government\u2019s) pleading, the trial judge held that nothing in the role of local governments, as defined in the Constitution, suggests that they can conduct or contract marriages. However, the only power is derived from the Legal Notices issued by the President.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\nSee the full statement below.\n\nThe attention of the Ministry of Interior has been drawn to news making the rounds on social media claiming that the Federal High Court sitting in Lagos has declared all Marriages conducted by Ikoyi marriage registry to be illegal and invalid.\n\nWe would like to state that this statement is false, misleading and a deliberate distortion of the decision of the Court in Suit No: FHC/L/CS/816/18 between Eti-Osa Local Government Council & 3 others where the Honourable Court held that only the Local Government councils can conduct valid marriages in Nigeria.\n\nIt is noteworthy that, the same Federal High Court situated in Ikoyi, Lagos in Suit No. FHC/L/870/2002 between Prince Haastrup and Eti Osa Local Government held that the Federal Government, through the Ministry of Interior is constitutionally empowered to conduct marriages in Nigeria and held that the Local Governments were delegated by the Federal Government to conduct marriages, by virtue of Legal Notices issued pursuant to the Marriage Act.\n\nIn that case, the learned trial judge held that nothing in the role of local governments, as defined in the Constitution, suggests that local governments can conduct or contract marriages as alleged in their pleadings. The Court affirmed that powers of the local governments to contract statutory marriages is derived from the Legal Notices issued by the President.\n\nThe Court also confirmed that the role of local governments, as enshrined in the Constitution is limited to registration of all forms of marriages (including Islamic and customary marriages).\n\nRather than appeal this decision, the same claimants instituted another action in 2016 Suit no. FHC/L/CS/1760/16 Egor Local Government, EtiOsa Local Government and 2 others V Hon, Minister of Interior and 2 Others.\n\nThe Court held that the Suit was an abuse of court process, as it could not be invited to make another pronouncement on the same point, which would lead to conflicting decisions coming from the same court and struck out the case.\n\nThe same issue was adjudicated in the case of Olumide Babalola vs Ikeja Local Government and the Registered Trustees of the Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON) in Suit No. LD/1343/GCM/2016 delivered on 15th May, 2017.\n\nThe Court held that while registration of marriages are regulated by local governments, being under the concurrent list, formation of marriage is under the Exclusive Legislative List, within the jurisdiction of the Federal Government, regulated by the Ministry of Interior.\n\nIt is further worthy of note that the issue of formation, annulment and other matrimonial causes are by virtue of item 61 of the 1st Schedule of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria exclusively reserved for the Federal Government. The General Public is invited to note that these judgments are all still subsisting, competent and have not been appealed against till date.\n\nFurther to the above, the current decision of the Federal High Court delivered by Hon. Justice D. E. Osiagor of Court 6, cannot set aside a previous decision of the same Court, which is of coordinate jurisdiction, as that would amount to the court sitting on appeal over its own judgment.. In the circumstances, the Federal Government through the Ministry of Interior, has applied for a certified true copy of the judgement and will take appropriate further action including but not limited to filing of an appeal in respect of this conflicting and confusing decision, in line with the provisions of the Constitution.\n\nWe would like to appeal to the general public, the international community, to couples who had hitherto had their marriages solemnized at Federal Marriage Registries by duly licensed places of worship and to all intending couples to be calm and continue transacting their normal businesses at all Federal Marriage Registries subsisting throughout the federation in line with statutory and constitutional provisions.\n\nThe general public is to please note the foregoing and maintain status quo ante. Dr. Shuaib Belgore Permanent Secretary/Principal Registrar of Marriages",

          "text": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has increased the number of flight slots given to Nigerian flag carrier Air Peace to seven per week from an initial one per week.\n\nIt has also granted the Nigerian carrier the permit to fly directly to Dubai instead of just Sharjah Airport.\n\nDubai Civil Aviation Authority announced the slot extension in a letter to the Air Peace chairman amid an ongoing diplomatic row between Nigeria and the UAE.\n\nIt said the letter was \u201cwith regard to slot availability at DXBTerminal 1 and as a gesture of goodwill and in support of UAE and Nigeria relations, in case Air Peace wish to start their flights, slots have been blocked by Dubai Airports.\n\n\u201cRelations between our two countries go a long way back and we value these relations immensely.

          "title": "Aubameyang Stripped of Arsenal Captaincy as Arteta Punishes Disciplinary Breach",
          "text": "Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been stripped of the Arsenal captaincy and will not be selected for Wednesday\u2019s match against West Ham, throwing the striker\u2019s future at the club into doubt.\n\nMikel Arteta dropped Aubameyang from the squad that beat Southampton on Saturday over returning late from a trip abroad and the manager afterwards refused to take questions on the player\u2019s status as club captain. But it was far from the 32-year-old\u2019s first such offence and, as Arsenal made clear in a statement on Tuesday, Arteta\u2019s patience has run out.\n\n\u201cFollowing his latest disciplinary breach last week, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will no longer be our club captain, and will not be considered for selection for Wednesday\u2019s match against West Ham United,\u201d the club said.\n\n\u201cWe expect all our players, particularly our captain, to work to the rules and standards we have all set and agreed. We are fully focused on tomorrow\u2019s match.\u201d\n\nArteta\u2019s decision was made jointly with the club\u2019s hierarchy and comes after discussions with Aubameyang over the past three days. Punctuality issues have dogged Aubameyang in the past, the most high-profile seeing him dropped to the bench for the derby against Spurs in March after he reported late. Similar infractions are also understood to have taken place. Additionally, he was reminded of his responsibilities by the club in February after apparently breaching Covid-19 regulations to get a tattoo.\n\nArsenal have been sympathetic to other off-pitch issues this year, such as a serious illness to his mother and a bout of malaria that hospitalised him, but have been compelled to act after that they see as an intolerable cumulation of breaches.\n\nAlexandre Lacazette captained Arsenal against Southampton but his long-term future is unclear and Arteta is short of senior players capable of stepping up. Granit Xhaka\u2019s ill-fated captaincy is unlikely to be repeated over a longer period so players such as Kieran Tierney and Martin \u00d8degaard, who only turns 23 on Friday but is captain of Norway, may come into the reckoning.\n\nAubameyang signed a new three-year deal in September 2020 and is the club\u2019s highest earner. But he has only scored four Premier League goals this season and, given he is due to represent Gabon at the Africa Cup of Nations next month, Arsenal are already prepared for short-term life without him. His prospects of seeing out that deal will be under question now that Arteta has taken such firm action.",

          "title": "Air Force Discharges 27 for Refusal to Get Covid Vaccine",
          "text": "The Air Force has discharged 27 people for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine, making them what officials believe are the first service members to be removed for disobeying the mandate to get the shots.\n\nThe Air Force gave its forces until Nov. 2 to get the vaccine, and thousands have either refused or sought an exemption. Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said Monday that these are the first airmen to be administratively discharged for reasons involving the vaccine.\n\nShe said all of them were in their first term of enlistment, so they were younger, lower-ranking personnel. And while the Air Force does not disclose what type of discharge a service member gets, legislation working its way through Congress limits the military to giving troops in vaccine refusal cases an honorable discharge or general discharge under honorable conditions.\n\nThe Pentagon earlier this year required the vaccine for all members of the military, including active duty, National Guard and the Reserves. Each of the services set its own deadlines and procedures for the mandate, and the Air Force set the earliest deadline. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said the vaccine is critical to maintaining the health of the force and its ability to respond to an national security crisis.\n\nNone of the 27 airmen sought a medical, administrative or religious exemption, Stefanek said. Several officials from the other services said they believe that so far only the Air Force has gotten this far along in the process and discharged people over the vaccine refusal.\n\nAs a result, they were formally removed from service for failure to obey an order. Stefanek said it is also possible that some had other infractions on their records, but all had the vaccine refusal as one of the elements of their discharge.\n\nIt is not unusual for members of the military to be thrown out of the service for disobeying an order; discipline is a key tenet of the armed services. As a comparison, Stefanek said that in the first three quarters of 2021, about 1,800 airmen were discharged for failure to follow orders.\n\nAccording to the latest Air Force data, more than 1,000 airmen have refused the shot and more than 4,700 are seeking a religious exemption. As of last week, a bit more than 97% of the active duty Air Force had gotten at least one shot.\n\nMembers of the Navy and the Marine Corps had until Nov. 28 to get the shots and their Reserve members have until Dec. 28. Army active duty soldiers have until Wednesday, and members of the Army National Guard and the Reserves have the most time to be vaccinated, with a deadline of next June 30.\n\nAcross the military, the vaccine reaction has mirrored that of society as a whole, with thousands seeking exemptions or refusing the shots. But overall the percentage of troops \u2014 particularly active duty members \u2014 who quickly got the shots exceeds the nationwide numbers.\n\nAs of Dec. 10, the Pentagon said that 96.4% of active duty personnel have gotten at least one shot. The number plummets to about 74%, however, when the Guard and Reserve are included. According to the Centers for Disease Control, about 72% of the U.S. population 18 and older have gotten at least one shot.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin has made it clear that the Guard and Reserve are also subject to the mandate, and has warned that those who fail to comply risk their continuing as members of the military. But that has proven to be contentious.\n\nOklahoma\u2019s Republican governor and the state attorney general have already filed a federal lawsuit challenging the military mandate for the state\u2019s Guard. Gov. Kevin Stitt \u2014 the first state leader to publicly challenge the mandate \u2014 is arguing that Austin is overstepping his constitutional authority.\n\nStitt had asked Austin to suspend the mandate for the Oklahoma National Guard and directed his new adjutant general to assure members that they would not be punished for not being vaccinated.\n\nAustin rejected the request and said unvaccinated Guard members would be barred from federally funded drills and training required to maintain their Guard status.\n\nOklahoma\u2019s adjutant general, Brig. Gen. Thomas Mancino, posted a letter on the state Guard\u2019s website, however, warning his troops that those who refuse the vaccine could end their military careers.\n\n\u201cAnyone \u2026 deciding not to take the vaccine, must realize that the potential for career ending federal action, barring a favorable court ruling, legislative intervention, or a change in policy is present,\u201d Mancino wrote.",
