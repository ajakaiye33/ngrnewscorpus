          "text": "A first summit between US President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart was \u201cconstructive\u201d, Vladimir Putin said Wednesday after the talks in Geneva ended.\n\n\u201cThe conversation was absolutely constructive\u201d, Putin told reporters, adding that the sides had agreed for their ambassadors to return in a small gesture of healing in their strained relations.\n\nThe ambassadors \u201cwill return to their place of work. When exactly is a purely technical question,\u201d Putin told reporters after the summit, which lasted about three and a half hours.\n\nDiplomatic relations between Moscow and Washington had all but broken down since Biden took office in January.\n\nAfter Biden likened Putin to a \u201ckiller\u201d, Russia in March took the rare step of recalling its ambassador Anatoly Antonov. The US envoy, John Sullivan, likewise returned to Washington.\n\nDespite tensions, the summit at an elegant villa on the shore of Lake Geneva got off to a good start, with the two leaders shaking hands and striking cautiously positive notes.\n\nBiden, who was set to hold a separate press conference later, pressed Putin to replace the combustible US-Russian stand-off with a more \u201cpredictable\u201d relationship between \u201ctwo great powers\u201d capable of agreeing to disagree.\n\nHe stressed his desire to take US-Russian relations off their increasingly unstable trajectory, in which Washington accuses the Kremlin of everything from meddling in elections to cyberwarfare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always better to meet face to face,\u201d he told Putin as they met in the villa\u2019s library, with a globe placed between them.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to determine where we have a mutual interest, where we can cooperate; and where we don\u2019t, establish a predictable and rational way in which we disagree \u2014 two great powers,\u201d Biden said.\n\nPutin noted at the start of the meeting that \u201ca lot of issues\u201d need addressing \u201cat the highest level\u201d and that he hoped the meeting would be \u201cproductive\u201d.\n\nAt his press conference after the summit, Putin signalled progress in a number of areas, including an agreement to \u201cstart consultations on cybersecurity\u201d.\n\n\u2013 Cold War, new problems \u2013\n\nBiden\u2019s apparent offer of a more understanding \u2014 if not necessarily a friendly relationship \u2014 went a long way toward what Putin is reportedly seeking: increased respect on the world stage.\n\nThe reference to the United States and Russia as \u201ctwo great powers\u201d was sure to please the Kremlin leader, who has dominated his country for two decades, infuriating the West with invasions of Ukraine and Georgia, and often brutal crushing of political dissent.\n\nExpectations were low for anything more than a modest thaw in relations.\n\nIllustrating the frostiness, there was no shared meal during the talks, which were attended by the two countries\u2019 foreign ministers and later by an expanded group of officials.\n\nThe choice of Geneva recalled the Cold War summit between US president Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in the Swiss city in 1985.\n\nThe summit villa, encircled with barbed wire, was under intense security. Grey patrol boats cruised along the lakefront and heavily-armed camouflaged troops stood guard at a nearby yacht marina.\n\nBut in contrast with 1985, tensions are less about strategic nuclear weapons and competing ideologies than what the Biden administration sees as an increasingly rogue regime.\n\nFrom cyberattacks on American entities and meddling in the last two US presidential elections to human rights violations and aggression against Ukraine and other European countries, Washington\u2019s list of allegations against the Kremlin runs long.\n\nPutin came to the summit arguing that Moscow is simply challenging US hegemony \u2014 part of a bid to promote a so-called \u201cmulti-polar\u201d world that has seen Russia draw close with the US\u2019s arguably even more powerful adversary China.\n\nIn a pre-summit interview with NBC News, he scoffed at allegations that he had anything to do with cyberattacks or the near-fatal poisoning of one of his last remaining domestic opponents, Alexei Navalny.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Worthy adversary\u2019 \u2013\n\nBiden, ending an intensive first foreign trip as president, arrived in Geneva after summits with NATO and the European Union in Brussels, and a G7 summit in Britain.\n\nWhile in Brussels, he said he would detail his \u201cred lines.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking for conflict,\u201d he said, but \u201cwe will respond if Russia continues its harmful activities\u201d.\n\nHowever, Biden, who had previously characterised Putin as a \u201ckiller\u201d, upgraded the Russian leader to \u201cworthy adversary\u201d.\n\nAnd for all the rhetoric, the White House and Kremlin both say they are open to doing business in a limited way.\n\nOfficials point to the recent extension of the New START nuclear arms limitation treaty as an example of successful diplomacy.\n\nUnlike in 2018, when Biden\u2019s predecessor Donald Trump met Putin in Helsinki, there was to be no joint press conference at the end of the summit.\n\nThe US side clearly wanted to avoid the optics of having Biden sharing that kind of platform with the Russian president.\n\nIn 2018, Trump caused a stir by saying, as Putin stood beside him, that he believed the Kremlin leader over his own intelligence services when it came to accusations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election bringing Trump to power.\n\nAFP",

Otemu, Head of Oghenovo O. Otemu Chambers, the petitioners said out of 17 persons arrested, 12 were released upon payment for their bail while the police refused to release them, and two others insisting that N35 million must be paid.\n\nALSO READ: Nigeria to reduce import by 35 % in Q1 2022 \u2014 Emefiele\n\n\u201cIt is our brief that Alhaji Bawa Adamu, Abdullahi Adamu and 17 others were arrested by the Police Anti-kidnapping Team in Nasarawa State about the 15th of April,2021 on the instigation of Kire Iki and Dere Dono.\n\n\u201cAfter their arrest, several financial requests were made by the police. While 14 of the arrested persons were released upon paying for their bail, the police refused to release our client and two others, insisting that our client must pay the sum of N35 million or buy a gun which they will submit to the Anti-kidnapping Unit,\u201d the petition read.\n\nNoting that, \u201cit is worthy of mention that Kire Iki and Dere Dono have been conniving with the police you extort monies from our clients at different times before\u201d,the petitioners claimed that:\u201dThis current arrest on Alhaji Bawa Adamu was done when he went to secure the release of Abdullahi Adamu,his brother.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter their arrest,the police in connivance with Kire Iki and Dere Dono have trumped up charges against our client in a bid to extort the sum of N35 million from them,\u201dthe petition read.\n\nTo this end, the petitioners did not only demand transfer of the case from the Nasarawa State Police Command but also a thorough and unbiased investigation on the case.\n\nIt claimed that a petition earlier written to the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali, was approved by the former and the case assigned to the Force Criminal Investigation Department, FCID, \u201cbut when officers of the FCID went to Nasarawa State Police Command to collect the file and the suspects, the Commissioner of Police refused to direct a release of the case file and the suspects, thereby insisting of holding on to the case file.\u201d\n\nALSO READ: 2023 Presidency: Zoning can\u2019t stop Tinubu from clinching APC ticket, says ex-minister\n\n\u201cThe IPO has consistently boasted that nobody, not even the Inspector General of Police can take the case from them and that if the money they are requesting for is not paid,our client will be implicated and subsequently die in prison,\u201d they alleged in the petition.\n\nAccording to the petitioners, \u201cIn actualizing their threat, our clients\u2019 brother who has been interfacing with the police by trying to secure their bail, who also has on behalf of our clients instructed lawyers to petition the Inspector General of Police to call for justice for his brothers by trying to expose the activities of the police and the humongous request they are making, was also arrested on the 6th of June, 2021, in order to permanently silence our clients and keep them in perpetual detention until the N35 million is paid.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur clients are seriously sick and are not being cared for. The police in Nasarawa State have also refused to thoroughly and unbiasedly investigate the case as they are working with Kire Iki and Dere Dono to undermine your authority and further our clients by keeping them in detention under harsh condition in perpetuity with a bid to coarse them to succumbing to paying the N35 million.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we therefore, humbly appeal to you to use your good offices to direct the Inspector General of Police to cause a transfer of this case from the Nasarawa State Police Command to an unbiased team of investigators here in Abuja for a thorough investigation into this matter to see that justice prevails,\u201dthe petition further read.\n\nReacting to the allegations, the Nasarawa State Police Command denied its involvement in the alleged bribery leveled against it.\n\nCommissioner of Police in the State, CP Bola Longe gave the denial while reacting to a petition purportedly written against the command, alleging that it was demanding the sum of N35 million for the release of one Alhaji Bawa Adamu and two of his brothers being detained over alleged involvement in the kidnapping.\n\nCP Longe said as soon as the suspects were arrested,pressure has been mounting from different quarters for their release, but added quickly that his command remained resolute in its determination to fight crimes to the barest minimum.\n\nWhile vowing that in spite of the pressure,there must be a thorough and unbiased investigation into the case involving the suspects, he said his insistence that the law must take its course \u201cprompted the petitioners to go to the highest command to seek the release of the suspects.\u201d\n\n\u201d We are firmed,the command would not be intimidated by the petitions flying from every corners,\u201d he insisted saying that Nasarawa has zero tolerance in corruption, so cannot be associated with the allegation by the petitioners.\n\nHe advised that the command must be allowed to carry out its statutory responsibility of protecting and preserving the lives and property of citizens of the state.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Rufai of the CDCFIB read in part: \u201cIn view of the convention on seniority in the military and paramilitary services in respect to the newly appointed Controller-General, and in addition to other antecedents, you are hereby advised to proceed on voluntary retirement from the service with effect from 9th June 2021.\u201d\n\nA source told PRNigera that none of the retired officers was senior to the new CG.\n\n\u201cThere are three DCGs who were promoted with effect from 1st January, 2019 and by that are senior to the CGC whose date of appointment was April 2021. The DCGs were left in the service.\n\n\u201cIt is also curious that the letter of the retirement cited tradition in the military and paramilitary.

In 2002 when Abraham Akpe was appointed, he worked with all his contemporaries.\n\n\u201cIn 2006, when Olusola Ogundipe was picked from among the ACGs, he worked with hitherto superiors. In 2012, when DCG Zakari Ibrahim was appointed, he did the same. Dr. Peter Ekpendu too in 2014.\n\n\u201cWhen the immediate past substantive CGP was appointed, he worked with his superior and contemporaries. The only senior officer, Alhaji Aminu Sulley, he wanted to retire took the matter to court and won.\u201d\n\nThe source added that the return of the officers would be in line with the reform of the NCoS spelt out in the Correctional Service Act 2019 signed by the President.\n\nIt was gathered that the officers have sent words to Buhari and the National Assembly to intervene in their retirement.",

This is either that there are problems in the course of investigation or problems in the course of prosecution or problems when case files are sent to the Ministry of Justice for legal advice,\u201d the Chief Registrar said.\n\nHe submitted that gender-based violence was not something to be swept under the carpets, adding that there was a need for women to be protected by the laws of the land.\n\nEkiti First Lady restates govt\u2019s zero tolerance for Gender-Based Violence among students\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t have anybody to put an eye on some of these things that are happening from the time arrests are made up to the time the accused persons are taken to court.\n\n\u201cWe are really worried and I think this programme is a forum where we begin to sensitize ourselves and those we live with to see that gender-based violence are not just things we can sweep away.\n\n\u201cWe should try as much as possible to see that women are given due protection by our laws,\u201d Sublim said.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, a Programme Coordinator with UN Women, Peter Mancha, informed that 15 states, including Bauchi State, had so far not only keyed into the implementation of the UN Women programme but also launched implementation plans.\n\nHe said the UN Women had been working with various partners, including Partners West Africa Nigeria (PWAN) and International Alert, to implement the programme with the support of the Federal Ministry of Budget and National Planning.",

As of April 2021, the inflation rate was the highest in four years. Food prices accounted for over 60 per cent of the total increase in inflation. Rising prices have pushed an estimated seven million Nigerians below the poverty line in 2020 alone.\u201d\n\nThe report acknowledged notable government\u2019s policy reforms aimed at mitigating the impact of the crisis and supporting the recovery, including steps taken towards reducing gasoline subsidies and adjusting electricity tariffs towards more cost-reflective levels, both aimed at expanding the fiscal space for pro-poor spending.\n\nIn addition, the report highlighted that both the federal and state governments cut non-essential spending and redirected resources towards the COVID-19 response.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, public-sector transparency has improved, in particular around the operations of the oil and gas sector,\u201d it added.\n\nThe report, however, said despite the more favourable external environment, with recovering oil prices and growth in advanced economies, a failure to sustain and deepen reforms would threaten both macroeconomic sustainability and policy credibility, thereby limiting the government\u2019s ability to address gaps in human and physical capital, which is needed to attract private investment.\n\n\u201cNigeria faces interlinked challenges in relation to inflation, limited job opportunities, and insecurity,\u201d Chaudhuri, said during the virtual presentation of the NDU.\n\n\u201dWhile the government has made efforts to reduce the effect of these by advancing long-delayed policy reforms, it is clear that these reforms will have to be sustained and deepened for Nigeria to realise its development potential,\u201d he added.\n\nThe latest Nigeria Development Update proposed a near-term policy option organised around three priority objectives: reduce inflation by implementing policies that support macroeconomic stability, inclusive growth, and job creation; protect poor households from the impacts of inflation, and facilitate access to financing for small and medium enterprises in key sectors to mitigate the effects of inflation and accelerate the recovery.\n\n\u201cGiven the urgency to reduce inflation amidst the pandemic, a policy consensus and expedite reform implementation on exchange-rate management, monetary policy, trade policy, fiscal policy and social protection would help save lives, protect livelihoods, and ensure a faster and sustained recovery,\u201d World Bank Lead Economist for Nigeria and co-author of the report, Marco Hernandez said.\n\nIn addition to assessing Nigeria\u2019s economic situation, the NDU discussed how the COVID-19 crisis has affected employment, how inflation is exacerbating poverty in Nigeria, how reforming the power sector can ignite economic growth and how Nigeria can mobilise revenues in a time of crisis.\n\nLack of Economic Opportunities Fuelling Insecurity, Criminality in Nigeria, Says W\u2019Bank\n\nWhile speaking on \u2018The Arise Xchange,\u2019 a programme of ARISE NEWS Channel, Chaudhuri said lack of economic opportunities was contributing to the rising crime cases and insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, due to the level of poverty, many people will try to find a way to getting by however they can, and if criminality offers an option, then they will embrace it.\n\nThis, he stated, in turn, makes it difficult for businesses to operate and has a multiplier effect on the country\u2019s economic growth potential.\n\nResponding to a question on at what point he thinks the country would begin to lift its citizens out of poverty, he said: \u201cThe simple and complicated answer to that question is as soon as Nigeria chooses to. It really is Nigeria\u2019s choice. The potential is there and the resources can be directed towards that effort.\n\n\u201cUltimately, it would be the private sector that would create the jobs by investing and it is the government that invests in the people by making sure that every Nigerian child has education and the right healthcare. So, these are the things that lead to sustained poverty reduction. In any way, these are simple things in terms of what needs to be done and what is often complicated is generating the consensus around them and actually implementing it.\n\n\u201cSo, we believe Nigeria has the potential to lift 100 million of its citizens out of poverty by 2030 as President Buhari has said. But that decision has to be Nigeria\u2019s choice right now.\u201d\n\nHe, however, commended Nigeria\u2019s fiscal and monetary authorities for undertaking \u201cbold reforms in the face of vocal opposition.\u201d\n\nHe cited the reforms to include the central bank\u2019s recent adoption of the NAFEX rate, which is the rate at the Investors and Exporters\u2019 Window.\n\n\u201cWe believe that would help to boost investor\u2019s confidence, boost the competitiveness of the economy and if combined with other measures, would add more flexibility on the rate. That I think would set the foundation for a strong economic recovery.\n\n\u201cIn collaboration with everything, the fiscal authorities are doing both in terms of mobilising domestic revenue and rationalising expenditure at a time when much-needed resources are needed to combat the pandemic, that coordination would be critical,\u201d he said.\n\nChaudhuri also stressed the need for establishing a more systematic coordination mechanism between fiscal and monetary policy managers, as is being done in a range of countries around the world.\n\nHe stated that in such coordination, communication would be critical.\n\n\u201cWe are in a situation that is unprecedented across the world and it would require support from all members of the society. That is why we believe that communication is essential in anything that the government does,\u201d he added.\n\nIn his contribution, World Bank Lead Economist for Nigeria and co-author of the NDU, Marco Hernandez said: \u201cTo achieve Nigeria\u2019s potential is not up to one government.\u201d\n\nThis, according to the economist, will require sustained action from subsequent governments.\n\n\u201cSo, it is important that the citizens take part so that they can monitor progress and make suggestion going forward,\u201d he added.\n\nModeration in Food Prices Slows Inflation to 17.93%\n\nMeanwhile, the CPI, which measures inflation, dropped to 17.93 per cent (year-on-year) in May compared to 18.12 per cent in the preceding month, according to the NBS.\n\nThe 0.19 per cent decline in the headline index, makes it the second consecutive month that the rate has sustained its downward trajectory after 18 months of inflationary pressures on the economy.\n\nAccording to the CPI figures for May, food inflation dropped to 22.28 per cent from 22.72 per cent in April.\n\nPrice moderation was recorded in bread, cereals, milk, cheese, eggs, fish, soft drinks, coffee, tea and cocoa, fruits, meat, oils and fats and vegetables.\n\nOn a month-on-month basis, the food sub-index declined to 1.05 per cent in May from 0.99 per cent recorded in the preceding month.\n\nOn the other hand, core inflation, which excludes the prices of volatile agricultural produce rose to 13.15 per cent from 12.72 per cent in the review period.\n\nOn a month-on-month basis, the core sub-index increased by 1.24 per cent, the NBS stated.\n\nThe highest increases were recorded in prices of pharmaceutical products, garments, shoes and other footwear, hairdressing salons and personal grooming establishments.\n\nOthers are furniture and furnishing, carpet and other floor covering, motor cars, hospital services, fuels and lubricants for personal transport equipment, cleaning, repair and hire of clothing, other services in respect of personal transport equipment, gas, household textile and non-durable household goods.\n\nThe NBS said core inflation was highest in Kogi with 25.13 per cent; Bauchi, 23.02 per cent and Sokoto 20.11 per cent. Katsina, with 15.69 per cent; Imo, 15.52 per cent and Delta, 14.85 per cent recorded the slowest rise in headline year-on-year inflation.\n\nSimilarly, food inflation was highest in Kogi 32.82 per cent, Kwara 26.02 per cent and Enugu 25.43 per cent. Akwa Ibom, at 20.06 per cent; Bauchi, 18.65 per cent and Abuja 16.91 per cent recorded the slowest rise in year-on-year inflation.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "CBN Seeks to Slash Importation by 35%",
          "text": "James Emejo\n\nThe Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, yesterday said efforts are ongoing to reduce the country\u2019s import bill by about 35 per cent.\n\nHe said President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s insistence about five years ago on the diversification of the country\u2019s economic base had already started to yield positive results.\n\nThe CBN governor, while receiving a delegation from the Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG), led by its governor, Mr. Buah Saidy, on a two-day working visit to the country, stated that the country currently has the potential to export and earn foreign currency from the production of urea for local production of fertiliser as well as petroleum product as soon as the Dangote refineries goes into operation by the first quarter of next year.\n\nThis, he said would help to reduce importation by about 35 per cent.\n\nHe said a country with a population of over 200 million should have food security, pointing out that this was why the CBN was aggressively looking into the area of food and, \u201cwhere we can use our own available raw materials to produce what we need in our country\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd we believe with time Nigeria will really be a greater country than it is today. We don\u2019t think we are great yet because we have a high import dependence in the country and we are doing everything possible to reduce imports.\n\n\u201cBut like you know, when we are able to reduce imports, encourage exports and encourage consumption spending and investment, those are some of the parameters that will ultimately boost our economy so that we can continue to see rapid growth in our GDP and see prosperity for our people.\u201d\n\nHe also told the visiting team that the apex bank has vast experiences in IT and cybersecurity, adding that its infrastructure had been proven to be impregnable to hackers.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere were some protests sometime last year and when the protest was going on we saw that people were trying to hack into systems and they tried to hack into the CBN systems.\n\n\u201cI got a message that the CBN system had been hacked into and I said the CBN system cannot be hacked into. I called our director in charge of IT and she responded that we have enough firewall that prevented the hack into our system. So those are the kinds of experiences we can share with you though expensive but will share then with you and think of how to work together to collaborate with yours.\u201d\n\nHowever, Saidy, who also said the CBG was having a difficult time regulating the banks in the Gambia especially in the areas of meting out sanctions to erring financial institutions had further sought to know the magic which the CBN had adopted to sanction banks\u2019 executives without repercussions.\n\nResponding, however, Emefiele attributed the successes to the support which the apex bank had enjoyed from the National Assembly.\n\nHe said: \u201cOn the issue of the CBN independence, I thank you for the kind words. But I think the point is that we thank our own parliament. Our parliament has been extremely supportive of the CBN.\n\n\u201cThey put in place a central bank Act that grants independence to the CBN and we have our Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act that also grants a lot of power and authority for the CBN to bite when we find people who want to take advantage of the system for their own personal benefit and we don\u2019t breed any nonsense about people who try to take advantage of our system for their personal benefits.\n\n\u201cEverything must be done keeping in mind the overall national goals and objectives and that is why the CBN will act very fast on any economic agent that tries to undermine our policies and that\u2019s why we are very firm on them.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWorking with your parliamentary I believe you can have laws that can give you the kind of independence that you need in any, practically most of the central banks in the world today have independence that gives them the power to be able to manage monetary policy in a way that is beneficial to their countries and economy.\u201d\n\nEmefiele also said the apex bank was doing everything possible, apart from looking at currency adjustment when necessary, to confront issues of supply management and ensure that economy grows.\n\nHe said the CBN had adopted demand management strategies that will help to curtail imports and ensure that some of those goods that can be produced locally are not imported.\n\nMeanwhile, there are strong indications that CBN may seal an agreement with the Central Bank of the Gambia (CBG) to undertake the printing of legal tender for the latter.\n\nThis followed a request by the CBG for a possible collaboration as it seeks to address acute currency shortages in the country.\n\nAlready, Emefiele, while receiving a delegation, assured that the CBN has extremely competitive advantage to manage the currency printing job for The Gambia.\n\nHe said the Nigerian Security Printing and Minting Plc which was established in the early 1960s had been printing currency for the country, adding that the facility has a lot of idle capacity to satisfy the demand of the CBG.\n\nAmong other considerations, Saidy had informed the CBN governor that it is currently costly and unsustainable for the Gambia to continue to rely on its printer \u2013 De La Rue of London \u2013 for its currency needs.\n\nHe added that the distance coupled with some logistics and resource constraints had partly led to a current situation whereby the country had witnessed acute shortage of currency with the attendant implications for the economy.\n\nEmefiele, nevertheless, said: \u201cI note your point on currency management. The Nigerian mint was set up in the early 1960s and we\u2019ve been producing our currency since the early 60s and we have a lot of idle capacity to ensure that instead of you going to Europe or other countries, you will be able to benefit from our ideas.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cOur colleagues will take you to the security printing facility. Our colleagues that came in from Liberia two months ago were fascinated by the kind of facilities, we have at our Nigerian security printing and minting facility and I am sure that you will also enjoy them.\n\n\u201cAnd I am sure they will follow you back to the Gambia to see how they can help you to structure your economic order quantities so we can also be of assistance in printing your currency.\n\n\u201cAnd I can assure you that we can be extremely competitive if only from the stand point of logistics and freight from Europe but it\u2019s just going to be a few hours from here to the Gambia and the rest of them.\u201d\n\nThe CBG governor had further explained that it costs the bank about \u00a370,000 to lift printed currencies from Sri Lanka to the Gambia.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe also need assistance in currency management. Right now we have a situation where we are running very low on currency and at some point I get scared because we cannot at the central bank run out of currency completely as that will be a disaster.\n\n\u201cSo we want to learn from your estimate. We have a model but we have not looked at it yet \u2013 given to us by our printers \u2013 De La Rue. How they estimate the currency need of the country on yearly basis.\n\n\u201cBut I think it has some defects otherwise, the acute shortage we have currently would not have happened.\u201d\n\nSaidy said: \u201cWe placed an order for three years of currency to be printed but again, the contract with De La Rue since independence they have been printing our currency.\n\n\u201cYesterday in my interaction with the Deputy Governor, Mr. Kingsley Obiora, we realise that you print your own currency and I asked about security and he assured me that you have top of the line security features.\n\n\u201cSo this is another area I would want us to exchange ideas and have discussions on how possibly if we decide to go with you we can collaborate with your assistance to be printing our currency.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cAgain, it is closer, De La Rue is in London but they do the printing in Malta and also Sri Lanka. The last one was done in Sri Lanka.\n\n\u201cLifting those things all the way to the Gambia is costly because we had to do some emergency order and that cost was going to be on CBG but with negotiations and assuming then that we will give them this contract of three years of printing our currency, they now paid for the flight \u2013 about \u00a370,000 to lift those currencies to the Gambia.\u201d\n\nHe also said the CBG was in the country to benefit from the CBN\u2019s vast experiences on how it had successfully regulated the financial system and sought assistance in the areas of information technology, modernisation, cybersecurity, forex shipping and management, among others.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Army chief says synergy now better among service chiefs\n\nDeji Elumoye and Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday called for unity among West African States and those in the Sahel to deal with security challenges in their respective nations.\n\nAlso, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya, has said service chiefs now work in synergy, debunking insinuation that they failed in curbing the worsening insecurity in the country due to inter-agency rivalry.\n\nBuhari, while receiving the new Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for West Africa and the Sahel, Mahamat Annadif, at the State House, Abuja, said the security challenges were enormous and, there, required concerted efforts to tackle them.\n\nThe president, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, said: \u201cYou are our neighbour. You have vast experience on matters affecting the Sahel, having served for five years in Mali. I hope you will get the countries to work together to confront the issues affecting them.\n\n\u201cI hope under the auspices of UNOWAS, you will help get the problems sorted out. Most of them have to do with the instability in Libya, and it affects all of us.\u201d\n\nWhile describing the security challenges as \u201cenormous,\u201d Buhari added that the Boko Haram insurgency has ravished the lives and resources of Nigerians and inhabitants of some neighbouring countries while large swathes of Mali remain occupied by militants.\n\nHe promised Nigeria\u2019s support to Annadif to aid his new assignment.\n\nIn his remarks, Annadif said he was visiting shortly after his appointment because he recognised Nigeria\u2019s crucial role in West Africa.\n\nHe said the problems of the Sahel region were not new to him, which is why more than ever, he would depend on the help of Nigeria to succeed.\n\nSynergy Now Better among Service Chiefs, Says COAS\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya, has debunked the insinuation that the service chiefs failed to curb the worsening insecurity in the country due to lack of synergy among them.\n\nYahaya, who spoke while fielding questions from members of the House of Representatives Committees on Defence and Army at his screening, said there was synergy among the service chiefs.\n\nBuhari had appointed Yahaya to replace former COAS, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, who died in a plane crash in Kaduna.\n\nThe president consequently wrote to both chambers of the National Assembly, urging them to confirm Yahaya\u2019s appointment.\n\nAddressing the lawmakers, Yahaya said the job of securing the country was not a one man\u2019s job, adding that the service chiefs have always operated together, hence the composition of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Police, DSS and Civil Defence.\n\nHe said: \u201dAs we know, internal security is intelligence-driven operation. So we need others, including communities, including traditional rulers and all others who can provide information. We work together. At the army headquarters level here, all the service chiefs now luckily we were all mates in the academy. So there\u2019s not much gap. The CDS (Chief of Defence Staff) is a member of 34 regular course; we met him there.\n\nSo, at one time or the other, all of us were members of that academy together. The chief of naval staff and I were one time members of battalion. So, the synergy cannot be anything better now that we\u2019re brought up together; we have trained together.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on his plans to curb the worsening insecurity, the COAS said he would use his experience in the field over the years to make Nigeria safer.\n\nHe added: \u201dI joined the military 36 years ago, so, I brought along with me 36 years of military experience. I\u2019m abreast with the security requirements. I was involved in several security operations. The challenges we are facing now, all are characterised by these areas I mentioned, where I have first-hand information and have commanded troops and I administered them in achieving what we\u2019ve done.\n\n\u201cI believe I have the requisite requirements by the grace of God to now provide my services in this office of the Chief of Army Staff, if confirmed. What I brought is a wealth of experience and commitment. So I\u2019m committed and determined to provide my best and also having known what\u2019s required to achieve results.\u201d\n\nHe also appealed to all citizens for their support, adding that with the support of the people, Nigeria will win the fight against insecurity.\n\nEarlier, the Chairman, House Committee on Defence, Hon. Babajimi Benson, had said the insecurity bedeviling the country had cost it a lot both financially and in terms of human lives.\n\nHe tasked the COAS to bring to strive to end it.\n\nBenson said: \u2018This exercise comes at a very challenging time in the history of our dear country, Nigeria.\n\nOur nation has been besieged by several security issues across all the geopolitical zones with banditry, militancy and self-secessionists stretching our military to the extreme. The worst is the lingering insurgency in the North-east. This war has cost the country a lot both financially and in terms of human lives. This must stop. The Armed Forces of Nigeria needs to adopt innovative measures to curb the killings and wanton destruction of property as a result of these cases of insecurity.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, hope that, if confirmed, the new chief of army staff will do everything possible, working with other service chiefs, to bring this to an end.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "In-house vs. Agency: What tech startups can learn from the biggest question of the corporate world",
          "text": "From the birth of management consulting in the aftermath of the 1921 Depression to the golden era of advertising in the 1950s, followed by strategy, IT, and accounting consultants in the three decades that followed, large corporation leaders have, for a long time, had options on human resource, with external expertise sometimes a competition to internal competence, and other times a complement.\n\nHowever, the trend of firm/agency adoption has been trailed by criticism as consultants debate, among other things, the decision to\u2026 yes, hire consultants, leaving business leaders with a lot to think about, and sometimes the confusion on which approach to take. While there are similarities in their dilemmas, tech startup founders do not have as much luxury and are by nature, designed to achieve more with less. Perhaps the most difficult of the questions is on what is truly more, or less.\n\nStartup founders understandably tend towards the desire to have as much as possible done internally, especially on verticals like brand, marketing, advertising, and media (or one could just say \u2018marketing\u2019, for ease). This desire is inspired by, among other factors, 1. the need to be agile; 2. the need to be understood; 3. the need to be lean; 4. the need to invest in internal competence; and 5. the need for control.\n\nThere are a few downsides to keep in mind, however, but we will (subsequently) discuss alternative approaches to maximizing the pros.\n\nRestricted flow of ideas due to the monotony of challenge in-house. Rigidity of human resources as you cannot just \u201cchange hands to switch things up\u201d, like you could ask an agency to switch people working on your account (or even change the agency altogether). Difficulty in attracting top talent as a good percentage are more likely to choose being in the company of their like-minds for exchange of ideas, among other things.\n\nWhile a lot of these ring true, the motivations for internal teams remain strong, and rightly so. Below are a few things startup founders surely want to ponder upon as they work towards success with these objectives while avoiding some of the issues raised above.\n\nOn operations \u2014 the need to be agile\n\nStartups are rightly concerned about the speed and flexibility they can expect from agencies.\n\nBeyond clearly discussing these expectations, which is very important, it helps to design a system where the agency professionals devoted to the project are clearly known and there is a communication system that is transparent, with collaborators from both sides being able to interact through platforms that make new teams out of the collaboration. Think about it like a Joint Task Force.\n\nOn quality \u2014 the need to be understood\n\nFounders trust their ability to get their teams on board with the bigger picture, values and more. They are sometimes unsure how to extend this for external teams.\n\nFirst, it is important to remember that while the internal perspective may be the most important, it is only one side to the full view. Agencies are able to see the company from without and escape the trappings of confirmation biases, and a lot more.\n\nAs a collaboration appears like a better balance of perspectives, it helps to ensure that there are key internal stakeholders on the project team, with at least one of them being well versed in the field of expertise being outsourced. They help to provide that \u201cfrom-within\u201d influence. Usually, there is a co-founder or top executive deeply involved in these conversations, as they set the direction for major decisions.\n\nOn budget \u2014 the need to be lean\n\nNeedless to state that startups need to cut costs and spend wisely to extend their runways.\n\nMany startups decide to go fully in-house as a way to cut costs but the only way that results in lower costs is if they set up teams with people with far lower capacities compared to agency professionals. It\u2019s either that or they are breaking the bank to match up, as they make up for the tendency of this top talent to prefer teams of their peers, if pay was the same. There is hardly any true saving of costs in this regard, especially when you also add how agencies are able to spread their payroll across multiple talents and hence be relatively cheaper in fees for the client.\n\nA better way to save money is to combine an internal team of a few seasoned experts, some mid-level talents or interns with an experienced team (external) that is tasked with setting the foundation and helping to fully onboard (or sometimes train) the internal team. A continuous but cheaper path to continuity may involve the internal team doing the day-to-day work while using the guardianship of the external agency.\n\nOn talent \u2014 the need to invest in internal competence\n\nStartups are thinking about breaking that bank as a long-term investment in talent development.\n\nWhile this is a great approach when there is the budget for it, perhaps the best gift for an in-house team is to not close them up, no matter high the quality of talent within, but to rather open them up to the exchange of ideas achievable with collaboration from external teams who readily come with more diversity in experience.\n\nOn trust \u2014 the need for control (or commitment)\n\nMany startup founders have experienced being treated as \u201cone of many clients\u201d, feeling helpless and being unable to control timeline and delivery issues.\n\nThe thought here is to simply shop carefully, and speak to other startup founders who have worked with agencies to determine which ones have the best systems that ensure that despite the inability to directly manage the condition of things, as external engagements go, they can be trusted to commit to the goals of the clients. This calls for a thorough process of choosing the agencies and firms to work with, but just like hiring staff, the work is always hard but worth it.\n\nOne more place to look at is in the contracts and SLAs, ensuring that expectations are clearly stated as well as clear systems to check and review the progress of work week in week out, or bi-monthly.\n\nThere are hardly any definite answers, surely not from the traditional \u201ccorporate world\u201d. What we have to work with are lessons and talking points to thoroughly think around as each team finds its own fit.\n\nIn the end, it may be more about how best to combine both than which side to commit to.\n\nVictor Fatanmi is the Managing Partner at FourthCanvas, a brand strategy and design agency focused on African tech ecosystems.\n\nShare this article",

Armed with our new motto \u2013 \u201cEveryone is invited\u201d \u2013 we are telling more pan-African stories and covering more regions on the continent.\n\nAnd speaking of stories, we decided to give them a better, cooler home. The result of that decision is what you are currently reading this on \u2013 our new website!\n\nWe\u2019ve been at this since 2013 and so far we\u2019ve been able to bring much-needed attention to Africa\u2019s nascent startup and innovation scene.

Now you can watch TC Live or Building From Ground Up episodes directly on our new website.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all, our flagships are now super easy to find:\n\nAbout the flagships\n\nFrom telling human angle stories of how Africans use technologies to reporting big tech and exploring everyday trends as seen on social media, our stories are grouped into a diverse range of interests and consistently shared in different categories.\n\nMy Life In Tech\n\nWhat does it mean to have a career in tech?

Everyone should read Ask an Investor to get to know the different investors on the African continent and how they make decisions, says Daniel.\n\nThe Backend\n\n\u201cWhat goes into the design and final outcome of an African tech product? What assumptions do tech companies make about user behaviour?\u201d Alex asks. The BackEnd looks into these and other questions about how products are built in Africa, giving an inside view into the \u201ccontrol rooms\u201d at tech companies.\n\nThe TC Daily Newsletter\n\nWe publish the TC Daily newsletter, the most comprehensive roundup of technology around Africa.

          "text": "Mazi Mobility, a mobility-as-a-service (Maas) startup founded by Jesse Forrester, recently launched its flagship electric motorcycle fleet in Nairobi, Kenya. Mazi Mobility is backed by global Venture Builder, Satgana.\n\nMazi uses motorcycles, locally known as \u2018bodas\u2019, to accelerate the transition to efficient, affordable and clean transport in the city. The startup also introduced battery swapping stations that provide on-demand energy, reducing transportation costs by 50%. The MK3 offers a choice between a single and dual battery, capable of up to 70km and 140km of range, respectively. Mazi is taking a multi-stakeholder approach to drive the e-mobility sector forward. They are working with boda operators, technical institutions and manufacturers to ensure the successful implementation of their service.\n\n\u201cMazi is not just an EV company, we are advocates for a sustainable mass mobility change,\u201d says Jesse Forrester, Co-Founder and CEO at Mazi Mobility.\n\n\u201cAt Mazi, we believe that Africans should be able to move efficiently, and affordably across cities at less than the price of personal vehicle ownership while reducing CO2 emissions. What industry is better to see this change than the boda one? Mazi is taking a long approach to mobility, we don\u2019t want to just have the same status quo but with electric vehicles. At Mazi we move people, data and things. Twende Kazi na Mazi!\u201d\n\nSupporting Mazi on their journey is Satgana, a global Venture Builder on a mission to launch and fund responsible startups aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nSatgana backs purpose-driven entrepreneurs who at the core of their business model want to address the social and environmental pillars of the SDGs. They become hands-on partners, supporting their startups with strategy, technology, investor readiness, and impact management.\n\nAs an e-mobility startup, Mazi Mobility fulfils one or more of the UN\u2019s SDGs including SDG#8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG#11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) and SDG#13 (Climate Action).\n\nIn a conversation with Konstantin Behr, Venture Builder at Satgana, he shared with TechCabal what he looks out for in prospective founders:\n\n\u201cFrom the get-go, we analyse how impact-driven a founder is\u2013 that helps us determine if we\u2019re a right fit for them and vice versa.\n\nI am very passionate about the African continent and having been working in the ecosystem for the last 3 years, I have seen amazing growth in startups and increasing interest from foreign investors. Mazi Mobility is our first venture in Africa.\u201d\n\nWhile most Venture Builders hire founders to execute their ideas and strategic plans for a product or business, Satgana\u2019s approach is unique and colors outside the box.\n\nSatgana aims to build and invest into startups alongside purpose-driven entrepreneurs, wherever they are, by using innovation-led and market-based approaches to solve the greatest social and environmental challenges of our time. And alongside Mazi, they hope to write a new chapter in the history of e-mobility in Africa.\n\nFounder and CEO at Satgana, Romain Diaz, elaborated on the launch of their first portfolio venture saying,\n\n\u201cThe urgent need to decarbonise our economies places transportation at the cusp of a fundamental shift towards electric solutions and mobility in Africa is ripe for disruption. As such, Satgana is beyond excited to be involved in the launch of Mazi and truly believes in the founding team\u2019s ability to make it happen. Since day-1, we have been impressed by Jesse\u2019s vision and execution capability. As a Venture Builder, we are humbled to be able to support Mazi in its mission to make urban transportation sustainable while empowering low-income drivers.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nNigeria\u2019s telecommunications workers to go on strike\n\nHelium Health launches in Kenya\n\nMarketForce acquires Digiduka\n\nPlanned strike by Nigeria\u2019s telecommunications workers.\n\nThe Private Telecommunications and Communications Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PTECSSAN) has announced a three-day warning strike starting today, Wednesday, June 16.\n\nAccording to The Punch, the PTECSSAN President, Opeyemi Tomori, decried the poor working conditions of its members and the disregard for labour laws in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigerians are no strangers to strike actions, but this would be the first by the country\u2019s telecommunications workers. Techpoint Africa spoke with customer care representatives from MTN and Airtel, who either claimed ignorance of the strike or said that their services would not be affected.\n\nIf it goes ahead as planned, it could have damaging effects on an economy already grappling with a Twitter ban and widespread insecurity.\n\nInterestingly, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) records that Nigeria\u2019s telecommunications industry contributed 15.05% to the nation\u2019s GDP in 2020.\n\nFollowing reports of a planned strike by telecommunications workers last year, the Federal Government stepped in. They may do so again.\n\nHelium Health launches in Kenya\n\nAdegoke Olubisi (CEO), Tito Ovia (Head, Public Growth Sector), Dimeji Sofowora (CFO)\n\nAfter announcing expansion plans last year, Nigerian healthtech startup, Helium Health, has finally launched in Kenya. This comes after its $10 million Series A raise in May 2020.\n\nAt the time of the raise, the startup announced that the funds would be used for its expansion and the development of new products to make the doctor-patient experience more seamless.\n\nCo-founder and Head of Public Sector Growth, Tito Ovia, announced that the startup is already working with three local partners to improve efficiency and provide better service to patients. Simultaneously, it is rolling out its services in Liberia and Uganda.\n\nHelium Health claims to have over 300 healthcare providers and 5,000 health professionals using its technology to improve access to healthcare for patients.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith this move, the six-year-old startup is now present in six West African countries, making it one of the largest healthtech startups in the region.\n\nHealthtech startups in the continent have started getting more recognition, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Disrupt Africa reports that funding for healthtech startups on the continent increased by 257.5% from 2019 to 2020.\n\nMarketForce acquires Digiduka\n\nKenyan startup, MarketForce, has announced the acquisition of Digiduka. The company provides a software solution that allows field agents to record their activities and collect data using handheld devices electronically. This way, businesses can monitor the performance of their sales channels.\n\nOn the other hand, Digiduka helps retailers earn extra money by reselling digital services such as airtime and electricity tokens and also provide them with the payments infrastructure needed to run their businesses.\n\nAccording to Tesh Mbaabu, MarketForce Co-founder and CEO, acquiring Digiduka, rather than competing with them, makes sense as it means the two companies are joining forces to solve a common problem. As part of the buy, Digiduka\u2019s staff will join MarketForce\u2019s team.\n\nFounded in 2018, MarketForce has raised over $2.5 million in funding from investors such as Future Africa, Y Combinator, Ventures Platform, and EchoVC Partners.\n\nAcquisitions are attractive to startups looking to enter new markets, and this seems to be the case with Digiduka. For example, Ajua, a Kenyan consumer experience platform for businesses, bought WayaWaya in April 2021 to take advantage of its payment bots.\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nThe biggest stereotypes about young, unemployed Africans.

          "text": "On Monday, June 14, 2021, the Private Telecommunications and Communications Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PTECSSAN) \u2014 a union that protects the rights of telecom workers in Nigeria \u2014 announced plans to embark on a three-day warning strike.\n\nThe industrial action will start today, Wednesday, June 16, 2021. Reportedly, users may be unable to conveniently use data and call services during the three days as the strike is likely to disrupt these services.\n\nAccording to The Punch, PTECSSAN is embarking on the strike to express their concerns against what the General Secretary, Okonu Abdullahi, calls \u201carbitrary sackings and casualisations\u201d.\n\nAbdullahi said that workers are usually outsourced, which has caused a significant problem in the industry. And since it\u2019s a continual problem, workers are always shortchanged.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn recent times, PTECSSAN has made demands and even threatened to go on strike regarding this problem. However, none of their demands has been met.\n\nIn August 2020, PTECSSAN threatened to go on a two-week warning strike over the remuneration of workers, employee relations practices, exit packages for long-term staff, and alleged abuse of expatriate quota, among others.\n\nMoreover, in March 2021, the telecom association planned to embark on industrial strike action against Huawei Technologies Nigeria Limited, a telecom equipment company. They kept denying workers the right to unionise.\n\nHowever, following the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami\u2019s intervention, that strike action was suspended. In a statement, he said that the telecom equipment company was ready to address the concerns PTECSSAN raised.\n\nThe strike action reportedly commencing today is against the precarious working conditions in the telecom sector like ignoring occupational health and safety, lack of hazard allowance and poor remuneration, and the abuse of national laws and institutions by employers.\n\nWhile the association may be protesting for its rights, the disruptions of data and call services may affect the Nigerian economy.\n\nYesterday, Tuesday, June 15, 2021, MTN reportedly said that due to insecurity in the country, service in Nigeria might be disrupted.\n\nWhat this means is that MTN\u2019s technical support team, in some cases, may not get to the site and achieve an optimum result timely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecall that we wrote that the Nigerian telecom lost 15.5 million mobile subscribers between December 2020 and March 2021 following the SIM registration ban. Therefore, this won\u2019t be the first disruption to the telecom sector in recent months.\n\nIn 2020, Internet shutdowns cost sub-Saharan Africa $237.4 million.\n\nAccording to Statista, as of January 2021, there were 4.66 billion active Internet users globally. In Nigeria, as of January 2021, there were 187.9 million mobile connections and 104.4 million people connected to the Internet, per Data Reportal.\n\nDeloitte\u2019s 2016 The Economic Impact of Disruptions to Internet Connectivity Report shows that in a low connectivity country, with a GDP per capita of $6,000, a population of c. 40 million people, and fixed broadband penetration of c. 5%, a temporary Internet shutdown could have an estimated GDP impact of c. $3 million per day of disruption, amounting a 0.4% of daily GDP.\n\nThis reveals the importance of the Internet to business today.\n\nWe reached out to MTN and Airtel, but as of press time, we are yet to receive a response.\n\nIt\u2019s not certain if Pantami will intervene this time, neither is it known if the industrial strike action will aid the association\u2019s demands.",

Sawari Ventures and Arzan Venture Capital led the round.\n\nOther investors in the round include Egypt Ventures, The Cairo Angels, Saudi Arabia-based VC, Khwarizmi Ventures, and fintech-focused accelerator, EFG-EV.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering, a pre-series A round is fundraising done by a startup in the interim between the seed round and the series A round. In July 2020, the startup raised an undisclosed seed round, and this is their second funding round since then.\n\nFatura is a platform that sells grocery inventories to Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) retailers via a mobile application. With a network that connects manufacturers with wholesalers, the startup can meet those inventory needs. On the app, sellers can manage their pricing lists, manage stocks, and receive orders.\n\nThis latest funding will be used to expand to more cities in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The startup also plans to go beyond meeting retailers\u2019 need for FMCGs and create additional services like a digital payment platform to foster ease-of-business for retailers.\n\nCo-founded by Hossam Ali, Ahmed Anwar, AbdAllah Mohebeldin, and Ahmed Al Bakary \u2014 who joined the team later \u2014 Fatura launched in Cairo, Egypt, in 2020. So far, the startup has 500 sellers, wholesalers, distributors, and manufacturers on the marketplace, having provided service to 25,000 retailers across Egypt.\n\nThings have been quite interesting, as the MENA region\u2019s e-commerce sector has experienced steady growth. According to a Bain & Company report, it was worth $8.3 billion as of 2017, with an average annual growth rate of 25%, most of which Egypt accounts for.\n\nWith such significant growth, we could witness the rise of more startups with product offerings geared towards boosting Egypt\u2019s e-commerce sector.\n\nEthiopian government to sell 40% stake of Ethio Telecom\n\nThe Ethiopian Communications Authority (ECA) has launched a tender to aid the partial privatisation of state-owned telecommunication operator, Ethio Telecom. With this in place, interested private investors can apply, and the chosen bidder will own a 40% stake in Ethio Telecom.\n\nProspective investors have to go through a few stages, the first being submitting a special form-like request called Expression of Interest (EOI). Other stages in the process will be revealed later.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEthiopia is one of the few countries globally to have a monopoly on telecom providers. However, this move is part of plans to open up the country\u2019s largest and most lucrative sector to private investors.\n\nIn February, we reported that Kenyan telecom giant, Safaricom, was one of the final six companies shortlisted for bids on two telecom licences in Ethiopia. And they got it in May, alongside Sumitomo Corporation and the CDC Group.\n\nThis move to sell off a 40% stake to private investors further shows the country\u2019s commitment to encouraging healthy competition in the region, as shielding the sector from competition might slow down innovation.\n\nHowever, we shouldn\u2019t be quick to forget Ethiopia\u2019s erratic approach to Internet censorship,\n\nYouTube to ban certain topics from its masthead ad banner\n\nGoogle-owned video-sharing platform, YouTube, has made some updates to its masthead ad placement policies.\n\nBeginning from Monday, June 21, 2021, YouTube will not allow ads about alcohol sale, gambling, prescription drugs, elections, and politics to run on its homepage \u2014 the platform\u2019s biggest ad unit.\n\nPer Axios, this move is a part of Google\u2019s commitment to \u201cminimize confusion, misinformation and manipulation, especially surrounding sensitive events.\u201d\n\nOne might wonder if YouTube isn\u2019t too late to the party, as giant social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have since placed bans on ads related to political topics. This story gives further context to how these bans took effect during Nigeria\u2019s general elections in 2019.\n\nYou might want to make some excuses for YouTube. Perhaps, the platform wasn\u2019t as strongly exploited as Facebook and Twitter, so the need for permanent restriction measures didn\u2019t arise. However, they placed a temporary ban on political ads following the January 6 Capitol Insurrection.\n\nBut then, the best-performing videos on YouTube are usually longer than 10 minutes, enough time to capture nuance and context that Twitter and Facebook inherently can\u2019t.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\n#WorldBloodDonorDay: 5 startups improving access to safe blood in Africa.

Lately corps members are being deployed to meet the needs of the health care system in the region, owing to the state government\u2019s failure to employ more doctors and nurses.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cHow do the NYSC authority want us to work and contribute our quota to the development of our mother\u2019s land in an areas that are not safe, where kidnappers on daily basis invade the areas, even with the presence of security operatives\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to the presidency and the National Assembly to intervene and reason along with us because It\u2019s just a sucide mission\u201d, he said.\n\nHe also noted that there were hardly any provisions made for the corps members in terms of accommodation and security.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe country\u2019s insecurity has affected various states in Nigeria, and it is becoming alarming. This is to the Director-General of NYSC; please allow all corps members to relocate or redeploy to their states of choice.\n\n\u201cWe expect that when posted to a camp, and after you manage to spend three weeks in camp, you should be able to relocate to your state of choice irrespective of your state of origin or course of study because the country is unstable right now.\n\n\u201cThe NYSC DG has made relocation difficult for doctors, nurses, medical laboratory scientists and pharmacists and people who studied some other courses.\n\n\u201cWe observe that some failed State governments are using these sets of people in place of doctors and nurses that ought to be in the system. The government has refused to employ workers, so corps members in the medical profession are used in hospitals as the major staff members instead of a support system.\n\n\u201cThey have refused to relocate us to where we want to go because it feels safe for us. At a time like this, we need to be around our family or relatives and not just in any state, so it is so wrong to disapprove our relocation requests.\n\n\u201cI believe we have just one life to live and our lives are more important than where we are posted to work. I am a medical doctor, posted to Jos, Plateau State, but due to the insecurity, we decided to redeploy from there and some of my colleagues used medical reports, which showed they were not OK. The criteria for leaving were medical reasons or insecurity, or marriage, so we submitted our relocation form. I left the orientation camp because I was not too fine; I wanted to go back to Delta.\n\n\u201cIn my camp, only about two persons were allowed to relocate out of about 33 doctors and those who got theirs were seriously connected. Should we go to the North and die because I am a government child?\n\n\u201cOf all my friends who are also medical practitioners, only about four were posted to Ekiti, Osun and other southern states; the rest were taken to Sokoto and Kaduna. One of us encountered bandits on his way to Sokoto; he escaped, though and we had to ask him to put on his WhatsApp location to know wherever he was going.\n\n\u201cThe accommodation they give corps members is not befitting. My friend in Borno told me they lost a corps member, a pharmacist, during the camp. She was 24 years old and she had started panting after they played volleyball. They rushed her to the clinic but in less than 10 minutes, she died. The clinic had no oxygen. It was after she died that the oxygen arrived. So the official there told them to lie that the lady died at the referral hospital. You can imagine this\u201d, the corper disclosed\n\n...",

A brush cutter is a powered garden or agricultural tool used to trim weeds, small trees, and other foliage not accessible by a lawnmower or rotary mower.\n\nIn a letter from SUBEB, signed on behalf of the Executive Chairman by the Public and Private Partnership Officer, Akinlehin Temitope, the board thanked the leading philanthropist and community supporter and offered its warmest regards.\n\nThe letter which is specifically in respect of the donation to Imule Primary in Esan West LGA on March 18, 2021, read in part, \u201cThe Board lauds your generous initiative of complementing her efforts in ensuring quality basic education delivery in Edo State and also looks forward to more partnership in this regard.\u201d\n\nMr. Iseghohimen thanked the Education Board for the gesture noting that he received the letter of commendation with great joy and deep appreciation.

This singular tragedy has already compromised Nigeria\u2019s existence because our people no longer belief in a system without fairness, equity and objectiveness.\n\n\u201cThe situation has got to a level in which some leaders of these killer herdsmen openly threaten governors who have banned open grazing, insisting there will be no peace unless Fulani herdsmen \u2013 armed with sophisticated weapons \u2013 are allowed to go from one state to the other.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour Excellencies, if something urgent is not done, these series of attacks will soon have a negative effect on Western countries\u2019 investments in Nigeria,\u201d he concluded.",

It is rather unfortunate that our President has been misadvised on this matter.\n\n\u201cThe Grazing Reserves Laws in some states created from the former Northern Region of Nigeria are deemed to be state laws by Section 318 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), having been adopted from the Grazing Reserve Law of Northern Region of Nigeria (NN Law of 1965).

          "text": "Africa Polling Institute (API), an Abuja-based research institute, has advocated for accurate data of persons living with disabilities (PWDs) in the country, in order to improve their conditions.\n\nProf. Bell Ihua, Executive Director, API, said this at a one-day multi-stakeholder workshop on the Nigeria Disability Research Project, on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, the project which is born out of the need to have a Nigerian-owned data on people with disabilities, is supported by the Ford Foundation.\n\nIhua noted that the project is aimed at gathering evidence-based disaggregated data on Persons With Disability (PWDs) in the country, that would create useful data that would be quoted for many years.\n\n\u201cAs you know, data is life and one of the challenges that have been found so far that has not allowed the inclusion of people with disabilities is the fact there have been little data from the country on people living with disabilities.\n\n\u201cSo with the support of Ford Foundation, the Africa Polling Institute was asked to midwife the process of generating national data on persons with disabilities in the country.\n\n\u201cThe project has four components, the first is working with the National Bureau of Statistics to generate nation wide data on persons with disabilities.\n\n\u201cThe second component is working with academics to engage state government officials in action research to collect data on disabilities at the state level.\n\n\u201cThe third component has to do with capacity building for persons with disabilities, especially in the area of research.\n\n\u201cA lot of organisations within the community want to advocate but they lack the research skill to advocate, so this project is going to help them gain the necessary research skill to be able to do the necessary advocacy.\n\n\u201cThe fourth component is to conduct a study on sexual and gender based violence against people with disabilities,\u201d he said.\n\nThe executive director also advised states that are yet to domesticate the disability Act, to do so and ensure speedy implementation of the Act.\n\nIn her remarks, National President, Joint National Association of Persons with Disabilities (JONAPWD), Ekaete Umoh, added that the outcome of the research would help the PWDs have constructive engagements with the government.\n\n\u201cData is everything, data is for planning and if we do not have accurate data about the situation of persons with disabilities, it is going to be extremely difficult to even implement the disability Act,\u201d she added.\n\nMr Jake Epelle, Chief Executive Officer, The Albino Foundation, added that the outcome of the project would be excellent and beneficial to the community of PWDs.\n\n\u201cWe are going to lend our support to ensure that once the exercise is complete, we will push it through the various systems that we work with both national and international, so that it can be captured at the national level.\n\n\u201cI am hoping that the National Bureau of Statistics will team up with this process and ensure that this outcome would be used in every national discourse,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Buhari Should Personally Lead Peace Talks With Us To End Insecurity \u2014 Bandit Leader Says [Video]",
          "text": "Banditry in the Northwestern section of Nigeria, according to a group of bandits, began when Zamfara was created out of Sokoto in 1996 under the reign of the late military Head of State, Sani Abacha.\n\nThe bandits stated this in a video interview with Daily Trust published on Wednesday.\n\nFulani herdsmen have been exposed to humiliation, hardship, and neglect in the past under democratic regimes that began in 1999 and have pushed them to take up arms, according to the gang\u2019s commander, who spoke in Hausa.\n\nAccording to them, successive Nigerian administrations have failed to share the country\u2019s wealth with the nomads, leaving them illiterate and hungry, forcing them to resort to banditry to survive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been long we started. We started not long after Zamfara State was created. We took up arms because we are herders and despite this country\u2019s wealth, we are not carried along, we are not educated, we do not know anything. We do not have security, we do not have any benefit.\n\n\u201cWe are the ones being killed but are always seen as the aggressors. We don\u2019t have anything. Wherever a herder is, he is uneducated and has nothing. In this country, there is everything but we are not carried along. It is as if though we don\u2019t exist. We are just being killed,\u201d the leader of the gang said in the video.\n\nHe also mentioned a pact that the Nigerian government had previously broken, which was supposed to put a stop to banditry in the region.\n\nThe bandits stated that the government failed to keep its half of the bargain, bemoaning that killings occur on a daily basis in the North West, with no respect for tribe.\n\n\u201cOf course, it has been breached. You have asked for an armistice. An agreement was reached but you left that person in the forest with a gun and nothing was to substitute. What do you expect? How do you want that person to survive?\n\n\u201cAll promises made to us, none of them was fulfilled and nothing was done to enrol the young ones in schools. We should be treated the same way and given jobs, by the government. The Hausa, Yoruba, and Fulani should be treated equally,\u201d the bandits said.\n\nSpeaking, the leader of the marauding gang said President Muhammadu Buhari should head the peace talks if he is serious about ending banditry and insecurity in the country.\n\nFurthermore, the bandits claimed they supported President Buhari because he promised to fix the country, but they can see now that the promise was merely a fantasy.\n\n\u201cThe president should personally come and preside over the talks. When he was campaigning, he travelled all over, why would he not do it now? He does not take these peace talks seriously and every day people are being killed. There is no day that someone is not killed between Zamfara, Niger, Kaduna, Sokoto, and Katsina. No two days pass without someone getting killed in these places.\n\n\u201cThere is no tribe that is spared. Gunmen kill, soldiers kill, vigilantes kill. Whoever you see with a gun today in Nigeria, uses it to kill people. You may not know, but if I were to tell you the situation of things in this country, you will cry. Even the president will cry. We supported this administration and accepted dialogue because we thought he will fix the country but he won\u2019t fix the country.\n\n\u201cFrom the time he praised Goodluck (Jonathan), (Olusegun) Obasanjo, and late (Umaru) Yar\u2019Adua. These were not praiseworthy. It would have been better if he had praised (Sani) Abacha because, under Abacha, pastoralists were being educated. During Abacha, there was allocation in the budget for the nomadic communities. There was no such thing again since Obasanjo became president.\n\n\u201cThey stopped looking after Fulani. Their forests and grazing areas were taken over. You will see one person having as much as 1,000 hectares, just because he is rich,\u201d the leader said.",

          "text": "Primate Elijah Ayodele, the leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, decried the issues facing the Christian world in Nigeria on Wednesday.\n\nPrimate Ayodele stated in a statement released by his media office that some Christian leaders such as Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, Bishop David Oyedepo, the Founder of Living Faith Bible Church, Bishop David Oyedepo, the Founder Of Household Of God International Ministry, Rev Chris Okotie, and some Christian bodies such as CAN and PFN are a threat to the unborn.\n\nThe man of God mentioned Prophet TB Joshua, who died a few weeks ago, and said that despite the fact that he was a Christian before he died, some Christian leaders found it difficult to offer condolence notes to his family members.\n\nHe added that despite claiming to have attended bible schools to learn in-depth about what the Bible says, many of them have publicly accused him of being a wizard and that he isn\u2019t a true Christian.\n\nThe love and harmony in Christianity have been destroyed by top ministers of God who are filled with envy and malice, according to Primate Ayodele.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2019Christians are the problem of the church, everyone will die one day but it\u2019s unfortunate that a Christian brother died and the so called big pastors can\u2019t say a word of condolence, is that how good leaders act? What they have done is wrong, what does it take CAN, PFN to come out when the death happened to pay condolences?\n\n\u201cThe likes of Chris Okotie went ahead to call TB Joshua a wizard, some called him devil while he was alive, was it God that revealed that them that He is working for the devil? Why not bring an evidence? God is going to condemn lot of pastors.\n\n\u201cChristians are the problems of Nigeria, they don\u2019t have love, they have different doctrines, and some preaching are not even biblical. When the beloved son of Pastor Adeboye died, TB Joshua sent condolences and ordered a 1-minute moment of silence to honour the deceased but now that He is dead, what have they done? These are part of hooliganism in Christianity, it\u2019s quite unfortunate. I\u2019m highly disappointed in Pastor Adeboye who is seen as a prominent Christian leader for keeping silent on this . Every one of us will die someday.\n\n\u201cThis is not the time for hatred, there is so much hatred in Christianity and that is why I will never join CAN, PFN or any Christian association, they are associations of envy and hatred, they claim that they went to bible school, is that what the bible taught them? If at all TB Joshua offended anyone, why can\u2019t they forgive him? they should all change, they are getting older.\n\n\u201cCAN, PFN are just association for the government and for personal gains. These associations are not biblical. I have no apology, I don\u2019t want anyone to like me, I am saying this the way I feel, this is a time when we need love and unity in Christianity but those that are the supposed leaders have killed the spirit of love in Christianity. The administrators of this association are selfish, greedy and totally self-centered.\n\n\u201cWe need to support one another, let the bigger pastors help the lesser ones to grow, that\u2019s what we need in Christianity not all these associations causing division.\u2019\u2019",

This is because everyone can do it.

My client was one of the beneficiaries and the conditions given were \u2013 two sureties, one must be a blood relation and another surety not less than level 16 in the Lagos State government civil service.\n\n\u201cThe elder brother to the defendant has appeared as a surety and we have paid the N500,000 bail bond to the account of the Lagos State government but we have not been able to get a level 16 officer to stand as surety,\u201d Mr Olabiran said.\n\nExplaining further, the lawyer said they got three different levels 16 officers but one turned them down along the line and two others declined upon hearing that they need to get a clearance letter from the Head of Service.\n\n\u201cThe level 16 officers are afraid of being issued a query. We are applying for bail on compassionate ground and in the interest of justice,\u201d Mr Olabiran added, urging the Magistrate to consider the visibly ill health of his client.\n\nA counsel from the office of the DPP, Mobolaji Owoebute-Okedeji, opposed the bail application.\n\nHe said the matter has been already filed at the High Court, and he urged the court to refuse bail.\n\nIn his ruling, Magistrate Peter Nwaka refused to vary his bail condition on charges of rape, sexual assault, and abuse of a minor.\n\nAfter considering all the submissions, Magistrate Nwaka declined to grant the defendant bail on the grounds that he no longer had jurisdiction over the matter.\n\n\u201cI have carefully considered the application of the counsel to the defendant seeking bail for the defendant and the opposition by the counsel from the DPP.\n\n\u201cSince there are indications that the matter is before the high court and the defendant will appear before the court, no bail can be given,\u201d the Magistrate said.\n\nThe court also ordered that the defendant must be accorded full medical attention by the authorities pending his arraignment at the high court and adjourned the matter to July 13 for mention.",

          "text": "The construction of an 18.7-kilometer six-lane rigid pavement road from Eleko Junction in Ibeju Lekki to Epe T-Junction in Lagos State will be finished and commissioned. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu gave this guarantee on Monday when he and members of the State Executive Council went on a site visit to examine the project.\n\nSanwo-Olu was impressed by the pace of work on the road, persuading the contractor handling the project to increase its momentum in order to push the progress to an encouraging level before the end of the year.\n\nLast November, the Governor officially opened the first phase of the expansion of the Lekki-Epe Expressway, kicking off the renovation of the 40-year-old infrastructure. The project\u2019s second phase, which will begin later this year, would span 26.7 kilometers from Eleko Junction to Abraham Adesanya Junction in the Eti-Osa axis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe contractor had completed a 3km length of the roadway from Eleko Junction to Epe at the time of the Governor\u2019s inspection, and the right-of-way for the entire project had been cleared.\n\nAfter communicating the work progress to the Governor, representatives of the contractor led Sanwo-Olu and cabinet members on legwork for assessment of features on the completed stretch, including drainage channels, kerb and segregated lane for heavy-duty vehicles.\n\nThe Governor was optimistic the project would be delivered on record time, charging the contractor to scale up the pace of work.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis exercise is an on-the-spot assessment to view the status of the 18.7Km six-lane rigid pavement road construction we are doing from Eleko Junction to Epe. The contractor has been active on site in the last six months, and they have touched every part of the entire stretch. We are currently assessing the project from the 3km lane already completed. On either side are three lanes. Two lanes are for cars, while the last lane is for heavy-duty vehicles. There will be 1.5km pedestrian walkway on both sides.\n\n\u201cWe are happy with the progress of the project, because the contractor works day and night. I believe the work is on track. Residents on this corridor are also happy with the level of work done. They are waiting on us to hand over this important infrastructure to them in earnest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe beauty of the work is that it has reduced the journey time, even as the road is still being constructed. There is no hindrance on the road; motorists have the right-of-way for free movement. Not until when we finish the entire construction, we would have the full benefit of this investment. We are happy with what we have seen and we believe that the contractor should be rounding off the work by end this year or first quarter next year.\u201d",

          "title": "\u2018Two Great Powers\u2019: Biden, Putin Plunge into Hours of Talks",
          "text": "With stern expressions and polite words before the cameras, President Joe Biden and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin plunged into hours of face-to-face talks Wednesday at a lush lakeside Swiss mansion, a highly anticipated summit at a time when both leaders say relations between their countries are at an all-time low.\n\nBiden called it a discussion between \u201ctwo great powers\u201d and said it was \u201calways better to meet face to face.\u201d Putin said he hoped the talks would be \u201cproductive.\u201d\n\nThe meeting in a book-lined room had a somewhat awkward beginning \u2014 both men appeared to avoid looking directly at each other during a brief and chaotic photo opportunity before a scrum of jostling reporters.\n\nBiden nodded when a reporter asked if Putin could be trusted, but the White House quickly sent out a tweet insisting that the president was \u201cvery clearly not responding to any one question, but nodding in acknowledgment to the press generally.\u201d\n\nPutin ignored shouted questions from reporters, including whether he feared jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\n\nThe two leaders did shake hands \u2014 Biden extended his hand first and smiled at the stoic Russian leader \u2014 moments earlier when they posed with Swiss President Guy Parmelin, who welcomed them to Switzerland for the summit.\n\nBiden and Putin first held a relatively intimate meeting joined by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Each side had a translator for the session, which lasted about an hour and a half. The meeting, after about a 40-minute break, then expanded to include senior aides on each side. Biden and Putin were expected to meet for a total of four to five hours of wide-ranging talks.\n\nFor months, they have traded sharp rhetoric. Biden has repeatedly called out Putin for malicious cyberattacks by Russian-based hackers on U.S. interests, for the jailing of Russia\u2019s foremost opposition leader and for interference in American elections.\n\nPutin has reacted with whatabout-isms and denials \u2014 pointing to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol to argue that the U.S. has no business lecturing on democratic norms and insisting that the Russian government hasn\u2019t been involved in any election interference or cyberattacks despite U.S. intelligence showing otherwise.\n\nIn advance of Wednesday\u2019s meeting, both sides set out to lower expectations.\n\nEven so, Biden said it was an important step if the United States and Russia were able to ultimately find \u201cstability and predictability\u201d in their relationship, a seemingly modest goal from the president for dealing with the person he sees as one of America\u2019s fiercest adversaries.\n\n\u201cWe should decide where it\u2019s in our mutual interest, in the interest of the world, to cooperate, and see if we can do that,\u201d Biden told reporters earlier this week. \u201cAnd the areas where we don\u2019t agree, make it clear what the red lines are.\u201d\n\nPutin\u2019s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that no breakthroughs were expected and that \u201cthe situation is too difficult in Russian-American relations.\u201d He added that \u201cthe fact that the two presidents agreed to meet and finally start to speak openly about the problems is already an achievement.\u201d\n\nArrangements for the meeting were carefully choreographed and vigorously negotiated.\n\nBiden first floated the meeting in an April phone call in which he informed Putin that he would be expelling several Russian diplomats and imposing sanctions against dozens of people and companies, part of an effort to hold the Kremlin accountable for interference in last year\u2019s presidential election and the hacking of federal agencies.\n\nPutin and his entourage arrived first at the summit site: Villa La Grange, a grand lakeside mansion set in Geneva\u2019s biggest park. Next came Biden and his team. Putin flew into Geneva on Wednesday shortly before the scheduled start of the meeting; Biden \u2014 who was already in Europe for meetings with allies \u2014 arrived the day before.\n\nAfter the meeting concludes, Putin is scheduled to hold a solo news conference, with Biden following suit. The White House opted against a joint news conference, deciding it did not want to appear to elevate Putin at a moment when the U.S. president is urging European allies to pressure Putin to cut out myriad provocations.\n\nBiden sees himself with few peers on foreign policy. He traveled the globe as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and was given difficult foreign policy assignments by President Barack Obama when Biden was vice president. His portfolio included messy spots like Iraq and Ukraine and weighing the mettle of China\u2019s Xi Jinping during his rise to power.\n\nHe has repeatedly said that he believes executing effective foreign policy comes from forming strong personal relations, and he has managed to find rapport with both the likes of Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whom Biden has labeled an \u201cautocrat,\u201d and more conventional Western leaders including Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau.\n\nBut with Putin, who he has said has \u201cno soul,\u201d Biden has long been wary. At the same time, he acknowledges that Putin, who has remained the most powerful figure in Russian politics over the span of five U.S. presidents, is not without talent.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s bright. He\u2019s tough,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd I have found that he is a \u2014 as they say \u2026 a worthy adversary.\u201d\n\nThe White House held on to hope of finding small areas of agreement.\n\nNo commitments have been made, but according to the senior administration official, there are hopes that both sides will return their ambassadors to their respective postings following the meeting. Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Anatoly Antonov, was recalled from Washington about three months ago after Biden called Putin a killer; U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan left Moscow almost two months ago, after Russia suggested he return to Washington for consultations.\n\nBiden administration officials say they think common ground can be found on arms control. International arms control groups are pressing the Russian and American leaders to start a push for new arms control agreements.\n\nThe Biden team will press its concerns on cybersecurity. In recent months, Russia-based hackers have launched alarming attacks on a major U.S. oil pipeline and a Brazil-headquartered meat supplier that operates in the U.S.\n\nThe Russian side has said that the imprisonment of Navalny, the jailed opposition leader, is an internal political matter and one area where Putin won\u2019t engage on the matter. White House officials said, however, Biden intended to bring up the matter.\n\nThe meeting is sure to invite comparisons with President Donald Trump\u2019s 2018 meeting with Putin in Helsinki, where the two leaders held a joint news conference and Trump sided with Russian denials when asked whether Moscow had meddled in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBiden has prepared for his one-on-one by reviewing materials and consulting with officials across government and with outside advisers. Aides said the level of preparation wasn\u2019t unusual. Biden, in a brief exchange with reporters upon a rriving in Geneva on Tuesday night, sought to offer the impression that he wasn\u2019t sweating his big meeting.\n\n\u201cI am always ready,\u201d Biden said.\n\n___",
