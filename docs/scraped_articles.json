          "title": "Governor Udom Emmanuel\u2019s sixth-year anniversary speech, takeaways",
          "text": "\n\n\n\nBy Etokowo Owoh\n\nI took time to read and digest the speech given by the Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Mr. Udom Emmanuel, on the anniversary of his sixth year in office on Saturday, May 29, 2021.\n\n\n\nThe speech reflected the foresight of a leader on a mission, a heartening departure from speeches made by Nigerian leaders most of which are deficient in key socio-economic appeal and philosophy of governance. Governor Udom\u2019s remarks were nuanced with measurement criteria that assuage public perception.\n\n\n\nAware of the temper of the time and with the felt needs of his people met, he didn\u2019t talk down on the public rather, he then communicate with empathy to an already distraught population. His tone and views were inspiring and l with the right dose of salt to spice the palate. He no doubt came across as pleasantly different.\n\nREAD ALSORejiging Akwa Ibom economy: The Udom Emmanuel interministerial model (2)\n\nCynics, and they are many, may not yet appreciate the speech having for several years been traumatized by long talks that were replete with fine prose but short on economic activities are produce outcomes that lead to the improved economic well-being of the people. Outcomes of economic activities should be measurable against the backdrop of time, resources employed, and, above all, predetermined benchmarks.\n\nAnd one does not blame them because past speeches failed to lay emphasis on how their administrations have conquered, or will conquer, specific societal challenges such as increased employment rate, reduced inflation rate, reduced the mortality rate of mothers and children, elimination of common ailments such as malaria, availability of potable water in households, improved performance of school children at public examinations, reduced teacher/pupil ratio in public schools, the reduced crime rate among many others. It is only within these definable criteria that speeches are soul-lifting and roundly edifying.\n\n\n\nOnly then would hope and confidence be rekindled and restored amongst Nigerians who daily grapple with very harsh economic conditions. These correlations were missing in most past speeches, not because they could not be derived, but perhaps someone is not willing to face reality or is unwilling to conduct a basic survey to ascertain numerically the extent of improvement in the quantum of benefits that accrue to the people based of efforts exerted.\n\n\n\nSo one found greater efforts expended in written speeches than on the works that should make the speeches credible.\n\nGovernor Udom Emmanuel\u2019s speech was also apt and elevating in that it dealt with two primary issues that impinge on our growth as a people. First, it said clearly that one of Akwa Ibom\u2019s major challenges is industrialization which when achieved would, among other things, translate to more employment opportunities, reduced capital flight, and a robust transactional economy with an attendant boost in GDP. He gave an account of his efforts, so far, at surmounting this challenge.\n\nSecond, he took a kaleidoscopic view of the future and sought to generate discourse on the subject of future leaders of our dear State. He reminded us of a serious aspect of the State\u2019s life where serious attention if neglected, could be self-destructive. That is the qualifications and attributes of the next governor after him.\n\n\n\nThat was bold as he gave very emphatic prescriptions and sounded a note of advice (some could say warning) on what to look out for in the next governor; the values that must accompany the would-be occupant of the exalted office. For if the occupant does not possess these attributes, he will not be able to reposition Akwa Ibom State along the lines of well-defined core values let alone accelerate the pace of what he is currently doing to re-define the content of the State\u2019s economy. Let me quote a segment of his speech:\n\n\u2026..do you desire a successor with a known e-mail address\n\nthat the international business community recognizes.\n\nDo you want a leader who will fritter away our commonwealth\n\nin search of cheap popularity or one who would utilize the\n\nResource and continue investing in projects with enduring values\u2026\n\nThe imports of these lines are that the governor was talking about fellow Akwa Ibomites who have laudable principles and are capable of meeting the requirements adumbrated by His Excellency. People of high net worth integrity who would not define governance from a narrow and jaundiced prism of me, and myself. People with large hearts would give the generality of Akwa Ibom people the freedom to compete for opportunities within the system.\n\nHe wishes for someone who is not a stranger to the international business community in a digitized, globalized, and highly integrity-minded world. He leveraged on someone who has proved his mettle in several world outings and would not for any reason compromise his hard-earned reputation but rather would place it as collateral while negotiating collaborations and partnerships on behalf of the State. One who has managed multi-billion dollar budgets and is astute enough to navigate his way through an infinitely changing world economic order to the benefit of the State.\n\nThe keywords here are TRUST and INTEGRITY within and beyond our borders. The governor was making a clarion call for someone whose reign as governor would not change anything about him because he has nothing more to prove. One whose current lifestyle won\u2019t change merely because he is governor. An Investor friendly person whose words one can take to the bank once uttered.\n\n\n\nHe was short of saying that we should not risk the management of our resources in the hands of chameleons; people who masquerade just to enter the office only to turn monsters thereafter and gamble with Akwa Ibom people. To Mr. Udom Emmanuel, having someone of such towering integrity would fast-track interaction between local investors and the State, on the one hand, and easily lubricate international business transactions that would increase the quantum of private sector funds, both local and foreign direct investments, in the State. That we do not want people who would come to launder their image at the plaza, or anywhere else, in want of cheap popularity in the name of \u201cono mkpo owo\u201d.\n\nSummarily put, the Governor is asking the people of Akwa Ibom State to search for a next governor who will leverage on the well-known core values that over the years have stood Akwa Ibom out as a sought after trademark \u2013 hard work, integrity, perseverance, and the belief in rewards that commensurate these time tested irreducible minima. In short, he set the tone for those who aspire for the coveted office to first examine themselves and see if they are worthy of this \u2018communion cup\u2019, and for the public to judge by standards that would deposit enduring legacies in our quest to set ourselves apart as a destination of choice for all what is good.\n\nSomeone may ask: who is Udom Emmanuel to seek to dominate the political sphere with a political philosophy? Why can\u2019t he just finish his tenure and leave us to figure out our next steps? Well, Udom Emmanuel is a leader. Every good leader should, according to John Maxwell, \u201cknow the way, go the way, and show the way\u201d. He showed the way.\n\nThe question on the lips of Akwa Ibom people, who worry about our tomorrow, now is who could such a person be? Among the lots jostling for this position, do we have anyone with these \u2018tall\u2019 credentials? My answer is yes we do, they are many.\n\n\n\nThe choice of leaders is not usually a mean task. Each time God wanted to pick leaders for His people, He went the extra mile to select, not necessarily among the presumed best by human calculations, but by criteria that awe man\u2019s presumptions. Take Moses, Joseph, David, and Elisha; who usually emerge is a \u2018forgotten one\u2019 at the seaside, one \u2018sold to slavery\u2019 in the house of Potiphar, one \u2018in the bush\u2019 quietly tending after the father\u2019s sheep, or one \u2018dutiful enough\u2019 to watch when the master will be taken up.\n\nThese metaphors go beyond grandstanding loud noise and touch at the very root of what leadership stands for \u2013 service. In each of the examples cited above, God rooted for someone who would render service to His people. It will be a disservice to Akwa Ibomites, living and yet to be born, if we continue to bask in the absurdities that characterize politics in our society while our people suffer want and deprivation in the hands of those whose claim to altruistic tendencies are at best tenuous.\n\nWe must look far and think deep lest we falter and set the hand of the clock backward for leadership is everything and the lack of it brings sorrows to a people. The Governor has set the tone as a good leader. We must pick up the gauntlet from this pleasant axis and run with it. Indeed, a good speech.\n\n*Etokowo Owoh is a Management Consultant and Public Policy Analyst.",

          "text": "By Moses Emorinken, Abuja\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has validated China\u2019s Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine, otherwise known as CoronaVac for emergency use.\n\nIt noted that aside from having easy storage requirements, the vaccine has an efficacy of preventing symptomatic disease in 51 percent of those vaccinated, and prevented severe COVID-19 and hospitalisation in 100 percent of the studied population.\n\nThe WHO therefore recommended the vaccine for use in adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule with a spacing of two to four weeks.\n\nIt, however, does not recommend it for the upper age limit (60 years and above).\n\nIt urged countries using the vaccine in older age groups to conduct safety and effectiveness monitoring to verify the expected impact and contribute to making the recommendation more robust for all countries.\n\nAccording to a statement by the United Nations global health body, \u201cThe WHO today validated the Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, giving countries, funders, procuring agencies and communities the assurance that it meets international standards for safety, efficacy and manufacturing. The vaccine is produced by the Beijing-based pharmaceutical company Sinovac.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe WHO Assistant-Director General for Access to Health Products, Dr Mari\u00e2ngela Sim\u00e3o, according to the statement, said: \u201cThe world desperately needs multiple COVID-19 vaccines to address the huge access inequity across the globe.\n\n\u201cWe urge manufacturers to participate in the COVAX Facility, share their knowhow and data and contribute to bringing the pandemic under control.\u201d\n\nWHO\u2019s Emergency Use Listing (EUL) is a prerequisite for COVAX Facility vaccine supply and international procurement. It also allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe statement added: \u201cThe EUL assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as risk management plans and programmatic suitability, such as cold chain requirements. The assessment is performed by the product evaluation group, composed by regulatory experts from around the world and a Technical Advisory Group (TAG), in charge of performing the risk-benefit assessment for an independent recommendation on whether a vaccine can be listed for emergency use and, if so, under which conditions.\n\n\u201cIn the case of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine, the WHO assessment included on-site inspections of the production facility.\n\n\u201cThe Sinovac-CoronaVac product is an inactivated vaccine. Its easy storage requirements make it very manageable and particularly suitable for low-resource settings.\n\n\u201cWHO\u2019s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) has also completed its review of the vaccine. On the basis of available evidence, WHO recommends the vaccine for use in adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule with a spacing of two to four weeks. Vaccine efficacy results showed that the vaccine prevented symptomatic disease in 51 percent of those vaccinated and prevented severe COVID-19 and hospitalization in 100 percent of the studied population.\n\n\u201cFew older adults (over 60 years) were enrolled in clinical trials, so efficacy could not be estimated in this age group. Nevertheless, WHO is not recommending an upper age limit for the vaccine because data collected during subsequent use in multiple countries and supportive immunogenicity data suggest the vaccine is likely to have a protective effect in older persons. There is no reason to believe that the vaccine has a different safety profile in older and younger populations. WHO recommends that countries using the vaccine in older age groups conduct safety and effectiveness monitoring to verify the expected impact and contribute to making the recommendation more robust for all countries.\u201d",

          "text": "By Nduka Chiejina (Assistant Editor)\n\nThe federal government has attributed the improved economic performance of the country to the positive growth recorded in 23 out of 46 sectors in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, said this during her presentation of the first quarter of 2021 gross domestic product (GDP) results and other performance indicators of Nigeria at the Federal Executive Council (FEC).\n\nAccording to her, \u201cthere is a further illustration that the slow, but gradual recovery process is indicative of the fact that business operations are returning to normal and that restrictions of movements and commercial activities have been relaxed after extended closedown in the year 2020.\n\n\u201cThe agricultural sector posted a strong growth at the rate of 2.28 percent in the first quarter of 2021, compared to previous quarters. This growth in agriculture signifies the resilience of the agricultural sector,\u201d she stated.\n\nShe further stated that, \u201cthe industrial sector recorded positive growth, even though a weak one, but the growth is a positive one.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cServices recorded a slight dip, but a small one at 0.39 percent.\u201d\n\nThe finance minister also noted that the recent growth, \u201cwas boosted, by increase in crude oil prices as well as increase in production in the first quarter of 2020.\u201d\n\nIn her words, \u201cwe have seen this positive growth being contributed by not just the oil sector, but also by economic activities within the metal sector, the cement sector, electricity, telecommunications, food and beverages as well as human health and social services.\u201d\n\nHowever, \u201csome sectors recorded negative growth and these sectors include quarrying and other minerals, oil refinery, road transport, air transport, rail transport, education, as well as hotel that is accommodation and food services,\u201d she explained.\n\nWith regards to inflation, Zainab Ahmed stated that \u201cthroughout 2020 and even three quarters, a year before 2020, inflation had maintained an upward trend but for the first time in 19 months, inflation has shown a slight dip. It is a very slight dip, but it is a positive point for us.\u201d\n\nSubsequently, she projected that government is \u201clooking at inflation beginning to trend downwards. Food inflation will not come down as fast as the other aspects of inflation, but it is important to also see that the rate of food inflation also showed a slight dip.\u201d\n\nAccording to her \u201camidst the global pandemic, which is gradually improving, the return of international trade, recovery in oil prices and successful vaccination programmes across the world are contributing to favourable results in most economies.\u201d",

The former president, who expressed his worries that Nigerians usually perform- \u201cfantastically well\u201d outside the shores of the country, but seem to be under-performing when they are in the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs of today, we have five Nigerians directly running international organisations and running them very well, and one or two at the number two level.\n\n\u201cWe have Akin Adesina running the African Development Bank (AfDB); we have Benedict Oramah running the Afrexim Bank; we have Mohammed Barkindo running the OPEC; we have my sister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, running the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and we have Amina Mohammed who, I think, celebrated her 60th birthday, yesterday or day before yesterday, who is number two in the United Nations (UN). These are things that should give hope and encouragement for the future.\n\n\u201cThe point is that, if these people are here in Nigeria, if you hear of them at all, we would have shackled them and made it impossible for them to perform as they are performing outside.\n\n\u201cAnd each of these people that I have mentioned are doing fantastically well. We even have Ambassador Bankole Adeoye, who just took over as the Commissioner for Political Affairs and Peace and Security (PAPS) of the AU.\n\n\u201cSo, why are they doing well there while we are not doing well here? Something must be wrong, we should be interrogating this, what should we do? What we should do is to put our house in order, and we can put our house in order.\u201d\n\nWhile lamenting the 14 million out-of-school children in the country, Obasanjo urged the leadership of the country to ensure education is provided for the children, saying \u201cotherwise, Nigeria is breeding future Boko Haram.\u201d\n\nHe added that education must take the forefront in order to put Nigeria on the right footing.\n\n\u201cMy prayer is that all of us, particularly, in this country and now, will have something to contribute to make this country what God has created it to be; a land flowing with milk and honey.

          "text": "The suspended Senior Special Assistant to the Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun, Mr Abidemi Rufai, caught in $350,000 wire fraud, may forfeit his bail as the United State authorities said he would escape to Nigeria if granted bail and his extradition would be difficult.\n\nThe Acting US Attorney, Tessa Gorma, stated this while asking a district judge to reverse a bail earlier granted to Rufai by a magistrate judge.\n\nThe authorities argued that Rufai presents an extreme risk of flight and \u201cif he does escape to Nigeria, extradition will be extraordinarily difficult or impossible because of his ties to the Nigerian government.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is well known that extradition from Nigeria to the United States is difficult under the best of circumstances. That will be exacerbated in this case because of the strong political connections that earned Rufai a governmental appointment,\u201d Gorma said.\n\nDespite his alleged involvement in $350,000 fraud, Rufai said through his lawyer that he was a man of integrity.\n\nResponding to the government\u2019s appeal on why he should be released on bail, his lawyer, Lance Hester, told the court in Tacoma that his client has a good character, which facilitated his appointment as governor\u2019s aide.\n\nThe reply was filed on June 1, 2021. See Also Sahara Reporters Ogun Governor, Abiodun Suspends Aide Arrested In US Over N158million Fraud\n\n\u201c\u2026Mr Rufai\u2019s status as Nigerian National should not weigh heavily in favour of pretrial detention but rather, militate in favor of pretrial release. As the government concedes, Mr. Rufai holds a distinguished Governmental position in his home.\n\n\u201cIt goes without saying that only an individual of high moral character and integrity could achieve such a distinguished governmental appointment,\u201d Hester argued for his client in a court filing obtained by Premium Times on Thursday.\n\nSaharaReporters had on May 18 reported that Rufai faces up to 30 years in prison if he is convicted of wire fraud.\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Justice, wire fraud is punishable by up to 30 years in prison regarding benefits paid in connection with a presidentially declared disaster or emergency, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. See Also Sahara Reporters Suspended Governor Abiodun's Aide Faces 30 Years In United States Jail Over $350,000 Fraud\n\nRufai, who served as the Deputy Director-General of the Dapo Abiodun Campaign Organisation in the last governorship election in the state, was arrested on Friday at the JFK Airport in New York, the United States of America, on a criminal complaint of wire fraud for his scheme to steal over $350,000 in unemployment benefits from the Washington State Employment Security Department, the acting US Attorney, Tessa M. Gorman, announced.\n\nRufai, aka Sandy Tang, 42, of Lekki, Lagos, made his initial appearance in court on Saturday, May 15, 2021, in New York.\n\n\"Since the first fraud reports to our office in April 2020, we have worked diligently with a federal law enforcement team to track down the criminals who stole funds designated for pandemic relief. This is the first, but will not be the last, significant arrest in our ongoing investigation of the ESD fraud,\" Gorman had said.\n\nThe criminal complaint alleges that Rufai used the stolen identities of more than 100 Washington residents to file fraudulent claims with the ESD for pandemic-related unemployment benefits.\n\nHe was alleged to have also filed fraudulent unemployment claims with Hawaii, Wyoming, Massachusetts, Montana, New York and Pennsylvania. He used variations of a single email address in a manner intended to evade automatic detection by fraud systems.\n\nUsing this practice, Rufai allegedly made it appear that each claim was connected with a different email account.\n\nThe US Department of Justice stated on its website that Rufai caused the fraud proceeds to be paid out to online payment accounts such as 'Green Dot' accounts or wired to bank accounts controlled by 'money mules'. Some of the proceeds were then mailed to the Jamaica, New York address of Rufai's relative.

          "text": "\u201cWhat does it take to create Unicorns in Africa?\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the journey started with this question. Back then, eCommerce giant Jumia, South Africa\u2019s Promasidor Holdings and Cell C were the only Unicorns from Africa.\n\nToday, the story is different, there are five unicorns in Africa.\n\nCoined in 2013 by venture capitalist Aileen Lee, a unicorn is any private startup company started after 2003 that is valued at more than $1 billion. Lee chose the magic valuation number of $1 billion because it suggests that a company has either disrupted the market or created a new market.\n\nMeanwhile, the increase in the number of unicorns in Africa might seem like progress. It\u2019s only a small fraction of the number of unicorns in the world and in other countries.\n\nAccording to CBInsights, as of May 2021, there were more than 600 unicorns around the world. India has about 100 unicorns, China has 162 unicorns while the US has almost 300 unicorns.\n\nMost unicorns come from outside the African continent because the startup scene in Africa is still growing.\n\nTo accelerate this growth, in 2017, Unicorn Group, a pan-African investment company, set out to create a systematic approach to discover and produce unicorns on the continent. The unicorn team is led by Dr Akintoye Akindele with support from members like Dr Wura Abiola, Kola Abiola, Olatutu Sholeye, Yomi Akapo, Prof Cesar Baena, Mark White, Akudo Nweke, Kunle Soriyan and Dr Ponmile Osibo. The team travelled around the world studying different tech ecosystems to learn about what makes a unicorn and to create a playbook for the African tech ecosystem.\n\nThe wife of the Lagos state governor, Joke Sanwo-Olu at the event\n\nOn the 2nd of June, 2021 Unicorn Group held an event for the official launch of its Lagos campus. A number of distinguished dignitaries were present.\n\nTimipre Sylva Minister of State for Petroleum Resources; Lagos state governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu represented by his wife Joke Sanwo-Olu; Engr Simbi Wabote Exec. sec. Nigerian Content Development monitoring board and Mr Osh Agabi CEO Koniku. The vice-chancellors of Lagos State University and Obafemi Awolowo University, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe and Prof Eyitope Ogunbodede, respectively, were also in attendance.\n\nA group picture of the invited dignitaries\n\nUnicorn Group\u2019s ecosystem approach\n\nAt this event, the Unicorn Group shared its multifaceted approach to creating more unicorns in Africa.\n\nThis approach is made up of programs developed for startups and early-stage companies, campuses built across Africa to bridge the gap of inadequate infrastructure, advisers for the startups and partnerships with leading global organisations.\n\nThe five-step program caters to businesses at any stage. The first step is the Idea Lab, a program targeted at people with business ideas. The Idea Lab will run for a maximum of six months.\n\nThe Hub program is the second step, it\u2019s for businesses with a viable product. It\u2019ll run for a maximum of 12 months.\n\nThe third step is the incubator program for businesses with existing commercial products with market acceptance. It\u2019ll run for a maximum duration of two years.\n\nThe fourth and fifth programs are the Accelerator and the growth & scale program which are designed for established and profitable businesses.\n\nThe programs would run concurrently. Intentionally, its Lagos campus which is housed in a five story building is built in such a way that each floor caters for each step of the program.\n\nDr Akintoye Akindele, Chairman of Unicorn Group\n\nUnicorn Group has campuses in Lagos, Nairobi, Johannesburg and Accra. A fifth campus in Marrakesh is slated to open in 2022.\n\nWhat sets the Unicorn Group\u2019s approach apart from others? Ponmile Osibo, Chief investor relations officer told TechCabal, that for the Unicorn Group, it\u2019s beyond investing just money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible to give someone money and it disappears. We\u2019ve come to understand that companies need access to a wide range of support.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack then in 2017, there was no path to becoming a unicorn. There are different types of business models. There are businesses that should monetize from the get go and those who should gain traction first before monetization. There\u2019s no African playbook for this.\u201d\n\nFor any investment company, the end goal is to get a good return on investment (ROI). The investment in creating five campuses amongst other things is an enormous upfront provision of capital. I asked Osibo how they plan to recoup its investment.\n\n\u201cAt some stages, we collect equity in exchange for the capital and support we give these companies but for us, it\u2019s even bigger than that,\u201d He said.\n\nThe bigger picture for the Unicorn Group is the impact it\u2019ll have on the economy. He said, \u201cThink about it, we\u2019ve found out that the average small business hires five people. If we\u2019re able to empower about 200,000 businesses that\u2019s a minimum of 1 million additional jobs that won\u2019t have existed. Think of the ripple effect on the economy.\u201d",

          "title": "Can TalentQL\u2019s six-month program fill Africa\u2019s need for senior developers?",
          "text": "Adewale Yusuf, the founder and former publisher of Techpoint, made what many saw as a bold move last year.\n\nNot only did he swap the uncertainty of tech media for the vulnerability of founding a tech startup, he chose Ile-Ife, a town 200 km removed from the chaos of Lagos, as the \u201cquiet location\u201d for his new adventure.\n\nYusuf, along with one Jobberman co-founder and a couple other people, started TalentQL, an outsourcing firm for companies in need of quality software developers.\n\n\u201cHire top vetted technical talent across Africa quickly and seamlessly,\u201d their website says. Part of the plan was to produce talents by building campuses that house co-working spaces, with dependable electricity and Internet.\n\nOf course this is no longer a novel startup idea. Indeed it might appear late in the day to be getting into the \u201ctech talent matching\u201d game. Andela, one might say, has been there, done that. There probably isn\u2019t much mineral left in that mine.\n\nBut Yusuf thinks there is and has garnered resources to explore the endless possibilities that exist in the ecosystem. They launched last November with $300,000 seed money from Zedcrest Capital, Kola Aina of Ventures Platform and Prosper Otemuyiwa, a co-founder at Eden. In March this year, they got accepted into Techstars Toronto.\n\nFun fact: Over 70% of @TalentQL's African clients are Fintech companies.\n\nWe've placed CTO/Technical Lead in over 50% of them. \u2014 Adewale Yusuf (@AdewaleYusuf_) May 28, 2021\n\nYusuf is \u201cconvinced that what we are doing at TalentQL will change the African talent landscape. We believe that talent is Africa\u2019s greatest export and as such needs to be developed and refined.\u201d\n\nAll well and good. But what kind of talent are we exporting and why does it need to be refined? The answer has come nearly eight months after launch.\n\nMeet \u201cPipeline by TalentQL\u201c\n\nThis week, TalentQL has announced a \u201cspecialised training program for Software Engineers in Africa.\u201d It is coolly named Pipeline by TalentQL.\n\nThe program is for mid-level African software engineers, defined by TalentQL as those with three years work experience. In six intensive months, each of them will access \u201cadvanced resources\u201d and will be mentored by top senior software engineers working in global organisations like Twitter, Tesla, Gitlab, Amazon and Google.\n\nAccording to Yusuf, the program is necessary because up to 90% of TalentQL\u2019s clients want senior software engineers. Africa may have about 700,000 professional software developers but many are not experienced enough to meet global demand.\n\nThat\u2019s a familiar line for anyone who has followed Andela\u2019s story. Once the poster child of African tech for organising bootcamps that churned out junior developers at no initial cost, Andela hit the reality-check button in September 2019.\n\nFor a period of nine months to May 2020, Andela laid off more than 500 junior to mid level developers as they trimmed down to focus on senior talent. They have now expanded their talent pool to include Latin America to more ably serve the senior talent need that Africa alone cannot solve.\n\nOn one hand, TalentQL\u2019s Pipeline is a welcome plan to plug the experience gap in Africa by upskilling mid-level engineers. Yusuf insists Pipeline isn\u2019t for juniors \u2013 while the likes of Decagon and Semicolon serve as entry points for novices.\n\nTalentQL\u2019s promise with the program is that those who participate can expect to gain skills that will make them highly valued by employers. In addition to technical competence, Pipeline participants will be taught important soft skills.\n\nTheir mission comes from a good place but will it work?\n\nSenior developers are not a monolith\n\nTo get a sense of what to expect from Pipeline, I asked Sheriff Shittu, who runs a platform for developers seeking jobs, for his thoughts. His first inquiry was to know if the intensive program will involve live projects.\n\nWhile a training can make developers more knowledgeable, it may not immediately translate to experience and readiness for senior roles.\n\nBut \u201cif I work on high-impact fast live projects, my growth will be faster than someone who lets on select projects for two years,\u201d Shittu says.\n\nFor a senior developer at a Nigerian fintech, these four pillars are necessary for maturity: communication, problem solving, mentorship abilities, and ownership.\n\n\u201cI have been a good communicator from day one of my job, but my problem-solving abilities were not as good as they are now. If you become good at solving problems independently then you can take ownership.\u201d\n\nDoes he think Pipeline\u2019s six-month program will get mid-level devs to the senior ladder? \u201cIt depends, people are different.\u201d\n\nInviting similar upskilling initiatives\n\nKeeping both options in view, it is possible for TalentQL to achieve its purpose with this program if it meets a threshold for practicality and participants can meaningfully accelerate their communication and problem solving expertise.\n\nThe other implication is that Pipeline won\u2019t be open to just any mid-level engineer who has worked for three years.

          "text": "A tweet by Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria\u2019s president, that seemed to imply certain people in the country will be dealt with violently caused a stir on Tuesday evening.\n\nAlmost immediately, there were calls for Buhari\u2019s tweet to be removed from the social media platform.\n\nTwitter answered that call on Wednesday afternoon. The tweet was part of a thread in which Buhari expressed displeasure at \u201cattacks on critical national infrastructure,\u201d including on facilities belonging to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nBuhari\u2019s deleted tweet was widely criticised as summoning the ghosts of the Nigeria civil war, a deadly three-year combat between the Nigerian government and a government in southeast Nigeria, which had seceded from the republic.\n\nThe Biafra war, as it is alternatively called, led to the death of nearly 1 million people, according to various accounts.\n\nWhile he may have intended to send a strong message against recent vandalism in the southeast supposedly led by the Indigenous People of Biafra, a proscribed militant group, Buhari\u2019s comment was interpreted as an affront and a threat to people in the region.\n\n\u201cMany of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War,\u201d the tweet read.\n\n\u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.\u201d\n\nThe controversial tweet was from what Buhari said in a televised meeting with the leadership of INEC. He did not seem to be reading from a script, according to a video recording.\n\nTwitter had never deleted tweets by the Nigerian president before. Given that Nigeria is the platform\u2019s biggest market in Africa, it marks a new paradigm in the role it plays shaping civic spaces and citizen-government relations in Africa.\n\nTwitter may have been nudged to take action on Buhari\u2019s tweet following complaints by multiple accounts. Peoples\u2019 Gazette, an online publication on political affairs, reports that Twitter initially said Buhari\u2019s tweet did not violate its policies but reversed itself later.\n\nIn a statement to TechCabal, Twitter said the tweet \u201cwas in violation of the Twitter Rules. The account owner will be required to delete the violative Tweet and spend 12 hours with their account in read-only mode.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Lai Mohammed, Nigeria\u2019s information minister, has accused Twitter of not being clear in its standard for deleting tweets, implying the US company has a longstanding bias against the Nigerian government.\n\n\u201cThe mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very very suspect,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\n\u201cHas Twitter deleted the violent tweets that Nnamdi Kanu has been sending? The same Twitter that was funding #ENDSARS protesters\u2026 When people were burning Police stations and killing policemen, for Twitter it was about the right to protest. But when a similar thing happened at the [US] Capitol, it became an insurrection.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwitter\u2019s mission in Nigeria, citing those two examples, is very suspect. What is their agenda?\u201d\n\nLast October, Twitter became the platform where the world learned much about END SARS protests in Nigeria. Jack Dorsey, the company\u2019s CEO, expressed solidarity in a couple of tweets. But it is not clear that the company funded protesters in the way the minister alleges.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, says it\u2019s been a real struggle getting the app to function properly across devices.\n\nAccording to WABetaInfo, on June 3, 2021, Zuckerberg said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a big technical challenge to get all your messages and content to sync properly across devices even when your phone battery dies, but we\u2019ve solved this and we\u2019re looking forward to getting it out soon!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not all that\u2019s coming to the app. The CEO also revealed a \u2018view once\u2019 feature which will let users send pictures and videos that disappear after they have been viewed.\n\nWhen are these features coming? Though there is no launch date for these features, Zuckerberg hints at some time within the next two months.\n\nTesla for Africa might be getting closer\n\nBe it self-driving or battery-powered, bringing an electric vehicle to African roads is a challenge for obvious reasons: the state of the roads and a lack of electricity. But some local entrepreneurs have not only actualised this but incorporated the continent\u2019s flair.\n\nFrom electric delivery tricycles used by Kibanda to Siltech\u2019s electric bikes and Jet Motor Company\u2019s cars, an African Tesla could be closer than we think.\n\nTechpoint Africa visited Tolulope Williams, a legal practitioner turned EV engineer, and he detailed his story on how a love for motorbikes gave birth to an EV assembly company.\n\nRead his engaging discussion with our Senior Reporter, Emmanuel Paul, here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter launches premium subscription service\n\nTwitter launched its premium subscription service, Twitter Blue, on June 3, 2021.

          "text": "Kibanda TopUp, a Kenyan startup which aims at digitising the food supply chain for micro, small, and medium restaurants in Africa has closed a $460k pre-seed round to increase its customer base.\n\nThe round was led by US-based JAM Fund, with the participation of mPharma\u2019s CEO, Gregory Rockson; Flutterwave\u2019s CEO, Olugbenga GB Agboola; Alarko Ventures\u2019 Managing Partner, Cem Garih; and several angel investors.\n\nThe involvement of local investors like Rockson and Agboola continues a growing trend of African investment in early-stage startups.\n\nLaunched in February 2021 by Co-founders, Njavwa Mutambo and Emilie Blauwhoff, Kibanda delivers goods directly to restaurants via electric tricycles assembled in Nairobi by its partner, ARC Ride.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCustomers can order inventory such as grains, beverages, poultry, and beef via app or SMS and receive their order the next day.\n\nSince launch, the startup has reportedly served 130 restaurants \u2014 announcing restaurant 100 on May 31, 2021 \u2014 and plans to use the funding to hire critical team members in engineering and supply chain who will enable fast growth and development of additional products.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Tony Elumelu Foundation of which he is an alumnus, Mutambo revealed plans to expand to Lagos.\n\n\u201cWe are increasing restaurants\u2019 contributions to Africa\u2019s GDP by helping reduce cost with the supply chain. We are doubling down on our efforts in Kenya and our next location is Lagos \u2013 the reason being that we have to be where the majority of restaurants are, and Nigeria has a large number of these informal restaurants.\u201d says Mutambo\n\nKibanda faces the problem of solving issues around logistics and transport. To address the challenge of transportation costs, the company uses electric tricycles Kenya leading to a reduction in cost by 25%.\n\nWith plans to expand into other countries, this might pose a challenge of scalability especially in countries where it might not be able to use this to its advantage.\n\nMutambo is an experienced hand in the logistics space having served as CEO of Musanga Logistics \u2014 a Zambia-based Software as a Service (SaaS) platform connecting shippers and carriers in real time \u2014 and Global Lead for Product Operations at Lori Systems \u2014 an e-logistics company in Kenya.\n\nBased on Blauwhoff\u2019s skills in entrepreneurial digital strategy and project management, and Mutambo\u2019s experience in logistics, Rockson expresses confidence in the founders\u2019 vision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLocal informal restaurants are the heart of social commerce in African neighbourhoods.

          "text": "Twitter has revealed plans to roll out Birdwatch as part of its efforts to combat misinformation on the platform.\n\nThe social media platform informed users in a tweet that they might see Tweets with Birdwatch notes across all devices.\n\nThe new feature, which is only available to a few pilot participants, requires users to add notes that provide more information to misleading tweets. A pilot version of the product was launched in January, with the social media giant calling it a community-based approach to misinformation.\n\nFinally, if all notes on a Tweet are \u201cCurrently not rated helpful,\u201d there won\u2019t be a card on the Tweet. You\u2019ll still be able to get to Birdwatch notes on that Tweet by clicking on the Birdwatch icon in the Tweet details page. pic.twitter.com/Ubf8qeAWxS Advertisement June 2, 2021\n\nIn a blog post explaining the new feature, Twitter\u2019s VP of Product, Keith Coleman, stated that the move was to \u201cbroaden the range of voices\u201d tackling misinformation.\n\nHow does Birdwatch work?\n\nThe Birdwatch feature comes with two notes: currently rated helpful and currently not rated helpful. Consequently, users can rate tweets displayed as the former to elevate the most helpful ones.\n\nHowever, if all notes on the tweet are currently rated not helpful, there won\u2019t be a card on the tweet, and users can still access the feature on that tweet by clicking on the icon.\n\nThe big picture\n\nJust last month, Facebook announced a new feature that would prompt users to read articles they intend to share. Twitter also released a similar feature last year that reminded users to read articles they were about to retweet.\n\nFacebook has also used the services of its Oversight Board to combat misleading information on the platform, with the board upholding Donald Trump\u2019s ban last month. Twitter\u2019s decision to launch Birdwatch is a different approach from Facebook\u2019s as it lets users decide.\n\nIt seems social media platforms are finally getting serious about combating misinformation but having released several features in the past with varying degrees of success; the jury is still out on these efforts.\n\nWhat should be the role of social media platforms?\n\nIn January, following tweets by former US President, Donald Trump, supporters of the president stormed the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of the election. Twitter subsequently suspended the President\u2019s account over claims that it incited violence.\n\nThis week, Twitter deleted a tweet by Nigerian President, Muhammadu Buhari, in which he referred to the Nigerian Civil War.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust like in Donald Trump\u2019s case, the move has faced criticism from different quarters. Critics see such interventions as a gag on free speech, although most social media platforms pride themselves as proponents of free expression.\n\nAs Top10VPN reports, sub-Saharan Africa lost $2.16 billion from the Internet or social media shutdowns in 2019. This could have severe economic repercussions.\n\nOn the other hand, victims of online abuse have consistently called on social media platforms to be proactive in combating issues, such as racism, which are frequently perpetrated on these platforms. In April, the English Premier League (EPL) organised a social media blackout to protest online abuse directed at players.\n\nAs social media platforms become more powerful, the question about whose responsibility it is to check abuse remains. Should governments be tasked with this responsibility, or should the platforms reserve that right?",

The Senate therefore deemed it important to create avenues for the involvement of the public\u201d.\n\n\u201cOur country has been consistently reminded that there are flaws in our constitution. There is a deep concern among legislators and other stakeholders, just as there are divergent opinions on what we should do to remedy it\u201d.\n\nLawan also noted that, \u201cthere are broad-ranging agitations and constitutional amendment proposals for devolving more powers to subnational governments, for resource control, greater representation and participation of women in governance and public life, return to the regional system of the post-independence era, creation of additional states and Local Government, enhanced residency and indigene rights, decentralized policing, and Local government autonomy, amongst others\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile we have identified certain items as thematic areas, we are still open to engagement on any other relevant proposal and we look forward to continuing discussions with stakeholders on all proposals in that regard\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is important to similarly note that agitations are democratic expressions and indications of dissatisfaction with our extant Constitution. Honestly engaging with each other, amid a good faith, is the best way forward\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, the National Assembly plays the underlying role of participatory democracy to replace representative democracy, but to supplement it and make it function better. Therefore, there are no preconceived decisions on the outcome of the process. The final product will be shaped by the voices of citizens as harnessed from the hearings.\n\n\u201cRegardless, the constitution review alone will not engender a successful democracy, without a concomitant shift in attitude and political will. It has to be backed by the requisite political will and the right attitude. Democracy demands the highest qualities of self-discipline, restraint, empathy, and the willingness to commit, concede and sacrifice for the general good\u201d, he added.\n\n...",

There is no need to have N12 trillion sitting in banks and not helping to activate the economy. I believe it\u2019s time for the Commission to get a lot more participatory. Yes, it\u2019s the people\u2019s fund and must be accounted for and provided, when needed.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t keep the money in banks and make the banks happy. We need to grow the economy. We have talked on how to utilize and channel funds to the real economy over the years, but it has not happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese funds should be channeled into the economy to build infrastructure and grow the economy,\u201d he added.\n\nReaffirming his administration\u2019s commitment to the welfare of workers and pensioners in the state, the governor noted, \u201cI am glad that we started the Contributory Pension Scheme in 2017 and now Edo State workers have seen the benefits of the scheme.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince the commencement of the scheme in 2017, benefits have been paid to the families of all those covered by the insurance scheme,\u201d he revealed.\n\nThe governor said his administration is undertaking an audit of the 18 Local Government Areas, adding, \u201cFor us, sustainability is key. We don\u2019t want to start something and stop it half way.\n\n\u201cWe need more sensitization on the Scheme to ensure it is accepted and appreciated totally. The local government is another tier of government that we don\u2019t have direct control over because they are independent. We don\u2019t keep their money, but can persuade and encourage; these we have tried in the past.\u201d\n\nHe further said, \u201cThe wage bill for pensioners in the state is quite heavy on the government. We are currently paying a huge sum in terms of pension payment. It\u2019s almost 50 per cent of our regular salary payment.\n\n\u201cFor us, the welfare of our civil servants is critical to us; that is why you will not see me with a long convoy. Instead, I will use that money to better the lives of Edo people and not use it to benefit some godfather. Thank God, we have victory in that area.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Emukowhate said the mandate of the PENCOM is to ensure that the lives of pensioners are made comfortable after retirement from service.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe commend you for embracing the process and enacting the Edo State Pension Reforms laws, commencing the implementation of CPS in 2017, setting up the Pension Bureau Board, registering employees with Pension fund administrators and remitting 10 per cent employers and 8 per cent employees contributions to the CPS, even as employers\u2019 verification exercise is ongoing.\n\n\u201cEdo State has a valid group life insurance. With these steps you have shown the people of the State that you are a governor who cares for them.\u201d\n\n...",

          "title": "Nigeria joins global partnership against forest destruction",
          "text": "Nigeria has expressed her commitment to the protection of forests and natural habitats from destruction, and promotion of sustainable trade and supply chains of agricultural commodities.\n\nThe country recently joined a total of 23 other nations across various continents to endorse a statement committing to working together towards achieving the targets.\n\nThe development was part of the outcome of the first ministerial meeting of the Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade (FACT) Dialogue.\n\nThe dialogue, which, according to a statement issued by the British Deputy High Commission in Nigeria, and signed by a press and public affairs officer, Ndidiamaka Eze, was launched in February as part of the United Kingdom\u2019s efforts to achieve united front in the fight against the destruction of the forests globally.\n\nOther countries on the list include; Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Denmark, France, Gabon, Ghana, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Liberia, and Malaysia.\n\nOthers are the Netherlands, Norway, Paraguay, Peru, Republic of Congo, Republic of Korea, Spain, United Kingdom, and Uruguay.\n\n\u201cThe landmark statement is the result of collaborative action on an issue that is complex but also critical to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and limiting a global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius,\u201d the statement states in part.\n\nStatistics\n\nAccording to the statement, international trade in agricultural commodities such as palm oil, soy and beef, is worth more than $80 billion per year.\n\n\u201cGlobally, 1.6 billion people depend on forests for their livelihoods, many of them in developing countries,\u201d the statement said, adding that; \u201cNigeria is a producer and consumer of forest risk agricultural commodities.\u201d\n\nIt said, Nigeria domestically produces cocoa and palm oil but also imports palm oil from Southeast Asia.\n\nForests are said to be the largest natural carbon sink and a vital harbour of biodiversity \u201cbut they are disappearing at an alarming rate.\u201d\n\nThe data provided by the high commissioner\u2019s office further says Nigeria has one of the highest deforestation rates globally, and she loses approximately 350,000 to 400,000 hectares per year.\n\n\u201cLogging, agriculture and collection of fuelwood are the leading causes of forest loss in Nigeria,\u201d Ms Eze stated.\n\nIntervention\n\nMeanwhile, the United Kingdom\u2019s government has reportedly expressed her desire to intensify partnership with Nigeria towards ensuring \u201can inclusive vision and effective action for sustainable agriculture, forests and land-use economy, as these areas have the potential to address major barriers to development around poverty, food and nutrition insecurity, unemployment, environmental degradation and instability.\u201d\n\nMs Eze noted that through programmes such as Investments in Forests and Sustainable Land-Use (IFSLU), the UK government is supporting a shift to sustainable supply chains for agricultural commodities associated with deforestation, including palm oil and cocoa, and creating new investment opportunities in sustainable land use through public-private partnerships.\n\n\u201cIFSLU has worked with Edo State\u2013 one of the major forest states in Nigeria, and a leading palm oil state. Edo State Government has committed to responsible oil palm production, becoming a member of the UK-funded Tropical Forest Alliance 2020 (TFA 2020) Africa Palm Oil Initiative (APOI) in May 2018 and the UK-led Just Rural Transition in September 2019,\u201d the statement said.\n\nSpeaking on the joint statement, Ms Eze said the President-Designate of the forthcoming UN climate change conference COP26 to be hosted by the UK, Alok Sharma, said: \u201cThe FACT Dialogue has much work ahead to deliver on its objectives as we move towards COP26. But the publication of today\u2019s joint statement marks a highly important first step in laying the foundation for our work.\n\n\u201cTo have brought so many countries together, both producers and consumers, and to plan a way forward on sustainable trade is a fantastic start. I am confident that this is just the beginning as we work to protect trade and development, and our biodiversity-rich forests, in equal measure.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing, reportedly added that; \u201cIn Nigeria, the UK is working with the Federal Government, the private sector and with local communities across the country to promote investment in climate-smart practices and business models that will help reduce emissions, increasing productivity and build climate resilience.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s active engagement in the COP26 FACT Dialogue and their endorsement of the joint statement is very welcome. We look forward to more collaborations like this as we continue to work together towards a common goal of sustainably producing agricultural commodities.\u201d\n\nThe joint statement, Ms Eze said, outlines a set of collaborative principles as well as areas of common purpose and action. \u201cThese include four areas; Trade and Market Development; Smallholder Support; Transparency and Traceability; Research, Development, and Innovation.\n\n\u201cThe statement also highlights international commitments and obligations to protect forests such as the Sustainable Development Goals (including Goal 15), the Paris Agreement, the Convention on Biological Diversity, and agreements under the World Trade Organisation.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s presidency has expressed disgust over an article in Foreign Affairs magazine that described the West African country as a failed state, with the federal government accusing the US-based magazine of spreading fake news.\n\nPresidential spokesman Garba Shehu in a statement late Thursday said the \u201clatest article on Nigeria in Foreign Affairs titled \u2018The Giant of Africa is Failing\u2019 is unfair both to a magazine with such an esteemed pedigree and to its readers.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian government\u2019s stance comes barely 24 hours after the federal government accused Twitter of having a hidden agenda about Nigeria after the social media giant deleted a \u201ccivil war\u201d post by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThat tweet by the Nigerian leader had been heavily criticised by citizens who were of the opinion that the posts were targeted at Igbos in the southeastern region of the country.\n\n\u201cThose of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand,\u201d the president wrote.\n\nThe article by Foreign affairs was co-authored by a former American ambassador to Nigeria, John Campbell, and another researcher, Robert Rotberg.\n\nThey had written that \u201cNigeria is in big trouble. If a state\u2019s first obligation to those it governs is to provide for their security and maintain a monopoly on the use of violence, then Nigeria has failed, even if some other aspects of the state still function.\u201d\n\nBut in a swift reaction, Mr Shehu, President Buhari\u2019s spokesman in the statement said, \u201cAmbassador Campbell has been predicting the collapse of Nigeria for several years. He is of course entitled to his opinions, even where events consistently prove him wrong.\u201d\n\nMr Shehu questioned the motive of the article when he claimed that the authors expressed distorted opinions by \u201cbending facts\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cBut facts should not be bent to support distorted opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me give you one example.\n\nThe authors write:\n\n\u2018At an April meeting with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Buhari reportedly requested that the headquarters of the U.S. Africa Command be moved from Germany to Nigeria so that it would be closer to the fight against jihadi groups in the country\u2019s north.\u2019\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari did not request that AFRICOM move to Nigeria. The transcript of the call with Secretary Blinken is available on the State Department\u2019s own website.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of the invented addition of \u2018to Nigeria\u2019 with regard to AFRICOM. It sums up a piece that attempts \u2013 subtly but revealingly \u2013 to shift facts to suit an argument.\n\n\u201cNigeria faces multiple challenges, not least of which is the dissemination of fake news and prejudiced opinion.\n\n\u201cThis is something we have come to expect from partisan blogs and politically motivated lobbies. It is still a surprise, and a disappointment, to see them joined by Foreign Affairs.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
