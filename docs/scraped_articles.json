          "title": "Again, bandits hit Niger, kill 30, Kaduna shuts phone services",
          "text": "The Kaduna State Government, as part of efforts to address rising insecurity in the state, has banned the use of motorcycles, popularly known as okada, for commercial and personal purposes.\n\nThe state also announced the shutdown of communication networks in some parts of the state beginning from Wednesday.\n\nThe state Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, disclosed these during a press conference in Kaduna on Wednesday, three days after bandits killed no fewer than 51 people in the southern part of the state.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, security experts warned that with the ban on okada in Kaduna and some northern states, the riders would migrate to other states.\n\nThe experts gave the warning as bandits killed no fewer than 30 people in Kachiwe and its adjourning villages in the Munya Local Government Area of Niger State on Tuesday evening.\n\nIn Kaduna, Aruwan while addressing journalists, said, \u201cRecall that Governor Nasir El-Rufai announced in a media chat yesterday ( September, 28, 2021) that the state government had formally requested the Federal Government to enforce the shutdown of telecom services in parts of the state identified by security agencies as requiring such measures.\n\n\u201cThe relevant federal agencies have today informed the Kaduna State Government that the processes for telecoms shutdown in parts of the state have commenced.\n\n\u201cAs part of the steps to address the current security situation in Kaduna State and neighbouring states in the North-West and North-Central, the state government has held several meetings with security agencies to adopt critical measures towards crushing bandits in their identified hideouts.\n\n\u201cThe military and other security forces have been carrying out assaults on the identified locations. The state government is advised that certain measures are now necessary to assist the spirited efforts of these security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe following measures become effective from Thursday, September, 30 2021; the complete ban on the use of motorcycles (okada), for commercial or personal purposes, for three months in the first instance; ban on possession of or wielding of dangerous weapons.\n\n\u201cTricycles are allowed to operate only from 6am to 7pm. All tricycles must remove all curtains. Movement of all tricycles is restricted from dusk till dawn (7pm to 6am).\n\n\u201cAll vehicles used for commercial transport must be painted yellow and black within 30 days. Vehicles that are part of ride-hailing services are to carry yellow and black stripes.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the ban on okada, a security expert and member of the International Institute of Professional Security in Nigeria, Jackson Lekan-Ojo, in an interview with The PUNCH, called on other state governors to emulate their Kaduna State counterpart.\n\nHe said, \u201cI applaud the Kaduna State governor on the ban. People may find it difficult to make up, but they should understand that the first thing is security.\n\n\u201cOne of the issues we are facing in this country is that when we wage war on insecurity, we attack from one corner. Only one part of the country gets the heat.\n\n\u201cA bandit that experiences fire in Kaduna will move to another state to perpetrate evil. Reports have shown that these people use motorcycles most of the time for criminal activities.\n\n\u201cNow that the Kaduna State governor has banned their operations, the next thing you will see is that most of them will start moving to Abuja, Nasarawa and Niger because there is no heat in these places. Before you know it, you will see them in Kogi, Ondo, Ekiti, Kwara, Edo and before you know it, God forbid, they take over the South-West.\u201d\n\nHe said with the ban, the Kaduna State Government had the responsibility to man boundaries to make sure that they do not migrate to other states.\n\nHe said other governors should also see the development as a wake-up call to ban them in their states.\n\nAnother security expert, Timothy Avele, said strict regulations should be put in place in southern states.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think the government is being reactive. Aside from banning okada and tricycles, there are reports of also shutting down telecommunication services like Zamfara State.\n\n\u201cFrom a general perspective, it is a good action. But from a professional security angle, it is like dressing a cancerous sore instead of treating it headlong.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that these reactive measures can\u2019t produce the desired results in the long run.\n\nExpert berates southern govs, says they\u2019re inactive\n\n\u201cThe southern governors sadly do not see what is happening in the northern part of the country as an immediate danger to their zone. I have yet to see any state in the South with concrete proactive security measures to counter the expected spillover of what is happening in the northern part. They are busy preparing for 2023\n\n\u201cHowever, I would rather suggest strict regulation and monitoring than sending them back altogether, except states that already have okada ban in place. Don\u2019t forget, there is no job anywhere.\n\n\u201cMore so, it is not the okada that makes crime increase, it is the lack of proper intelligence-based policing.\u201d\n\nAnother security expert, Commodore Abimbola Ayuba (retd.), said the southern governors should be on the alert.\n\nHe said, \u201cMotorcyclists are most times being used to perpetrate crime.\n\n\u201cThe government and the citizens have to be very vigilant and be more proactive in their dealings.\n\n\u201cSome states south have banned motorcycles, what they need to do is to ensure that the ban remains in force.\u201d\n\nBut a retired Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Austin Iwar, wondered if there was any study that showed that the motorcycle and tricycle riders contributed to crime spike in the country.\n\nHe argued, \u201cIn the first place, the governors brought the tricycles as part of empowerment. Has anyone carried out a study to show that the rising criminality was caused by tricycle riders and motorcyclists? Have the governors carried out a study to find out if these categories of people that they created contribute to crimes?\n\nInstead of banning them, Iwar said the activities of the riders should be properly regulated to generate revenue for the government.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhat you need is regulation and enforcement and a tricycle is a source of revenue for the government; licensing and contravention which can bring in a lot of revenue. The government needs to conduct a study to know the economic value of Okada and tricycles. I don\u2019t support the ban because they have economic and social values.\u201d\n\nA Security Risk Management Consultant, Kabir Adamu, said the ban could result in negative mobilisation and crimes in the concerned states, arguing that the issue could trigger a bigger problem.\n\nHe said, \u201cWhen you ban Okada, what options have you given them? If you don\u2019t give them a job, it means you are sending them back in to the pool from which those that are carrying out security challenges are recruiting from.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Kaduna, apart from bandits, we know there are criminal gangs, youth gangs that are quite active. There are also political leaders who engage youths for political violence. What it means is that you are sending these Okada riders into this pool and they can be easily recruited.\u201d\n\nHe advised southern states which might record influx of jobless youths from the north to engage in profiling of the riders.\n\nA security consultant, Mr Chidi Omeje, described the ban as a developmental issues, adding that the government must provide alternatives if it insisted on banning motorcycles and tricycles.\n\nHe noted, \u201cThese are some of the desperate measures that the chief executives of states who have challenge in governing their states deploy. If you are going to ban Ookada or Keke (tricycles) , what other alternatives do you have for the people? You are going to add to the hardship of the citizens and life would be much more terrible for the average Nigerians who have no cars and of course, there are no trains.\u201d\n\nOmeje explained that the ban would result in the influx of riders in the south, adding that the state governments in the region should ensure effective security measures.\n\nHe added, \u201cInflux of skada and keke riders to the south is one of the outcomes of this rash and brash decision. Nigerians are itinerant people; if you make lives difficult for them up north, the natural thing for them is to migrate down south.\u201d\n\nIn Benue State, the Officer in Charge of Operation in the state Police Command, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Ike Nwosu, in an interview with one of our correspondents said that the ban on okada riders from 8pm till 6am was still force. \u201cThe ban on Okada in Benue State in the night still in force\u201d, Nwosu said\n\nIn Ondo State, the state government said the ban on riding on motorcycles beyond 7pm was still subsisting .\n\nThe Special Adviser to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu on Security Matters, Alhaji Jimoh Dojumo, in an interview with The PUNCH, said the administration in the state was committed to the protection of lives and property.\n\nHe said, \u201c The ban on okada riding in the evening is still in force and we are not taking anything for granted in the area of security of people.\n\n\u201cLet any bandit bring okada to this state from anywhere, we are battle-ready for them. They will meet us here. The security of our people is paramount to us. \u201c\n\nOperations of commercial motorcycles and tricycles in Katsina State have been restricted. They are not allowed to operate from 10pm to 6am in Katsina, the state capital.\n\nIn Sokoto State, an official of the state government, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to speak to the media, stated that Governor Aminu Tambuwal\u2019s restriction on okada was in force.\n\nThe governor recently signed into law, Security Challenges (Containment) Order 3, 2021, prohibiting motorcycles operations from 10pm to 6am in the state capital, and 6pm to 6am in Gada, Goronyo, Gudu, Gwadabawa, Illela, Isa, Kebbe, Sabon Birni, Shagari, Rabah Tambuwal Tangaza, Tureta and Wurno local governments areas.\n\nIn River State, it was learnt that motorcycles and tricycles were not allowed to operate in Port Harcourt and Obio/Akpor local government areas.\n\nMotorcycles were banned from operating in the state capital during the tenure of former Governor Rotimi Amaechi on the grounds that they contributed to accidents witnessed in the state.\n\nThe state Government through the Commissioner for Transport, Osima Gina, in December 2020 began a clampdown on the operations of tricycles, saying the move was to forestall avoidable accidents.\n\nGina recalled that the state Governor Nyesom Wike had signed an Executive Order banning tricycles from operating on 19 major roads, noting that most of the road crashes in Port Harcourt were traceable to tricycle operations.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIn addition to that,you can see the increasing infrastructure being put in place by the governor in terms of roads and flyovers. So, there is a need to restore sanity on the roads.\u201d\n\nThe PUNCH gathered that Lagos State would soon get tough with okada riders.\n\nMotorcyclists had on September 23 went on the rampage killing a senior police officer, Chief Superintendent of Police, Kazeem Abonde attached to the Operations Department of the state police command.\n\nThe incident took place at Ajao Estate Junction Bus-Stop, Murtala Muhammed International Airport Road, when security agents were enforcing the ban on okada by the state government. ,,\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "APC needs a computerized membership database, says PGF DG",
          "text": "By Omeiza Ajayi, Abuja\n\nDirector General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum PGF, Salihu Moh. Lukman has asked his ruling All Progressives Congress APC to embark on the collation of an electronically based data of all members of the party across the country.\n\nDescribing the project as capable of repositioning the party, Lukman said a reliable membership database is at the soul of political party management.\n\nThe PGF DG made his position known while featuring on a programme on he African Independent Television AIT, \u2018Jigsaw\u2019 monitored Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nHe said; \u201cI believe as a party, immediately after the Convention, the first thing the new leadership should do is to have a membership database that is computerized. We cannot continue to have a situation where our membership data is not electronically preserved. We must ensure that our membership data is updated electronically without the tedious process of handling it in an analogue way.\n\n\u201cSecondly, we must have a national database because membership is everything to a political party. A situation where the administrative framework of the national secretariat is so weak and loose that it has no link to what is obtainable at the local government and state levels, creates its own complications. So, the first thing the new leadership must do is to reorganize the national secretariat in such a way that it has that organic relation between it and all the structures of the party so that at the ward level, even if somebody leaves the party, it will be immediately known by the national leadership, and if somebody joins the party, he should be quietly registered at the ward without the noise in the media, it should be seamless.\u201d\n\nAPC had in late 2014 attempted to have an electronic database of its members, but the move was halted after operatives of the State Security Services SSS invaded the facility on suspicion that the then opposition party was using the building to illegally produce Permanent Voter Cards PVCs.\n\nLukman also spoke on the internal crisis that has rocked the party insisting that it is not a problem experienced only by the APC, adding that as a convergence of people from diverse backgrounds and interests, there are bound to be minor disagreements which do not necessarily mean that the party will implode.\n\n\u201cIt is important to return to the basic framework that every party is an organization that has various interests. It is difficult to have a political party where people do not have diverse interests. But the most important is to have and build a party where the aggregation of the various interests will be able to win the mandate.\n\n\u201cThe major issue is that even before the merger, there was the notion that parties do not have the power to win the confidence of the people as it were. I also do not think that while negotiating for the merger, nobody believed it was going to be a party that can appeal to everybody. Even some people in the merger had sympathy for the PDP then.\n\n\u201cOne basic issue is the need to have strong point about the need to institute reconciliation within the party. The major issue is that you can\u2019t have a political party without a credible membership register. Good enough, the Caretaker Committee bought that idea and we have done it and that is the basis of the new book I have written. It is a contribution to help in an advisory capacity to support the leadership to know what needs to be done to make the party appeal to the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lukman, the party must be run democratically where all the organs have the opportunity to discharge their functions unlike what obtained in the last National Working Committee NWC that did not function in tandem with the books of the party.\n\n\u201cThere is the need for the party to be democratic which means that organs of the party should be meeting regularly to be taking decisions; when we talk about party supremacy, it is not the position of an individual leader that should serve as supremacy of the party when the organs are not meeting which is the major issue with the last NWC, the National Executive Committee NEC wasn\u2019t meeting, the only organ that was meeting was the administrative organ and it was difficult at that time to now say that the Constitution of the party was being respected.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between the political parties and Nigerians is so weak and that is the argument I am canvassing in that book, it dwells on the type of relationship the party should have with interest groups, non-state actors, youth organizations, women organizations, persons living with disabilities.\u201d\n\nThe DG also threw a jab at former Governor Ali Modu Sheriff who had last week boasted that the APC will rule the country for 50 years, describing such comments as far from what should be coming from a progressive politician.\n\n\u201cThe other issue is how the party organizes itself. We can\u2019t have a party where for instance I have seen recently somebody aspiring for national chairmanship of the party saying the party needs a tough person to rule up to 40 years. That is not how a progressive should be thinking, a progressive should be thinking of how to endear himself to the citizens, it is not a question of how long you rule but how you are able to constantly endear yourself to the citizens. If you say you want to rule for 40 years, it is a question of going to lobby citizens to vote you, this is where we are coming from in terms of manipulating elections and what have you and these are the brutal issues in terms of politics in Nigeria which will take time to change, and it is not a one day thing, it is a life journey and we have to embark on that journey.\u201d\n\nHe however lauded the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker Committee for the manner it has been organizing the party congresses saying moving forward, it will be difficult for any one individual to hijack the organs of the party at the ward level.\n\nOn the spate of insecurity which appears to have worsened since the APC administration came to power in 2015, Lukman said contrary to insinuations, insurgency was not the only problem troubling the country pre-2015. He noted that there were cases of cattle rustling in the entire North as far back as 2013 as well as kidnapping in the Southern parts of the country.\n\nHe added that security agencies were overstretched adding that the country will continue to be confronted with some of these issues as long as a majority of Nigerians were not properly and meaningfully engaged.",

          "text": "\u2026 As Bill Scales Second Reading\n\nBy Henry Umoru\n\nMOVES by the Senate to provide the legal framework for the empowerment and provision of jobs for poor Nigerians, got a boost Wednesday, as a bill to that effect scaled second reading in the Senate.\n\nThe Senate today considered a bill seeking to empower poor Nigerians in rural areas with guaranteed income and jobs that would provide 100 days of paid work per year.\n\nThe Rural Employment Guarantee Bill, 2021 was sponsored by Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, APC, Niger East.\n\nThe President of the Senate, Senator Ahmad Lawan thereafter, referred the bill to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for further work after passing second reading.\n\nThe Committee which is chaired by Senator Abdullahi Adamu was given four weeks to report back to the Senate.\n\nIn his lead debate on the general principles of the Bill, Senator Musa explained that the bill among others, essentially seeks to provide livelihood security in rural communities by providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in every financial year to every household whose adult member volunteer do skilled manual work.\n\nAccording to him, the bill when passed into law would empower rural poor through the processes of a rights-based Law; ensure a strong social safety net for vulnerable groups; strengthen the natural resource base of rural livelihood; and serve as a model of governance reform anchored on the principles of transparency and grass root democracy.\n\nHe added that the National Rural Employment Guarantee bill aims to reduce poverty by providing extra work for those who need it, while also providing empowerment and insurance when other sources of work dry up.\n\nCiting the Poor Employment Act of 1817 in Britain, and the New Deal Programs in the United States in the 1930s, Senator Musa explained that the piece of legislation was similarly intended to be an intervention that makes government an employer of last resort.\n\nHe noted that the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development would monitor the implementation of the scheme in association with state governments.\n\nContributing to the debate, Senator Smart Adeyemi, APC, Kogi West who threw his weight behind the passage of the bill into law, said that having agencies backed by law to oversee the implementation of such schemes for the poor would ensure that they are not abused.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn our nation today, Mr. President, most of these palliatives that the present government has put in place has been abused, because you have a situation where names are duplicated.\n\nREAD ALSO: Senate moves to stop illegal charges on cargo transport in Nigeria\n\n\u201cIt is even difficult for you to know those who are benefiting.\n\n\u201cThe bill my brother is seeking, is for us to have a formal agency for social security that will take care of all employment problems and even health problems of people who are not gainfully employed. It must be holistic.\n\n\u201cThis bill is good, the intention is good, but I think this bill must go further to make it a holistic solution to the problem of unemployment in our nation, so that it is not abused, and so that in every local government in Nigeria, you have an agency in charge that will take care of unemployment of our people.\n\n\u201cIn having the law, we must also have the punitive measures in place for those who would abuse it, so that people will know that this bill is intended to alleviate the suffering of people, and by extension, Mr. President, guarantee security of our nation.\n\n\u201cMost of the people who are into crime today, is out of frustration of unemployment. We have a large number of people who are unemployed.\n\n\u201cToday, we have up to two hundred universities and polytechnics producing graduates.\n\n\u201cSo, I think we must advise our government. Progressive as this government is to palliatives, let us formalize these palliative measures by having a social security agency in every local government of Nigeria, and let us put a law in place to make sure that nobody abuses it.\u201d\n\nIn a related development, the Smallholder Farmers (Protection) Bill 2021, also scaled second reading on Wednesday.\n\nThe bill sponsored by Senator Muhammad Enagi Bima, APC, Niger South was also referred by the Senate President to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.\n\nAlso, the Chartered Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering of Nigeria (Establishment) Bill, 2021; and Federal College of Agriculture, Shani (Establishment) Bill, 2021, passed second reading during plenary.\n\nThe two bills were referred to the Committees on Establishment and Public Service; and Tertiary Institutions and TETFUND for further inputs, respectively.\n\nThe Committees were all given four weeks to turn in their reports to the chamber in plenary.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

He said that the N20 million bounty was to show how seriously the state government took the matter.\n\n\u201cTo reinforce our commitment and seriousness on this issue, I on behalf of the state government, wish to announce a N20,000,000 reward for any useful information leading to the arrest of the perpetrators of these heinous attacks on our state. The people behind this must be unmasked and brought to book.\n\n\u201cI urge citizens to report to us anybody bearing firearm who is not a security or vigilante personnel, so we can deal with this monster, once and for all. I wish to most heartily condole with the families of all those who have lost their loved ones in the course of these senseless attacks.\n\n\u201cI promise you that we will leave no stone unturned in getting justice for them. May their souls rest in peace.\n\nFinally, I urge all citizens of the state to unite in this fight against all forms of terror, intimidation and tyranny. We will not succumb to invaders as I am convinced that no Anambra son will indulge in this kind of heartlessness.\n\n\u201cI warn all those promoting and participating in these violent attacks to leave our state or pay a high price as we will definitely catch up with them.\n\n\u201cSince last weekend, some armed persons have unleashed terror with sporadic attacks on innocent citizens in various parts of the state.\n\n\u201cFrom the briefings I have received from security commanders, offices of some political parties, branded campaign vehicles and individuals occupying them have been attacked with killings and burning of vehicles observed. Other innocent road users have become victims of this menace with many losing their lives and others, their properties.\n\n\u201cBetween Sunday 26th and yesterday 28th September, 2021 attacks on citizens at Oko, Agulu, Obosi, Nkpor, Nnobi, Nnewi and other places have left about 10 people dead including an illustrious son of this state, Dr Chike Akunyili, husband of late Prof Dora Akunyili who was reportedly gunned down yesterday around Nkpor.\n\n\u201cThese attacks and accompanying deaths cannot be justified and must stop now\u201d, Obiano declared.\n\nContinuing, the governor said: \u201cI have therefore conducted an extensive security meeting and have directed all security agencies to step up and confront this monster ravaging our land.\n\n\u201cI have charge everyone involved in the security architecture of Anambra State to take very seriously, this threat to our livelihood and boldly rise to confront same.\n\n\u201cEverything that needs to be done will be done and no stone will be left unturned in this effort. My directive to this effect is clear and I urge every security personnel on duty in Anambra State to do his utmost best to secure our people.\n\n\u201cWe cannot condone this savagery for any reason whatsoever. I, therefore, call on all our youths in the state to rise up and protect our communities.\n\n\u201cTraditional rulers, Presidents General, clergymen, vigilance groups and all leadership structures must now take responsibility and in conjunction with the police, military and other law enforcement agencies, work to restore order immediately.\u201d",

          "text": "The Lagos State judicial panel on restitution for victims of SARS related abuses and other matters was told on Tuesday by a UK based security consultant and forensic expert that the military did not fire live high velocity ammunition at EndSARS protesters at the Lekki tollgate.\n\nTestifying at the panel via zoom, the forensic expert Willie-Harry who is the Director and senior consultant of Oxygene consulting UK limited, stated that his organization was engaged by the Lagos State government to conduct a forensic and ballistic investigation of the Lekki tollgate incident of October 20th 2020.\n\nHe said the conclusion that the military did not fire live high velocity projectiles at EndSARS protesters on the said day was due to the obtained medical data of the victims who were admitted and treated at five medical centres, the time of arrival and the nature of injuries sustained.\n\nWillie-Harry also stated that four of the victims who sustained gunshot injuries were discovered to be projectiles from low velocity firearm which is not associated with the military or any of the security agencies.\n\nHe said the low velocity projectiles from which the four identified patients were treated for are common with locally produced firearms\n\nHowever Mr. Tonye Willie-Harry admitted that his team during the course of investigation were unable to ascertain how, by whom, where and when the gun shot injuries were sustained by the victims which might not be unconnected to the breakdown of law and order on the 20th October 2020 in the state, including at the tollgate.\n\nThe witness said the rifles shown as being carried by men in military gear who were at the Lekki tollgate protest ground from footages and videos obtained were Russian made Kalashnikov AK 47 rifles and that if the rifles had been shot with live bullets at protesters, that the damage would have been catastrophic because an AK 47 rifles when fired within a range of 50-100 meters has the capacity to kill 2-3 persons or more at a single shot.\n\nWhen asked under cross examination to authenticate his assurance that the military didn\u2019t fire live ammunition at the EndSARS protesters but rather fired blank bullets into the skies with images of muzzle flashes, the witness affirmed that by his training and that of his team members, he was 99.999% sure from his investigation that the bullets fired by the military were blank bullets.\n\nIn the media report presentation of the investigation, the witness also explained that the videos and footages alledged to be massacre of EndSARS protesters were not reflective of the reality as they were misleading and inaccurate representation of the fact.\n\nMr. Tonye Willie-Harry particularly quarreled with the video of the CNN report which he stated was a huge disappointment of an organization of that calibre, just as he picked holes in the media reportage and footages of BBC, Channels TV and DW which a Fisayo Soyombo Centre for investigative Journalism relied on to present his report.\n\nHowever, the witness admitted that the time line between when the incident occurred and when his organization embarked on the investigation was one which would not have allowed for facts and materials relevant to the investigation to be preserved as they were like to have been lost and some victims injuries healed or some victims absconding from accessing treatment from where they could be monitored.\n\nMr. Tonye Willie-Harry also affirmed that in a normal situation when incident of such occur, it is appropriate to preserve the scene, but that this was not done and it affected his investigation that he had to rely on only what he was able get and presented with. The witness said the investigation of the Lekki tollgate incident was conducted by his organization in December 2020 and the report compiled in February 2021 and submitted.\n\nThe witness was then discharged at the end of the cross examination by all the counsels and the panel adjourned sitting for the day.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

          "text": "As senate moves to stop illegal charges on cargo transport\n\nBy Deji Elumoye and Juliet Akoje\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has written formally to the Senate requesting to replace the nomination of Engr. Sarki Auwalu as the Chief Executive Officer on the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NPRA) board.\n\nThis is just as the Red Chamber moved on Wednesday to stop illegal charges on cargo transport by freight agents in the country.\n\nThe President\u2019s request was contained in a letter dated September 28, 2021, and read at Wednesday plenary by the Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan.\n\nThe President had in an earlier letter dated September 16, 2021, requested the upper chamber to confirm Auwalu alongside three others as board members of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority.\n\nIn his new request, President Buhari is, however, asking for the approval of the Senate to replace\n\nSarki Auwalu with Engr. Farouk A. Ahmed as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nHe explained that the replacement request was duly in accordance with the provision of Section 34(3) of the Petroleum Industry Act 2021.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the Red Chamber commenced moves to stop processing delay and illegal charges on cargo transport by freight agents in the country.\n\nThe decision to end multiple charges on cargo processing and transport was reached by the upper chamber in a resolution, following consideration of a motion during plenary.\n\nThe motion tilted: \u201cThe need to streamline Import and Export Cargo Processing in the Aviation Sector\u201d was sponsored by Senator Bala Ibn Na\u2019Allah.\n\nRising under Order 42 and 52 of the Senate Standing Rules, Na\u2019Allah noted with dismay the loss of about N250 billion on agro-export of produce in the country.\n\nAccording to him, the loss which translates to a ratio of 87:13 continues to impact negatively on the country\u2019s economy.\n\nNa\u2019Allah noted that there are about 16 sundry charges for goods coming in or out of the country \u2013 with 16 in Lagos and 15 in Abuja \u2013 and many of them being unofficial and illegal.\n\nHe lamented that loading 100 tons of cargo on aircraft cost around $35,000 in Nigeria, compared to Ghana that cost just about $4000 USD.\n\nThe ranking Senator said: \u201cThis has caused substantial damage to the Federal Government efforts of stimulating Capital Inflow\u201d, adding that, \u201cairlines involved in cargo transport have started avoiding Nigeria in view of the prohibitive charges.\u201d\n\nThe Senate, accordingly, mandated the Joint Committees on Trade and Investment, Agriculture and Rural Development, and Aviation and Customs to invite stakeholders and Freight Agents to come with acceptable template of processing Nigeria\u2019s Imports and Exports.\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan, has referred President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s request for the confirmation of Engr. Mohammed Sani Baba, representing Bauchi State as Federal Commissioner in the Revenue Mobilization, Allocation and Fiscal Commission, to the Committee on National Planning and Economic Affairs.\n\nThe Committee is expected to screen the nominee and report back to the upper chamber in two weeks.\n\nAlso, the President\u2019s request for the confirmation of five nominees as Commissioners in the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission was referred to the Committee on Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes.\n\nThe nominees for screening include: Dr. Mojisola Yaya-Kolade, Ekiti (South-West); Mrs. Anne Otelafu Odey, Cross River (South-South); Alh. Goni Ali Gujba, Yobe (North-East); Dr. Louis Solomon Mandama, Adamawa (North-East); and Senator Anthony O. Agbo (Ebonyi).\n\nThe Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes Committee also has two weeks to screen the nominees and report back to the Senate.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Inaugurates police quarters, boasts FG has invested substantially in NDDC\n\n\u2022NDDC is cash cow for politicians, says Wike\n\n\u2022Akpabio hints agency to fix 13,777 abandoned projects\n\n\u2022IG describes project as significant to force\n\nBlessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, described the funding of the Nigeria Police as a huge challenge for government. Although, Buhari said it was the reason government set up the Police Trust Fund, he maintained there was still need to source more funding avenues for the police in order to enhance the security of the society.\n\nThe president spoke at the commissioning of a block of 66 flats built by the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) for officers of the Nigeria Police Special Protection Unit Base 6, at Omagwa, Ikwerre Local Government Area of Rivers State. He boasted that the federal government on his watch had invested significantly in the NDDC, as could be seen in the many projects across the Niger Delta states.\n\nBut Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike, in his remarks, said NDDC had become a cash cow for politicians.\n\nIn his speech, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, disclosed that NDCC was struggling to complete 13, 777 abandoned projects across the Niger Delta states.\n\nInspector General of Police Alkali Baba Usman commended Buhari for the police quarters, saying it is a key security project.\n\nBuhari, who was represented by the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, at the inauguration, advised that the resources pumped into the commission should be justifiable and must impact positively on the people of the region. The president stated that the Nigeria Police had been effective in their role of protecting lives and property. He restated the federal government\u2019s commitment to providing a fair and convenient ground for police personnel to operate in their fight against insecurity.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cFunding of the police force remains a huge challenge, which is why we work with the National Assembly to enact the police trust fund Act. We are looking at other measures to improve funding for the police.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s event meets two objectives: the first is, it is an important part of our government\u2019s effort to improve the lives and livelihood of our police officers and men. And it is also another important milestone in our administration\u2019s pursuit of the peace, prosperity and the development of the Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cWe recognised that establishing adequate security is absolutely integral to the fulfilment of this administration\u2019s objective, which is why we have committed significant resources to projects such that we are about to commission.\u201d\n\nBuhari added, \u201cOur police force is a crucial component of our law enforcement architecture. They are the civil force, the closest to the people in the various communities. In the past months, we have been undertaking a major reform of the police. For us, we believe that we must increase the number of police personnel. So, we are also in the process of re-equipping our personnel, both in personal gear and hardware.\n\n\u201cAn important feature of the reform is the accommodation for men and officers. I have directed that the building of barracks for men and women of the police force should be done in collaboration with the social housing effort or the family homes fund. This will ensure speedy execution of all of the projects, and all of the barracks that need to be provided.\u201d\n\nThe president also said, \u201cThe federal government has invested significantly in the NDDC and we recognise that this outplay of resources must be justified with very viable projects and will improve the living standard of the people of this region.\n\n\u201cAnd as we hand over this facility to the Nigeria Police force, let me reiterate that with our security, there would be more development. This is the basis of my administration\u2019s commitment to continue to provide various platforms for all the security agencies and the fight against terrorism, banditry and all forms of criminality.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Wike observed that NDDC had become a cash cow for politicians. He accused the management of NDDC of sidelining the Niger Delta states in the execution of its projects. The governor said inclusion of the states would reduce the rampant incidence of abandoned projects across the region.\n\nHe said the commissioned project, which was supposed to be completed within one year, lasted about 10 years.\n\nWike stated, \u201cNDDC has been a cash cow for politicians. You will see competition for position, because of political interest. The problem of NDDC is not just for the Niger Delta but the entire Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis project shouldn\u2019t last one year if NDDC was committed to effective service delivery. There is no collaboration we have had with NDDC. And why would NDDC not be abandoning the project? You (NDDC) declare projects without conceptualisation, without funding, no commitment.\n\n\u201cMy problem with NDDC is, no synergy with the mandate states. You distort the development plans of the states. Sometimes, you go into our schools, health centres to build. Who told you it is our priority?\u201d\n\nWike, however, commended the Interim Sole Administrator of NDDC, Effiong Akwa, for his impactful effort so far in actualising development in the region since he assumed office.\n\nAkpabio disclosed that NDCC was struggling to complete 13, 777 abandoned projects across the Niger Delta states. He noted that the region was the safest and most peaceful in the country.\n\nThe minister said, \u201cThe Niger Delta region is the most peaceful region to live and do business today. Everything will be done to ensure the completion of the East/West Road. Presently, we have 13,777 abandoned projects but we thank Mr. President for making this event (commissioning of the police quarter) possible.\u201d\n\nUsman, said, \u201cThe project demonstrates the (determination of the) leadership of the Niger Delta Ministry to support the effort of the police in security in the region.\u201d\n\nMaintaining that the outcome of the project would change the narrative of the police, he assured of the maintenance of the property. The Inspector General added that he would monitor usage of the building.\n\nThe building has one commander\u2019s residence, one second-in-command\u2019s residence, 64 one-bedroom flats, one armoury, underground cells, and gate house.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says it could fund 46 per cent of 2021 budget deficit of N5.6 trillion\n\n\u2022NNPC set to deduct N149.2bn from October FAAC\n\n\u2022Oil price climbs above $80 per barrel\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nAs Nigeria continues to grapple with revenue shortfall and has gone borrowing to finance its huge budget deficit with debt service gulping as much as 98 per cent of its revenue, it has been revealed that 77 oil and gas companies operating in Nigeria are indebted to the country to the tune of N2.659 trillion.\n\nThis is just as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is expected to once more make a huge deduction of N149.2 billion from the federation\u2019s joint account when the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) meets next month, a document seen by THISDAY yesterday revealed.\n\nThe Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) which disclosed that 77 oil and gas companies were indebted to the federal government, attributed the debt to their failure to remit petroleum profit tax, company income tax, education tax, value added tax, withholding tax, royalty and concession on rentals.\n\nSpeaking in Abuja during an interaction with the media on the status of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) implementation in Nigeria, the Executive Secretary of the organisation, Dr. Ogbonnaya Orji, stated that when converted to dollar, the government was being owed $6.48 billion at today\u2019s official exchange rate of N410.35.\n\nHe noted that a breakdown of the figures showed that a total of $143.99 million was owed as petroleum profit taxes, $1.089 billion as company income taxes and $201.69 million as education tax. According to him, others included $18.46 million and \u00a3972,000 as VAT, $23.91 million and \u00a3997,000 as withholding tax, $4.357 billion as royalty oil, $292.44 million as royalty gas, while $270.187 million and $41.86 million were unremitted gas flare penalties and concession rentals respectively.\n\nIn view of the government\u2019s current search for revenues to address citizens\u2019 demand for steady power, access to good roads, quality education, fighting insurgency and creating of job opportunities for the country\u2019s teeming youths, Orji stressed that the monies needed to be recovered.\n\nAn analysis of what the sum of N2.65 trillion could contribute to economic development, he said, showed that it could cover the entire capital budget of the federal government in 2020 or even service the federal government\u2019s debt of $2.68 billion in 2020.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, if the money is recovered, the N2.659 trillion, it could fund about 46 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s 2021 budget deficit of N5.6 trillion and is even higher than the entire projected oil revenue for 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is why NEITI is set to work with the government to provide relevant information and data to support efforts at recovering this money.\n\n\u201cThe disclosure of this information is in line with NEITI\u2019s mandate to conduct audits, disseminate the findings to the public to enable the citizen\u2019s, especially the media and civil society to use the information and data to hold government, companies and even society to account.\n\n\u201cIt is important that the process of recovering this humongous sum be set on course to support government in this period of dwindling revenues,\u201d the NEITI helmsman said.\n\nThe executive secretary called on the companies to ensure that they remit the various outstanding sums against them before the conclusion of the 2020 NEITI audit cycle to the relevant government agencies responsible for collection and remittances of such revenue.\n\n\u201cNEITI will no longer watch while these debts continue to remain in its reports unaddressed. We will provide all necessary information and data to sister agencies whose responsibilities are to recover these debts into government coffers. We will do also share the information and data with our partner anti-corruption agencies with whom we have signed MoUs,\u201d he added.\n\nWithin the short period the new management was appointed, Orji disclosed that his team had succeeded in ensuring the reconstitution and inauguration of the NEITI board and commencement of process of reviewing of NEITI Act to strengthen its powers and functions. In addition, he listed the timely publication and presentation of the reports; securing permanent office accommodation for the agency after 17 years of squatting on rent; sustained and diversified partnerships with key stakeholders and partners as part of the initiative\u2019s achievement.\n\nAccording to him, the appointment of NEITI into the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA); commencement of the development of a five-year NEITI strategic plan (2022-2026); NEITI audit automation project and Nigeria\u2019s involvement in opening extractives programme, were further modest strides made by the organisation.\n\nHe stated that NEITI\u2019s had further been appointed to lead the global EITI contract transparency network; designing of a new, functional and interactive website and reconstitution of the civil society and communication sub-committee, among others.\n\nEarlier in his welcome remarks, the Chairman of the NEITI board, Mr. Olusegun Adekunle, assured that a lot more needed to be done in the EITI implementation in Nigeria, especially under the new PIA regime. He maintained that the solid minerals sector was begging for coordination, noting that the civil society and the media, being the third leg of the EITI tripod have critical roles to play in the Initiative.\n\n\u201cTo effectively undertake this task of ensuring prudent management of extractive resources, there is need for effective oversight of the implementation of the EITI standard by all relevant frontline agencies of government and companies.\n\n\u201cNSWG looks up to you for you to effectively monitor these guidelines and to ensure that the standards are mainstreamed in the covered entities\u2019 daily operations\u201d, he said.\n\nHe reiterated the commitment of President Muhammadu-led administration to EITI implementation in Nigeria, noting that the administration was passionate about the EITI process.\n\nThe chairman assured members of the civil society and the media that the NEITI board under his watch would do all within its power to sustain the existing partnership and ensure a more robust and cordial relationship with civil society groups.\n\nIn his goodwill message, the Programme Manager, British Council/ Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption Programme (RoLAC), Mr. Emanuel Uche, commended NEITI under the current management for the modest achievements made within a short period.\n\nNNPC Set to Deduct N149.2bn from October FAAC\n\nMeanwhile, the NNPC will again make a huge deduction of N149.2 billion from the federation\u2019s joint account when the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) meets next month, according to a document seen by THISDAY.\n\nThe NNPC FAAC presentation held on September 21, which detailed the corporation\u2019s operations for the month of August, disclosed that as reported by THISDAY last month, the national oil company also withheld about N173.1 billion during the month to pay for what it terms under-recovery or value shortfall. An analysis of the document showed that net revenue to FAAC from the NNPC rose to N80 billion in August as against N67.280 billion in July, an increase of about N13.28 billion.\n\nYear-to-date, the NNPC FAAC presentation showed that N714.7 billion had been paid as subsidy from January to August, with the eight month getting the lion\u2019s share of N173.1 billion, while June came next with N164.3 billion, followed by May with N126 billion, then July in which N103.2 billion was spent on what the government terms under-recovery.\n\nIn the same vein, while no subsidy was paid in January, N24.3 billion was paid in February, N60.3 billion in March and N61.9 billion in April this year.\n\nAccording to the NNPC, a pending N40 billion from June under-recovery would be subsequently subtracted from the federation account jointly run by the federal, state and local governments.\n\nWhen the implementation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) begins in earnest and the federal continues in its hesitation to stop payment of subsidy on petrol, it would be double jeopardy for the sub-nationals which would also be hugely affected by the deduction of the controversial 30 per cent frontier exploration fund.\n\n\u201cThe value shortfall of N173,131,639,213.61, for July 2021 was charged. The balance of N40,000,000,000.00 for the June 2021 value shortfall will be deducted subsequently.\n\n\u201cThe August, 2021 value shortfall of N149,283,084,869.20 is to be deducted from the September, 2021 proceeds due for sharing at the October, 2021 FAAC meeting,\u201d the document disclosed.\n\nIn all, the overall NNPC crude oil lifting of 8.71 mbbls (export & domestic crude) in July 2021, recorded 0.87 per cent increase relative to the 8.66 mbbls lifted in June 2021, the corporation stated, with Nigeria maintaining 1.554 million bpd Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production cut in July, 2021.\n\nCrude Oil export revenue received in August 2021 amounted to $7.78 million, equivalent to N2.98 billion, while domestic gas receipts in the month was N5.69 billion.\n\nAccording to the NNPC, feedstock valued at $64.66 million was sold to Nigeria LNG during the period, out of which $54.40 million was received during the month, the difference being Modified Carry Agreement (MCA) obligations, gas reconciliation and credit notes.\n\nNLNG arrears amounting to $3.09 million was received during the period, while the sum of $151.26 million being miscellaneous receipts, gas and ullage (the amount by which a container falls short of being full) fees and interest income was received in August 2021.\n\nIn its July operations, for monies which were shared in August, NNPC had deducted a cumulative N215.3 billion from its contribution to joint Federation Account, being a combination of N175 billion value shortfall or subsidy and N40 billion Joint Venture (JV) cost recovery.\n\nThe data earlier obtained by THISDAY showed that NNPC paid N67.280 to the joint account in July, in contrast to the N47.162 in June. The July payment was about N20 billion higher than that of June.\n\nFurthermore, in January, net revenue to FAAC was N90.8 billion, it was N64.161 billion in February, N41.184 billion in March, zero in April, N38.608 billion in May, N47.162 billion in June and N67.280 billion in July.\n\nIn June, the NNPC told the nation that Nigeria was losing about 42 million litres of petrol to the activities of smugglers across the country\u2019s borders, increasing Nigeria\u2019s estimated daily consumption of 60 million litres to 103 million litres, thereby worsening the subsidy payment regime.\n\nMeanwhile, Brent oil, Nigeria\u2019s crude benchmark, rose above $80 a barrel on Tuesday, the latest milestone in a global energy crisis, on signs that demand was running ahead of supply and depleting inventories.\n\nThe international crude benchmark hit the highest since October 2018, before paring some earlier gains to trade close to $80, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) also climbed above $75.\n\nHowever, the jump to $80 was adding inflationary pressure to the global economy at a time when prices of energy commodities are soaring, especially in Europe and America.\n\nOther things being equal, oil has rebounded from its collapse last year amid record output curbs from the OPEC+ group and a global economic recovery that has boosted demand.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Alongside Softbank, the round included Whale Rock, a new investor and existing investors like Generation Investment Management, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and Spark Capital.\n\n\u201cAndela has always been the high-quality option for those building remote engineering teams. Now that the world has come to embrace remote work, Andela has become the obvious choice for companies because we can find better talent, faster,\u201d said Jeremy Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Andela. \u201cIf you are a talented engineer, Andela opens up a world of possibilities for you, no matter where you are based.\u201d\n\nIn view of this announcement, Lydia Jett, Founding Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers and one of the most respected consumer technology investors in the world, will join Andela\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\nLaunched in Nigeria in 2014, Andela started as an African-focused software developer training and outsourcing company. Notorious for being harder to get into than Harvard, Andela grew to become a premier source for talented, well-rounded developers in Africa thanks to its curriculum and developer training methodology. Two years after it launched the company got a $24 million infusion, led by Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, who followed up with a visit.\n\nL \u2013 R: Brice Nkengsa, Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, Ian Carnevale, Christina Sass, Jeremy Johnson, and Nadayar Enegesi co-founded Andela in September 2014.

According to estimates, roughly 27,000 Sierra Leoneans were disabled or had one or more of their limbs amputated during the 1991-2002 war.\n\nMIT adds that while the population of people with amputated limbs continues to increase each year in Sierra Leone, less than 10% of that population currently benefits from functional prostheses.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cThrough the mobile delivery system, a key centre objective is to scale up production and access of functional limb prostheses for Sierra Leoneans in dire need,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nSierra Leone President, Julius Maada Bio, describes the mobile prosthetics service fueled by the K. Lisa Yang Center for Bionics as \u201can innovative solution to a global problem.\u201d\n\nThe MIT project aligns with President Bio\u2019s plans to make Sierra Leone a hub for technology and innovation.\n\nOne of the first things he did after assuming office in 2017 was set up a Directorate of Science, Technology, and Innovation (DSTI) led by David Moinina Sengeh, the country\u2019s first-ever chief innovation officer who doubles as the Minister of Basic and Senior Secondary Education.\n\nSengeh is an MIT and Harvard inventor whose research work to improve prosthetic limbs in Sierra Leone will be leveraged by the MIT bionics centre.\n\nA crucial figure in the government\u2019s digitisation drive, he\u2019s introduced President Bio to TED Talks and tech activities at the universities of Oxford, Yale, and Harvard.\n\nOver the past four years, the President has participated in dialogues centered around using innovation and technology to transform food systems in Africa; given presentations on blockchain and the fourth industrial revolution; as well as visited MIT, where he detailed plans to make his nation a digital centre.\n\n\u201cI am proud that Sierra Leone will be the first site for deploying this state-of-the-art digital design and fabrication process,\u201d Bio said.\n\n\u201cAs the leader of a government that promotes innovative technologies and prioritizes human capital development, I am overjoyed that this pilot project will give Sierra Leoneans (especially in rural areas) access to quality limb prostheses and thus improve their quality of life.\u201d\n\nMore on the bionics centre\n\nThe K. Lisa Yang Center for Bionics will be run by Hugh Herr, an MIT professor and double amputee. Broadly, it aims to develop technologies and surgical methods to mitigate disability because of injury, aging, or disease using interdisciplinary research.\n\nExperts from three MIT schools \u2013 Science, Engineering, and Architecture and Planning \u2013 as well as clinical and surgical collaborators at Harvard Medical School, are expected to work together at the new centre.\n\nFurthermore, the center will provide four endowed fellowships for MIT graduate students working in bionics or other research areas focused on improving the lives of individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe new K. Lisa Yang Center for Bionics at MIT, made possible by a US$24 million gift from philanthropist Lisa Yang (center), will be led by Hugh Herr, professor of media arts and sciences at the MIT Media Lab (left), and Ed Boyden, the Y. Eva Tan Professor in Neurotechnology at MIT (right).

          "title": "China plans to deploy digital satellite TVs in 200 Togolese villages",
          "text": "The Chinese government plans to distribute digital satellite television and reception kits in 200 villages across Togo.\n\nChina\u2019s deputy trade minister Qian Keming said late last month the Asian powerhouse was \u201ccommitted to assisting in the implementation of this programme\u201d in Togo. It will cover more than a third of villages in the country, which is one of the smallest by land area and population in Africa with approximately 8 million people.\n\nThe project aligns with a separate plan by the West African country to switch to digital terrestrial television (DTT) broadcasting.\n\nDTT, which will replace analog television, is a technology that improves image quality and reduces operating costs inherent in broadcasting. In October 2019, the Togolese parliament passed a law authorising the DTT migration, a process that began a few years before the regulation was approved.\n\nThe government\u2019s plan was expected to kick off with the construction of nine digital transmission sites. However, it has stalled as DTT coverage in the French-speaking country remains low, and non-existent in rural areas.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nChina\u2019s 10,000 Villages Plan\n\nThe Chinese government\u2019s provision of satellite TV in Togo is part of a more extensive program in Africa, through which 10,000 villages in 20 countries are expected to receive TV sets and reception kits, with the aim of reducing the digital divide in rural Africa.\n\nSelected villages get solar-powered projector TVs, digital TV sets, satellite dishes, and decoders where they can watch 20 international and local channels free of charge. Local technicians also receive training on the installation and maintenance of the equipment.\n\nChinese media conglomerate StarTimes, contracted for the project, carried out the installation in neighboring West African countries Benin and Nigeria, where the company claims to have equipped public areas with satellite reception kits in 200 and 1,000 villages respectively. The same deployment was done in Uganda and Kenya.\n\nChinese presence in Africa\u2019s media\n\nStarTimes is one of the most popular pay-TV operators on the continent. Although it is technically a private company with no known government affiliation, the pay-TV operator plays a vital role in China\u2019s diplomacy push in Africa.\n\nChina\u2019s significant presence and influence in Africa, mainly in the areas of infrastructure development and trade, has expanded to include the media sector. Over the years, Beijing has invested significantly in the African media landscape, through projects like the DTT coverage.\n\nSeveral Chinese media organisations also boast a significant presence on the continent.\n\nThe state-funded Xinhua News Agency established a regional office in Nairobi in 2006 with a massive foreign correspondent network in Africa. It currently allows local media outlets to get content via its newswire without charge.\n\nThe China Global Television Network (CGTN) also has an African bureau headquartered in the Kenya capital, where it offers free and reduced broadcasting to television providers.\n\nBoth the China Daily publication and China Radio International have bureaus in Nairobi as well.\n\nA major aspect of StarTimes\u2019 ambitions in Africa is its ability to promote state broadcasters from the Asian nation, enabling easier access to Chinese content \u2013 from soap operas to news programmes. For instance, it broadcasts CGTN for free and offers the station with every subscription package.\n\nHowever, not all content on the platform is Chinese-produced. In addition to broadcasting Chinese and African national channels, StarTimes produces its own content in local languages, including Swahili, from its production facility in Nairobi.\n\nIn some ways, China\u2019s presence in the African media landscape has benefitted the region. The investment in the media industry has reportedly created hundreds of jobs and provided international training courses to many journalists, often in China.\n\nBut the Asian power\u2019s increasing investment in African media is seen as a strategy to positively shape its image, which is key to achieving Beijing\u2019s longer-term ambitions.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "This is the time to build the architecture for Africa\u2019s future \u2013 Ndubuisi Ekekwe on funding startups in Africa",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a child, Ndubuisi Ekekwe realised that excelling in his education was a guaranteed path to influence. That realisation drove him to apply himself, eventually resulting in him studying electrical and electronics engineering at the Federal University of Technology, Owerri.\n\nAfter graduation, he worked at various companies, including Diamond Bank and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) before moving to the US where he obtained a PhD in electrical and electronics engineering from Johns Hopkins University. Subsequently, he taught at Carnegie Mellon University before founding companies operating in the technology space.\n\nIn December 2020, Professor Ekekwe published an article on the Tekedia website, which he titled, \u201cFintechnolization of Platforms \u2013 Expect this Redesign in Startups.\u201d In the article, he argued that every digital platform would have to offer a financial service at some point if it must capture massive value.\n\nIn January 2021, he launched Tekedia Capital, an investment syndicate that allows individuals to invest in companies operating largely in Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I made that postulation, I thought, \u2018if I have written this, how do I demonstrate that I\u2019m walking the talk?\u2019 So, that is how I started thinking about building our fintech solution within our ecosystem since, to a large extent, we have a couple of thousands of people here. That was how Tekedia Capital came about.\u201d\n\nStarting Tekedia Capital was not just about making money though. It was also driven by a desire to support a generation of African entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cI will say, to a large extent, that I am optimistic about this Cambrian moment of entrepreneurial capitalism in Africa. That this is the time to build the architecture for the new African future and having the right capital will make sure that the entrepreneurs will be successful in doing that.\u201d\n\nEkekwe is quick to point out that Tekedia Capital is not a VC fund but an investment syndicate. On the reason for choosing this model, he points out that becoming a VC fund increases ticket sizes and could result in worrying about big exits, adding that investing smaller amounts improves the chance of being bought out by bigger investors at subsequent raises.\n\nWith most members of the syndicate being angel investors, this flexibility is key.\n\n\u201cMost people who are still investing at a personal level want to have that flexibility but VCs may like it to get very big.\u201d\n\nEven with this, the firm does not invest less than $70,000 in startups, often going as high as $700,000.\n\nHow Tekedia Capital works\n\nWith an annual fee of $1,000, or its local equivalent, investors get access to Tekedia Capital\u2019s deal flow for four investment cycles or 12 months in situations where Tekedia Capital does not have up to four investment cycles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor investors in the syndicate, the minimum investment in a startup is $10,000 or its local equivalent. In addition to the $1,000 required to gain access, Tekedia Capital charges a 20% carried interest of the invested amount.\n\nSince its launch, the syndicate has invested in up to ten startups, including Y Combinator portfolio company, Mecho Autotech; on-demand helicopter booking startup Vetifly; and online checkout startup, OurPass. Investments in startups are determined by members of the syndicate and not Tekedia Capital.\n\nIt operates a lean model with a small team that sources and vets deals before presenting them to the syndicate\u2019s members.\n\nMembers of the syndicate come from various professional backgrounds, and this means that Tekedia Capital can get professional advice from someone with experience in a sector before investing.\n\nInvestment thesis\n\nTekedia Capital invests in early-stage technology-anchored startups with most of their operations based in Africa. It is also sector-agnostic although there is a bias towards startups that are hard to automate.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to invest in a company that someone in Silicon Valley will automate. So, you\u2019re not going to see us invest in businesses like Twitter or Instagram because there is no inherent geographical advantage that it gives you as an innovator in Lagos. You have to be physically present.\u201d\n\nWhen choosing startups to invest in, Ekekwe discloses that the syndicate picks startups with teams that show the required technical and managerial abilities. The team must also be able to go beyond customer acquisition to making fans of their customers.\n\nIn my conversations with early-stage investors, a common thought expressed is how there is very little data available on a startup that could aid the due diligence process and so in many cases, the decision on whether to invest in a startup could come down to the founder.\n\nEkekwe reveals that beyond a founder\u2019s technical or managerial capabilities, it is important to know what motivates the person.\n\n\u201cI like to know our startup founders. I don\u2019t want to invest in someone whose motivations I don\u2019t understand. I just want to know if this is a guy that will stop picking calls if you send him $300,000 so we put significant effort into trying to understand exactly who our founders are.\u201d\n\nFounders who meet Tekedia Capital\u2019s requirements can apply for investment by sending an email to capital@fasmicro.com.\n\nBuilding Africa\u2019s future\n\nAfrica still suffers a huge infrastructural deficit and the capital required to plug the hole means that only a few entrepreneurs would bother with it. Ekekwe understands this and points out that despite the growth experienced by software startups, those are not the innovations that would ultimately drive Africa\u2019s economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe biggest opportunity in Africa today is building infrastructure but they don\u2019t bring in a lot of money. We need to build seaports, better broadband in rural communities, a better logistics system that will make eCommerce work, and we also need electricity that works. These are the infrastructure that power innovation but you don\u2019t expect small VCs or entrepreneurs to deal with that. However, those are the things that will facilitate Africa\u2019s growth.\u201d\n\nWhile conceding that entrepreneurs cannot be expected to drive this growth, he expressed hope that as more exits are recorded in the startup scene, more founders will be willing to take on projects of this nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry*, a 9-year-old student, was diagnosed with dysgraphia when he was seven years old. He has trouble gripping a pencil, which always leads to hand cramps and fatigue.\n\n\u201cHenry\u2019s handwriting was unusual and inconsistent. It was sad to see him struggle to write at home because it seemed like his teachers were punishing him by having him write in class,\u201d Henry\u2019s dad recalls.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), writing necessitates a complex set of motor and information processing skills which includes the ability to organise thoughts coherently and then write them down on paper.\n\nHowever, dysgraphia impairs these abilities in varying degrees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPrior to the diagnosis, I had received numerous reports from his teachers indicating that my son was lazy and unable to write. They advised me to withdraw him. But Henry was a natural communicator. He could speak and express himself clearly in words. I knew something was wrong. So, in 2019, I took him for diagnosis,\u201d his dad says.\n\nDysgraphia is a neurological condition that impairs writing and fine motor skills. It is a learning disability that affects both children and adults, and it affects almost every aspect of the writing process, including spelling, legibility, word spacing, and sizing.\n\nLiving with dysgraphia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDysgraphia is a condition that has received little attention from researchers globally. As a result, estimating the prevalence of dysgraphia is difficult.\n\nHowever, according to research, Dr Reynold Cecil Randy, an American psychology professor, estimates that the prevalence of dysgraphia ranges from 5 to 20% in the world. Besides, men are more likely to suffer from dysgraphia than women.\n\nTypically, dysgraphia appears when children are first introduced to writing. Despite thorough instruction, they write incorrectly sized and spaced letters or misspell words, resulting in poor handwriting.\n\nNevertheless, dysgraphia may remain unnoticed from childhood until adulthood.\n\nWhen dysgraphia appears in childhood, it is usually due to a problem with orthographic coding.\n\nThe International Dyslexia Association (IDA), a non-profit education and advocacy organisation devoted to issues surrounding dyslexia, describes orthographic coding as the ability to store written words in working memory while the letters in words are analysed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe IDA also describes it as the ability to form long-term memories of written words associated with their pronunciation and meaning.\n\nAdditionally, children with dysgraphia do not have a primary developmental motor disorder, another cause of poor handwriting. Nonetheless, they may struggle to plan sequential finger movements without visual feedback, such as touching the thumb to successive fingers on the same hand.\n\nAccording to a study, students with dysgraphia may struggle to learn, complete coursework, communicate, record ideas, demonstrate knowledge, and keep up with their peers and teachers\u2019 instructions.\n\nThis can also cause or exacerbate emotional, academic, and social development deficits in students, as well as \u201cimpact factors like self-efficacy, self-esteem, anxiety, and depression, all of which are linked to educational motivation, achievement, and persistence.\u201d\n\nIn adults, it is most prevalent following a traumatic event and is usually associated with damage to the brain\u2019s parietal lobe.\n\nIndividuals with dysgraphia frequently use incorrect words to convey their message. For instance, instead of saying \u201cchild,\u201d they say \u201cboy.\u201d\n\nEven so, children with dysgraphia may have good oral skills, but they may be misunderstood as lazy and uninterested or indifferent because they cannot write.\n\nIn summary, dysgraphia makes it difficult for children and adults to plan and execute a sentence, words, or even letters in writing. Therefore, it\u2019s not as if individuals with dysgraphia can\u2019t read, spell, or recognise letters and words. It\u2019s just that their brains struggle to process words and write.\n\nSo, it is critical to understand that dysgraphia is a neurological disorder, not a cognitive impairment.\n\nRelationship between dysgraphia and dyslexia\n\nDysgraphia was initially grouped with dyslexia until 1936 when Anna Gillingham \u2014 an educator and psychologist best known for her contributions to the Orton-Gillingham method of teaching dyslexic children to read \u2014 led a series of workshops on reading, spelling, and handwriting, according to a study.\n\nDyslexia and dysgraphia are language-based disorders. However, while dyslexia affects reading, dysgraphia affects writing.\n\nMoreso, both disabilities make it difficult for people to convert phonemes (sounds) into graphemes (letters in written form). That is, they affect the ability to spell.\n\nAccording to Lexercise, a Structured Language Therapy programme based on the Orton Gillingham methodology for children with learning disabilities, language disorders can occur independently or in conjunction with other problems.\n\nTherefore, dysgraphia can coexist with other learning disabilities such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\n\nAssistive technology for Dysgraphia\n\nSome beneficial assistive technologies (AT) can help students and adults with dysgraphia access information and demonstrate what they know in writing.\n\nA study by the University of Washington shows that finding a set of appropriate AT tools and techniques for a specific individual may necessitate some trial and error.\n\nTherefore, a person with a learning disability should be involved in the selection of their technology. They should assist in determining what works for them.\n\nHere are five AT tools that can be tested, discarded, adapted or refined by students with dysgraphia.\n\n1. Pencil Grips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Consortium\n\nDesigned in 1992 by Dr Lois Provda, an educational therapist, the Pencil Grip is used extensively in classrooms, homes, and therapeutic settings.\n\nPencil Grips are small attachments that are placed at the end of a pencil. They assist a child in grasping a pencil practically and accurately.\n\nWhen used correctly, a Pencil Grip can help develop fine motor skills and handwriting control. Its distinctive, one-of-a-kind design gently allows the fingers and hand to rest in the correct gripping position.\n\nWith a Pencil Grip that fits over the pencil, the thumb, index, and middle fingers are perfectly positioned. When a child grasps a pencil correctly, they write faster and neater without tiring out their hand muscles.\n\nBecause there are so many different Pencil Grips, it\u2019s critical to understand a child\u2019s specific needs.\n\nFor example, there is a Pencil Grip with built-in guards for students who wrap their thumbs around their index fingers. With this type of Pencil Grip, their fingers may find it easier to maintain proper posture with the protectors on.\n\n2. Slant boards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Amazon\n\nWriting on a slanted surface is a common biomechanical strategy occupational therapists employ to promote proper wrist position and improve handwriting.\n\nAccording to a recent study by Nova Southeastern University (NSU) in Florida, \u201cthe handwriting task is modified by elevating the upper extremity to stabilise the wrist in extension while also allowing the hand and forearm to rest on a supportive surface when using a slant board set at 20 degrees.\u201d\n\nThe slant board aids handwriting by facilitating proper posture and gradually developing proximal stability.\n\nThe concept behind using a slant board to improve pencil grip is based on wrist position.\n\nTo produce legible written work, a student must move their wrist and elbow in a fluid motion. To be effective, the wrist must be extended or up-bent.\n\nSo, the slant board promotes wrist extension when writing by causing the wrist to extend while the fingers flex and naturally fall into a better writing position.\n\n3. Graphic Organisers\n\nPeople with learning disabilities are often visual learners and thinkers, according to the Learning Disabilities Association of America. This means when ideas, words, and concepts are associated with pictures, diagrams, charts, and maps, they understand and remember such information better.\n\nHence, the need to adopt graphic organisers.\n\nGraphic organisers are simple but powerful tools that can help people with dysgraphia, executive functioning issues, or other issues that cause writing difficulties.\n\nGraphic organisers are visual thinking tools that help individuals visualise their ideas. The images show relationships between facts, concepts, or ideas and guide their thinking as they create the map or diagram.\n\nThese graphic organisers range from Venn diagrams, concept maps, mind maps to flowing charts.\n\nVenn diagrams demonstrate how different things or ideas can overlap to show, compare, or contrast relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: The Data Science Venn Diagram \u2014 Drew Conway\n\nConcept maps help organise information, brainstorm ideas, visualising them, and planning what you want to write.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: PM-Training.net\n\nMind maps are graphical representations of hierarchical data that include a central idea surrounded by connected branches of related topics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Venngage\n\nThey\u2019re excellent for generating new ideas, solving problems, and illustrating relationships and/or process components. XMind, Mindly and Coggle are examples of mind mapping software.\n\nFlow charts are graphic organisers that show how different steps in a process interact with each other. This makes them valuable tools for communicating how methods work and documenting how a particular job is done.\n\nMapping a process in a flow chart format can help clarify the process and show where the process can be improved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Hubspot\n\n4. Keyboards and touchscreens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Tech News Inc\n\nHandwriting can be painful and tiring for people with dysgraphia, so typing written work on a computer is essential.\n\nUsing keyboards and touchscreens allows them to enter letters and words by typing or touching the screen. So, a keyboard with alphabetical keys or vowels and consonants in different colours may be the perfect fit for someone with dysgraphia.\n\n5. Dictation\n\nDictation technology, also known as speech-to-text, voice-to-text, voice recognition, or speech recognition technology, assists people who have difficulty writing. It converts spoken words into text.\n\nInstead of writing by hand or with a keyboard, dictation allows people to write words by speaking them aloud. People can use dictation to write, edit, and revise their work.\n\nWhile there are built-in dictation tools in devices such as computers, smartphones, digital tablets, and Chromebooks, there are also web-based, app-based, and software dictation tools.\n\nOther tools that can be used\n\nTools like predictive text, writing guide, raised-line paper, lettering stencils, electronic dictionaries and Thesaurus, and Word Banks are examples of other tools that can help people with dysgraphia.\n\nGrammarly is an app that assists people with spelling and grammar that they might overlook because they focus on content rather than writing.\n\nEvernote is a note-taking app that allows people to photograph worksheets and type answers directly into the blanks. It can also be synchronised across devices, giving users access to notes and other items no matter where they are working.\n\nIt is crucial to understand that a person with a learning disability cannot be cured with AT as there is no known cure for any learning disability.\n\nRegardless, rather than focusing on a person\u2019s disabilities, AT tools allow them to demonstrate and apply their intelligence and knowledge.\n\nConsequently, with occupational therapy and support from parents, teachers, and loved ones, AT tools can help people with dysgraphia to reach their full potential in school and at home.\n\n* \u2013 not real name\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "This post is a delayed version of Techpoint Digest , a week-daily newsletter that rounds up major happenings in African tech. You can start receiving it hours before everyone else if you .\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing:\n\nCelebrating access to information\n\nHome for the homeless\n\nMeeting Abake Adenle\n\nGokada in Ibadan\n\nOn this day for universal access to information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Sara Kurfe\u00df on Unsplash Photo by AbsolutVision on Unsplash\n\nWait, is that even a thing? Yes, it is. In 2015, at the 74th United Nations (UN) General Assembly, September 28 was declared the International Day for Universal Access to Information (IDUAI).\n\nFor what? You might ask. Access to information is a core part of the fundamental right of freedom of expression. I mean, what do you express without access to information?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a problem. In 2021 alone, Africa lost an estimated $454 million between January and August due to varying degrees of Internet blackouts and social media shutdowns by governments. Add to this zero transparency in governmental activities, and what you have is freedom of access to information dragged in the mud.\n\nWait for it. Going by the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act passed by the National Assembly in 2011, Nigerians are entitled to know the budget for projects executed by their local government chairmen. This also includes money collected in tax and how it was spent. Sadly that isn\u2019t the case today.\n\nOur reporters, Oluwanifemi and Emmanuel, did a deep dive, where they extensively discussed the right to access information, with opinions from senior journalists from different companies in between. Read here.\n\nA foundation\u2019s move to empower homeless children in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Destiny Trust Children Foundation Webpage\n\nIt\u2019s the 21st century, the age of technology. There is access to information, and yes, there are still homeless people trying to make it from one day to the next. Reports show that there are an estimated 24.4 million homeless people in Nigeria alone. Sadly, this number takes children into account.\n\nStatistics don\u2019t bleed. There\u2019s a tendency to downplay the severity of situations when figures are bandied around. In the comfort of one\u2019s bed, it\u2019s easy to feel like homeless statistics are just figures. But these figures speak of actual people \u2014 adults and children.\n\nEnter The Destiny Trust Children Foundation. In 2012, Abimbola Ojenike, a practising lawyer in Lagos, noticed children roaming the streets during school hours, and after some investigation, he discovered they were homeless. Getting friends in on the vision, they co-founded a foundation to help house, educate, and empower these children with tech skills.\n\nSix years and outlets in three Nigerian cities later, the foundation has established two innovative hubs and reached out to about 15,000 children in Nigeria.\n\nRead the full article here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeeting Abake Adenle, an African speech recognition engineer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbake Adenle Source: Supplied\n\nThe question \u201cwhat do you want to be in future?\u201d is one that we all probably heard a zillion times while growing up. That people ask with good intentions doesn\u2019t change the fact that the future isn\u2019t set in stone; adventure, curiosity, and diversity are unavoidable parts of life.\n\nNigerian-American software engineer, Abake Adenle, went from studying electrical engineering to working 9-5 at a UK-based investment bank to taking the road less travelled \u2014 building a speech recognition API for five African languages. Add to the mix a passion for teaching, adventure, and solving problems.\n\nIn came the accolades. In July 2021, she was recognised by the Women in Voice (WiV) for her outstanding contributions to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in voice.\n\nOn yesterday\u2019s episode of The Experts, a bi-weekly series where tech career specialists take us on their journey from newbie to expert, Oluwanifemi had an exciting chat with Abake. Read her story here.\n\nGokada wants to replicate past Lagos traction in Ibadan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage credit: Gokada\n\nThe same Gokada? Well, if you mean the bike-hailing and last-mile delivery platform whose motorcycle transport services growth in Lagos was halted mid-flight by the state government-imposed ban on bikes in February 2020, then yes, it\u2019s the same Gokada.\n\nWhat\u2019s the news? Well, the Nigeria-based startup has announced its launch in the Southwestern city of Ibadan. For now, inhabitants can access food delivery (GFood) and logistics services (GSend) via the Gokada SuperApp while waiting for ride-hailing and a proposed eCommerce store to be launched later this year.\n\nReplication and competition. Their logistics services seem to have gained traction in Lagos, as the company says it has completed more than 1.5 million deliveries on behalf of 30,000 merchants. The startup is looking to replicate that growth in Ibadan in both its logistics and forthcoming transport services.\n\nWith the established presence of SafeBoda in Ibadan, will we see a power tussle, or is it a case of the sky being big enough for every bird to fly?\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nThe Internet Dream. Read\n\none small thing. Read.\n\nHow to Make Productivity Healthier.

          "title": "Labour shortage in the UK triggers petrol crisis",
          "text": "The current fuel crisis experienced in the United Kingdom has negatively impacted the region\u2019s economic activities as vehicular mobility and other private business concerns have been hit by the event.\n\nPanicked motorists can be seen all over the UK as queues continue to gain length at the pump stations. As a result, small businesses and essential services providers continue to face difficulties due to the shortage of this essential commodity.\n\nWhile the UK government claims to be handling the situation properly, several calls by concerned local agencies are being made for a quicker and more effective response to the situation to forestall an aggravated eventuality owing to the current situation.\n\nOn Saturday, September 25, UK\u2019s Evening Standard reported that BP, UK\u2019s oil giant, announced its decision to temporarily close some of its petrol stations because it lacked sufficient lorry drivers for its supply operations.\n\nAccording to the oil firm, not enough drivers are available to shuttle fuel to the various dispensing locations. For this reason, the firm has decided to close down some of its petrol stations for a while.\n\nAccording to a British information source, over 100,000 HGV drivers lack across a broad range of UK\u2019s industries, including fast foods supply chains and supermarkets.\n\nRead Also: Petroleum crisis looms in South-East as IPMAN withdraws services\n\nThis labour shortage is blamed on many reasons, including the exit of many drivers to their home countries after Brexit. Some others moved elsewhere in search of better working conditions, and an escape from additional border bureaucracies, which impacts their income if they remained in the UK post-Brexit.\n\nFurthermore, enlistment into the truck driving job requires additional safety qualifications in addition to their HGV licence before they can be allowed to transport chemicals such as petrol with huge trucks.\n\nOf course, the pandemic also shares in the blame for labour supply contraction across the UK, as many drivers fled to their home countries when the region experienced a remarkable economic downturn. Older drivers resigned as well, and a massive backlog of HGV driver tests was created due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAll over the UK, long queues keep building up as people fear that prices will spike. While the Northern Ireland region seems unaffected by this development, urban areas throughout Great Britain seem to be hit the hardest.\n\nThe UK government has been alleviating the situation by luring more temporary workers into the distribution network. The government has announced the provision of temporary visas to 5,000 foreign fuel tankers and food lorry drivers, and up to 5,500 poultry workers.\n\nWith this, the government hopes to boost supply and contract the scarcity timeline.\n\nAlso, the UK authorities are looking to take measures to ensure that companies share more timely information about fuel supply and prioritise areas in need. This is expected to give timely public information about petrol supply situations in the country so that panic responses to announcements that further ignite scarcity and price hikes in fuel prices and other related concerns will not occur.\n\nUK authorities are also making efforts to speed up the process of approving HGV driver licences so that newly employed drivers can commence supply operations as fast as possible.\n\nCurrently, there are arguments that border on the need for government priority focus towards providers of critical services across the country concerning petrol access. This strand of believers argues that providers of such services as medical, education and security should be given access priority while the situation elapses. This, they believe, should help avert the disruption of these essential services during this trying time.\n\nCommenting on the current situation, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng assures the public that the crisis is stabilising.\n\nAccording to BBC News, the Secretary said soldiers would be involved with supplying fuel within the next couple of days to help relieve supply issues. He further announced that the government would be drawing on its tanker reserve fleet to boost fuel availability to the panicking public.\n\nThe Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents about 5,500 of the UK\u2019s 8,000 filling stations, has assured the public that the mounting demand pressures will soon ease at the pumps.\n\nThe government has also assured its citizens that fuel supply at the more significant level is not affected despite the current situation. However, they blame the current crisis on customer over-demand due to fears of a shortage and inflated media coverage on the issue.\n\nReports from BBC news hold that petrol prices across the UK are at an eight-year high. The average price of petrol at UK forecourts was \u00a3135.10 a litre on Monday, up from \u00a3134.86 a week earlier. Also, diesel price per litre is observed to go up from \u00a3137.35 per litre to \u00a3137.95 over the same period, BBC media reports.",

          "text": "Nigerian airlines are seeking cheaper locations to repair and maintain their aircraft as dollar scarcity persists, people with a deep understanding of Nigeria\u2019s aviation sector say.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s aviation analyst on a trip to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and has observed that Ethiopian Airlines maintenance facility has aircraft and engines belonging to some Nigerian airlines undergoing routine and other levels of maintenance.\n\nPeople familiar with the matter say Nigerian airlines get foreign exchange from unofficial sources at about N550 per dollar, making it difficult to carry out their scheduled maintenance as at when due. This development has made airlines re-strategise on affordable options to get their maintenance done.\n\nSome of Nigeria\u2019s domestic carriers have plans to start local Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul, (MRO) facilities. This is not a reality yet and airlines are ferrying their aircraft to facilities offering cheaper rates.\n\nFor instance, some airlines are ferrying their aircraft to Ethiopia for periodic maintenance as the country offers them cheaper maintenance options than Europe and America, BusinessDay\u2019s findings show.\n\nBusinessDay also learnt that some Nigerian airlines recently took their aircraft back to Nigeria from Ethiopia after completing comprehensive maintenance.\n\nHenok Yazew Haile, acting manager, sales and marketing Ethiopian Airlines told BusinessDay that Nigerian airlines are bringing their aircraft for maintenance in Ethiopia airline\u2019s MRO facility because aircraft maintenance is cheaper here than in Europe, America, and other continents.\n\nHaile disclosed that they had just carried out maintenance on Medview aircraft and Air Peace Boeing 777 in Ethiopia, while Arik Air is currently rebranding its aircraft to the paint hangar section of Ethiopia Airlines\u2019 MRO.\n\nHe further disclosed that the firm is receiving orders to maintain more aircraft from Nigerian airlines and other countries.\n\n\u201cMore Nigerian airlines come here because of cost. We are cheaper than Europe or the US. We are the first choice for aircraft maintenance of African airlines. We are Africans, we have to grow each other and support each other. Ethiopian Airlines is the pride of Africa. So every African carrier should come to Ethiopia, he said.\n\nHaile however declined to speak on the average cost to maintain an aircraft in Ethiopia.\n\nEthiopian MRO performs the base and line maintenances under the approval of the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority (ETCAA). The base maintenance (Airframe, Engine, and Component shops) has had the FAA PART 145 Repair Station approvals since September 1968 and is currently approved for B737, B757, B767, B777, B787, Q400, and MD11.\n\nEthiopian MRO also holds EASA PART 145 approvals for both base and line maintenance at Addis Ababa for B737NG, B757, B767 and B777\n\nIn addition, the Ethiopian MRO base facility has the accreditation of Boeing as well as Bombardier as approve service facility.\n\nHowever, Obi Mbanuzuo, chief operating officer, Dana Air said Dana Air has not maintained its aircraft in Ethiopia but when its B737 was due for C-check Dana sent a Request for Quote (RFQ) to all its accredited MROs that it hoped to work with.\n\nAccording to Mbanuzuo, Ukraine, Ethiopian airlines and a maintenance facility in Naples Italy quoted for the job, adding that these quotes are not just a function of price but also turnaround time, warranty, who supplies parts, and other things.\n\nHe said after careful evaluation of all the quotes, it awarded the job to Naples and the aircraft went and is already back in Nigeria.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s checks show that it takes airlines an average of 30 to 50 days to carry out aircraft maintenance in Ethiopia depending on the work scope.\n\n\u201cIt is possible that if we request RFQ, what Ethiopian Airlines give to Arik (NG Eagle) might be much lower than what they give us (Dana) as they already have a relationship with Arik. In the same way, we have done business with Atitech in Italy for at least 10 years and get food rates from them,\u201d Mbanuzuo disclosed.\n\nGeorge Uriesi, chief operating officer at Ibom Air said Ibom Air hasn\u2019t maintained its aircraft in Ethiopia so it is difficult to say how affordable maintenance is at Ethiopia\u2019s MRO.\n\nUriesi told BusinessDay that strategically though, to avoid exorbitant maintenance costs, Ibom Air is focused on ensuring that all its maintenance is done in Uyo in the shortest possible time.\n\nA C- check on a Boeing 737 which is conducted between 12 to 18months costs the airlines between 800,000 dollars to 1million dollars. This amount does not include the cost of ferrying the aircraft abroad and other charges which will amount to over 200,000 dollars.\n\nJohn Ojikutu, member of aviation industry think tank group, Aviation Round Table (ART) and chief executive of Centurion Securities, told BusinessDay that one single C-check on one Boeing aircraft costs between 800,000 to 1million dollars.\n\nOjikutu said this amount is enough to wipe out one year of profit made by an airline, so if they get cheaper maintenance options, they will explore these options.\n\nNigerian airlines are also setting up MRO facilities in a bid to reduce capital flight, save cost and create job opportunities locally.\n\nAirPeace, United Airlines, and Ibom Air have concluded plans to set up MROs in Anambra Enugu and Akwa Ibom States respectively, with other airlines expected to pool into this as a way of getting the local industry to thrive better.\n\nAir Peace is partnering with the Anambra State Government to get Embraer of Brazil, the world\u2019s fourth-largest civilian aircraft manufacturer, to locate an MRO service centre for Africa in the state.",
          "summary": "BusinessDay\u2019s aviation analyst on a trip to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and has observed that Ethiopian Airlines maintenance facility has aircraft and engines belonging to some Nigerian airlines undergoing routine and other levels of maintenance.\nBusinessDay also learnt that some Nigerian airlines recently took their aircraft back to Nigeria from Ethiopia after completing comprehensive maintenance.\nHenok Yazew Haile, acting manager, sales and marketing Ethiopian Airlines told BusinessDay that Nigerian airlines are bringing their aircraft for maintenance in Ethiopia airline\u2019s MRO facility because aircraft maintenance is cheaper here than in Europe, America, and other continents.\nHe further disclosed that the firm is receiving orders to maintain more aircraft from Nigerian airlines and other countries.\nNigerian airlines are also setting up MRO facilities in a bid to reduce capital flight, save cost and create job opportunities locally.",

Other innocent road users have become victims of this menace with many losing their lives and others, their properties.\n\n\u201cBetween Sunday 26th and yesterday 28th September, 2021 attacks on citizens at Oko, Agulu, Obosi, Nkpor, Nnobi, Nnewi and other places have left about ten (10) people dead including an illustrious son of this State, Dr Chike Akunyili, husband of late Prof Dora Akunyili who was reportedly gunned down yesterday around Nkpor. These are our own people dying every day and for what reason?\n\n\u201cNdi Anambra, these attacks and accompanying deaths cannot be justified and must stop now.\n\n\u201cI have therefore conducted an extensive security meeting and have directed all Security Agencies to step up and confront this monster ravaging our land. I charge everyone involved in the security architecture of Anambra State to take very seriously, this threat to our livelihood and boldly rise to confront same. Everything that needs to be done will be done and no stone will be left unturned in this effort. My directive to this effect is clear and I urge every security personnel on duty in Anambra State to do his utmost best to secure our people.\n\n\u201cTo all citizens of Anambra State and every person living and doing business in our State, I urge you now to join forces with us to confront this common enemy. We cannot condone this savagery for any reason whatsoever. I therefore call on all our youths in the State to rise up and protect our communities.\n\n\u201cTraditional Rulers, Presidents General, Clergy men, Vigilante Groups and all leadership structures must now take responsibility and in conjunction with the Police, Military and other Law Enforcement Agencies, work to restore order immediately.\n\n\u201cTo reinforce our commitment and seriousness on this issue, I on behalf of the State Government, wish to announce a twenty million Naira (N20,000,000.00) reward for any useful information leading to the arrest of the perpetrators of these heinous attacks on our State. The people behind this must be unmasked and brought to book. I urge Citizens to report to us, anybody bearing firearm who is not a Security or Vigilante personnel, so we can deal with this monster, once and for all. Call 07039194332 or approach any Security deployment if you have any information. As the Americans say, IF YOU SEE SOMETHING, SAY SOMETHING.\n\n\u201cAt this point, I wish to most heartily condole with the families of all those who have lost their loved ones in the course of these senseless attacks. I promise you that we will leave no stone unturned in getting justice for them. May their souls rest in peace.\n\n\u201cFinally, I urge all citizens of the State to unite in this fight against all forms of terror, intimidation and tyranny. We will not succumb to invaders as I am convinced that no Anambra son will indulge in this kind of heartlessness. I warn all those promoting and participating in these violent attacks to leave our State or pay a high price as we will definitely catch up with them.\n\n\u201cTo all law abiding citizens and persons living in our State, I urge you to go about your lawful businesses but we must now ALL go to work and take back our State. This is Anambra, the Light of the Nation, where darkness has no place. The events of the last one week will not be allowed to fester and by God\u2019s grace, we shall overcome.\u201d",

It was a case of mistaken identity. It\u2019s totally condemnable.\u201d\n\nUwazurike who lamented the worsening security situation in Nigeria\u2019s Southeast, noted that some individuals have made it a point of duty to destabilize the zone.\n\nAccording to him, the attacks in the zone are \u201csynchronised to make the East ungovernable. They want anarchy. They are people who kill for pleasure and play football with human heads. It\u2019s totally condemnable.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, PDP youth leader, Emma Umeh @emmaikumeh, described the killing as a sad development, while condoning with the bereaved family.\n\n\u201cMy condolences to the family of the Akunyili\u2019s. This is really sad. The South East is now a war zone, we warned when ESN was formed that it was going to get bad. They killed 8 people yesterday.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of IPOB have lost total control. It\u2019s shameful. We need a proactive leadership right now.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting to the murder, Dr. Ayoade Alakija, @yodifiji said, \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken by the news of the senseless murder of Dr. Chike Akunyili. Absolutely heartbroken for his beautiful family, our dear Chidiogo, Njerika & the grandchildren. Nigeria cannot continue to destroy her own legacy like this. This is a country at war.\u201d\n\nSimilarly the Senate on Wednesday, observed a minute silence to mourn Akunyili\u2019s murder.\n\nAccording to the statement by the Special Assistant (Press) to the President of the Senate, Ezrel Tabiowo, on Wednesday, the late doctor was mourned following a point of order raised by Senator Uche Ekwunife, representing Anambra Central.\n\nThe statement titled, \u2018Senate mourns brutal killing of Dr. Chike Akunyili\u2019 partly read, \u201cComing under order 43 of the Senate Standing Rules \u2013 Personal Explanation, Ekwunife noted with concern that on Tuesday 28th September, 2021, Dr. Chike Akunyili was gunned down in a most gruesome and very horrifying manner at Afor Nkpor, Anambra State.\n\n\u201cAccording to the lawmaker, the late Dr. Chike Akunyili, until his death, was the Medical Director of St. Leo Hospital Enugu. She noted that he also was an established academician, medical director, and one who had contributed to the development of healthcare in Nigeria.\n\nMeanwhile, separatist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), has denied having any hand in the \u2018senseless\u2019 killing of Dr. Akunyili and other killings in the Southeast, noting that the killings were politically motivated.\n\nWitness accounts had suggested that the killers may have been unknown gunmen who are sympathetic to the agitation for a separate state of Biafra in the zone, with many pointing fingers at IPOB.\n\nHowever, the denied any involvement, noting that the masterminds of killings in the Southeast are taking advantage of the current situation in the region to unleash mayhem on their political opponents.\n\nThe Director of Media and Publicity of the secessionist group, Emma Powerful, aired the group\u2019s view in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe the great family of the Indigenous People of Biafra ably led by our great leader Mazi Nnamdi Okwuchukkwu Kanu, wish to dissociate ourselves from the senseless killing of innocent citizens in Anambra State. We have no hands in the political killings going on in Biafra land. We have at several times raised the alarm that some cruel politicians are hiding under the cloak of the situation in Biafra land to eliminate their political enemies and blame it on IPOB.\n\n\u201cWe also wish to clarify that IPOB has never issued an official statement that there would be no governorship election in Anambra State. Those peddling such rumour are not our members and should be ignored. Our position on the Anambra election will be made public at the right time through our normal channels of information dissemination. Anything to the contrary should be disregarded.\u201d\n\nIPOB further claimed that those who killed Prof Akunyili were responsible for the death of her husband.\n\n\u201cThose who killed Dora Akunyili husband killed his wife with poison because she exposed the death of Yar\u2019Adua for Goodluck Ebele Jonathan to take over as President of Nigeria, they know themselves, they conspired to poison Prof. Dora Akunyili.\u201d\n\nIt added, \u201cWe have no issues with Chike Akunyili and we don\u2019t know him, those behind this act must stop this and stop using IPOB\u2019s name, we don\u2019t want anybody to blame IPOB because we must get them, this is purely a political assassination going on in Anambra State now.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that those that burnt Anambra Government House and other parts of the state some years back are back to use intimidations and killings to subdue their opponents ahead of the governorship election in Anambra State.\u201d",

          "text": "President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda was at risk of being derailed by divisions among his own Democrats, as moderates voiced anger on Wednesday at the idea of delaying a $1 trillion infrastructure bill ahead of a critical vote to avert a government shutdown.\n\nThe White House said talks over twin bills that would revitalize the nation\u2019s roads and airports and fund social programs and climate change measures, were at a \u201cprecarious\u201d point.\n\nThis was because moderates and progressives disagreed over the scope of some $4 trillion in spending.\n\nCongress, which Democrats control by a razor-thin margin, is due to vote on a bipartisan resolution to fund federal operations through early December before funding expires at midnight on Thursday.\n\nThe House of Representatives is expected to vote on Thursday on a $1 trillion infrastructure bill already passed by the Senate, although some party leaders warned that vote could be delayed again \u2013 which would dismay moderates.\n\nRepresentative Stephanie Murphy, a moderate Democrat who backs the infrastructure bill, warned against defeat or delay of the legislation.\n\n\u201cIf the vote were to fail tomorrow or be delayed, there would be a significant breach of trust that would slow the momentum in moving forward in delivering the Biden agenda,\u201d she told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nWith House progressives warning they will vote against the infrastructure bill until a deal is reached on the separate multi-trillion-dollar plan focused on social spending and climate, the vote was not guaranteed.\n\n\u201cThe only way the vote happens (Thursday) is if we have the votes to pass the bill,\u201d Representative Dan Kildee, House Democrats\u2019 chief deputy whip, told reporters.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer went to the White House on Wednesday afternoon to meet Biden, a former senator himself, who canceled a trip to Chicago to lead negotiations with Congress.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re obviously at a precarious and important time,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Wednesday.\n\nA White House staffer met at the Capitol with moderate Democratic Senator Kyrsten Sinema, who has expressed deep concern over the size of Biden\u2019s plans and has the power to block them due to the Democrats\u2019 narrow control of the Senate.\n\nIf the resolution to fund the government passes the Senate, the House could vote quickly to send the measure to Biden to sign into law, averting a partial government shutdown in the midst of a national health crisis.\n\nBiden\u2019s Democrats campaigned on a platform of responsible government after Republican Donald Trump\u2019s turbulent four years in office.\n\nRepublican Senator John Cornyn expressed optimism on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cDemocrats don\u2019t want to shut down the government. Republicans don\u2019t want to shut down the government. That will supply the result that we all expect, which is to keep the lights on,\u201d he told a news conference.\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Democrats have tried to pass legislation that both funds the government and heads off a potentially catastrophic federal government default by raising the nation\u2019s $28.4 trillion debt ceiling.\n\nBut they have been thwarted by Republicans who want Democrats to use a parliamentary maneuver to act alone on the debt limit issue.\n\nThe government will hit the ceiling around Oct. 18, an event that could cause a historic default with long-lasting economic fallout and implications for financial markets.\n\nSchumer has demanded bipartisan cooperation on the issue, arguing that it addresses debts racked up during both Democratic and Republican administrations.\n\nThe House passed a bill on Wednesday suspending the limit through December 2022, by a mostly partisan vote.\n\nIt now goes to the Senate, where it is expected to be blocked by Republicans again.\n\nInvestment bank Goldman Sachs this month described the standoff as \u201cthe riskiest debt-limit deadline in a decade.\u201d",

          "text": "The Senate Wednesday told President Muhammadu Buhari to declare bandits as terrorists and wage total war against them.\n\nClassification of bandits as terrorists by the Senate came on the heels of killings being carried out by the criminal elements across the three senatorial zones of Sokoto state.\n\nMassive killings of innocent lives in Sokoto state, totalling about 500 within the last two months, was brought to the attention of the red chamber by Senator Ibrahim Abdullahi Gobir (APC Sokoto East ), through a motion sponsored along with eight other lawmakers.\n\nIn the motion titled: \u201cBanditry in Sokoto State,\u201d Senator Gobir said the eastern senatorial district of the state had now become a safe haven for bandits due to the ongoing crackdown against them in Zamfara state.\n\nHe specifically lamented that on Saturday, 25th September, 2021, Twenty One (21) Security Personnel were killed in Dama and Gangara villages by rampaging bandits, 15 of them soldiers, 3 Mobile Police and 3 members of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps; in addition to yet to be ascertained number of civilians from neighbouring villages.\n\nThis, he explained, had gone to portray the seriousness of the problem which requires concerted and urgent action by the declaration of total war on banditry by the Nigerian government.\n\nHe said losing such number of trained security personnel would further deplete the numerical strength of the nation\u2019s security agencies and jeopardise the security architecture of the country.\n\nGobir said: \u201cNo section of the State within the last two months has not been attacked in one way or the other by the bandits with attendant loss of innocent lives totalling about 500 when figures are put together from one affected community to the other.\n\n\u201cNot less than 50,000 Nigerians have hurriedly relocated to Niger Republic as a result of incessant attacks of armed bandits on their communities.\n\n\u201cWhile the crackdown on the bandits was taking place in Zamfara State, no concrete measures have been taken in Sokoto State leaving it totally exposed to the activities of the bandits which made most of them to relocate to Sabon Birni and Isa Local Governments.\u201d\n\nThe lawmaker further lamented that the present military onslaught on the bandits \u201cis not well co-ordinated because it is only being orchestrated in Zamfara State instead of all the frontline States ravaged by banditry, i.e. Sokoto, Katsina, Niger and Kaduna States.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe operation should be holistic instead of restrictive in order to produce effective and the desired results,\u201d he stressed.\n\nVirtually all the lawmakers who spoke on the matter, including Senators Uche Ekwunife (PDP Anambra Central) and Ali Ndume (APC Borno South), called on government and security agencies to make the war against banditry and insurgency in the country, a well coordinated and potent one.\n\nIn his remarks, Senate President Ahmad Lawan commended the security agencies were doing their best in curtailing crimes and criminalities in the country.\n\nHe, however, called for improved appropriation for the armed forces to meet their needs, even as he said concerned committees should ensure the monies were appropriately used.\n\nHe said: \u201cDistinguished colleagues, I think the issue of insecurity is one issue we will never get tired of debating here, and we must commend our Armed Forces and other Security Agencies.\n\n\u201cThey give their lives in trying to secure this country, and that is the ultimate sacrifice anybody could pay. I believe that they are doing their best, but we also need to do our best as a government by giving them the kind of resources that they need.\n\n\u201cI believe we have done that in the supplementary budget like pointed out, but we also need to improve the annual appropriation for them.\n\n\u201cIf we could pass over N800 billion in the supplementary budget, I don\u2019t see why we cannot improve the resources up to N1 trillion and then hold our security agencies accountable.\n\n\u201cAnd I believe that we need to monitor the procurement processes when we give such kind of resources to our Armed Forces.\n\n\u201cThe security related committees, particularly the armed forces related committees \u2013 Defence, Army, Navy and Airforce Committees \u2013 need to work very closely on the procurement processes by these services.\n\n\u201cWe must ensure that funds appropriated are not put in the wrong areas, and ensure that this fight is taken to its logical conclusion.\u201d\n\nResolutions\n\nIn its resolutions, the Senate also urged President Buhari to declare all the known leadership of the bandits wanted and track them wherever they are for arrest and prosecution; and as well directed the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and other disaster management outfits, to as a matter of urgency, give all the necessary supports to victims of the menace of banditry in Sokoto and other parts of the country.\n\nKilling of Akunyili, others\n\nIn a related development, gunmen, Tuesday, killed Dr Chike Akunyili, the husband of late Professor Dora Akunyili, former Director General National Agency for Food and Drug and Administration (NAFDAC).\n\nAccording to reports, Akunyili was shot dead by gun-wielding women at Nkpor junction in Idemili North local government area Anambra state while returning from an event where his late wife was honoured by the University of Nigeria Nsukka Alumni Association (UNAA), Onitsha branch.\n\nAlthough the state Police command was yet to confirm the report, a viral video showed the deceased in the pool of his blood.\n\n\u201cGod, please render the devil and his agents powerless and useless. I was with this man yesterday (Tuesday) same yesterday at Sharon Hall, All Saints Cathedral, Onitsha. It was an occasion of University of Nigeria Nsukka Alumni Association (UNAA), Onitsha branch event where they honoured late Dora Akunyili.\n\n\u201cHe spoke glowingly about Dora and made a donation of 500k (N500, 000) to the association.\n\n\u201cHe was there with his son, Obum now working with Anambra state government. We saw them off to the car and it was emotional when Obum hugged him tight as both of them separated to join their respective vehicles. \u201cObum was in a white Hilux while the man was in a big Jeep (I think Prado). God have mercy!\u201da source stated.\n\nOn what could be the deceased\u2019s offence, another source claimed he was not the target but \u201chis sin is that his security wanted to clear the road because of a heavy traffic at Nkpor. Some girls and boy with covered face started shooting at them immediately they saw the security guys clearing the road. He saw what was happening and wanted to move out of his jeep, the girls faced him and fired him.\u201d\n\nOhaneze, CAN call for unity\n\nThe Ohanaeze Ndigbo and Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) have called for unity among the Igbo nation.\n\nThe two groups which lamented constant killings in Igbo land called for unity among members of the nation.\n\nThey made the call Wednesday during a prayer summit to mark the World Igbo Day at the Christian Ecumenical Centre, Abakaliki.\n\nIt was organised by Ebonyi state branch of Ohanaeze Ndigbo in collaboration with the state government.\n\nRepresenting the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo George Obiozor, Secretary General of the group, Okey Emuche, noted that Igbo land was under siege.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe need to take a pulse concerning Igbo nation, we need to seek the face of God, we need to remember our brothers and sisters who have been killed over the years.\n\n\u201cBut more importantly we need to think about today, the Igbo nation is under siege, too many killings. As I sat there waiting for the event to start, a video was sent to me about the latest killing in Anambra state- the husband of late Professor Dora Akunyili was brutally murdered.\n\n\u201cThe killings for the last couple of days in Anambra state calls for introspection, called for a pulse. We are under siege; the southeast states are under siege.\n\nWe plead with the men of God gathered here, the CAN are here, mothers, fathers are here, something urgent needs to be done; this is the message of the PG of Ohanaeze.\n\n\u201cHe has asked IPOB to think and to think deeply because if you kill every person, who will be there?\n\n\u201cWe need to take a pulse as a people and understand what is confronting us. Beyond sit-at-home, these killings that have started went round from one state to the other maiming lives for the Igbo people.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Chairman Southeast CAN Rev. Fr. Abraham Nwali expressed the need for Igbo people to be united.\n\n\u201cIgbo people should unite. Ohaneze Ndigbo General and Ohanaeze youth should unite. If the church is not united, the Igbo nation will be in difficulty. Igbo leaders, traditional rulers and chiefs should come together and seek for unity of Igbo people.\n\n\u201cEnugu, Ebonyi, Igbo nation should come up with an enterprise that will boost its resources that they can stand on their own,\u201d the cleric said.\n\nReprisal in Plateau\n\nIn a related development, four persons were reportedly ambushed and killed in what seems a reprisal in the crises-prone areas of Bassa local government area of Plateau State.\n\nSpokesman of Irigwe Development Association (IDA) Malison Davidson said two of the deceased persons were killed while moving on their motorcycle around Twin Hill Road, Jebbu Miango, Miango District of Rigwe Chiefdom in the local government area, while two others were later found dead in the farm.\n\nHowever, spokesman of the state Police command, ASP Ubah Ogaba, confirmed that only two persons were killed.\n\nBlueprint reports that last week, at least three herders were killed and more than a dozen of their cows rustled at Tashan Maude village near a poultry beside Rafin Bauna in Irigwe chiefdom, while three herders were separately attacked and killed as well.\n\nKaduna shuts down telecoms\n\nMeanwhile, Kaduna state government Wednesday directed the shutdown of telecommunications services in the state.\n\nThis, the government said, was to check influx of bandits from Zamfara and Katsina states.\n\nCommissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs Samuel Aruwan disclosed this at a press conference in Kaduna.\n\nHe also announced the ban on all motorcycles across the state for three months.\n\nGovernor el-Rufai had in a chat with local broadcast media Tuesday evening said bandits were now coming into the state from Katsina and Zamfara states to make calls and demand ransom.\n\nAccording to Aruwan, relevant federal agencies had already informed the state government that the processes for telecoms shutdown in parts of the state had commenced.\n\n\u201cI am here to announce the implementation of certain measures to assist the security agencies in parts of the state. Governor Nasir el-Rufai announced in a media chat yesterday (Tuesday) that the state government has formally requested the Federal Government to enforce the shutdown of telecom services in parts of the state identified by security agencies as requiring such measures.\n\n\u201cThe relevant federal agencies have today informed the Kaduna state government that the processes for telecoms shutdown in parts of the state have commenced. As part of the steps to address the current security situation in Kaduna state and neighbouring states in the North-West and North-Central regions, KDSG has held several meetings with security agencies to adopt critical measures towards crushing bandits in their identified hideouts.\n\n\u201cThe military and other security forces have been carrying out assaults on the identified locations. The state government is advised that certain measures are now necessary to assist the spirited efforts of these security agencies. The following measures become effective from Thursday, 30 September 2021:\n\n\u201cThe complete ban on the use of motorcycles (Okada) for commercial or personal purposes for three months in the first instance. Ban on possession of or wielding of dangerous weapons. Tricycles are allowed to operate only from 6am to 7pm. All tricycles must remove all curtains. Movement of all tricycles is restricted from dusk till dawn (7pm to 6am).\n\n\u201cAll vehicles used for commercial transport must be painted in yellow and black within 30 days. Vehicles that are part of ride hailing services are to carry yellow and black stripes. Ban on the sale of petrol in jerry cans or other containers in Birnin Gwari, Giwa, Chikun, Igabi, Kachia, Kagarko and Kajuru LGAs persists.\n\n\u201cOther containment measures previously communicated by the Kaduna state government remain in place. These include: ban on felling of trees and forestry activities in Birnin Gwari, Giwa, Igabi, Chikun, Kachia, Kagarko and Kajuru LGAs, ban on firewood and charcoal transportation and ban on the transportation of livestock into and out of the state.\n\n\u201cOthers include cessation of weekly markets in the front line local government areas of Birnin Gwari, Giwa, Chikun, Igabi, Kajuru and Kawo weekly market of Kaduna North local government. The Kaduna state government regrets the severe strain and inconvenience these measures will place on peaceful and law abiding citizens.\n\n\u201cThe government therefore appeals for the understanding and cooperation of all residents of the affected areas, and indeed across the State. These difficult times have demand that difficult decisions be made. The measures have been adopted purely in the interest of our collective safety and security, and to aid our brave forces in their fight against these mindless criminals.\n\n\u201cToo many lives have been lost, and too many families have been shattered. Small groups of wicked persons cannot continue to hold us to ransom, and force us to live in perpetual fear. Once again, the government craves the understanding of all citizens. The hardship we face will be temporary, and we are confident that in the end, it will pay off. Good will prevail over evil,\u201d Aruwan said.",

          "text": "To adequately police and protect a nation\u2019s territorial integrity through the land, air, and sea, efforts must be geared towards procurement of sophisticated armaments for the Armed Forces, as well as invest inadequate training of personnel on new trends in strategy, tact, leadership, fighting skills, and weapon handling. This in addition to building capability in local manufacturing of the needed military hardware and logistics equipment, writes our Defence correspondent LINUS ALEKE.\n\nThough no nation is an island onto itself when it comes to manufacturing of light and lethal military armaments and logistics equipment, but some are more equal than others.\n\nWhile, the United States, Russian China, UK, Israel, France, Iran, North Korea, Japan, India, Brazil, and Pakistan, may be self sufficient in the area of manufacturing of these armaments and logistics equipment, they still depend on each other for certain hardware so as to maintain balance of force.\n\nRegrettably, most nations in Africa have not build the technical capability of becoming self sufficient in weapon manufacturing, and hence depend on other advanced nations for their supplies, even when its territories are battle field for terrorism, insurgency, sea piracy human trafficking amongst several other ills that depend on light and lethal weapons to execute their nefarious mandate.\n\nThe Nigerian Armed Forces is not insulated from this abnormality in the continent. However, the Armed Forces of Nigeria, especially the Nigerian Navy is making effort to bridge this identified gap.\n\nBut before presenting the graphic details of what the service had done thus far in this regard, it is imperative to also highlight the effort of Federal Government in the area of fleet renewal for the service.\n\nThe Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS), Vice Admiral AZ Gambo posited that the NN\u2019s ability to effectively deliver improved maritime security for the nation would be greatly enhanced if critical equipment shortfall in the areas of operating platforms and key infrastructure are addressed.\n\nThe CNS who said this while delivering a paper at Bayero University Kano, during the recently concluded Chief of the Naval Staff Annual Conference 2021further averred that the critical platforms including ships and aircraft are crucial for maritime operations.\n\n\u201cNotably, Mr President Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Federal Republic of Nigeria recently granted approval for the NN to acquire 2 x Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs). Furthermore, the NN seeks to strengthen ongoing discussions with Original Equipment Manufacturers to commence local manufacturing/fabrication of spares as a sustainable means of guaranteeing fleet availability and readiness,\u201d Vice Admiral Gambo said.\n\nEnumerating the indigenous ship building effort of the Nigerian Navy, the CNS said: \u201cThe NN Research and Developmental efforts gained traction with local construction and production of equipment that erstwhile are usually vendor-driven and are sourced from manufacturers outside the country.\n\n\u201cIn line with this, the NN initiated an indigenous ship design/building with the construction of Tugboat COMMANDER UGWU and Seaward Defence Boats namely; 31.3m NNS ANDONI and 38m NNS KARADUWA while a third 43m SDB is currently under construction at the Naval Dockyard Limited (NDL).\n\n\u201cThe vessel is programmed to join the Service by the Fourth quarter of this year\u201d.\n\nThe CNS also disclosed that about 170 riverine patrol boats were also built in-country, thus complementing indigenous shipbuilding capacity, employment generation and skills acquisition.\n\nHe noted that these efforts have made the desired positive impacts on the nation\u2019s socio economic development.\n\nThe number one Naval officer said that, \u201crequisite hydrographic capability is one of the key enablers in the attainment of a sustainable blue economy for the nation. The NN intends to develop hydrographic capacity beyond mere surveys to the production of relevant charts to incorporating data relevant to the blue economy and national security. Recently, the NN has upgraded its Hydrography Department to produce navigational and bathymetric charts. This has caused reduction in foreign exchange losses previously deployed to procure these charts.\n\n\u201cProspective hydrographic surveys would be governed by the principle of \u2018one data collection, multiple usage\u2019 to facilitate its use in support of hydro-seismic data, safety of navigation and military applications. Thus, to bolster its hydrographic survey capability, the NN recently acquired a Hydrographic Survey Vessel NNS LANA. Also, arising from the extant Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the NN and Nigerian Export and Import Bank, the NN recently took delivery of some hydrographic survey equipment procured by the Bank.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, efforts are ongoing to upgrade the NN Hydrographic Department to a National Hydrographic Agency (NHA) by 2025 to attract independent funding to drive attainment of its future objectives in line with best practices. This development would further boost the maritime trade and shipping activities along the nation\u2019s maritime domain for enhanced national development\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on some of the measures the service put in place to guarantee safe maritime environment, the CNS said: \u201cA commendable stride has also been made by the NN in the enhancement of its surveillance capabilities through a Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) project to enhance our maritime security architecture. The twin but complementary systems of the Regional Maritime Awareness Capability (RMAC) facility and the FALCON EYE system leverage modern technology to enhance the safeguard of immense hydrocarbon and other mineral resources in the nation\u2019s maritime domain with highly encouraging outputs. The FALCON EYE System incorporates surveillance and intelligence capabilities which allows for real time monitoring of activities in the nation\u2019s maritime environment. This facilitates decision making on shipping activities, maritime safety and violation of maritime laws.\n\n\u201cThe FALCON EYE system played a key role in the rescue of the crew of Chinese FV HAILUFENG II by NN in 2020. In addition, the intelligence generated from the 2 systems led to the arrest of over 30 vessels engaged in IUUF as well as the arrest of over 50 pirates. With these assets, the NN is better positioned to guarantee maritime security which in turn will boost Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas production and other maritime activities that are essential for the sustenance of the nation\u2019s economy\u201d.\n\nThe Chief of Naval Staff nonetheless said that in spite of improved FGN intervention in support of various NN engagements, the current level of statutory funding for the NN is still far below the requirement to sustain a force capable of discharging its roles effectively.\n\n\u201cFor instance, it requires about 800,000 litres of AGO to sail NNS THUNDER for 14-21 days continuous sea patrol. This is without adding costs for other essentials such as water, rations, operational allowances, personal protection equipment, arms and ammunition. The cost of sustaining a ship such as NNS THUNDER and the entire NN Fleet can thus be better imagined. Inadequacy of funds affects ship availability and sustainability for effective maritime response. It is only rational therefore, that the NN considers the option of stakeholder contributions to the logistics cost of sustaining the NN fleet in furtherance of maritime security. Accordingly, NN recently made a presentation at the National Assembly on a bill for an act to establish the Nigerian Maritime Trust Fund for the purpose of training, provision of security equipment and related facilities to enhance the skills of personnel of the NN,\u201d he proposed.\n\nHe further theorized that in the foreseeable future, the maritime domain would continue to provide the mainstay of the nation\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cTo enhance NN\u2019s ability to effectively address emerging challenges for improved operational efficiency, the Service is articulating new perspectives taking into cognizance its past experiences, current operational realities and the contemporary strategic security environment,\u201d he conclueded.",

          "title": "Insecurity will persist unless Nigerians are meaningfully engaged \u2013 APC chieftain -NigPilot",
          "text": "A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, and Director-General of Progressive Governors Forum, PGF, Dr. Salihu Moh. Lukman has said that the country will continue to be confronted with the security challenges it is currently facing as long as a majority of Nigerians were not properly and meaningfully engaged.\n\nLukman, who noted that security agencies in the country were already overstretched stressed that governments at various levels must find a way of making positive use of the abundant human resources because the over-reliance on oil revenue will not solve the problems.\n\nThe PGF DG said contrary to insinuations that the spate of insecurity appears to have worsened since the APC administration came to power in 2015, the insurgency was not the only problem troubling the country pre-2015, stressing that there were cases of cattle rustling in the entire North as far back as 2013 as well as kidnapping in the Southern parts of the country.\n\nLukman also took time to explain some of the measures he thinks should be implemented to make the APC to function more effectively as a real progressive political party.\n\n\u201cI believe as a party, immediately after the Convention, the first thing the new leadership should do is to have a membership data that is computerized. We can\u2019t continue to have a situation where our membership data is not electronically preserved. We must ensure that our membership data is updated electronically without the tedious process of handling it in an analog way.\n\n\u201cSecondly, we must have a national secretariat because membership is everything to a political party, a situation where the administrative framework of the national secretariat is so weak and loosed that it links to what is obtainable at the local government and state levels and creates its own complications. So the first thing the new leadership must do is to reorganize the national secretariat in such a way it has that organic relation between it and all the structures of the party so that at the ward level, even if somebody leaves the party, it will be immediately known by the national leadership, and if somebody joins the party, he should be quietly be registered at the ward without the noise in the media, it should be seamless.\u201d\n\nThe DG of the PGF also spoke on the internal crisis that has rocked the party insisting that it is not a problem experienced only by the APC, adding that as a convergence of people from diverse backgrounds and interests, there are bound to be minor disagreements which do not necessarily mean that the party will implode.\n\nHe noted that even before and even immediately after the meager that brought about the APC, many analysts had thought that the party was going to disintegrate, assuring that whatever seems to be the situation today will still be handled by the party.\n\n\u201cIt is important to return to the basic framework that every party is an organization that has various interests. It is difficult to have a political party where people do not have diverse interests. But the most important is to have and build a party where the aggregation of the various interests will be able to win the mandate.\n\n\u201cThe major issue is that even before the merger, there is the notion that parties do not have the power to win the confidence of the people as it were. I also do not think that while negotiating for the merger, nobody believed it was going to be a party that can appeal to everybody. Even some people in the merger had sympathy for the PDP then.\n\n\u201cOne basic issue is the need to have strong point about the need to institute reconciliation within the party. The major issue we have insisted is that you can\u2019t have a political party without a credible membership register. Good enough the Caretaker Committee bought that idea and we have done it and that is the basic of the new book I have written. It is a contribution to help in an advisory capacity to support the leadership to know what needs to be done to make the party appeal to the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lukman, the party must be run democratically where all the organs have the opportunity to discharge their functions unlike what obtained in the last National Working Committee (NWC) that did not function in tandem with the books of the party.\n\n\u201cThere is the need for the party to be democratic which means that organs of the party should be meeting regularly to be taking decisions; when we talk about party supremacy, it is not the position of an individual leader that should serve as supremacy of the party when the organs are not meeting which is the major issue with the last NWC, the National executive Committee (NEC) wasn\u2019t meeting, the only organ that was meeting was the administrative organ and it was difficult at that time to now say that the Constitution of the party was being respected.\n\n\u201cThe second issue is what we can call the ideological thrust of the party. This is the party that was envisioned to be progressive, what it means to be progressive has to do with the capacity to issue related to governance and politics and decisions in terms of what is in the best interest of the people. This is a very hard decision, they may not be attractive but generally, being progressive is about taking popular decisions, it is not about those cheap decisions that people take and which is why my basic position is that these are not issues that can be sorted out if you don\u2019t go back to lay solid foundation in terms of how the party recruits members, for instance, and this is not just with the APC, it is basically the same for every political party.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between the political parties and Nigerians is so weak and that is the argument I am canvassing in that book, it dwells on the type of relationship the party should have with interest groups, non government actors, youth organizations, women organizations, persons living with disabilities.\u201d",
          "summary": "A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, and Director-General of Progressive Governors Forum, PGF, Dr. Salihu Moh.\nLukman also took time to explain some of the measures he thinks should be implemented to make the APC to function more effectively as a real progressive political party.\n\u201cIt is important to return to the basic framework that every party is an organization that has various interests.\nIt is difficult to have a political party where people do not have diverse interests.\nThe major issue we have insisted is that you can\u2019t have a political party without a credible membership register.",

          "text": "Cristiano Ronaldo marked his record-breaking 178th Champions League appearance with a 95th-minute winner as Manchester United snatched a 2-1 victory over Villarreal at Old Trafford on Wednesday.\n\nThe five-time Ballon d\u2019Or winner had barely threatened until he fired past Geronimo Rulli at the back post to ease the mounting pressure on United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with virtually the last kick of the game.\n\nUnited were staring down the barrel of another embarrassing group stage exit from the Champions League after deservedly falling behind early in the second half to Paco Alcacer\u2019s smart finish.\n\nAlex Telles\u2019 stunning strike quickly levelled, but a sixth draw from open play in as many meetings between the sides was on the cards until Ronaldo\u2019s late intervention.\n\nDespite the result, there was little in the performance to quell the growing questions as to whether Solskjaer is the man to get the best out of a squad of supremely talented individuals that are yet to click as a collective.\n\nBruno Fernandes\u2019 stoppage-time penalty that ended up in the Stretford End condemned United to a 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa on Saturday, but Solskjaer showed his backing for the Portuguese midfielder by handing him the captain\u2019s armband in the absence of Harry Maguire.\n\nLuke Shaw was also missing due to injury, while Aaron Wan-Bissaka was suspended after being sent off in the 2-1 defeat to Young Boys on matchday one.\n\nA makeshift United defence looked as such in the first half as Villarreal wasted a host of chances to inflict more misery on the Red Devils after beating them in May to win the Europa League.\n\nArnaut Danjuma toyed with stand-in United right-back Diogo Dalot, but the Dutch winger firstly fired straight at David de Gea and was then denied by a brilliant finger-tip stop by the Spanish goalkeeper.\n\nDe Gea was the fall guy in the Europa League final as he was the only player of the 22 on both sides to fail to score in a marathon penalty shootout.\n\nREAD ALSO: Chelsea Lose To Juventus, Records Second Defeat In A Row\n\nUnited Fall Behind\n\nHowever, he has started the season in supreme form and was needed to save his side once more midway through the first half to turn Alcacer\u2019s header over.\n\nAlcacer then fired wide with just De Gea to beat after an error from Raphael Varane and botched a two-on-one counter-attack with a poor pass to Yeremi Pino.\n\nUnited did not heed their first-half warnings as eight minutes into the second period another promising break from Danjuma finally got the finish it deserved as Alcacer prodded through the legs of De Gea at the near post.\n\nTelles was at fault for the opening goal as he played Danjuma onside.\n\nBut the Brazilian quickly made amends in spectacular fashion as he volleyed home Fernandes\u2019 free-kick from outside the area.\n\nSolskjaer had named an extremely offensive line-up with Ronaldo flanked by Jadon Sancho and Mason Greenwood, and Paul Pogba alongside Fernandes in midfield.\n\nBut it was another night to forget Sancho since his \u00a373 million move from Borussia Dortmund in July.\n\nThe England winger was easily kept in check by Juan Foyth before being replaced 15 minutes from time by Edinson Cavani.\n\nThe Uruguayan had a golden chance to instantly make himself the hero, but somehow headed wide with the goal gaping from Greenwood\u2019s perfect cross.\n\nDe Gea saved United once more five minutes from time in a goalmouth scramble to deny Moi Gomez and Boulaye Dia.\n\nAnd Villarreal\u2019s profligacy in front of goal came back to haunt them as the all-time top goalscorer in Champions League history showed them how to finish.\n\nJesse Lingard turned a loose ball Ronaldo\u2019s way deep into stoppage time and his effort had too much power for Rulli.\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Lava from an erupting volcano on Spain\u2019s La Palma island has reached the Atlantic Ocean, raising fears of toxic gases being released and explosions.\n\nClouds of white steam were seen rising as a red-hot current made contact with the water in the Playa Nueva area.\n\nThis could trigger a chemical reaction which can irritate the skin and eyes and affect breathing.\n\nHundreds of homes have been destroyed since the Cumbre Vieja volcano in the Canary Islands erupted on 19 September.\n\nAbout 6,000 people have been evacuated, as the lava was engulfing houses, schools and some banana plantations.\n\nThe lava reached the ocean late on Tuesday, the Canary Islands Volcanic Institute, Involcan, tweeted.\n\nThere are also fears that parts of the shoreline could now collapse, triggering explosions.\n\nThree coastal villages were earlier locked down in anticipation of the lava making contact with the water.\n\nThe Spanish authorities have declared La Palma \u2013 the most north-westerly island of the archipelago off the north African coast \u2013 a disaster zone, pledging financial support for all those affected by the volcanic activity.\n\nWhen lava comes into contact with ocean water, it produces a gas plume known as laze \u2013 lava and haze.\n\nLaze forms through a series of chemical reactions as hot lava boils the colder sea water.\n\n\u201cIt creates a steam of hydrochloric acid, water vapour and bits of ash,\u201d science journalist and volcanologist Dr Robin George Andrews told the BBC when the volcano first erupted. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s not good to breathe in.\u201d\n\nLaze plumes can cause eye, lung and skin irritation but should not be a problem if residents keep their distance, he said.\n\nVolcanic explosions were also possible, he added, because lava entering sea water creates \u201ca pressure-cooker situation\u201d that \u201cmight fling out volcanic debris\u201d.\n\nThere was an incident in Hawaii where a chunk of molten rock, known as a lava bomb, crashed into a tourist boat off Hawaii\u2019s coast in 2018, injuring 23 people.\n\nAuthorities have set up an exclusion zone around the lava, including in the sea, to keep people away from any potential danger.",

          "text": "Boxing legend Manny Pacquiao has announced his retirement from the sport to focus on his political career.\n\nThe multi-division world champion, who is a senator in his native Philippines, has already announced his intention to run for president in the country\u2019s 2022 elections.\n\nThe 42-year-old\u2019s final fight was a defeat by Cuba\u2019s Yordenis Ugas in Las Vegas last month.\n\n\u201cI just heard the final bell. Boxing is over,\u201d said Pacquiao.\n\nIn a video posted on social media, Pacquiao described retiring as the \u201chardest decision\u201d of his life, adding boxing had given him \u201cthe chance to fight my way out of poverty\u201d and \u201cthe courage to change more lives\u201d.\n\nHe also thanked his fans, friends and all those who supported him throughout his career, most notably long-time trainer Freddie Roach, who he described as \u201cmy family, a brother and a friend\u201d.\n\n\u201cI will never forget what I have done and accomplished in my life,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter growing up in poverty in the south of the Philippines, Pacquiao moved to the capital Manila as a teenager to start a boxing career that would make him one of the world\u2019s most highly paid athletes.\n\nHe won his first major title in 1998 at the age of 19, defeating Thailand\u2019s Chatchai Sasakul for the WBC flyweight title.\n\nWithin three years he was fighting in Las Vegas, beating South Africa\u2019s Lehlohonolo Ledwaba for the IBF super bantamweight title at the MGM Grand, the venue for most of his fights in the following two decades.\n\nHe is now regarded as one of the greatest professional boxers of all time, winning 12 different titles across eight weight divisions and is the only boxer to hold world championships across four decades.\n\nIn July 2019, Pacquiao became the oldest welterweight world champion in history at the age of 40 when he defeated Keith Thurman to win the WBA (Super) welterweight title, though he was stripped of the title in January 2021 because of inactivity.\n\nSpeaking after his defeat to Ugas in August, Pacquiao said he was \u201c60-40\u201d in favour of quitting.\n\nHe retires with a record of 62 wins, eight defeats and two draws.\n\nPacquiao entered politics in 2010 when he won a seat in the lower house of the Philippines congress, before being elected for a six-year term in the upper chamber in 2016.\n\nHe confirmed earlier this month his intention to run for president after he was nominated as a candidate by a faction of the ruling party, PDP-Laban.",
