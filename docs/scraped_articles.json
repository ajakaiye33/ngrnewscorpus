          "text": "A three-man panel of the Court of Appeal, Lagos Division, led by Justice Peter Affem, on Wednesday upheld the appeal of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and dismissed the ruling of a Federal High Court in Lagos in the case involving a former Executive Director, Projects, Niger Delta Development Commission, Tuoyo Omatsuli.\n\nOmatsuli is facing prosecution alongside Francis Momoh, Don Parker Properties Limited, and Building Associates Limited on an amended 45-count charge bordering on conspiracy and money laundering to the tune of N3.6 billion.\n\nThe judgment delivered by Justice Festus Ogbuinya held that the ruling of the Lower Court dated November 11, 2020, discharging the respondent of the money laundering charges \u201cis hereby set aside, and he shall enter into his defense accordingly on the same counts.\u201d\n\nThe Appellate Court, however, discharged Omatsuli on counts 27, 28, and 29 of the charge.\n\nThe defendants had pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nIn the trial, the prosecuting counsel, Ekene Iheanacho, called 16 prosecution witnesses, the last being Segun Temitope, a staff member of the Special Control Unit against Money Laundering, who gave his testimony on July 7, 2020.\n\nHowever, rather than open their defense, the defendants filed a no-case submission, which was heard on October 12, 2020, while the ruling was reserved till November 11, 2020.\n\nIn his ruling on November 11, 2020, Justice Saliu Saidu had discharged Omatsuli, saying, \u201cI have gone through the charges preferred against the defendants as well as the evidence of all the 16 prosecution witnesses and I found no reason for the first defendant to enter the defence. Accordingly, the first defendant is hereby discharged.\u201d\n\nThe Judge, however, held that the other defendants had a case to answer, but the EFCC appealed the ruling of the lower Court.\n\nThe EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, said in a statement that \u201cthe Appellate Court, also today, dismissed the applications of Momoh and Building Associates Limited seeking to set aside the ruling of the lower Court on their no-case submission.\n\n\u201cThe appellate court, in its ruling, however, affirmed the ruling of the lower court on the no-case submission filed by both Momoh and Building Associates on the grounds their appeal \u201cis bereft of merit\u201d and ordered them to enter their defence, accordingly.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Peter Duru, Makurdi\n\nThe Middle Belt Forum, MBF, has described the recent killings in Benue, Plateau and Kaduna states by bandits as a function of a failed government.\n\nThe National President of MBF, Dr. Bitrus Pogu who was reacting to the recent bloodletting in the affected states, in an interview Wednesday in Makurdi lamented that the killings were becoming too much for Nigerians.\n\nDr. Pogu said: \u201cIt is an unfortunate development; it is a function of a failed Federal Government. A government that cannot protect its people. A government that has failed in its primary responsibility as provided in our constitution which is the provision of security and welfare for the people.\n\nALSO READ:\n\n\u201cThis thing has gone too much for Nigerians. I recall that before the recent killings in Benue and Plateau states, three major indents happened in Kaduna which are the attack on the airport, the attack on the train and the attack on the community that in the immediate south of Kaduna.\n\n\u201cIt is only a failed government that would allow such a thing to happen in a country unchecked.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate because their failure to put an end to these killings is gradually making the average Nigerian to hate a Fulani man. And may God forbid that day when the Nigerian will rise up against innocent Fulani because of the failure of this government, so they better do something and quickly too.\u201d\n\nOn the call by Governor Samuel Ortom on Benue people to defend themselves, Dr. Pogu said it was proper. \u201cI support the call for self-defence but the unfortunate thing is that our people do not have the wherewithal. If they have the wherewithal I can assure you that they will defend themselves.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Owodunni Opayemi said that the move was a symbolic milestone that would redefine the future of housing in Ekiti State.\n\nOpayemi noted that Wemabod remains absolutely committed to delivering quality housing to Nigerians describing the engagement of Connect Homes as the best fit for the task given its pedigree in the built industry.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cThe choice of Connect Homes as the delivery partner is quite strategic given its experience and professionalism in the built sector and expressed confidence in their ability to deliver quality houses in Ekiti. Connect Homes is a home-grown development company that has driven the Ekiti Homes Agenda of the Dr. Kayode Fayemi administration in Ekiti State. We believe under the Wemabod ethos, they will deliver quality homes in record time\u201d.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Managing Director, Wemabod Limited, Mr. Yemi Ejidiran stated that the MoU signing is the first of many that Wemabod will be initiating with developers as part of its bid to increase Wemabod\u2019s presence across the South West region starting from Ekiti. \u2018The decision to deliver housing units in Ekiti State was borne out of the desire to contribute our part to reducing the housing deficit in the South West noting that currently there is an increased demand for new housing in the State\u2019. He further described the MOU signing between Wemabod and Connect Homes as a huge success that is in total alignment with the visions of both organisations.\n\n\n\nAlso speaking, the Chief Executive Officer, Connect Homes Limited, Mr. Ope Akeju explained that the MoU signing is a breakthrough in the housing sector and that the company is delighted to work with Wemabod in providing housing solutions to the people of Ekiti State through this collaboration. He said, \u201cwe are excited to be entering this agreement to deliver 155 homes in a fully serviced and environmentally sustainable community that we believe will set the standard for contemporary living in Ekiti State. We are glad to be part of this historic occasion that would provide more housing access to Nigerians\u201d.\n\n\n\nUpon completion, Wemabod Estate Ado Ekiti which is located on Iworoko Road would have facilities such as full security with CCTV & patrols, 24 hour power supply, communal areas with recreation & sport fields, shopping mail, an on-site estate office, among others.",

          "text": "By Joseph Erunke\n\nABUjA- THE Universal Basic Education Commission,UBEC, has expressed concern over poor learning outcomes in basic education.\n\n\n\nExecutive Secretary of the commission,Dr Hamid Bobboyi,said despite huge intervention by the federal government, in basic education-,there had not been impressive learning outcomes.\n\n\n\nHe, however, blamed this on a number of factors including, recruitment of unqualified teachers by some state governments, lack of regular professional training programmes for teachers, low remuneration among others.\n\n\n\n\n\nBobboyi spoke on Wednesday in Abuja while declaring open a one-day workshop for Council for Regulation of Engineers in Nigeria,COREN inspectors for monitoring of UBEC/SUBEBS Matching Grant intervention projects in 36 states and FCT.\n\n\n\nHe was reacting to report by United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), that Nigeria is faced with staggering learning crisis with about 70 per cent of children in schools cannot read and write or perform basic numeracy task by age 10.\n\n\n\nThe UBEC boss said even though the figures being bandied were not scientific, the Commission was working with UNICEF to have a large scale assessment of learning achievements in the country, going into the details of what the problems are and to improve on learning outcomes in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nHe said there was need to invest more on teachers that would teach children at the basic level of education, especially public schools across the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no justification for all the investment, if the child in the classroom is not learning,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nOn colboration with COREN, Bobboyi, said one of the key elements that could encourage learning is good environment, hence the need the partnership with the Council to ensure that infrastructure built in public schools across the country are of standard quality.\n\n\n\nRecall that on 3rd March, 2022, UBEC and COREN signed a memorandum of understanding for the Council to monitor UBEC matching grant intervention projects across the 36 states of the Federation and Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThe Executive Secretary disclosed that 50 per cent of allocation to the Commission from the Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF), as support by the Federal Government to basic education, is disbursed to state governments for development of infrastructure.\n\n\n\nHe said it was therefore important for UBEC to monitor what is going on in order to ensure that there is value for money and infrastructures built are safe and could last for long time as well as motivate the pupils to learn better.\n\nHe added that the role of the COREN was to make sure that all buildings in public basic schools has its certification and well built enough to add value to Nigerian classrooms.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the engagement of COREN for monitoring and evaluation of UBEC projects would add value to the efforts being put in place to ensure quality basic education delivery in the country.\n\n\n\nRegistrar of COREN, Professor Adisa Bello, in his remark, said the Council is to monitor construction work, renovation, furniture, equipment, works and water supply projects and report appropriately to UBEC management, saying this falls within Engineering Regulation Monitoring (ERM) mandate of the Council.\n\nHe said this was to ensure protection of lives and property, safety and value for money for sustainable national infrastructure development in Nigeria.\n\n\n\nBello warned the inspectors against deviation from the norm, stressing that anyone found wanting during the exercise would be dealt with accordingly.\n\nHe said: \u201cAny of our inspectors that is found wanting in the course of his or her duty, will be adequate sanctioned.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe commended the management of UBEC for opening itself for scrutiny, saying many government agencies would not be prepared to subject themselves to such evaluation.\n\n\n\nPresident of Nigerian Society of Engineers, Engr. Tas\u2019u Gidari Wudil, on his part noted that infrastructures in schools are very key to delivery of education, saying the Council has however discovered that most of the projects were badly done with minimal supervision.\n\n\n\nA\u00e7cording to him,UBEC does not have the capacity to effectively supervise those projects across the entire country, hence the need for support of the Council Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria, by extension the Nigerian Society of Engineers.",

I prayed for her and prayed again. And when the symptoms did not abate, I counselled that they should go to the hospital to know exactly what the issue was.\n\n\u201cThey asked that I help facilitate the process and I called our head of the medical team to assist handle their situation. He called FMC Jabi and they were attended to,\u201d he said.\n\nEnenche said a CT scan was done and the doctor felt more investigation needed to be done either at UNIABUJA teaching hospital or National Hospital.\n\nHe explained that Osinachi did a biopsy of the lungs tissue at the National Hospital and the result was milder than what the CT scan earlier showed and he was happy they were relieved.\n\nThe cleric said Osinachi called him daily and reported progress as she needed no oxygen at some point.\n\n\u201cShe called me literally daily and reported progress and I prayed with her. She told me they checked her oxygen perfusion and it was 100% and we were very excited at that progress. That was the point it was before we went to the crusade in Cameroon. It was the second night in Cameron that I got to know of the unfortunate incident of her passing.\n\n\u201cIf there was domestic violence that led to it or coincided with those symptoms she came with, there is no way I will know. If there was domestic violence there is no way I will know,\u201d he said.\n\nEnenche said the things he heard after her passing was strange to me. He said Osinachi\u2019s twin sister told him that the talented singer had begged her not to inform the church.\n\nAccording to him, Osinachi\u2019s first son who confirmed his mother suffered domestic violence also revealed that he didn\u2019t tell the pastor because their father always asked what they discussed with Eneche anytime he and his sibling greeted the pastor.\n\nHe added they he confronted some of the people privy to the abuse and was informed that it was Osinachi that begged them not to reveal the situation.\n\nEnenche further prayed that God will give Osinachi\u2019s family grace during this trying time.",

This is, therefore, illegal, and these institutions should not be allowed to continue to award fake qualifications in the country.\n\n\u201cIn the light of the above, the board wishes to inform the general public to desist from seeking admissions into any of these unapproved polytechnics, colleges/schools of health technology and similar TVET institutions.\n\n\u201cThey are kindly requested to verify from the NBTE website (www.nbte.gov.ng) the list of accredited TVET institutions in Nigeria where they can legitimately enroll for the programmes of their choice. The lists would be updated regularly to ensure that all Nigerians are adequately informed and have access to only approved and accredited TVET institutions.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, all private institutions of higher education in Nigeria must be established in line with the provisions of Education (National Minimum Standards and Establishment of Institutions) Amendment Act, CAP E3 LFN 2004.\n\n\u201cAny individual or organisation intending to establish a private polytechnic, college/school of health technology and similar TVET institutions is strongly advised to contact NBTE Secretariat Complex in Kaduna or any of its Zonal/Liaison Offices in Abuja, Auchi, Bauchi, Enugu, Katsina, Lagos and Nasarawa for more information on the guidelines and procedures for the establishment of TVET institutions in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nNBTE also asked all health professional regulatory/registration bodies under the Federal Ministries of Health and Environment to note that only approved and licensed private institutions of higher education established pursuant of Education (National Minimum Standards and Establishment of Institutions) Amendment Act CAP E3 LFN 2004 are granted accreditation and permission to run their health professional training programmes.\n\n\u201cAll national security and anti-graft agencies are kindly requested by this press release to close down any erring private polytechnics, college/schools of health technology and similar TVET institutions operating in Nigeria without the Federal Ministry of Education\u2019s approval and licence.\u201d",

Bashir Magashi, spoke on the worsening insecurity after yesterday\u2019s Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at Aso Villa.\n\nKaduna State Governor Nasir El-Rufai had hinted at the alliance of the terrorists after the train attack in which nine people were killed and no fewer than 68 people abducted and taken to the forest in Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State.\n\nThe terrorists are demanding huge ransoms from the family members of their victims.\n\nIn the Plateau attack, more than 100 people were killed, 70 residents were kidnapped and about 100 houses were destroyed by terrorists last Sunday.\n\nMohammed said: \u201cWhat is happening now is that there is a kind of unholy handshake between bandits and Boko Haram insurgents.\n\n\u201cPreliminary reports of what transpired at the Kaduna train attack show that there is a kind of collaboration between the bandits and dislodged Boko Haram terrorists from the Northeast.\n\n\u201cI can tell you very confidently that the Federal Government is on top of this matter.\n\n\u201cAs I explained here last week, we are fighting an asymmetrical war, a war in which the other side does not obey or recognise the rules of engagement, but where we are compelled to fight according to the rules of engagement.\n\n\u201cWhat happened two Mondays ago shook the whole country, yes, but that is the modus operandi of terrorists.\n\n\u201cAfter a month of being decimated, of being defeated, they rally around and make one spectacular attack that will try to retreat the successes of the government, but I can assure you we are not distracted by that.\u201d\n\nOn the 72-hour ultimatum by the families of the kidnapped train passengers, Mohammed said the government understood their position.\n\n\u201cThe respective arms of government are working to get those victims released.\n\n\u201cI think the Minister of Defence has already addressed the issues.\n\n\u201cOne is that what the Federal Government is doing won\u2019t be the subject matter of a press conference, because we have lives at stake.\n\n\u201cThe various arms of security are working night and day to unravel the mystery surrounding the attack as a whole.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s natural for anybody who is a father or a mother of a kidnapped person to be worried and to be concerned, but at the level of government, we appreciate that and we are leaving no stone unturned.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done what is necessary; we\u2019ve condoled with the victims, but like the Minister of Defence said, we are not at liberty here to tell you exactly what we\u2019re doing on a daily basis, but I can assure you that we are certainly winning the war.\u201d\n\nGen Magashi said the government was on top of the situation.\n\n\u201cSecurity chiefs are working hard to unveil those that are involved. We will tell you very soon about those that are carrying out these attacks.\n\n\u201cFor both attacks in Jos and Kaduna, we will explain to the public what is really going on as per our efforts to ensure that all these activities are stopped once and for all.\n\n\u201cWe are really on top of the situation, we are planning hard and we will get it out as soon as possible,\u201d the Defence minister said.",

          "text": "All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader Asiwaju Bola Tinubu yesterday said Nigeria needed a courageous leader who can make drastic changes.\n\nHe described himself as that man Nigeria needs to take charge of the wheel of progress.\n\nTinubu spoke at a one-day parley between current speakers and deputy speakers of the APC-controlled states.\n\nThe theme was: \u2018The legislature, changing times and Nigeria\u2019s democratic journey\u2019.\n\nIt was hosted by Lagos State House of Assembly Speaker Mudashiru Obasa in Ikeja.\n\nTinubu stressed that development was about thinking and doing, which he had demonstrated.\n\nThe presidential aspirant said: \u201cNigeria needs me even as I need Nigeria. Nigeria needs drastic courageous changes that will bring revenue and I am that courageous one it needs.\n\n\u201cI was raised to be courageous and this has been working for me. I want to bring same to bear as president of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAccelerated development of our nation is about thinking and doing, and I am ready to do that again because I am a thinker and doer.\n\n\u201cI want to become president legitimately through the ballot but I reserve the right to brag.\n\n\u201cI started my teething age of politics in the Senate; I was the youngest and I did well.\n\n\u201cI am well educated, sound, brilliant, vibrant, and one of the best alumni of the Chicago State University.\n\n\u201cI was a student-tutor and one of the most sought-after graduates after school as I had five job offers even before graduation.\n\n\u201cIn the face of tyranny and all odds, I have survived, stood and fought for democracy, survived the exile, lived without family, while financing other pro-democracy groups.\n\n\u201cI have contributed to sustaining Nigeria\u2019s democracy more than any other person. I am a very passionate being.\n\n\u201cI have contributed immensely more than any other person contesting today. I equally have it better when it comes to legislative experience.\n\n\u201cI am married to a senator, and have allowed her practice her religion well.\u201d\n\nTinubu, who begged the lawmakers to spread the news of his ambition, added: \u201cI am pushing and requesting for your support to be elected president of Nigeria in 2023.\n\n\u201cI am begging you to do me a favour so I can do Nigeria a favour. No one should leave here without a commitment to vote for me as a delegate.\n\n\u201cIt is a very challenging time and we need to decide it right. How many of my fellow contenders have my experience as governor, even of a governor of my calibre?\n\n\u201cI am the first governor to grant autonomy to the House of Assembly even as I am knowledgeable in legislative duties.\n\n\u201cI survived the non-allocation of local government funds in Lagos, functioned and created jobs. We made progress out of adversity.\n\n\u201cRevenue generation, not allocation, has made Lagos the number one economy in Africa.\n\n\u201cNigeria should not be an index of poverty, frustration, banditry, hooliganism, and the likes, but a country that we will all be proud of. We need to get it right.\n\n\u201cNigeria needs me even as I need Nigeria. I will be a good example. I have a can-do spirit. I am confident, and I have never lost an election. I was raised to be courageous and this has been working for me.\n\n\u201cWe can change the fortune of this country without giving excuses. I have demonstrated it in Lagos, and though people talk about traffic, I tell you that if there is no good economy, there won\u2019t be traffic.\n\n\u201cWe can rebuild this nation, reverse the carnage, but you need the visioner. I am the best visioner available and so I plead with you to decide well on who the APC candidate will be.\n\n\u201cPlease decide well and I promise I will not let you down.\u201d\n\nFifteen serving Speakers from APC-controlled states attended the consultative forum, which also had serving Deputy Speakers, serving state legislators and all former members of the Conference of Speakers in attendance.\n\nThey unanimously expressed support for Tinubu in his bid to get the party\u2019s nomination to contest for president.\n\nLagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said Tinubu\u2019s leadership capacity had been sufficiently demonstrated, given the tenacity with which he rolled out vision and ideas that transformed Lagos into a flourishing economy.\n\nThe governor said the forum was held as part of wide consultations embarked on by the APC leader in his bid to win the support of the party members across various backgrounds and camps.\n\nSanwo-Olu said: \u201cIt is not by chance that you all are gathered here today. It is because we agree totally that you all are important stakeholders that need to be engaged and identified with separately from others.\n\n\u201cYou are the real foot soldiers who can go back to the hallowed chambers and pass the message to all members of your respective Houses of Assembly and your former colleagues in the legislature across States.\n\n\u201cTell them that the man, Asiwaju Tinubu, whom we all look forward to, has reached out and identified with them as important stakeholders in the journey to next political dispensation. We need a fresh breath of leadership at this critical moment in our country.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju is qualified and competent to provide the leadership we desire to see. He has the spirit, capacity, tenacity and experience to do that for us.\n\n\u201cAs stakeholders, legislators, both current and former, are the critical component that can make this happen for us.\u201d\n\nThe governor said a better and greater Nigeria could be achieved if a detribalised candidate that had been tested with the right leadership capacity was given collective support to succeed President Buhari and build on the progress recorded by the current administration.\n\nChairman of the Conference of Speakers and Bauchi State Speaker, Abubakar Suleiman, described Tinubu as \u2018a great leader with character and sacrifices\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe are well abreast of Tinubu\u2019s aspirations, and members of the state Houses of Assembly will be part of his aspirations.\u201d\n\nLagos State Chairman of the APC Cornelius Ojelabi said Tinubu has the Midas touch to turn Nigeria around having done so in Lagos.\n\n\u201cTinubu turned Lagos into a land of Gold, and well should support him to replicate his Lagos feat in the national. We must not miss the opportunity to make him president,\u201d he added.\n\nThe lawmaker representing Epe I, Abiodun Tobun, noted that the message was for everyone to go back home and canvass vote for Tinubu.\n\n\u201cCanvass vote for good governance, prosperity security, enablement, determination and confidence, courage to lead this country to the promised land,\u201d he said.",

The constitution provides immunity from civil and criminal prosecution for the president, vice president, governors, and deputy governors while in office.

He said in spite of intelligence reports by the Department of State Service on the influx of terrorists fleeing into Plateau, there was no proactive measure taken to avert the terror attack.\n\nHe claimed security agencies had reliable information at their disposal of the various camps of the terrorists at Kambari forest in Taraba State. He added that they also had information on Bangala in Wase LGA from where the terrorists organised and coordinated attacks.\n\nIn his contribution, Deputy Speaker of the House, Ahmed Wase, alleged that a security personnel who was supposed to be on duty in Zamfara got a pass and stayed in Plateau for six months supplying uniforms to bandits. He said members would now understand the complicity of the security agencies in the killings, stating that actions needed to be taken against some security agencies. He called on security agencies to do their job, adding that the last time, it was in Birnin Gwari, Kaduna State, where over 162 were killed.\n\nHe said an early warning signal was given, as identified by the citizens, where bandits coming from Zamfara and Niger to Plateau were reported but nothing was done to forestall it.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days...

Things have turned upside down in the last one decade.\u201d\n\nHe said to live in Nigeria was now an unusual privilege, adding that the shocking part was that there were early warning signals that there would be an attack but it was not acted upon.\n\n\u201cIs it that they feel that some people behind it cannot be touched or are too powerful? It appears that there is an absence of government,\u201d he said\n\nFatuhu Muhammed (APC-Katsina) said President Muhammadu Buhari, as chief security officer, should be held responsible for insecurity in the country. He, however, said there was no way such killings would be happening without security information but condemned the attempt of always sweeping it under the carpet.\n\n\u201cThe security agencies come here, present their budget and we allow it pass, there is no oversight function to unravel the truth. I just came back from my state, no security is willing to come out and protect people, we have to give them money. Everybody is important in this battle, though the president should be held responsible,\u201d he said.\n\nThe House, therefore, called for the establishment of a military base and the deployment of troops to the affected areas.",

          "text": "\u2022This year budget now projected to have deficit of N7.35 trillion\n\nGilbert Ekugbe\n\n\n\nThe Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has predicted that Nigeria\u2019s total debt stock was expected to hit N45.86 trillion by December 2022.\n\nAccording to the President, LCCI, Mr. Michael Olawale-Cole, who spoke at a press briefing on the state of the nation, the country\u2019s debt stock was expected to increase following the federal government\u2019s plan to borrow an additional N1.6 trillion, while the 2022 debt target for domestic borrowing was pegged at N2.57 trillion.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is also a plan to borrow N2.57 trillion from foreign creditors, while N1.16 trillion is expected from multilateral/bilateral drawdowns.\n\n\u201cIn total, the federal government plans to add N6.3 trillion new debts to the current debt stock, which would push the country\u2019s total debt stock to N45.86 trillion by December 2022,\u201d he added.\n\nThe LCCI boss noted that the 2022 federal government budget was now projected to have a deficit of N7.35 trillion from the approved N6.26trillion if the recent request for an additional deficit of N965.4billion by the president presented to the National Assembly was granted, explaining that in total, adding that with the new debts, the country was likely to have a higher debt service-to-revenue ratio if revenue levels do not increase significantly.\n\nFurthermore, he predicted tougher times ahead for the manufacturing sector of the economy going into the second quarter of the year, predicting that manufacturing concerns would likely suffer due to poor public infrastructure, and port-related challenges as these may continue to present as headwinds to the sector\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, with the war in Ukraine aggravating disruptions to supply chains of raw materials like wheat, barley, soybeans, sunflower, and corn, the rising cost of production may not abate soon,\u201d he added.\n\nOn the power sector, he said it was becoming clearer that the national grid cannot supply sufficient power to meet the nation\u2019s electricity demand, lamenting that on the back of the epileptic power supply, businesses have had to deal with the rising cost of manufacturing, exorbitant logistics, and constrained production.\n\nHe added that with the cost of diesel at record levels and persisting poor power supply, businesses had been running on unsustainable costs and producing at uncompetitive prices.\n\nHe warned that the situation could lead to job losses as output is constrained due to the unbearable cost of production.\n\n\u201cIf not quickly tackled, these challenges will likely subdue the GDP growth potentials and projections for 2022,\u201d he warned.\n\nThe LCCI boss added: \u201cThe government should create funding for critical infrastructure and special purpose intervention in the power sector. The newly launched Infrastructure Corporation of Nigeria (Infracorp) has a mandate to focus on power, renewables, transport, and logistics. The InfraCorp will succeed in mobilizsng private sector participation if we can achieve cost-reflective pricing in the power sector,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe gas-to-power infrastructure requires an overhaul to resolve the persisting gas shortage. However, the most sustainable solution to Nigeria\u2019s power shortages is the transition to renewable energy,\u201d he advised.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Insist perpetrators must face wrath of law\n\n\u2022Insecurity: Nigeria on verge of collapse, Kukah warns\n\n\u202223 killed in fresh attacks on Benue communities\n\n\u2022Northern Elders call for president\u2019s resignation: \u201cKillers and other criminals appear to have detected a paralysing vacuum at the highest levels of government, and they have grown more confident and competent in subverting the state and our security.\u201d\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja, Seriki Adinoyi in Jos and Onuminya Innocent in Sokoto\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, the senator for Plateau South in the National Assembly, Professor Nora Dadu\u2019ut, and her counterpart in Plateau Central, Hezekiah Dimka, have described the recent bloody terrorist attacks on Kanam and Wase communities in Plateau State as atrocious, saying the perpetrators must be brought to justice.\n\nThe condemnation came as the Bishop of Sokoto Catholic Diocese, Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah, said the country was at the verge of collapse. Kukah said Nigeria needed urgent measures to salvage it, especially in the face of an alarming spate of insecurity.\n\nThe Northern Elders\u2019 Forum (NEF), in its reaction to the worsening security situation, advised Buhari to \u201cimmediately\u201d resign from office.\n\nAmid the widespread mood of resentment and anger in the country, at least 23 persons were yet again killed on Monday in Benue State, when assailants believed to be herders attacked two communities in the state.\n\nSome bloodthirsty terrorists had at the weekend killed 80 persons and abducted 70 others after an invasion of communities in Plateau State. The villages, which were attacked on Sunday, included Kukawa, Gyambawu, Dungur, Kyaram, Yelwa, Dadda, Wanka, Shuwaka, Gwammadaji, and Dadin Kowa.\n\nTHISDAY had reported that, unfortunately, while terrorists soiled the state in blood and danger, Plateau State Governor, Mr. Simon Lalong, was busy in Abuja holding political meetings with a former Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Bola Tinubu, over the latter\u2019s presidential ambition. Observers said this was a reflection of the growing insensitivity of the country\u2019s political leaders.\n\nHowever, the president in a statement issued yesterday by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, directed that the perpetrators of the dastardly acts should not be spared or forgiven. The president ordered the law enforcement agencies to work actively with the Plateau State government to bring the situation under control and bring the culprits to justice.\n\nBuhari expressed his condolences over the terrorist attacks, saying as a matter of priority, peace must return at all costs to the state and the entire country.\n\nThe president urged, \u201cOur citizens, the people of Plateau State, in particular, to expose the perpetrators of such incidents, their sponsors and those who encourage such criminals who carry out these dastardly acts of murder, so that the law will take its course.\u201d\n\nHe added that the criminals \u201cmust not be forgiven\u201d.\n\nA statement in Jos by Dadu\u2019ut urged the federal government to expeditiously apprehend the perpetrators of the Plateau killings and bring them to justice. She also called on the federal government to put machineries in place that would ensure that criminals do not escape arrest and prosecution.\n\nDadu\u2019ut said, \u201cI condole with the Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, Chairman of Kanam Local Government Area, the Senator representing Plateau Central, and the people of the local government council over the sad incident.\u201d\n\nDimka also commiserated with the affected communities. He said he recently paid a condolence visit to the Executive Chairman of Kanam Local Government Area, Dr. Dayyabu Garga, over the killings and wanton destruction of property. Describing the act as disheartening, sad, and unfortunate, he reiterated his appeal to the federal Government to come to the rescue of the state.\n\nThe senator called on the security agencies to intensify efforts to expose the masterminds of the killings and bring them to book as a deterrent to others.\n\nDimka said, \u201cI wish to most heartily, on behalf of the people of Plateau Central, condemn these dastardly acts of taking the lives of innocent people and destruction of property and to console the families of those who have lost their loved ones in the course of these senseless attacks.\u201d\n\nDimka said he was touched by the barbaric act perpetrated by the bandits, who used the land donated to the state government for ranching at Garga to infiltrate the communities that were attacked last Sunday.\n\nThe senator was reported to have donated bags of millet, sugar, salt and maggi as his contribution to efforts to alleviate the suffering of the affected communities.\n\nMeanwhile, at least 23 locals were killed on Monday night in Benue State, when suspected armed herders attacked their communities. The attacks occurred on at Mbadwem and Tiortyu communities in Guma and Tiortyu local government areas, respectively, state authorities said.\n\nChief Press Secretary to Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State, Nathaniel Ikyur, confirmed the killings, in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nOrtom condemned the killings and asked the people of the state to rise and defend themselves.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cIt is becoming increasingly glaring every day that my people are now an endangered species and so we can no longer wait for help from anywhere.\u201d\n\nHe was also quoted as saying in the statement, \u201cMy people will have to rise up to the occasion to defend themselves and their heritage against the Fulani army of occupation.\u201d\n\nApart from the killings, the governor\u2019s aide said scores of others were injured and had been taken to the hospital for treatment.\n\nDuring the attack on Mbadwem, no fewer than eight people were reported killed, while 15 people lost their lives in Tiortyu.\n\nOrtom lamented, \u201cWe are law-abiding citizens; we have cried for help against these invaders, but nothing is forthcoming.\n\n\u201cWe are left alone, and it looks like it is a deliberate strategy.\n\n\u201cNow we have only one option: to defend ourselves or get extinct. This is a case for our survival. We have been accommodating of other people in our land, but our hospitality is misconstrued as weakness. We are not a conquered people. We will never be. We are free-born citizens of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe governor called on the security agencies to do more in crime prevention and protect the lives and property of the people in the state. He also urged the residents to cooperate with security agencies to flush out the undesirable elements in the society.\n\nThe state government, Ortom said, will not shy away from its commitment to providing welfare and security for its people.\n\nInsecurity: Nigeria on the Verge of Collapse, Says Kukah\n\nKukah expressed concern over what he called abandonment of Nigerians to their fate in the face of terrifying insecurity.\n\nThe Bishop said, \u201cNigerians are like orphans in the face of this difficult situation with nobody to console them.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to journalists shortly after the Chrism Mass at the Holy Family Catholic Cathedral, Sokoto, yesterday, Kukah said Nigeria was in a war situation, even though the authorities were not willing to admit that. He explained that the situation in Nigeria was inexplicable, stressing that Nigerians have since placed their fate, belief, and hope in God to bring about the needed change in the country.\n\nThe clergyman also expressed worry over the activities of fraudulent individuals using religion to compound the woes of citizens by subjecting them to all forms of manipulation.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe scripture has told us very clearly that there is nothing that is happening to us now that is new, that hasn\u2019t happened before, there is nothing that is new.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that the idea of spirituality in any religion was to provide man with moral anchor, saying, \u201cReligion doesn\u2019t make the problem go away and I am saying, for me in the Catholic Church, we have no discount.\u201d\n\nKukah added, \u201cWe are in a very dangerous time when many people and fraudsters are using the message of Christ in a way and manner that may suite the challenges of the moment.\u201d\n\nIn another development a resident of Isa local government of Sokoto State, Musa Abdullahi, said it would take the grace of God to eradicate banditry in the region.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you, these people have succeeded by recruiting informants, who tell them the movement of security agencies,\u201d Abdullahi added.\n\nHe stated that the insecurity in the North-west had political undertone, stressing that the terrorists are living among the people, \u201cbut nobody is willing to expose them.\u201d\n\nHe further stressed that the hands of security agencies were tied due to the law of engagement.\n\nNorthern Elders Call for Buhari\u2019s Resignation\n\nThe Northern Elders Forum (NEF), in a statement signed by its media chief, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, called for the president\u2019s resignation due to the high level of insecurity in the country.\n\nNEF stated, \u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration does not appear to have answers to the security challenges that we face.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue to live and die under the dictates of assassins, kidnappers, rapists, and other criminal organisations who have robbed us of our right to live in peace and security.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for President Buhari to seriously consider that option, given his leadership\u2019s spectacular inability to provide security to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cOur Forum recognises the importance of this advice and recognises that we cannot continue to live in these conditions until President Buhari\u2019s term ends in 2023.\u201d\n\nThe group expressed dissatisfaction with the incessant killings and attacks almost on a daily basis.\n\nIt said, \u201cKillers and other criminals appear to have detected a paralysing vacuum at the highest levels of government, and they have grown more confident and competent in subverting the state and our security.\n\n\u201cNigerians have shed enough tears and blood without receiving adequate protection from those who are supposed to protect us.\u201d\n\nThe forum advised Nigerians to exercise extreme caution when electing their leaders in the upcoming elections, saying the country urgently requires good leaders to lead it back to prosperity.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Dangote Oil Refinery, which is reputed to be Africa\u2019s biggest oil refinery, may soon run into a deep financial crisis as a result of a $7 billion debt burden \u2013 a situation which indicates a possible takeover of the project by the Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON).\n\nDangote Refinery is an oil refinery owned by the Dangote Group that is under construction in Lekki, Nigeria.\n\nDangote Group is a Nigerian multinational industrial conglomerate, founded by Aliko Dangote, Africa's richest man.\n\nThe Group's interests span a range of sectors in Nigeria and across Africa.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Money Management Series, Dangote Oil Refinery, a 650,000-barrel per day (BPD) integrated refinery project under construction in the Lekki Free Zone, Lagos, Nigeria, was expected to commence production in 2016 with $3.3 billion financing secured in 2013.\n\nWith the refinery now projected to commence operations in 2025, Dangote Group\u2019s indebtedness to financial institutions is estimated to hit $8.4 billion by 2025.\n\nPresently, this debt burden has risen to $7 billion with debt servicing of almost $700 million per annum.\n\nThe completion date of the refinery has been moved eight times.\n\nWhilst some might say this is not in the character for Dangote Industries and their numerous projects across different sectors, the problem is deeply rooted.\n\nA contractor at the delayed refinery project, speaking under the condition of anonymity, said that poor planning, underpayment of contractors, and a lack of proper project management with over 40 contractors on site have led to most of the delays. He also added that of the 40, none is willing to commission as there is no clear delegation of duty and over-decentralisation leading to absolute chaos.\n\nWith these incessant delays, some financing banks are already calling in their loans amid fears of liquidity crisis, while others are elated by the guarantee of huge interests to be recouped as soon as the refinery comes on stream.\n\nDangote has been able to restructure the facilities from various local and international banks twice so far, but most banks have totally refused to restructure for the third time with principal repayment also falling due as well as the annual interest payments.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has made available $3.8 billion as part of federal government\u2019s 20% equity in the project, providing $1 billion cash, while the remaining $2.8 billion will be in crude supply.\n\nHowever, analysts have pointed out that NNPC\u2019s 20% equity at $3.8 billion makes the Dangote refinery overvalued at $19 billion.\n\nWhen Aliko Dangote unveiled early plans for the refinery in September 2013 and announced that he had secured about $3.3 billion in financing for the project, the refinery was estimated to cost about $9 billion, of which $3 billion would be invested by the Dangote Group and the remainder via commercial loans, and begin production in 2016.\n\nHowever, after a change in location to Lekki, construction of the refinery did not begin until 2016 with excavation and infrastructure preparation, and the planned completion was pushed back to late 2018.\n\nIn July 2017, major structural construction began, and Dangote estimated that the refinery would be mechanically complete in late 2019 and commissioned in early 2020. Experts, however, posit that the construction would likely take at least twice as long as Dangote publicly stated, with refining capability not likely to be achieved until 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, last week the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, reiterated that Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the acquisition of 20 per cent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refinery.\n\nSylva, while briefing State House correspondents after the virtual FEC meeting presided by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo last Wednesday at the Presidential Villa, said the acquisition was in the sum of $2.76 billion.\n\n\u201cThe Executive Council also approved the acquisition of 20 percent minority stakes by the NNPC in the Dangote Petroleum and Petro-Chemical Refineries in the sum of $2.76 billion,\u201d he said.\n\nThis development has been described by industry observers as strange because $2.76 billion falls short of 20 percent of the Dangote project valued by the sponsor at $16 billion. Using the $16 billion value, 20 percent should be $3.2 billion and analysts have expressed dissatisfaction at the disparity in the project\u2019s value and NNPC\u2019s funding.\n\nSpeaking with MMS Plus on the complexities with funding Dangote refinery, the Managing Director of Cowry Assets Management, Mr. Johnson Chukwu, argued that the banks wouldn\u2019t have any challenge from the financing because Dangote would have to pay the interests.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the banks being unable to meet their liquidity because of the monies tied down in the Dangote refinery. Ultimately, if the investment is economically viable, when it starts operation it should be able to meet up the arrears. I believe the banks that went into this project understood some of these constraints and didn\u2019t break their balance-sheets in the move to finance Dangote refinery. I don\u2019t envisage any bank having a liquidity challenge as a result of investing in Dangote refinery. If there is any challenge it would come from Dangote, but it should be resolved when the project takes off,\u201d he said.\n\nCommenting on the possibility that NNPC over-valued or under-valued the project in its 20% equity, Chukwu opined that NNPC may be looking at an enterprise valuation while the other value could be the net value.\n\n\u201cThe enterprise value could be higher than the amount Dangote has invested in the project. However, I wasn\u2019t involved in determining that, so anything I say will be purely speculative,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the massive support of the Nigerian government on the refinery project, things have got so bad for the billionaire that even income from his other businesses may not be enough to cover the interest rates, let alone the principal.\n\nThe $8.4 billion debt represents 75% of Dangote\u2019s net worth at $11.1 billion and Africa\u2019s richest man has to seek innovative ways to prop up his business now as the refinery project continues to be consistently delayed.",

Publicity is the oxygen for politicians who have failed to connect with voters in a democracy,\u201d the statement reads.\n\n\u201cIt is enough to say from our part, that resignation call on the President is not a solution to the security problems facing the country, something that has built up to a worrisome level following decades of neglect.\n\n\u201cIt is more important that citizens know what their government is doing to deal with this situation and for politicians to come to terms with the fact that it is beneficial to all that they help to preserve the state so that when it is their turn, they will have a place that they will manage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t have to destroy what is there in a desperate quest to get power.\n\n\u201cIn response to the recent spike in terrorist activity particularly in the Kaduna and Niger States axis, the defence establishment, in response to presidential directives, has realigned and reorganised the ongoing operation in the areas, as well as that going on in the Niger Delta region.\n\n\u201cThe new operations structures are being reinforced with land-based assets to increase the efficiency of the troops and intelligence is equally being reinforced.\n\n\u201cThe air defence system is being reinforced with newly-acquired jets and drones which assemblage and training for operators has been hastened to meet the current exigencies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe country is equally getting assurances of early delivery of equipment on order from manufacturers and the effort is ongoing to conclude other major procurements still in process.\u201d\n\nHe highlighted efforts by the present administration to boost security in various geopolitical zones, adding that \u201cthe procurement of the largest ever single procurement of military vehicles\u201d was approved on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, similar major operations are going in the South-East and the South-South where the economic life wire of the nation and electricity transmission lines are currently being secured from saboteurs,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat the sponsored saboteurs aim to show is that the government cannot provide power sabotaging equipment at switches and other vital points. They will not succeed. The public knows who is who, and who has done what in our country\u2019s governance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMassive gains being made will shortly be manifesting.

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "MTN Nigeria, the Nigerian arm of Africa\u2019s largest telecom, today received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria to run a payment service bank.\n\nWith this approval, MTN Nigeria can provide virtually all the services offered by conventional commercial banks with the exception of granting credit and processing foreign exchange transactions.\n\nThis announcement follows a previous approval in principle granted in November 2021, to Airtel Africa Plc and MTN Nigeria Communications Plc to operate a payment service bank in the country. The final approval was subject to the fulfilment of certain standards of the conditions within six months. This hints that, while MTN has gotten its own approval, Airtel Nigeria could be getting its own soon.\n\nDespite being home to Africa\u2019s largest unbanked population, Nigeria has not witnessed the same exponential growth in mobile money adoption and lags behind its regional peers like Ghana and Kenya when it comes to penetration. In January, MTN revealed that MTN Nigeria\u2019s mobile money service had attracted 9.4 million active users since launching in August 2019.\n\nThis approval is expected to spur the adoption of mobile money in Nigeria as the use cases increase. The widespread coverage of MTN will help it serve people all over the country, especially in rural areas and also position the telecom giant as a competitor for the market share and earnings of commercial lenders.\n\nMTN Nigeria, which provides one-third of the MTN Group\u2019s sales, saw revenue climb to a record \u20a61.7 trillion ($3.4 billion) last year, with profit leaping 45.5% to \u20a6298.9 billion ($598 million). Mobile money is a growing contributor to MTN Nigeria\u2019s income, and it\u2019s expected that the new banking licence would allow the company to explore growth opportunities presented by the Nigeria\u2019s unbanked population.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly.

          "title": "Fact Check: Is there any truth to some of the allegations against Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga Agboola?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past 48 hours, social media has been set ablaze as allegations of fraud, insider trading, sexual harassment, and several other things have been made against Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola, the CEO and founder of one of Africa\u2019s unicorns, Flutterwave.\n\nOn Tuesday, April 12, 2022, investigative/freelance Journalist, David Hundeyin published the latest edition of his newsletter, the West Africa Weekly. In it, using screenshots of emails, Slack messages, WhatsApp correspondence, and official-looking documents, he weaves a story that has raised more questions than it has answered.\n\nDoes an employee selling stock options by force constitute insider trading?\n\nAccording to Hundeyin, employees were forced to sell their stock options to an investment vehicle said to be owned by Olugbenga Agboola.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave CEO\n\nHundeyin\u2019s report claims they sold for lower than market price, as determined by Agboola, and tags this as insider trading.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut before we go into that, how do employee stock options work?\n\nHow do employee stock options work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn employee stock option (ESO) is compensation given by a company to the employee. This gives them potential access to shares in the company at a preset price. However, before they can access said shares, the stock must have been vested.\n\nIn plain speak, vesting means you can now exercise or buy the company\u2019s shares. It happens gradually, so if the contract says that the vesting period is four years, you cannot fully access your stock option until four years after the agreement.\n\nIn some cases, you can access the part that has vested. Let\u2019s use an example. Chike owns ESO in XYZ company. According to the contract, he must have stayed with the company for four years before exercising his option. In the first year, he can access 25% of the stock. If he chooses not to, in the second year, he can access half of the ESO, and it goes on and on till the fourth year, when he can then access 100%.\n\nESOs only become valuable if the company\u2019s stock price rises above the preset price in the agreement. So if Chike was told that the price he can buy the stock is when it rises to $3, if it rises to $4, he can buy it for cheap at $3.\n\nEmployees usually wait till liquidity events like an Initial Public Offer (IPO) or a merger or find someone willing to buy their stock option if they are impatient.\n\nSo, was there insider trading?\n\nFrom a screenshot dated February 28, 2021, that Hundeyin shared, this employee appears to have exercised his option to buy but then wanted to sell those shares. They are offered an option to sell at $3.4999, which they round off to $3.5 and accept.\n\nAlso embedded in the article is a blurry video said to be from a potential Flutterwave investor explaining how he arrived at a possible share market price. At Series D, shares would be valued at $52. At Series C, $20.25, Series B, $4.47.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat SEC filings show\n\nFrom our archives, Flutterwave announced a Series B round in January 2020, a Series C in March 2021, and a Series D in February 2022.\n\nAccording to EDGAR (a US Securities Exchange Commission company search platform) filings, the date of first sale \u2014 when Flutterwave first began receiving money \u2014 for the Series C was February 2021, two days before the sale by the employee. The final filling was made on March 12, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEC Form D notice which, according to SEC rules, companies like Flutterwave have to file within 15 days after the first investor commits to their funding round\n\nSo let\u2019s piece all of this together. Flutterwave begins raising Series C in February. Employee sells in February at $3.5 lower than the potential $20. Flutterwave completes raising Series C round in March 2021.\n\nNext question: who bought those shares?\n\nHundeyin says it was Agboola, but the above screenshot shows the employee conversing with Kayinsola Adepoju, Flutterwave\u2019s Investor Relations Manager.\n\nSources close to the matter revealed to Techpoint Africa that the stock was bought by existing shareholders, who were exercising their first right of refusal, and not Agboola.\n\nCan this be classified as insider trading according to the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) Rules?\n\nSide note: Flutterwave is a company incorporated in Delaware in the US and, as such, is governed by US laws and regulations.\n\nAccording to SEC Rule 10b-5, which provides for insider trading, it is illegal for anyone to defraud or deceive someone, including misrepresenting material information concerning the sale or purchase of a security.\n\nEssentially, the company\u2019s officers, directors, or insider employees should not withhold any material information that could reasonably affect the share price or affect the judgment of the person planning to buy or sell stock.\n\nDoes insider trading apply to private companies?\n\nA 2011 case, SEC v Stiefel Laboratories Inc, appears to answer this question.\n\nIn 2009, Stiefel, a family-owned private company, was sold to GlaxoSmithKline. However, before the sale, the company defrauded shareholders of $110 million by withholding material information about the valuation of the shares held by Stiefel employees and the sale of the company.\n\nThis enabled the company to buy back these shares at an artificially low price and was found to have violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nWhat then is true?\n\nFact 1: Insider trading is illegal when material information that could affect the sale of a security or the buyer\u2019s or seller\u2019s judgment is withheld.\n\nFact 2: Flutterwave as a private company can be investigated by the SEC for insider trading, following the Stiefel case.\n\nFact 3: Flutterwave began raising its Series C and filed its first sale on February 26, 2021, two days before the employee sold their shares at $3.5.\n\nFact 4: Flutterwave closed Series C and filed with SEC on March 12, 2021, and share prices supposedly increased.\n\nWhat is still debatable, however, is if the shares were sold to Agboola or the investors and if there was any coercion. Does this count as insider trading?\n\nThere\u2019s still a bit more to unpack from Hundeyin\u2019s article, and it has to do with Agboola\u2019s time at Access Bank\n\nWas Access Bank aware of any of this?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgboola at Access Bank Hackathon in 2017\n\nGoing by Agboola\u2019s LinkedIn profile, he worked at Access Bank from November 2014 to May 2016. It also says he founded Flutterwave in May 2016 and assumed his CEO role in 2018.\n\nHundeyin, however, says that Agboola didn\u2019t resign from his job at Access as Head, Digital Factory and Innovation until 2018. Not only did he not resign, but he did not tell his superiors at Access Bank of this fact while making use of company resources to build Flutterwave.\n\nHundeyin shares several screenshots of WhatsApp Direct and Group messages between a contact saved as Olugbenga Agboola and an employee. In one dated August 10, 2016, Agboola is seen telling the employee that he would be acting as Access Bank and not Flutterwave in a particular matter.\n\nIn another screenshot with no date, the contact saved as Olugbenga Agboola says that Adeleke \u201cLeke\u201d Adekoya \u2014 a Flutterwave co-founder and Head, Digital Banking at Access Bank \u2014 would represent Access Bank, while Paul (Akingbade) and the employee would supposedly act as Flutterwave.\n\nIncidentally, Paul Akingbade worked at Access Bank as a Business Applications Manager until 2019 and now heads Core Switch Engineering at Flutterwave.\n\nAnother screenshot dated June 16, 2018, shows the contact saved as Olugbenga Agboola mentioning that he was finally leaving Access Bank in July, needed exit requirements, and that he thought he owed them some money.\n\nHe also says that all Access Bank staff now know \u201che is in Flutterwave\u201d. The conversation then focuses on their suspicions and moves to an already established story which portrays Agboola as a mere advisor on the board.\n\nIn an interview with Big Tech This Week published on April 3, 2022, Agboola does not mention the date he resigned at Access Bank but says he had begun working on Flutterwave at a co-working space. He then brought in Adekoya and Iyin Aboyeji, former CEO and Co-founder at Flutterwave.\n\nInterestingly, Agboola claims Aboyeji had left Andela. However, according to Aboyeji in this tweet made on April 13, 2022, he was still at Andela until May 2016, when Flutterwave was incorporated \u201cby his hand.\u201d\n\nBy my hand I incorporated Flutterwave May 2, 2016 (while I was still at Andela by the way) and by my hand I resigned with a letter dated Oct 12, 2018. Every single necessary evidence has been preserved because I conducted myself with the highest integrity. \u2014 iyin.eth (@iaboyeji) April 13, 2022\n\nIn his article, Hundeyin alleges that in early 2018, Agboola, Aboyeji, and Herbert Wigwe \u2014 Access Bank CEO \u2014 traveled to the US for a SEC hearing and testified under oath that Agboola never worked simultaneously at Flutterwave and Access Bank.\n\nWhy would Wigwe travel to the US with Agboola and Aboyeji?\n\nAboyeji, in another tweet on April 13, 2022, admits that he did indeed go to the US for a SEC hearing, but he went alone.\n\nAll lies. Only I went and we were cleared. David should have called me for comment but he doesn't care about the truth. https://t.co/hVd6evLP7l \u2014 iyin.eth (@iaboyeji) April 13, 2022\n\nIn a second tweet, he mentions that the hearing was concluded in 2017 and not 2018, as Hundeyin claims.\n\nAbsolutely. He\u2019s made himself hard to ignore this time sha. Especially since he claims I visited DC in 2018 with imaginary people to resolve an investigation that was closed by SEC in Sept 2017. https://t.co/sThyMWxKJl \u2014 iyin.eth (@iaboyeji) April 13, 2022\n\nConversely, according to the interview with Big Tech This Week, Agboola claims that he flew to the US with Wigwe when they were trying to acquire Uber as a client. Although he doesn\u2019t mention a specific date, Uber became a Flutterwave client in 2016.\n\nBut there\u2019s another tangent here that involves Flutterwave and some money allegedly owed to Access Bank\n\nWhy does Access Bank send that letter?\n\nHundeyin\u2019s article includes a letter dated August 30, 2018, in which Access Bank claims that Flutterwave owes the bank \u20a6221,106,830.80 (~ $530,000).\n\nAccording to Hundeyin\u2019s source named \u2018Ose\u2019, in the third quarter of 2018, while conducting an audit for the Access-Diamond merger, Access Bank discovered that Flutterwave had been settled for transactions but wasn\u2019t giving the bank its share.\n\nApparently, this was an arrangement between Flutterwave and Access Bank, which Agboola describes as their \u201cfirst acquiring bank.\u201d He also mentions Wigwe\u2019s role in helping to onboard potential clients who would then domicile their traditional businesses with the bank.\n\nSide note: An acquiring bank enables a merchant to accept digital payments.\n\nCoincidentally, Aboyeji stepped down two months after Access Bank sent the letter.\n\nWhat are the facts?\n\nFact 1: Agboola worked at Access Bank.\n\nFact 2: Wigwe travelled with Agboola to San Francisco for several meetings.\n\nFact 3: Aboyeji says there was an SEC hearing that only he travelled for.\n\nFact 4: Flutterwave and Access Bank had a partnership that meant transactions would pass through the bank.\n\nFact 5: Wigwe knew that Agboola was working at Flutterwave.\n\nWho then is lying? Why was there a SEC hearing? Does Wigwe knowing mean that Access Bank\u2019s board knew?\n\nLike we said at the beginning, several questions still remain unanswered, but while we await an official statement from all parties involved, we can draw conjecture based off the facts that we have verified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

          "title": "An insight into how Katapult VC invests in African startups",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of 2020, 282 million Africans went hungry because of insecurity, inadequate agricultural infrastructure, and drought. In addition to public sector initiatives, startups have been built to solve some of the sector\u2019s problems.\n\nKatapult Africa is a venture capital firm focused on startups building solutions for agriculture, food, and the climate. Founded in 2016 by Norwegian entrepreneur, Tharald Nustad, the firm has invested in 108 startups, including two unicorns \u2013 Esusu and Betterfly.\n\nAbbey Wemimo and Samir Goel founded Esusu to help immigrants access credit and build up a credit score. Betterfly, on the other hand, allows employers to incentivise their employees to maintain healthy habits.\n\nIn 2018, the firm started investing in African startups and has 17 startups in its portfolio. Techpoint Africa spoke to Katapult\u2019s Rwandan Country Director, Philip Gasaatura, who shared the firm\u2019s startup investment criteria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get into VC?\n\nI have a computer science and tech background, so I did some years in investment banking in the UK. I was mostly on the trading floors but then shifted more into entrepreneurship and then moved to ventures here in Africa. That led me more into the VC space because I knocked on a couple of doors.\n\nThat didn\u2019t go too well, which led me to work with the Rwandan government, where I advised on their innovation fund \u2014 the Rwanda Innovation Fund \u2014 and helped to structure it with the general partners. My role was advising the government on the structuring and LP agreements with the fund manager.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat went live and brought me into Katapult Africa, which was looking into setting up operations in Africa. Tharald Nustad, a tech entrepreneur, started Katapult, and it is both an accelerator and a VC fund, so we write checks for the companies that go through our cohort.\n\nWe started in 2016, and we have 108 companies in our portfolio. The two verticals have been mainly climate and ocean. The new one is Katapult Africa because we see opportunity on the continent, and we\u2019ve had some success stories along the way.\n\nSeventeen of the 108 companies in our portfolio are based in Africa, and last month, two companies \u2014 Betterfly in North America and Nigerian-founded, US-based Esusu \u2014 announced their unicorn status.\n\nWhen did Katapult start investing in Africa?\n\nThe first of our cohorts was back in 2019 with the likes of FinAccess in Kenya and RxAll; we also got Sky Garden.\n\nAre there industries that Katapult focuses on, or are you sector agnostic?\n\nOur cohorts in Oslo [Norway] have been mainly focused on climate and the ocean, focusing on those companies that can scale and have an effect on people, the planet, and profit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSky.Garden was one of Katapult Africa\u2019s first investments.\n\nWe\u2019re also looking at the scale at which these companies can grow. We are working with support from our partners, and we\u2019ve got partnerships with Smart Africa, Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, and Norrsken. We\u2019re looking broadly at Agritech, food, and climate and are open to other startups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you invest at specific stages or all stages?\n\nTypically, we invest between $100,00 and $150,000 for between 6 and 8% equity at the pre-seed or seed stage. That\u2019s our sweet spot, and we like companies with a good team that are post-revenue, have attained product-market fit, and want to scale. We also have a bias for companies that execute quickly.\n\nWhat startups have been your biggest successes and failures?\n\nGlobally, some of our successes include Esusu and Betterfly in North America. They recently attained unicorn status, and we\u2019re excited about that because they came through our programme in Oslo. In Africa, two of our companies \u2014 FinAccess and Sky Garden \u2014 are raising their Series A.\n\nHow do you deal with investments that don\u2019t go according to plan?\n\nWe do what every other investor does; we lick our wounds. Some investments fail because of the entrepreneur, while some fail because of the environment. Here in Africa, the challenges that entrepreneurs face may stop them from achieving their milestones, so they run out of cash or fold. This is why rather than go out to invest one by one, we do it in a cohort to improve the chances of our investments succeeding.\n\nHow will you advise a founder to prepare their startup for investments?\n\nThe investment is not the ultimate thing. Are you building a business that your customers want or like? The focus, I think, should be on product-market fit. There\u2019s always the temptation to scale before getting your product-market fit, and that\u2019s premature.\n\nIf companies understand their customer\u2019s needs, the capital will follow. That\u2019s critical. How companies grow their customer base is also essential. Are they growing week-on-week? How do they fix hitting a plateau? Those are important things in growing a solid business with a solid foundation and capital flows to such companies.\n\nHow do you ensure a steady stream of quality startups?\n\nWe believe in investing for scale and impact, and we can\u2019t do that independently. And this is why we have developed partnerships with TBI, Norrsken, and Smart Africa. We\u2019re also building with others across the region who were here before us.\n\nWe\u2019re aware that Africa is a different market, and we\u2019re learning from our relationships with different partners in the markets we\u2019re looking to operate in. These partnerships help us to understand the lay of the land while we can share and access deal flow. It\u2019s a journey, and we\u2019re aware that we don\u2019t know it all, but we\u2019re excited to learn along the way.\n\nWhat are the biggest mistakes you\u2019ve seen startups make?\n\nPremature scaling is one, and I mean scaling before hitting product-market fit in your home country. There\u2019s often the idea that my home country is not big enough, hence the need to scale quickly. An example is getting 1,000 visits to your app or website, but only 2% (2) stay. Many founders will ask how they can get more people to come in, but you should be asking, \u201cHow can I get 60% or 80% to stay?\u201d\n\nSo fixing those kinds of issues before getting to that scale is vital. I think that\u2019s one of the biggest challenges because VC money should be coming to add fuel to the fire. You already have something, and it\u2019s just coming to help scale growth, not necessarily helping you get product-market fit.\n\nThe second one and I think it\u2019s a big one, is the composition of your founding team. You need to build around a team and not an individual. A team will get you across many lines going forward, and investors like to invest in good teams. The product can always pivot, but the team is the key to that.\n\nWhat are the specific qualities you look for in a team?\n\nOne of the qualities we look out for is a team that understands the problem. When you look at a team\u2019s construct, there\u2019s someone handling the technical aspects and someone knocking on doors, getting the sales, getting the customers, and doing the heavy lifting.\n\nWho\u2019s helping to do the scaling after you\u2019ve gained territory? Who\u2019s creating the processes and the systems? One of the things you realise in the likes of Coca-Cola, Google, and others is that once the founding team has built the product or the company, they\u2019re not necessarily the team that will scale it and get into other countries.\n\nYou need to understand where each company needs help and who to bring in at the right time. I like to use the guys at Google [as an example]; they brought in Eric Schmidt because they were conscious of what they did not know. So who are the members of the founding team, and who do they bring in to support them through their early phases?\n\nHow can startups that are looking for investment reach you?\n\nWe are currently receiving applications on our website. There\u2019s a section where they can apply for the Africa programme, and we\u2019re always looking at applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Is it nice?\n\nUnrelated, but help Techpoint Africa determine how much African tech workers earn by filling out this form or sharing it with your developer friends.\n\nLet\u2019s get down to business. Today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nAllegations against Flutterwave\u2019s CEO\n\nNenne Nwodo\u2019s dream at age 6\n\nNCC\u2019s warning on NIN-SIM linkage\n\nPylon\u2019s $19 million seed funding\n\nFlutterwave CEO, Olugbenga Agboola, faces allegations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Hundeyin, journalist and founder of West Africa Weekly newsletter, stated in a tweet on Tuesday, April 12, 2022, that he began working on a story about the Nigerian payment company, Flutterwave, six months ago.\n\nThe story has gone viral, dominating Twitter roundtable discussions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat exactly is the story? According to the article, which he claims contains the necessary proof to back up his claims, Hundeyin accuses Flutterwave CEO, Olugbenga Agboola, of bullying and committing some crimes. These include insider trading, and inflating and deflating stock prices as desired.\n\nHe also said that Olugbenga \u2018GB\u2019 Agboola illegally exploited the assets, information, and contacts of Access Bank, where he worked.\n\nNo, I didn\u2019t make those up. You can catch up with the story here: Flutterwave: The African Unicorn Built On Quicksand\n\nThis story is coming after Clara Wanjiku, an ex-employee of Flutterwave, published a Medium post on Monday, April 4, 2022, criticising the CEO for \u201c5 years of constant harassment.\u201d\n\nThe company, which was founded in 2016, achieved unicorn status last year, and by February 2022, it was valued at $3 billion having raised $250m in Series D. This made the company the most valuable African startup, surpassing the $2 billion valuations set by SoftBank-backed fintech OPay and FTX-backed cross-border payments platform Chipper Cash in 2021.\n\nWell, there\u2019s quite a bit to unpack here that should make for some interesting reads. Please keep your eyes peeled on this space.\n\nNenne Nwodo\u2019s dream at age 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNenne Adaora Nwodo. Software engineer, Microsoft\n\nHow many of us are the people we aspired to be as children? Is this you? Certainly not me!\n\nWhile many of us are not what we wished to be when we were kids, a few of us are, and this can be attributed to our environment and background, among other factors.\n\nStudies have shown that one\u2019s environment \u2013 physical, emotional, mental, or social \u2013 significantly impacts one\u2019s career decision-making process.\n\nFor example, as a child, I aspired to be a doctor, an engineer, and a banker. Aside from my background, my environment played a significant role in my decisions.\n\nHowever, I am not doing any of these things right now. In fact, I didn\u2019t study any of them. So, we can conclude that I did not pursue my childhood dream.\n\nYesterday, though, I read about Nenne Adaora Nwodo, a 25-year-old Microsoft software engineer who is pursuing her six-year-old dream. Plus, I must say that her story is interesting and encouraging.\n\nFun fact about Nwodo: She is an author, a public speaker, a YouTuber, a DJ, a creator of digital content, and an entrepreneur. All of this, and she still works for Microsoft? What exactly is she doing right?\n\nSidebar: Despite the fact that her environment and support system had a significant impact on her career choice, she did and continues to do the work. I\u2019m not going to give you any spoilers, though.\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole, our Senior Reporter, had a 90-minute conversation with Nwodo, a Stanford Graduate School of Business (Stanford GSB) student, for The Experts, and I\u2019m confident you\u2019ll be inspired.\n\nPlease, take a look at it here: How Microsoft\u2019s Nenne Adaora Nwodo is living the software engineering dream she had as a 6-year-old\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\n\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon. Get it directly in your inbox by subscribing to the Intelligence by Techpoint newsletter here.\n\nNCC\u2019s warning on NIN-SIM linkage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember last week\u2019s Friday story: Is the NIN-SIM linkage deadline extension really over? This is a follow-up story.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, April 11, 2022, the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) stated that telecoms consumers whose Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards have been blocked from making calls would not be unblocked by service providers until their SIM cards are linked to their National Identification Numbers (NINs).\n\nWhy? The statement was deemed necessary by the NCC in light of a suspicious viral link attempting to compel the Commission to reverse its decision.\n\nPer the statement, the Commission said, \u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the NCC wishes to state categorically that it never issued such a statement, directing subscribers or indicating that subscribers can unbar their SIM without a NIN. As such, the originators and peddlers of the spurious message were out to mischievously mislead unsuspecting members of the public. Therefore, their message should be disregarded.\u201d\n\nRecall that on Monday, April 4, 2022, the Nigerian federal government barred all outgoing calls from all SIM cards not linked to NINs. But turns out some persons who had NINs still had to go through a process called validation to ensure it works.\n\nStill don\u2019t know how to validate your NIN and avoid crowds? We\u2019re here to help you get through it. To know how, please click on this link.\n\nMoreover, on Thursday, April 7, 2022, Techpoint Africa went on a short trip to confirm a situation at the National Identification Management Commission\u2019s (NIMC) headquarters in Alausa, Lagos State, but they were met with some unpleasant scenes.\n\nThen again, while I am undecided about the deadline extension, following the NCC\u2019s lead, please be advised not to fall victim to any scam perpetrated by the average Nigerian. Please safeguard your data.\n\nPylon\u2019s $19 million seed funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Egyptian infrastructure management platform for water and electricity companies, Pylon, has raised $19 million in seed funding.\n\nThe round was led by Endure Capital. Cathexis Ventures, Loftyinc Ventures, Khawarizmi Ventures, and a number of unnamed angel investors also participated.\n\nWhat problem does the company solve? Pylon addresses a number of issues for water and distribution companies. For starters, these companies have a very high rate of uncollected bills and thus lose out on a lot of money. Second, they have high electricity costs and water theft. Lastly, technical failures occur on the grid and network due to a lack of maintenance or law enforcement.\n\nThe company, founded in 2017 by Ahmed Ashour (CEO) and Omar (Radi co-founder and CTO), creates solutions for these water and electricity distribution companies in order to increase efficiency and stop the bleeding \u2014 the company estimates hundreds of billions of dollars in losses in emerging markets each year.\n\nHow does this work? Pylon\u2019s software collects data from grids, analyses it, and determines where theft and losses occur in the supply chain. It then automates billing processes for the businesses.\n\nWhile the company is currently based in Egypt and the Philippines, a portion of the seed investment will be used to expand into other emerging markets like Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nNestcoin is hiring an Associate UX Researcher.

          "text": "Economists have painted another unsavoury picture of the Nigerian economy and their prognosis isolates six factors that are piling woes on already beleaguered businesses and households, according to a report analysed by BusinessDay.\n\nFirstly, they said Africa\u2019s largest economy, which is yet to recover from the destruction caused by two economic contractions in five years, will face more slowdown in growth, with the next round of GDP figures projected to come in below population growth levels.\n\nNigeria recorded a real GDP growth of 3.4 percent in 2021 but with agriculture, the single largest contributor to GDP, and oil and gas, as well as industry, challenged, the outlook for the whole economy in 2022 is poor.\n\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) in a March 23 report expects Nigeria\u2019s economic growth to slow more than expected in 2022 as power-supply issues, high inflation and expected monetary tightening hurt output.\n\nFrom an initial forecast of 3.3 percent in February, the EIU now expects real GDP growth to decelerate to 3 percent in 2022. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) are less optimistic with growth projections of 2.5 percent and 2.7 percent, both of which are lower than the country\u2019s population growth rate.\n\nIn another expected blow to GDP growth in 2022, the recent warnings from the telecom sector, which has powered growth for three years now, suggest that the sector is also being squeezed.\n\nA second area of worry for the economy is the paradox of a failure to benefit from the spike in global oil prices and supply shortages.\n\nAfrica\u2019s top crude producer has failed to take advantage of oil prices that have been trading at an eight-year high as it has been battling to ramp up output to reach its full OPEC+ quota due to persistent production troubles.\n\nEnergy exporting countries across the world are reaping a sudden windfall but not for Nigeria, which for the first time is seeing significant pressures on both foreign exchange supply and public revenues at a time of rising oil prices.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil and gas sector expanded by 10.9 percent, according to the country\u2019s General Authority for Statistics. Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector, on the other hand, contracted by 8.1 percent in the same period.\n\nNot surprisingly, while Saudi Aramco declared a 124 percent increase in operating profit to $110 billion, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation declared only $700 million in 2020.\n\nThe report said Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector is hobbled by low crude production amid a scandalous level of crude oil theft, dwindling investment, high cost of production and the debilitating effect of a petrol subsidy regime that has spiraled out of control.\n\nRead also: What is the impact of the Russia-Ukraine crisis on Africa\u2019s trade and economy?\n\nThe third strong wind pulling down the Nigerian economy, according to the report, is the worsening external position exacerbated by falling foreign investment.\n\nIn 2021, Nigeria\u2019s trade deficit ballooned to N1.94 trillion, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nForeign direct investment for the whole year fell to the lowest on record at $698.78 million, according to data from the Central Bank of Nigeria, due to the perceived harsh business environment.\n\nFourthly, the Nigerian economy is confronted by falling foreign reserves despite rising oil prices, which reached a peak of $139.4 per barrel on March 8, 2022. While the issuance of Eurobonds and support by the IMF helped to shore up the reserves for some time, the impact of that is now fading, according to the economists and data from multilateral agencies.\n\nThe report identified the fifth wind blowing against the Nigerian economy to include persistent fiscal pressures rising, with the continuous decoupling of revenues from high oil prices amid soaring public debt.\n\nNigeria\u2019s public debt rose by 4.2 percent to N39.6 trillion as at the end of 2021 from N38 trillion in the third quarter of 2021. Total debt saw an increase of 20.4 percent in the whole of 2021 and so far this year, Nigeria has borrowed more by way of a Eurobond of $1.25bn and another N296.37 billion in local debt via FGN bond issuance in March 2022.\n\nOn a granular level, the net effect for the average Nigerian is that he or she is getting poorer, buffeted by rising inflationary pressures and worsening disposable income for each household in Africa\u2019s most populous nation.\n\nIn US dollar terms, real per capita income for the average Nigerian collapsed from $889.82 in 2020 to $775.76 in 2021, a fall of 13 per cent in just one year.\n\nNigeria\u2019s poverty count (Nigerians who cannot afford N450 a day) has shot up from 85.2 million in 2020 to 90 million in 2021 and is now projected by the World Bank to rise further to 95.1 million this year, despite claims by the government that it is working to cut the number of Nigerians falling into the poverty pit.\n\nAt an ongoing investment expo in Dubai, potential investors were expressing worry about Nigeria\u2019s worsening macroeconomic instability symbolised by FX and market volatility and other issues, including security challenges, high operating cost, regulatory insensitivity, and the worrying collapse in public power supply.\n\nThe economists concluded their report by saying that Nigeria\u2019s business environment \u201cis highly volatile and is faced with a unique set of challenges that are being worsened by the global shock.\u201d\n\nThe economists counselled businesses pummelled by these forces to seek mitigation in cost efficiency, focus on their customers, improve their marketing and to focus on their core competence.",

          "text": "In little over a year, Nigeria would be choosing a new leader, a leader most Nigerians hope will be remarkably different in competence and talent than President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cI have never seen such incompetence like I see with this President and his government,\u201d a European diplomat covering economic and trade told BusinessDay. \u201cThey came, they saw and they destroyed.\u201d\n\nHis election in 2015, under a cumulus of expectations that he himself and his party the All Progressives Congress (APC) had encouraged, marked the first time in Nigeria\u2019s 55-year history as an independent state that a ruling party was ousted by the ballot, not the bullet.\n\nIn a well-choreographed campaign that vaunted him into the leadership of the nation that year, Buhari promised to focus on three key priority areas when elected. He vowed to ensure the safety of Nigerians by putting an end to Boko Haram and other forms of insecurity in the country. He threatened corruption, promising to kill it \u2018before it killed us\u2019, and also swore to Nigerians that the economy would change for the better.\n\nWith just a year left for him to leave Aso Rock, Buhari and his government have failed to change any of those three areas to critical success stories. Rather it has been one big unwholesome story of missed opportunities.\n\nWhile the president\u2019s allies quixotically claim he is in hurry to develop the country, most Nigerians believe that he has failed to achieve any perceptible modicum of meaningful development or indeed growth in the last seven years. A citizens\u2019 perception and attitude survey on topical issues and trends covering a potpourri of social, economic, political, governance and public-life issues released in March by Africa Polling Institute (API) found that only one in 10 Nigerians (eight per cent) are happy with the current state of affairs in Nigeria, under Buhari.\n\nBuhari came into office under a massive cloud of goodwill from Nigerians and the international community. Aloof, kinetically unsociable and inflexibly tribal, Buhari turned deaf ears to the numerous opportunities that could have transformed Nigeria. Rather, like an unskilled shipmaster, he ran the country aground.\n\nAlmost every sector of the country\u2019s social and political economy under Buhari\u2019s leadership has come under unparalleled internal shocks of ineptitude, intellectual apathy and the beatification of insensitivity. The opportunities lost are massive and telling, so are the attendant fallouts that could take decades to repair.\n\nA politics of injustice, division and disconnection\n\nOn May 29, 2015, Nigeria was in dire need of healing the variegated political, ethnic and religious divides occasioned by the fierce contest for political power between the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party and the opposition APC. Twerking in victory that was legitimised by the gracious acceptance of defeat by the then incumbent, Buhari signalled the divisive, Kafkaesque nature of his politics. He had no interest in uniting the country. Questioned at the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) in July 2015 on what he intended to do about the Niger-Delta with respect to amnesty programme and socio-political inclusiveness, Buhari made it clear, he was going to treat constituencies that gave him \u201997 percent\u2019 of their votes better than those that gave him \u20185 percent\u2019 of their votes. By this, he indicated that he was going to engage in non-nationalist pork-barrel politics that would give more power and projects to the core Northern states where he had garnered the most number of votes.\n\nIt was a shocking statement that reaffirmed the nativist tendencies of a president falsely modelled as a nationalist by his campaign managers. The clannish nature of Buhari\u2019s politics was further accentuated by his lobbying the World Bank to prioritise its developmental programmes across the northern parts of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn my very first meeting with President Buhari, he said specifically that he would like us to shift our focus to the northern regions of Nigeria and we\u2019ve done that,\u201d World Bank\u2019s immediate past president Jim Yong Kim told reporters in Washington.\n\nOutside projects and programmes, Buhari\u2019s appointments have been outrageously divisive, helping to heighten a feeling of disconnection from the nation\u2019s socio-political centre by populations in the Southeast and the Niger Delta. The president\u2019s tepid response to large-scale killings and destruction by Fulani militia in the Christian dominated Middle-belt region of Benue, Taraba, Kaduna and Plateau states further amplified the disconnect between Buhari\u2019s government and Nigerians who perceived his lukewarm response to the killings as a nod to his ethnic group\u2019s bloody grab for power and land.\n\nAn economy abused and misused\n\nWhen Buhari assumed office in May 2015, Nigeria\u2019s GDP, a measurement of the health and size of the country\u2019s economy, stood at $525 billion. Seven years later, Nigeria\u2019s GDP is $432.3 billion, some $90 billion sliced off the economy as a result of little to no growth since late 2015.\n\nThe opportunities to expand growth stared Buhari in the face. He had a chance to bring in the best brains and hands in and out of the country to help him run the economy. He had the chance to ensure a market driven exchange rate system that would have encouraged investors rather than a fixed exchange rate regime he so favours that has so corrupted the nation\u2019s FX system.\n\nBuhari chose an execrable economic management team, and Nigeria\u2019s economy has been on a freefall since then. While the president asserts that his administration\u2019s \u201cjob creation, policy consistency and innovation have since 2015 developed the economy,\u201d the fallacy and misconception in that statement, is obvious from the fact that the country in 2020 became the poverty capital of the world.\n\n\u201cThe reality of the nation is that corruption, unemployment and inequalities have destroyed the nation\u2019s economic framework, causing it to be the poverty capital of the world,\u201d Krishna Panchal noted in a Borgen Magazine analysis in 2020.\n\nAccording to figures from data consulting firm StatiSense, in 2015, when Buhari came into office, 54.51 million Nigerians were fully employed. Five years later, only 30.57 million Nigerians had full employment. Unemployment rate, which stood at 10.4 percent in 2015, rose to 35 percent in 2021, up 6.06 percentage points from the 33.3 percent reported in 2020, according to figures from Agusto & Co.\n\nRead also: Buhari explains why Nigeria is rebuilding, expanding highways, bridges\n\nInflation rate which stood at 9.01 percent in 2015 currently stands at 16 percent and the nation\u2019s debt stock which stood at about 9 trillion naira when he came into power seven years ago, has now ballooned to about 32 trillion naira with nothing perceptible to show for Buhari\u2019s debt binge.\n\nThe depressing state of the Nigerian economy under Buhari, was aptly enumerated by the Economist magazine in its May 2019 edition, when it noted, \u201cthe Nigerian economy is stuck like a stranded truck. Average incomes have been falling for four years; the IMF thinks they will not rise for at least another six. The latest figures put unemployment at 23 percent, after growing for 15 consecutive quarters. Inflation is 11 percent. Some 94m people live on less than $1.90 a day, more than in any other country, and the number is swelling. By 2030 a quarter of very poor people will be Nigerian, predicts the World Data Lab, which counts such things.\u201d\n\nThe unskilled and insidious management of the nation\u2019s monetary and FX policies by a central bank keener on pleasing the political leadership of the country has left devastating cracks on the nation\u2019s economic landscape. Questionable economic policies of the administration, drove the World Bank to warn again in November 2021 that, \u201cthe government\u2019s exchange rate management policies continue to discourage investment and fuel inflation. FX management remains too rigid to respond to external shocks. Meanwhile, exchange-rate management has emerged as one of the key drivers of inflation\u201d.\n\nThe president, a retired diplomat and former senior national security officer, came in promising to stabilise the exchange rate. We had a clear case of the exchange rate being at about 160 to the dollar in 2015, now it has risen to almost 600.\n\nHe has not made any dent to unemployment, rather there is more desperation amongst our youths and you can see this in the glorification of yahoo boys, kidnapping for ransom and others, and poverty is just climbing.\n\nThe main reason I think this has happened is that the problem we have in this country is so deep that there must be a certain \u2018deliberateness\u2019 in any effort we are going to make to address the rot. Unfortunately, this \u2018deliberateness\u2019 has been lacking in this government.\n\n\u201cThe varied interventions of the central bank in different areas of the economy show the absence of a clear strategy to deal with the issue. There is no clear strategy of engaging with the citizens at coming clean with what is going on. What is required is a return to the drawing board to work with all stakeholders to lay the foundation for a better economy.\u201d\n\nIt was the need for this deliberateness that led the late economist and former CBN Deputy Governor, Obadiah Mailafia, to advise the administration that \u201cthere is a desperate need to diversify the economy away from dependency on petroleum.\n\nSecondly, they need to be able to balance the books, because right now the government has a revenue crisis on its hands and the debt situation is getting out of hand.\n\nAnd thirdly, they need to work on the expenditure framework. A lot of money is going down the drain and nobody knows what is going on there. It is not about having a yearly budget, it is about what the budget is achieving and the budget is not achieving anything.\n\nFourthly, we need to work on the central bank. CBN has been invaded and impacted by some bandits. We can\u2019t keep multiple exchange rates because it is just a drain pipe; what the Americans call a pork-barrel. We must fix it. There should be a single exchange rate and everybody must be subject to that single exchange rate with no favouritism of any kind.\n\nFifthly, we need to create a competitive economic environment. Right now, we don\u2019t have an economy that can compete for investments; we are losing investments to Ghana and Rwanda, investments that we cannot afford to lose if the government is keen on creating jobs and engendering growth.\n\nSixthly, we need to work on our tax policy. In an atmosphere of slow growth, you just don\u2019t increase taxes unless you want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg and it seems that\u2019s what they want to do.\n\nWe need to expand the tax base, not so much as increasing the rate. A lot of people and SMEs are not captured in the VAT. Let\u2019s not be lazy, let\u2019s make an effort to expand the VAT net by bringing in those who are presently outside it.\n\nDon\u2019t forget that a lot of the VAT paid by companies are not even remitted to the government, so there are many ways we can be innovative in expanding the tax base and even double and triple the revenue and income that goes to government, it is not just by the lazy approach of increasing the VAT rate\u201d.\n\nA Diaspora ignored\n\nHugo Cuevas-Mohr, in his analysis of the Nigerian diaspora and remittances, noted that \u201cone of the most fundamental acts of Nigerians when leaving the country is sending money home. Family is key for Nigerians and supporting their families back home is the ultimate expression of love, commitment and duty of Nigerians in the Diaspora.\u201d\n\nNigeria accounts for over a third of migrant remittance flows to Sub-Saharan Africa, and according to PwC, \u201cthese flows amounted to $23.63 billion in 2017, $22 billion in 2018, and represented 6.1 percent of Nigeria\u2019s GDP. The 2018 migrant remittances translate to 83 percent of the Federal Government budget in 2018 and 11 times the FDI flows in the same period. Nigeria\u2019s remittance inflows were also 7.4 times larger than the net official development assistance (foreign aid) received in 2017 of $3.4 billion\u201d.\n\nRemittances from Nigerians abroad rose to $14.2 billion in the nine months ending September 2021. Nigeria\u2019s diaspora possesses real and substantial resources, both in financial terms, and in terms of human capital, as noted in the US government census data.\n\nThey can be mobilised to be key players in trade links between Nigeria and their countries of residence. Despite the setting up of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission in 2017, Nigeria\u2019s government has not been able to mobilise the power of Nigerians abroad to drive and support Nigeria\u2019s economic development and diplomatic power.\n\nAn effective engagement with Nigerians in the United States, the United Kingdom and South Africa among others has the potential to build a power base for Nigeria\u2019s diplomatic and economic engagement with the world.\n\nAn OECD study found that, Diasporas and migrants returning to their country of origin can also influence political and civic life. For example, the study noted, \u201cseveral recent studies reveal that migrants have the potential to play a leading role in political change in terms of government changeovers, the level of democratisation and the formalisation and depersonalisation of institutions, and that they can also make stronger demands on local governments, particularly with regard to respecting basic rights. Finally, they can spur the demand for a more responsible and transparent government\u201d.\n\nThis, Nigeria\u2019s political leaders fear.",

          "title": "Banditry is now the Financial Wing of Boko Haram \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Federal Government has said preliminary reports on the Abuja-Kaduna train terror attack have revealed the impact of collaboration between the bandits and dislodged Boko Haram terrorists from the North East.\n\nThe Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, said this Wednesday while fielding questions from State House reporters after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa in Abuja. Mohammed intervened after the Minister of Defence, retired Major General Bashir Salihi Magashi, was asked to provide information on the perpetrators of the train attack.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat is happening now is that there is a kind of an unholy handshake between bandits and Boko Haram insurgents. Preliminary reports of what transpired at the Kaduna train attacks shows that there is a kind of collaboration between the bandits and the dislodged Boko Haram terrorists from the northeast. I can tell you very confidently that the Federal Government on the top of this matter.\u201d\n\nIntense fire from bandits in 2021 caused a Nigerian attack jet to crash in northwestern Zamfara State, but the pilot survived by ejecting from the aircraft, the Nigerian air force has said. Zamfara and neighbouring Kaduna are among the states worst-affected by a surge in criminality including mass abductions of schoolchildren and armed robberies, often carried out by large gangs of outlaws, locally known as bandits, who operate from remote hideouts.\n\nBandits are now members of Boko Haram. The only avenue left for Boko Haram to raise funds now is banditry. Bandits are occupying Zamfara, Katsina, Sokoto, Kebbi, Niger and Kaduna States to raise funds for Boko Haram. Boko Haram is using banditry to infiltrate all parts of Nigeria. Banditry represents the financial wing of Boko Haram to raise funds to finance terror activities. Bandits are terrorists who can raise funds for Boko Haram across Nigeria. Bandits have negotiated with many state governors in the north-west of Nigeria. President Buhari should treat bandits as terrorists. Bandits have participated in kidnappings where ransoms were collected to finance terrorism across Nigeria.. Boko Haram has also been known to raise funds through mass kidnapping of foreigners and civilians for ransom. Boko Haram has a specialized kidnapping task force led by bandits that sets out to abduct school children, politicians, business people, foreigners, rulers and civil servants with the intention of later trading them back for large sums of money or for the return of other Boko Haram militants. Nigeria\u2019s North West is suffering deadly conflict involving many armed organisations which Boko Haram has used to infiltrate the region, including herder-allied groups, vigilantes, criminal gangs and jihadists. The violence has killed many people since 2011, and displaced some people, some into neighbouring Niger. Despite several security operations and dialogue efforts, a durable peace remains elusive.\n\nFrequent acts of violent crime have grown to form a major threat to Nigeria\u2019s national security. These include instances of militancy, insurgency and banditry. Banditry includes cattle rustling, armed robbery and kidnapping for ransom. Kidnapping for ransom has remained the most virulent form of banditry in Nigeria. It has become the most pervasive and intractable violent crime in the country.\n\nKidnapping can be targeted at individuals or at groups. School children have been kidnapped in groups in various parts of Nigeria. Usually, the prime targets of kidnapping for ransom are those considered to be wealthy enough to pay a fee in exchange for being freed.\n\nKidnapping is the unlawful detention of a person through the use of force, threats, fraud or enticement. The purpose is an illicit gain, economic or material, in exchange for liberation. It may also be used to pressure someone into doing something\u2014or not doing something.\n\nNigeria has one of the world\u2019s highest rates of kidnap-for-ransom cases. Other countries high up on the list included Venezuela, Mexico, Yemen, Syria, the Philippines, Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia. Thousands of Nigerians have been kidnapped for ransom and other purposes over the years. Kidnapping has prevailed in spite of measures put in place by the government. The Nigerian police\u2019s anti-kidnapping squad, introduced in the 2000s, has endeavored to stem the menace. But this been to no avail, mainly due to a lack of manpower and poor logistics.\n\nIn my view these efforts have also failed because of weak sanctioning and deterrence mechanisms. Kidnapping thrives in an environment that condones crime; where criminal opportunism and impunity prevail over and above deterrence. This obviously calls for an urgent review of Nigeria\u2019s current anti-kidnapping approach to make it more effective\n\nSimilarly, Boko Haram insurgents have used the proceeds of kidnapping to keep their insurgency afloat. The insurgents engage in single or group kidnapping as a means of generating money to fund their activities. Huge sums are often paid as ransom by the victims\u2019 families and associates to secure their release.\n\nIn addition to militants and insurgents, organized local and transnational criminal syndicates have been involved. This is happening to apocalyptic proportions in North West Nigeria where rural bandits engage regularly in kidnapping in the states of Zamfara, Kaduna, Katsina, Kebbi, Katsina and Sokoto.\n\n________________\n\nInwalomhe Donald writes from Sokoto State.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

On Monday, he officially declared his ambition.\n\nHowever, the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress and presidential aspirant, Bola Tinubu who declared his ambition in January, met with the governors in Abuja on the same day.\n\nRecall that. last year, when Tinubu was in London on medical leave, the members of the northern caucus of the APC in the House of Representatives visited him where some of them described him as \u201cMr President.\u201d\n\nAs the battle rages on, Osinbajo, Tuesday, met with members of the APC caucus in the Senate. He also met, yesterday, with the House of Representatives Caucus.. The House was led by the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, a political godson of Tinubu who is also an active member of his campaign team.\n\nA Source close to our correspondent disclosed that some of the members loyal to Tinubu may not honour Osinbajo\u2019s invitation.\n\nThe Chairman, Committee on Finance, James Faleke, who is also the Convener of the Tinubu Support Group, told The NIGERIAN OBSERVER that Tinubu remained the candidate of the APC caucus in the House.\n\nFaleke, who represents Ikeja federal constituency, added that he would not be attending the Vice-President\u2019s dinner.\n\n\u201cAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu remains our candidate. I will not be attending the meeting,\u201d Faleke stated.\n\nEarlier at the plenary on Tuesday, a letter of notification was read out by the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, which came from the Majority Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, informing the APC caucus of Osinbajo\u2019s breaking of Ramadan fast (Iftar) and Easter with the lawmakers.\n\nThe Iftar/Easter dinner was scheduled for 6.30 pm at the Aguda House, Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nAlso, Tuesday, Osinbajo invited the APC caucus in the House to the Banquet Hall of the Presidential Villa for the Iftar dinner on Wednesday.\n\nThe Deputy Speaker of the House, Ahmed Wase, read the Vice-President\u2019s letter through the Majority Leader, Alhassan Ado-Doguwa, at the opening of plenary on Tuesday.\n\nThe letter to the House caucus read, \u201cIn the spirit of the Holy Month of Ramadan, it will be my great pleasure to host you and all members of the APC caucus in the House of Representatives to the Iftar/Easter dinner on Wednesday, April 13, 2022.\n\n\u201cIt is proposed that members arrive at 6.30 pm, hence arrangements would be made for prayer at the State House Banquet Hall which is also the event venue.\n\n\u201cI will appreciate your very kind assistance in conveying this invitation to all concerns, including persons who are equally welcome to join us for the dinner.\u201d\n\nAlso on Tuesday, groups loyal to Tinubu and Osinbajo told our correspondent that the support of the governors is unwavering.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "A sudden death is an unanticipated death. Though sudden deaths have different causes, they are all unexpected and consequently unanticipated.\n\nThe senior special assistant to the FCT minister, on health, Dr Ejike Orji, identified the things that can lead to sudden collapse and death as mostly metabolic and cardiac, adding that COVID-19 is also contributing.\n\n\u201cWhen I say metabolic, I am looking at things like diabetes. Somebody can suddenly die from diabetes if your blood sugar goes up so high. You can go into coma and if it is not corrected immediately, the person will die, the other one is hypoglycemia\u2013when there is low blood glucose in a person\u2019s body.\n\n\u201cThere is also what we call cardiac event; if somebody has had hypertension for about ten years without knowing and not doing anything about it, it will affect the heart, the kidney and the brain. The one that will cause sudden death is if the blood pressure shoots up so high and an artery bursts in the vein, the person can die immediately. The other one is if the blood pressure is high and the person has cholesterol deposited in the artery, it will deposit so high that the person\u2019s blood, the one supplying to the heart, they can suddenly cloth and close and the blood supply to the heart, if the artery blocks, that person can die suddenly.\n\n\u201cThe other thing that is causing sudden death recently is COVID 19. People may have COVID 19 without knowing it, even when they have very severe symptom, they will still be saying is malaria, they will be in denial, they won\u2019t go to see a doctor and the coronal virus will start from the nasal until, it gets into the lungs and once people start desaturating, you will find out that within 24 hours, their blood oxygen will fall so low that it will not sustain life and they will die. Most of the people who die from coronavirus die due to that.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe other thing that can cause sudden death is when people have Upper GI bleeding from peptic ulcer and the person did not manage it well and takes a drug that can cause massive bleeding. All of these can be found out if you do a comprehensive check every year once you are above 40, then every two years.\n\nOrji, however, said that health insurance has a big role to play as it makes it easy for a person to access healthcare because it\u2019s a pool resources scheme that will make you if you have a slight headache, you will like to go to the hospital since you know you are not going to pay as you have already paid the premium for the year.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s e-Passport has been ranked 99 best out of over 200 countries\u2019 passports in the world, as the passport holders can even visit a number of destinations without visas.\n\nQuoting Henley Passport Index second-quarter global passport ranking for the year 2022 report, the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, described the stride as a \u201cno mean feat,\u201d adding it was indicative of Nigeria\u2019s passport acceptability all over the world.\n\nHe said Henley Passport Index is the original and authoritative ranking of the world\u2019s passports.\n\nSpeaking at the opening of a two-day workshop for Passport Control Officers (PCOs) of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) held at the Service headquarters in Abuja, Aregbesola further revealed that the Immigration Service had between 2019 and the period under review issued about three million passports to Nigerians.\n\nThis, he said was despite the challenges of COVID-19, which greatly affected the availability of booklets and the passport issuing process.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, over 250,000 passports have been unclaimed by their owners and lying idle on the shelf,\u201d he said.\n\nHe again cautioned prospective applicants against patronising touts and NIS officials but to utilise the online portal to avoid being scammed.\n\nHe added that, \u201cIt is absolutely necessary, therefore, for all applicants to go to the NIS online portal to process their applications and avoid patronising touts and NIS officials.\n\n\u201cWe are taking complaints of solicitations and inflation of processing fees against NIS officials very seriously and will land a heavy stick of the law on culprits. Covert agents will soon be going around passport offices to apprehend touts and officials involved in these unwholesome practices. To be forewarned is to be forearmed. Be guided accordingly.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile noting that there have been challenges to passport administration over the years, the minister said it was for these reasons that the government introduced reforms into the passport administration system in Nigeria, to infuse the process with credibility and strengthen the integrity of the Nigerian passport.\n\n\u201cWe have adopted a processing period of six weeks to obtain fresh passports and three weeks for renewal. This is to enable the service to verify the identity and claims of applicants before issuing them the passport. For the enhanced passport, we have also synced the applicant\u2019s biodata with the National Identification Number (NIN) database. This means that the information you have with NIMC corresponds with your passport. This authenticates your identity,\u201d he further stated.\n\nSpeaking directly to the Passport Control Officers, Aregbesola told them that, \u201cI need not remind you, that as PCOs, you are the drivers of these reforms in your various Passport Offices. Therefore, you must strive to eliminate unnecessary bottlenecks and shenanigans of nefarious individuals aimed at bringing the passport issuing process a bad image by making the process difficult for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cYou must ensure that you provide the needed environment at your various Passport Offices for applicants to have the full benefits of the reforms in the issuance of passports.\n\n\u201cElimination of touting at Passport Offices, complete and total eradication of all forms of extortion and undesirable practices which constitute impediments in the process, ensuring that officers and men working in the Passport Offices maintain high levels of discipline, integrity and the desire to serve Nigeria and her citizens with every sense of patriotism are the imperative of effective and efficient service delivery.\n\n\u201cI, therefore, urge you to make these your minimum threshold in the course of your tenure at the various Passport Offices. Ensure that you leave a legacy of good service when you eventually complete your tour of duty.\u201d",

          "text": "A group, Project Ekiti, has carpeted the administration of Governor Kayode Fayemi, for attacking the personality of the governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Chief Segun Oni, over his call for the reinstatement of the sacked staff of the Ekiti State University.\n\nOni had pleaded with the Fayemi-led administration to reverse the disengagement of the university staff, which he described as unfair and a failure of due process.\n\nThe state government, however, through a statement by one Segun Dipe, took a swipe at Oni and tagged his statement on the issue as \u201cmisspeak and show of incompetence\u201d.\n\nBut reacting to the state government\u2019s response, Project Ekiti in a statement signed by its spokesperson, Comrade Tope Idowu, and made available to newsmen during the week, described the response that the said workers were disengaged but not sacked, as \u201cchildish, myopic, wicked, misleading, misinforming and a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth.\n\nAccording to the group, Fayemi and the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Abiodun Oyebanji, were trying to mock the people\u2019s sensibility.\n\nProject Ekiti argued that Oni\u2019s plea was neither out of place nor political, but an expression of sincere concern as a stakeholder in the state.\n\n\u201cThe statement reads: \u201cChief Segun Oni\u2019s plea is not out of place, neither is it political. The management of EKSU had on December 5, 2019 disengaged some workers, claiming offences ranging from certificate forgery to irregular appointment, and age falsification.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the said appointment was made by the then Vice-Chancellor, Prof Bamidele, under the administration of Ayo Fayose. But when Dr. Fayemi took over the administration of the State, and appointed Prof (Mrs) Olubunmi Ajayi, as the Acting Vice-Chancellor, and Prof Bantale Omole as the Chairman of the Council, who on the instruction of Dr. Fayemi set up an auditing panel, a panel whose members are not from a university community.\n\n\u201cThe governing council has the Secretary to the State Government, Abiodun Oyebanji (the current Governorship Candidate of APC) as the representative of Mr Governor, the Finance Commissioner, the Education Commissioner, and Prof Tale Omole as the Chairman of the Council. Therefore, it is unbelievable to what extent the Fayemi-led administration could go in deceiving the people.\n\n\u201cHow a government that practically dominates a university council would be claiming that the University is autonomous. The supposed auditing committee (even through kangaroo) had not submitted its report and was in one of its sittings when Mr. Abiodun Oyebanji, the man who is being packaged as the candidate of APC in the coming governorship election walked into the committee\u2019s meeting unannounced and threatened that heads will roll if the report was not submitted that particular day.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, the report of the committee ought to have been subjected to a Council Committee for a recommendation, before implementation, but rather, the report was implemented before Mr Oyebanji and Prof Bantale thought of setting up a Council Committee. An instance of acting before thinking. The only person who has displayed the highest level of ignorance, incompetence, and ineptitude is Mr. Oyebanji, the man being projected by the APC as the next governor of Ekiti State.\n\n\u201cMr. Oyebanji should have known better that no government organization/establishment disengages workers without giving at least one month\u2019s notice, and with pay to the affected person(s), after due process must have been followed. Unfortunately, he lacks administrative knowledge. No wonder Fayemi\u2019s administration cannot be regarded as a successful administration. The disengagement of the innocent workers never followed due process, and it was never the decision of the entire council. The whole process was scripted by the Fayemi led administration and acted by Mr Oyebanji and Prof Omole. Hence, the autonomy of the university was never respected.\n\n\u201cInstead of APC/Fayemi led Administration to keep wasting time and State\u2019s resources trying to, change the narrative, and further confuse the people, we would suggest they send Oyebanji to a leadership school, against subsequent elections, since the incompetent Oyebanji seem to be the best of all in APC and none other can represent the party in the election except him. Governor Fayemi claims he wants the best for the Ekiti people, and since Oyebanji who lacks administrative knowledge and understanding is his definition of the best, one would come to the conclusion that Governor Fayemi never meant well for the people of Ekiti State. God forbid Oyebanji becomes governor of Ekiti State, retrenchment awaits the workers\u201d.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen, on Wednesday, said she battled with tears when the children of the late popular gospel artiste, Osinachi Nwachukwu, narrated their late mother\u2019s ordeal.\n\nShe spoke on NTA\u2019s Good Morning Nigeria\u2019s breakfast show monitored by The PUNCH.\n\nAccording to the minister, the widower of the deceased, Peter Nwachukwu, brutalised his late wife and her four kids, adding that the late gospel artiste had no bank account of her own as all her proceeds were usurped by her husband.\n\nThe PUNCH had earlier reported that the 42-year-old artiste died on Friday after spending days at an undisclosed hospital in Abuja.\n\nColleagues of Osinachi, who was a lead singer at the Dunamis International Headquarters, Abuja, accused her husband of beating her.\n\nSubsequently, the husband was arrested by the police over the death of his wife.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, Tallen said she visited the Abuja home of the deceased on Tuesday to identify with the grief-stricken children.\n\nThe minister said, \u201cIt is so traumatizing, so heartbreaking, the death of Osinachi.\n\n\u201cWhen I came into the compound, I saw the children, four beautiful children; three boys, one girl. He (Peter) had told the children that they should not speak about the things that have been happening in the house.\n\n\u201cI came in with all the directors in the ministry. When I was asking questions, I saw that the children were not forthcoming. I excused everyone and said I wanted to have a one-on-one with the children.\n\n\u201cI first spoke with the first son. I asked him, \u2018Do you love your mother?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes\u2019. \u2018Has your mummy taught you to tell lies?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes\u2019. I asked him if she is still alive and he said she is dead. \u2018Do you know that she is now your angel and she is now watching you?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes\u2019. \u2018So, it will be very sad if you tell lies\u2019.\n\n\u201cI introduced myself and I told him the President is concerned, every Nigerian is concerned, we all join them to mourn Osinachi\u2019s death but what we want from him is the truth.\n\n\u201cThen he opened up\u2026 And said that their dad used to beat their mom and their mom was always sad. He would beat her and flog her. He said their father would gather them in the room and be beating them and if the mom comes into the room to stop him, he would turn back on her and beat her up. And that has always been the issue.\n\n\u201cThey said it was their mom that runs around on her gospel music, comes back with her money, in fact, if the money is paid through (a) bank account, it was paid into his account. She has no account of her own, any money she has, he collects it and gives her just peanut for feeding and when she cooks, he started shouting and beating her. And their mom was living in fear and was always sad.\n\n\u201cIt was such a horrible story from a young boy that is said to be just 12. I asked him what class he is and he said Class Five. At the age of 12? I said, \u2018Why?\u2019 And he said he can\u2019t even read. So, mentally, this child is already destroyed.\n\n\u201cI was battling with tears and when he finished, I called on the second son.\u201d\n\nTallen further said \u201cthe second son repeated the same horrible situation\u201d as well as the third son.\n\nThe minister vowed that justice would be served on the matter as it would be followed to a logical conclusion.",

          "text": "The Nigerian government has again made fresh submissions before the London Commercial Court, where Nigeria is suing JP Morgan Chase Bank and established that former Attorney-General, Mohammed Bello Adoke, was complicit in the controversial sale of the OPL 245 oil bloc licence to Shell and Eni, despite the firm having no formal connection to the deal.\n\nIn its final written submission to the court, the Nigerian government referenced an interview granted by former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, where he emphatically denied knowledge of the much touted 2006 deal referenced by Adoke in supporting the out-of-court settlement between Malabu and Federal Government.\n\nIn 2006, Malabu lost a case instituted by the company to have the OPL245 license withdrawn by the government return to it.\n\nThat was all the country needed to take full control of the license after the earlier revocation via executive fiat.\n\nThis revocation and court decision by the Federal High Court was the position throughout the period ex-President, Umar Yar\u2019adua, was in office but suddenly changed after Jonathan assumed office and Adoke appointed as Justice Minister.\n\nThe ministry under Adoke entered into a settlement agreement to return a licence lost through the court to Malabu, even without an appeal challenging the High Court decision delivered against Malabu. Adoke claims, albeit falsely, that Obasanjo sanctioned the out of court settlement.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian government in its submission, \u201c79. Third, JPM argues that it is a \u201cfair inference\u201d that the 2006 Settlement must have been considered and approved by the then-President, Olusegun Obasanjo, who is not accused in these proceedings of any wrongdoing. However, Mr Obasanjo himself has emphatically denied this. In a 2017 interview with the Nigerian Newspaper Premium Times, Mr Obasanjo said that he knew nothing about this deal and was not part of it; and would not have done so, because, he \u201ccould not have approved a deal with Dan Etete. What Etete did is the height of corruption. He appropriated the asset to himself illegally, illegitimately and immorally\u201d. That is the approach that Mr Ojo (and Mr Adoke) should have taken to dealing with Etete \u2013 but of course, they did not.\u201d\n\nObasanjo had granted an interview to deny the claims of his approval of an out-of-court settlement or have knowledge of it.\n\nIn the interview with Premium Times in 2017, the former President warned Adoke to cease further mention of his name in the controversial $1.1 billion Malabu Oil deal.\n\nObasanjo said he considered the controversial award of OPL 245 oil field licence as the \u201cheight of corruption,\u201d and, as such, could not have participated in negotiations that led to it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t support that kind of conduct,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\n\nHis rebuttal came a day after Adoke distributed excerpts of a petition he sent to the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, alleging victimisation and persecution by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nAdoke had told his successor to call the anti-graft agency to order because he was not the only official who acted on behalf of Nigeria in brokering the Malabu Oil deal with international oil majors that included Shell and Eni.\n\nHe specifically mentioned Obasanjo\u2019s name, alongside his two successors and their appointees.\n\n\u201cI believe it is your responsibility to explain to the public who are being sold a fiction that the transaction started from President Olusegun Obasanjo, GCFR under whose administration the Terms of Settlement were brokered with Chief Bayo Ojo, SAN, as the then Attorney General who executed the Terms of Settlement before the tenure of President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, GCFR who approved the final implementation of the Terms of Settlement and my humble self who executed the resolution agreements,\u201d Adoke had said in the petition dated March 6.\n\n\u201cThis is more so as the settlement and its implementation were situated in the Federal Ministry of Justice.\u201d",

          "summary": "The faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun state, loyal to the former governor and Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, is planning to join the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), News Direct has gathered.\nThe crisis between Aregbesola and his successor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has been heightened recently with the total neglect of members of the factional group in the congresses of the party.\nWhen contacted, Alimi who has openly declared hatred for Oyetola, said the video has elapsed, promising that the new date will be announced soon.\nHe noted that the video claimed that the open declaration will take place on March 23 which has lapsed.\nThough there is a plan to join PDP, no time has been fixed.",

          "text": "The federal government Wednesday said bandits operating in the North-west and parts of the North-central zones now collaborate with Boko Haram terrorists dislodged from the North-east region.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed stated this to journalists after the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting at the State House Abuja.\n\nThe government\u2019s position is coming days after about 142 persons were killed across 10 villages in Kanam and Wase local government areas of Plateau state.\n\nIt also comes two weeks after the attack by suspected bandits on the Kaduna-Abuja rail track.\n\nPremium Times had reported how the bandits rigged the tracks of the rail lines with explosives, causing damage to the Kaduna bound train, while also shooting sporadically at the passengers on board the train.\n\nAt least eight people were confirmed killed in the attack while others are still missing, according to the Kaduna state government.\n\nThe bandits, a few days later, released a video of the kidnapped victims who were urging the federal government to heed to their demands before they were released.\n\nMinister speaks\n\nBut reacting to the train incident, Alhaji Mohammed said the dislodged terrorists from the North-eastern part of the country were now in collaboration with the bandits who had hitherto operated in the other two zones in the north, adding that the federal government was working hard to put an end to the menace.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening now is that there is a kind of an unholy handshake between bandits and Boko Haram insurgents. Preliminary reports of what transpired at the Kaduna train attacks show that there is a kind of collaboration between the bandits and the dislodged Boko Haram terrorists from the North-east.\n\n\u201cI can tell you very confidently that the federal government is on top of this matter,\u201d he said.\n\nEfforts to release abductees\n\nOn efforts to rescue the kidnapped victims, Minister of Defence Bashir Magashi, who was at the briefing, also said the government was on top of the situation.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I think the security chiefs are working hard to unveil those that are involved, and we will tell you very soon those that are carrying out these attacks.\n\n\u201cBoth Jos and Kaduna, we will come and explain to the public what is really going on and our efforts to ensure that all these activities are stopped once and for all. We are really on top of the situation. We are planning hard and we will get it out as soon as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nThe revelation by the information minister about the collaboration between the two terrorist groups appears to contradict the position of one of the kingpins of banditry in the North-west region.\n\nNotorious kingpin, Bello Turji, had in an interview with Daily Trust newspaper recently, said he had no connection with ISWAP and Boko Haram members.\n\nTurji said he did not need to have any links with ISWAP and Boko Haram because he had no political agenda or looking to establish his own territory.\n\n\u201cWe are not interested in establishing any religious organisation. We are not aspiring to have a territory of our own, and we don\u2019t have any political aspirations.\n\n\u201cWe took up arms to protect the lives of our people that are being killed, it is not just because we are merciless or we are unconscious of Allah who created us.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Turji said the Muhammadu Buhari-led government cannot curb the illegal firearms in circulation and access to communication in the country.\n\nAfter months of foot-dragging, the federal government, in January, designated the bandits as terrorists.",

          "title": "Continuous voters\u2019 register: Over 1.3m invalid PVCs detected worrisome \u2013 INEC \u2013 Blueprint Newspapers Limited",
          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has uncovered 1,390,519 invalid registrations in the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise, INEC Chairman Professor Mahmood Yakubu has revealed.\n\nYakubu, who announced this at a press conference Wednesday in Abuja, said the figure represents 45 per cent of the 2,523,458 completed registration.\n\nAccording to the INEC chairman, the figure was part of the completed registration starting from June 2021 to January 14, 2022.\n\nHe noted that the exercise now in the fourth quarter of the ongoing CVR resumed June 28, 2021, after it was suspended for the 2019 general elections.\n\nDescribing the invalid registrations as worrisome, the INEC chair described multiple registrations, failure of Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) and incomplete data as examples of invalid voter registrations.\n\nHe stated that all states in the country were involved in the infraction, insisting that the invalid registrations would not be included in the register of voters.\n\nThe INEC boss also said while the number of new registrants was very impressive, the commission had a duty to clean up the data to ensure only eligible Nigerians were registered.\n\n\u201cSadly, it seems that many registrants, either out of ignorance that they do not need to re-register if they had done so before, or a belief that our systems will not detect this infraction, have gone out to register again. This is despite repeated warnings by the Commission against this illegal action.\n\n\u201cIn addition, there are also registrants whose data were incomplete and did not meet our Business Rules for inclusion in the register. Both categories i.e. the failure of ABIS and incomplete data constitute invalid registrations.\n\n\u201cPresently, nearly 45% of completed registrations nationwide are invalid, rising to as high as 60% or more in some States. This infraction happened in all States of the Federation. No State is immune from it. These invalid registrations will not be included in the Register of Voters.\n\n\u201cThis development is worrisome because of the time and resources expended in handling these cases. Even more disturbing are the strong indications that some of our staff may be complicit in facilitating these infractions, notwithstanding stern warnings.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the commission is reviewing reports on such staff and has commenced a detailed investigation which may include the prosecution of those found culpable,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nHe further said specific registrants associated with these infractions by the commission\u2019s staffers, may also face prosecution in line with Sections 22 and 23 of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nThe INEC boss assured that the commission would continue to clean up the register to eliminate invalid registration and ensure that only those who should be in the register of voters are included.\n\n\u201cIt is precisely the introduction of this more robust system that has enabled us to improve our ability to detect these invalid registrants. However, we also suspect that some of these invalid registrations may have arisen out of ignorance. Consequently, the Commission is establishing a dedicated Help Desk for people who need information about the CVR,\u201d he added.\n\nYakubu also said about 1,390,519 Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs) for genuine new registrants have been printed, adding that 464,340 PVCs for verified applicants for transfer or replacement of cards have also been printed.\n\n\u201cConsequently, a total of 1,854,859 PVCs are now ready. They will be delivered to our State offices across the country over the Easter holiday. They will be available for collection by the actual owners in person immediately after the holiday. No PVC will be collected by proxy. I must reiterate that the available cards only cover those who registered in the First and Second Quarters of the exercise,\u201d Yakubu said.\n\nINEC also said: \u201cMeanwhile, following the discovery, about 106,280 voters in Ekiti and Osun states were disqualified due to invalid registration ahead of the governorship elections in the two states.\n\n\u201cIn Ekiti state, a total of 40,234 new voters were registered out of which 17,640 were voided representing 43.9% of the completed registrations while in Osun State, 218,142 new registrations were completed, out of which 88,630 were invalidated, representing 40.6% of the total number of new voters.\u201d\n\nYakubu, however, assured that all registered voters in Osun and Ekiti states would have their PVCs ready before the governorship elections in the two states.\n\nParty primaries\n\nOn political parties\u2019 primaries, Yakubu maintained that the dates for all activities in the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 general elections, including the conduct of party primaries, were firm and fixed.\n\nAccording to him, only 10 political parties have served notices to the Commission for the conduct of their primaries.\n\n\u201cWith 52 days to the last day for the conduct of primaries, that is June 3 2022, political parties are once again admonished to adhere strictly to all dates in the Timetable, including the nomination of their candidates via the INEC web portal.\n\n\u201cSuch nominated candidates must emerge from valid primaries as provided in Section 84 of the Electoral Act 2022. This is necessary to avoid the unhappy consequences of any breach of the Commission\u2019s Timetable or the Electoral Act\u201d, he stated.\n\nSecurity\n\nOn security, the commission\u2019s boss said: \u201cWe are all concerned about the security challenges. But the environment must be secured for INEC to conduct the election. We are liaising with the security agencies to secure the environment for us to conduct the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nUN meets APC chair\n\nIn a related development, the United Nations Electoral Assistance Division (UNEAD) in Nigeria Wednesday met the national leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) with a call for peaceful and inclusive 2023 elections.\n\nThe UNEAD delegation, led by Serge Kubwimana, made the call after a meeting with the APC National Secretary, Senator Iyiola Omisore, who represented the APC national chairman, Sen. Abdullahi Adamu at the party\u2019s national secretariat in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking with newsmen shortly after the meeting, the UNEAD delegation, Serge Kubwimana, expressed intent to contribute to a peaceful and inclusive process leading to next year\u2019s general elections.\n\n\u201cWe are the United Nations Electoral Assistance Division (UNEAD) which is in Nigeria as a result of a request for electoral support for the UN to assess the overall context which the election will take place and see in what form we could potentially bring our small contribution to the 2023 elections.\n\n\u201cWe have conferred with the APC National Secretary on behalf of the National Chairman and we have done the same with other stakeholders such as INEC, government, civil society organizations, other major political parties, faith-based organizations, inter-party advisory council to name a few.\n\n\u201cIn a nutshell, we are here to express our intent to contribute to a peaceful and inclusive process next year and to see where we can be of value. The country has strong institutions and the ability to run its elections. There are issues of course, but Nigeria is not the only place where you see issues around elections. So our role again here is to see how we can support one of our member states,\u201d Kubwimina said.\n\nSenators beg Adamu\n\nMeanwhile, senators Wednesday subtly begged the APC national chairman, Senator Adamu for return tickets to the Senate.\n\nThe plea by the lawmakers came through contributions made during the valedictory session the Senate held in honour of Adamu, the APC deputy national chairman (North), and Zamfara state Deputy Governor Senator Mohammed Hassan.\n\nFirst to make the plea was Senator James Manager (PDP Delta South) who told Adamu to protect the interest of serving lawmakers on the APC platform during the coming primaries.\n\n\u201cThe period we are in now, is that of danger for Senators seeking return tickets. Though we are not in the same political party, but protect those in your party from the periodic danger,\u201d he said.\n\nHitting the nail on the head in his own remarks, Senator Ali Ndume said the rate of turnover in the number of legislators failing in return bids was worrisome and should be addressed.\n\nHe urged the party\u2019s national chairman and his deputy to protect the sanctity of the National Assembly, as it is the most vulnerable arm of government.\n\n\u201cThis Institution and by extension, the House of Representatives must be protected by way of prevention of legislative brain drain.\n\n\u201cYour experience as third term Senator before becoming the National Chairman of our great party should be brought to bear in stemming the tide of high rate of turnovers,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso making similar request, Senator Akpan Bassey (PDP Akwa Ibom North East), said Adamu is a man that can be trusted in doing the needful on the issue of high turnover of legislators.\n\n\u201cCombination of Senator Adamu as National Chairman of APC and Abubakar Kyari as Deputy National Chairman (North), will surely do the right thing as far as interests of Senators on the platform of their party are concerned,\u201d he said.\n\nIn yet another remarks, Senator Adamu Aliero (APC Kebbi Central), commended Senator Adamu for laying the foundation of Nasarawa state and strides in developing the education sector.\n\nHe noted that as the first chairman of the Nigerian Governors Forum, Senator Adamu was able to ensure harmony among members irrespective of diverse political persuasion.\n\nAlso i another contribution, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu (Abia North), urged the APC leader to bring his wealth of experience as former NGF chairman to bear on the administration of the ruling party.\n\nBut the Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe (PDP Abia South), urged Adamu to deepen democracy in the discharge of his duties more so, as a product of the Peoples Democratic Party.\n\nTaking his turn, Senate President Ahmad Lawan described the emergence of four members (serving and former) of the National Assembly as party executives of the APC as a remarkable development in the political evolution and history of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThat the National Chairman, Deputy National Chairman (North), National Secretary and National Auditor are all people who are either completing their service in the Senate or were here before.\n\n\u201cWhat this goes to show is that the legislature is coming of age, that the legislature is now contributing to the political development and stability of our country, and we shouldn\u2019t take this for granted.\n\n\u201cEven though the legislature has been the most disadvantaged arm of government out of the three, but I think it is rapidly developing,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nIn his remarks, the APC chairman, Senator Adamu, assured that the newly elected lawmakers in the APC would protect the integrity of the National Assembly within the confines of the party and its processes.\n\nHe also extended a hand of friendship to lawmakers in the minority party to become APC members.",

This is gradually becoming unavoidable and inevitable.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: NLC Asks FG To Resolve Impasse With ASUU, NASU, Others In 21 Days\n\nSome of the issues that led to the industrial action, according to the unions, include problems of inconsistencies in payment with the Integrated Payroll and Personnel information system (IPPIS), non-payment of earned allowances, and non-payment of arrears of national minimum wage and consequential adjustment, among others.\n\nNASU and SSANU faulted the government for failing to implement an agreement it freely entered into with the unions.\n\nThey also called on Nigerians and stakeholders in the university system to prevail on the government to honour the agreement to avoid a \u2018total breakdown of industrial harmony in the universities and inter-university centres.\n\nRead the full text of the communique below:\n\nJOINT ACTION COMMITTEE OF NASU AND SSANU PRESS CONFERENCE HELD ON WEDNESDAY, 13TH APRIL, 2022 AT BOLTON WHITE HOTEL, ABUJA\n\nOur friends from the Press, this meeting has been called to acquaint you with matters leading to and arising from the ongoing industrial action embarked upon by the Joint Action Committee (JAC) of the Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions (NASU) and the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU).\n\nThis strike, like others before it, was borne out of the insensitivity and non-responsive nature of the Government and its officials to matters affecting the members of the Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions (NASU) and the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) and by extension, the entire University System.\n\nYou will recall that the Joint Action Committee of NASU and SSANU had embarked on an industrial action that started on Friday, February 5th, 2021, and culminated in a Memorandum of Action (MoA) signed on Thursday, February 20th, 2021. Prior to this, we had embarked on a fourteen-day warning strike which culminated in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed on Tuesday, 20th October 2020.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the issues that led to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) of October 2020 and the Memorandum of Action (MoA) of February 2021 are the same issues that have led to this strike action of March 2022. It needs to be said that these same issues had led to previous Collective Bargaining Agreements with the Government in 2017, and 2018 before the agreements reached in 2020 and 2021.\n\nGoing by this, therefore, it is easy to conclude that the recurring cause of industrial unrest in our Universities and Inter-University Centres, especially between the JAC of NASU and SSANU and the Federal Government, has been the total disrespect and contemptuous disregard for Collective Bargaining Agreements by the Government.\n\nWhat are the issues that have led to these strike actions?\n\nThe problem of inconsistencies in Payment with IPPIS;\n\nNon-Payment of Earned Allowances;\n\nNon-Payment of Arrears of National Minimum Wage and its Consequential Adjustment;\n\nPoor Funding of State Universities;\n\nDelay in Renegotiation of the 2009 Agreements;\n\nNon-RELEASE of White Papers of Visitation Panels;\n\nUsurpation of Headship of Non-Teaching Units in clear violation of Conditions of Service and Establishment Procedures; and\n\nNon-Payment of Retirement Benefits to Outgone Members.\n\nThe Problem Of Inconsistencies In Payment With IPPIS\n\nAs had been expressed previously, while other stakeholders had from ab-initio rejected the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System, the Joint Action Committee had embraced the payment platform with the belief that it would stem the tide of corruption in the University system and with the understanding that the peculiarities of the University system would be taken into consideration in its operations.\n\nAlas, having permitted our members to enrol into the platform, what we witnessed was the most haphazard and disorganised pattern of salary application as our members began to receive salaries haphazardly, salaries of clerks paid to Professors and vice-versa, unpredictable salaries, non-issuance of payment advice or payslips, unsubscribed deductions to unknown organizations, non-remittance of payments to third parties especially Cooperative Societies and Unions, etc. The anomalies exposed a new underbelly of centralised corruption in the IPPIS office as against the decentralised corruption perpetrated by some University and Inter-University Centre Managements, which we had fought hard against.\n\nIn view of the pains experienced from IPPIS, we had engaged the Government and at the October 2020 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), agreed that a five-man Committee would carefully address all the concerns raised by the Unions on IPPIS. This did not happen and the Memorandum of Action (MoA) of February 2021 resolved that the committee must hand in its report within one month i.e. March 2021. To date, one year after, we await the outcome of the work of the 5-man committee.\n\nIt should be noted that the 2020 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) raised a challenge for the Joint Action Committee to come up with an alternative platform which we christened University Peculiar Personnel and Payroll System (U3PS).\n\nThis U3PS accommodates all the peculiarities of the university system and is a multi-tenant system that includes employees\u2019 salaries, bonuses, deductions, generation of pay advice and financial reports using accounting best practices. The U3PS is the solution to the problems encountered through IPPIS.\n\nWe have since communicated our desire to present the Payroll System to the Federal Government but to date, after two years of notifying the Government of the existence of the payment platform, we have not been invited for a presentation talk less of accrediting it with the relevant Government agencies.\n\nNon-Payment of Earned Allowances\n\nThe Earned Allowances are products of the FGN/NASU and SSANU 2009 Agreements. Following our industrial action of October 2020 and the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) therefrom, the Government had accepted to pay a sum of N30 Billion Naira being part of the outstanding sum owed for Earned Allowances.\n\nWhile the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) had stated that the criteria for disbursement would be according to the computation from each University and Inter-University Centre in line with what is outstanding for each staff, sadly, when the said sum was released, it was evident that rather than adopt the submissions of Universities and Inter-University Centres, the Federal Ministry of Education in releasing N22 billion adopted a lopsided sharing formula of 75% for ASUU and 25% for other Unions.\n\nPrior to the N22 Billion released late last year, previous disbursements had witnessed the same lopsided sharing formula without recourse to submissions from Universities and Inter-University Centres.\n\nAs responsible Unions, we have always demanded a forensic audit of all disbursements because we are convinced that the manner of disbursements and allocations are tainted with many irregularities which must be corrected going forward because the backlogs being owed our members continue to pile up. It is for this reason that we demand and insist that the N30 Billion originally agreed upon to be paid as part of what is being owed us, be released as a precondition for suspending the strike.\n\nNon-Payment of Arrears of National Minimum Wage and Its Consequential Adjustment\n\nIt would shock Nigerians to hear that four years after the National Minimum Wage was signed into law, the arrears of the payment is being owed to workers in the University system. This has been a thorny issue that the 2020 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) and 2021 Memorandum of Action (MoA) addressed.\n\nSpecifically, the 2021 Memorandum of Action (MoA) stated that the amount being owed to Tertiary Institutions including Inter-University Centres was N18,629,473,989.39 (N18.6 Billion) which would be captured in the 2021 supplementary Budget.\n\nIt was also agreed that the money would be processed for payment within a three months time frame. Three months from March 2021 would have been June 2021 and the money was not paid. We have had four three months since March 2021 and all efforts including follow-ups at the Budget Office and other relevant offices have yielded no results.\n\nPoor Funding of State Universities\n\nWe have continually made a case for the strengthening of the supervisory roles of the National Universities Commission to sanction or even deny accreditation to proprietors of Universities who are not meeting up to the personnel obligations of paying their staff, most especially State Governments.\n\nAs of today, many of our members in State Universities are being owed salaries running into arrears of months because of insufficient or zero subventions by State Governors. We had addressed our concerns on this issue in the 2021 Memorandum of Action (MoA) but to date, no action was taken on this. Our request for a meeting with the governors\u2019 forum on this matter has also not attracted any positive response.\n\nDelay in Renegotiation of the 2009 Agreements\n\nWe must admit that perhaps out of all the issues raised in the two Memoranda under reference, only the issue of renegotiations of the 2009 Agreements of NASU and SSANU is under processing.\n\nThese are however too early to conclude because meetings of the renegotiation team chaired by eminent Professor Nimi Briggs have only started. We however hope that tangible results are gotten from the engagements and discussions are not stalled as was the case in the past.\n\nNon-Release of White Papers of Visitation Panels and Constitution of Governing Councils\n\nThe health of our University system is predicated on the assignment of Visitation Panels to the Universities and Inter-University Centres. One year after the Visitation Panels completed their assignments and reports submitted, and despite our continued agitations for release of White Papers, nothing has been done.\n\nWe wish to further add that while the Federal Government had constituted Governing Councils for a number of Universities, Universities of Agriculture have been without Governing Councils for upward of a year now leading to dislocations in the Governance of those specialised Universities.\n\nUsurpation of Headship of Non-Teaching Units in clear violation of Conditions of Service and Establishment Procedures\n\nUsurpation of Non-Teaching staff positions by academic staff has been an issue that we are very passionate about because of its truncation of the careers of our members. This was assured to be addressed in the 2021 Memorandum of Action (MoA) but to date, nothing has been done.\n\nNon-Payment of Retirement Benefits of Outgone Members\n\nConcerted effort has not been put in the payment of retirement and death benefits to our retired and outgone members and the hardship caused by inexplicable delays in payment of retirement and death benefits to retired and departed staff is excruciating.\n\nThese anomalies were pointed out to the Government and in the signed Memorandum of Action (MoA) of February 2021, it was agreed that within three months-timeline, efforts will be made to correct the anomalies. To date, nothing concrete has been done on the matter.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe above issues among others represent the core of our disagreement with the Government. Arising from the last memorandum and following up on the issues, we had written no less than ten letters or reminders to the Government to no avail, not even an acknowledgement.\n\nThe letters of reminder included those dated 26th July 2021; 18th August 2021; 25th October 2021; 22nd November 2021; 24th February 2022; 1st March 2022 and 16th March 2022.\n\nIt was at the end of all these reminders with no acknowledgement by the Government that we were left with no other resort but to embark on a two-week warning strike. Prior to the strike, due process was duly followed, and the notice were issued in line with the extant laws.\n\nShamefully and painfully, there was no attempt by the Government to intercept or even invite the Unions to a meeting. This aloof and contemptuous attitude of the Government further incensed our members who resolved that following the failure of the Government to even invite the leadership for a meeting, the strike should be extended by another two weeks before an indefinite and total strike is declared.\n\nAs of today, the two weeks extension is getting to the middle and with no response in sight from Government, we may be left with no resort but to embark on an indefinite and total strike. This is gradually becoming unavoidable and inevitable.\n\nTo say we are saddened by the developments is putting it mildly; it is unbelievable that a Government cannot live up to its honour by implementing an agreement it freely entered into. It is a sorry path that we had avoided but being left with no choice, we have brought our agitation to you with a view to presenting them to the world.\n\nWe call on well-meaning Nigerians and stakeholders in the University System to prevail on Government to honour the agreement it freely entered into with the Joint Action Committee of NASU and SSANU in order to avoid a total breakdown of industrial harmony in the Nigeria Universities and Inter-University Centres.\n\nThank you.",

          "text": "More than 1,000 Ukrainian marines have surrendered in the besieged port of Mariupol, Russia\u2019s defence ministry said on Wednesday of Moscow\u2019s main target in the eastern Donbas region which it has yet to bring under its control.\n\nIf the Russians take the Azovstal industrial district, where the marines have been holed up, they would be in full control of Mariupol, which would allow Russia to reinforce a land corridor between separatist-held eastern areas and the Crimea region that it seized and annexed in 2014.\n\nSurrounded by Russian troops for weeks, Mariupol would be the first major city to fall since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, with the battle for the industrial heartland of Donbas likely to define the course of the war.\n\nUkraine\u2019s general staff said that Russian forces were proceeding with attacks on Azovstal and the port, but a defence ministry spokesman said he had no information about any surrender.\n\nReuters journalists accompanying Russian-backed separatists saw flames billowing from the Azovstal district on Tuesday.\n\nOn Monday, the 36th Marine Brigade said it was preparing for a final battle in Mariupol that would end in death or capture as its troops had run out of ammunition.\n\nThousands of people are believed to have been killed in Mariupol and Russia has been massing thousands of troops in the area for a new assault, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said.\n\nUkraine says tens of thousands of civilians have been trapped inside the city with no way to bring in food or water, and accuses Russia of blocking aid convoys.\n\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry said that 1,026 soldiers of Ukraine\u2019s 36th Marine Brigade surrendered, including 162 officers.\n\nCHEMICAL WEAPONS WARNING\n\nChechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, an ardent supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin, urged remaining Ukrainians holed up in Azovstal to surrender.\n\n\u201cWithin Azovstal at the moment there are about 200 wounded who cannot receive any medical assistance,\u201d Kadyrov said in a Telegram post. \u201cFor them and all the rest it would be better to end this pointless resistance and go home to their families.\u201d\n\nRussian television showed pictures of what it said were marines giving themselves up at Illich Iron and Steel Works in Mariupol on Tuesday, many of them wounded.\n\nIt showed what it said were Ukrainian soldiers being marched down a road with their hands in the air. One of the soldiers was shown holding a Ukrainian passport.\n\nUkrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Malyar has said there was a high risk of Russia using chemical weapons, echoing earlier warnings by Zelenskiy, who on Wednesday told the Estonian parliament by videolink Russia was using phosphorus bombs to terrorise civilians.\n\nHe did not provide evidence and Reuters has not been able to independently verify his assertion.\n\nChemical weapons production, use and stockpiling is banned under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. Although condemned by human rights groups, white phosphorous is not banned.\n\nRussia denies using chemical weapons, saying it had destroyed its last chemical stockpiles in 2017.\n\nMoscow\u2019s incursion into Ukraine, the biggest attack on a European state since 1945, has seen more than 4.6 million people flee abroad, killed or wounded thousands and left Russia increasingly isolated on the world stage.\n\nThe Ukrainian prosecutor general\u2019s office said 191 children had been killed and 349 wounded since the start of the invasion.\n\nThe Kremlin says it launched a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to demilitarise and \u201cdenazify\u201d Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext for an unprovoked attack.\n\nFOUR PRESIDENTS VISITING KYIV\n\nThe presidents of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were on their way to Kyiv to meet Zelenskiy, an adviser to the Polish leader said on Wednesday.\n\nThe four join a growing number of European politicians to visit the Ukrainian capital since Russian forces were driven away from the country\u2019s north earlier this month.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden said for the first time that Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine amounted to genocide, as Putin said Russia would \u201crhythmically and calmly\u201d continue its operation and achieve its goals.\n\nRussia has denied targeting civilians and has said Ukrainian and Western allegations of war crimes are fabricated.\n\nMany towns Russia has retreated from in northern Ukraine were littered with the bodies of civilians killed in what Kyiv says was a campaign of murder, torture and rape.\n\nInterfax Ukraine news agency on Wednesday quoted the Kyiv district police chief saying 720 bodies had been found in the region around the capital, with more than 200 people missing.\n\nThe General Headquarters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said Russian forces were maintaining attacks on civilian infrastructure in the Kharkiv region in the northeast and the Zaporizhzhia region in central Ukraine.\n\nAt least seven people were killed and 22 wounded in Kharkiv over the past 24 hours, Governor Oleh Synegubov said. A 2-year-old boy was among those killed in the 53 artillery or rocket strikes Russian forces had carried out in the region, he said in an online post.\n\nReuters could not independently verify the information.\n\nRussia denies targeting civilians. Putin on Tuesday used his first public comments on the conflict in more than a week to say Russia would \u201crhythmically and calmly\u201d continue its operation, and expressed confidence his goals would be achieved.\n\nZelenskiy mocked Putin in an early morning address: \u201cHow could a plan that provides for the death of tens of thousands of their own soldiers in a little more than a month of war come about?\u201d\n\nReuters",

          "text": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has refused to resign after being fined for breaking his government\u2019s pandemic lockdown rules, saying he would instead redouble efforts to strengthen the economy and combat Russian aggression in Ukraine.\n\nLondon police fined Johnson and other people Tuesday for attending a birthday party thrown for the prime minister at his Downing Street offices on June 19, 2020. The penalty made Johnson the first British prime minister ever found to have broken the law while in office.\n\nGatherings of more than two people were banned in Britain at the time of the birthday party to curb the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cI understand the anger that many will feel that I, myself, fell short when it came to observing the very rules which the government I lead had introduced to protect the public, and I accept in all sincerity that people had the right to expect better,\u201d Johnson said late Tuesday. \u201cAnd now I feel an even greater sense of obligation to deliver on the priorities of the British people.\u201d\n\nThe fine followed a police investigation and months of questions about lockdown-breaking parties at government offices, which Johnson had tried to bat away by saying there were no parties and that he believed no rules were broken.\n\nOpposition lawmakers demanded Johnson\u2019s resignation, arguing the fines given to him and Treasury chief Rishi Sunak were evidence of \u201ccriminality\u201d at the heart of government. The opposition argued that the Downing Street gathering demonstrated that Johnson and his supporters believe the rules don\u2019t apply to them.\n\nWhile the \u201cpartygate\u201d scandal ooses a threat to Johnson\u2019s government, the world has changed tremendously since the first reports of the parties surfaced late last year.\n\nJohnson has been a leading figure in marshaling international opposition to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, and Britain is facing its worst cost-of-living crisis since the 1950s.\n\nHis supporters are already arguing that whatever the prime minister may have done wrong, now is not time for a leadership contest.\n\nThat his Treasury chief also received an undermining fine helps Johnson since Sunak had been seen as the leading candidate to succeed Johnson.\n\nBut Johnson still faces the possibility of additional fines; he is reported to have attended three other gatherings that the Metropolitan Police Service is still investigating.\n\nHe will also have to answer questions about whether he knowingly misled Parliament with his previous statements about the parties, Jill Rutter, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government in London, said.\n\n\u201cGovernments have to realize that they can\u2019t just make laws and then skirt around them and rationalize themselves that it\u2019s all OK because they\u2019re very important people working at the center of government,\u201d Rutter said.",
