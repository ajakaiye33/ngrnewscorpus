          "text": "Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency have intercepted consignments of cocaine and heroin with a combined weight of 16.85 kilograms worth over N4.9 billion in street value at the Apapa seaport and Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos.\n\nThe Director, Media and Advocacy, NDLEA Headquarters, Abuja, Femi Babafemi disclosed this in a statement on Sunday.\n\nHe said four persons are currently being investigated for the 13.65kg cocaine seized onboard a ship, MV Karteria that came into the Apapa port from Santos, Brazil on Sunday, November 7, 2021, barely three weeks after 32.9kg of cocaine was intercepted at the port on another vessel, MV Chayanee Naree, also from Santos, Brazil.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cIn well-coordinated follow-up operations, no fewer than five persons have been arrested in different parts of Lagos and Delta states in connection to the seizure of 3.200kg heroin found on a passenger, Christian Osondu at the E- Arrival hall of the MMIA, on Friday 5th November, during the inward clearance of Air Peace flight passengers from South Africa. A swift follow-up operation the same day led to the arrest of one Ude Onyeka Victor, at Mafoluku area of Oshodi, Lagos.\n\n\u201cUde Onyeka confessed that his elder brother, Ikenna Ude, who is based in South Africa, had instructed him to collect the bag containing the drug and hand it over to another person who was supposed to come from Delta State. A second follow-up operation led to the arrest of Abanjo Innocent who came to Lagos from Delta State to pick the bag containing the drug around Cele Bus stop, Okota, on Saturday 6th November. He also confessed that he was contracted by one Oseki Chinedu, who is based in South Africa to travel to Lagos to collect the bag and bring it to Agbor junction, Delta State. The third follow-up operation led to the arrest of Ihator Theophilus Isioma at Agbor Junction, Delta State on Sunday 7th November.\u201d\n\nThe statement also said NDLEA operatives in Bayelsa State on Saturday, November 13, 2021, arrested one Obeluo Emeka from Anambra West Local Government Area of Anambra State with 600 grams of heroin.\n\n\u201cThe suspect who is a motor spare parts dealer based in Douala, Cameroon had arrived at Yenagoa by waterway to waybill the substance to an undisclosed address in Lagos.\n\n\u201cNot less than four suspects were arrested and different quantities of cocaine, cannabis, tramadol and Methamphetamine seized from them during weekend raids at Rumuokoro, Elelenwo and Omagwa/Elele communities in Rivers State. Those arrested include Elizabeth Iniama, Sir King Emmanuel, Godgift King and Amadi Bright.\n\n\u201cA total of 18.51kg of assorted illicit drugs were recovered on Saturday 13th November when operatives raided a neighbourhood of Bayan Gari, and Sir Ahmadu Bello Way, Bauchi town, Bauchi State where two suspects; Mr. Gabriel Iwagbunan and Ms. Cecilia Ezena were arrested.\n\n\u201cWhile 23-year-old Hadiza Ibrahim was arrested on Saturday 12th November along Okene-Lokoja highway with 54kg of cannabis, one Sunday Nnam a.k.a Idowu was nabbed the same day in Emene area of Enugu with 45kg of the same substance. In the same vein, one Umar Muhammad was arrested with 25,700 capsules of Tramadol weighing 15.1kg in Tudun Hatsi area of Gombe.\n\n\u201cIn Ogun State, following credible intelligence, two suspects; David Oduku, and Ifeanyi Raphael, were intercepted along Ore- Shagamu expressway with 364.98kg of cannabis being conveyed in a blue Toyota Sienna Bus, while two suspects; Buhari Jamiu and Ajibola Jimoh were arrested in the early hours of Sunday 14th November with 189kg of cannabis at Olorunlagba, Bode Saadu area of Kwara state.\n\n\u201cWhile commending the officers and men of Apapa port command and MMIA as well as their counterparts in Bayelsa, Rivers, Bauchi, Kogi, Enugu, Gombe, Ogun, and Kwara states for sustaining the maxim of offensive action against drug cartels in the country, Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig.

          "title": "How climate change affects our 2021 harvest \u2013 Nigerian farmers",
          "text": "Farmers in the North \u2013 Central and Taraba have narrated different experiences from the effects of irregular rainfall patterns on harvest during the 2021 farming season, as the cropping season rolls to an end.\n\n\n\nIn a survey conducted by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in the zone, some of the farmers said the rains impacted on their crops positively as they were already recording bumper harvest.\n\n\n\nOthers, however, submitted that the rains had ceased too early, which made them to experience poor yields.\n\n\n\nExperts are of the view that the irregular rainfall patterns which subsequently affect harvest in these parts of the country can also be attributed to the global problem of climate change.\n\n\n\nIn Benue, it was a joyous note as farmers said that the rainfall recorded in the state in the 2021 planting season affected their crops positively and had led to a bumper harvest for most.\n\n\n\nOne of them is Mrs Mbaoron Tyoakaa, a yam farmer, who said that the rainfall impacted positively on her crops.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am yet to commence full harvesting of my crops but I am sure that I will have better yields at the end of the day.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have harvested only a small portion and the harvest is good,\u201d Tyoakaa said excitedly.\n\n\n\nAnother grower, Mr Terdue Ijir, a soybean farmer, said that he had very good harvest from the 2021 cropping season.\n\n\n\n\u201cI have harvested all the soybean that I planted; though I am yet to thrash it but I know that I will get more bags when compared to the 2020 harvest.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am grateful to God for the harvest because he provided us with enough rainfall,\u201d Ijir said.\n\n\n\nA farmer who grows both soybean and rice, Mr Titus Atondu, said that the bumper harvest experienced by farmers in the state had also affected the price of their yields.\n\n\n\nAtondu said that before the bumper harvest, a 28 \u2013 kilogramme bag of soybean was sold for N35,000 but now it is N28,000.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlso, a 28kg bag of rice was sold for 32,000 and some N30,000 but now it is sold for N25,000 and N24,000 respectively for same size of bag,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe Director, Agricultural Services in the state, Mr Thomas Unongo also commented.\n\n\n\nUnongo said that farmers in the state were given seeds that could withstand drought and all types of infections, and that helped them to have bumper harvest.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey were also given water resistant crops and they planted, so, no matter the amount of rainfall, they will still have bountiful harvest.\n\n\n\n\u201cMost farmers in the state will have bumper harvest because most of them applied the \u201dGood Agronomic Practices,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, farmers in Taraba have expressed delight over the bumper harvest recorded in the 2021 cropping season due to the steady rainfall enjoyed in the state throughout the season.\n\n\n\nThose of them who spoke with NAN in Jalingo noted that the rains had very positive impact on their crops during the season.\n\n\n\nAmong them was Mr Simon Ijir, a rice farmer, who said that the rainfall which lasted up till November had resulted in bumper harvest for him and other farmers in the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis cropping season is exceptional because there has been steady rainfall that led to a bumper harvest for many crops,\u201d Ijir said.\n\n\n\nHe, however, lamented that the bumper harvest did not cause a drop in prices of foodstuff in the state due to the current inflationary trend in the country.\n\n\n\nEqually, Alhaji Aliyu Suleiman, a maize farmer, said that the adequate rainfall had put smiles on the faces of farmers as it resulted to greater yields of many crops.\n\n\n\nAccording to Suleiman, even the beans that he normally mixes with maize has done exceedingly well due to steady rainfall witnessed during the cropping season.\n\n\n\nMrs Mary Aso, a beniseed farmer, said the steady rainfall had helped greatly in enhancing bumper harvest in 2021.\n\n\n\nDr David Kassa, the Taraba Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, said that farmers of various crops had reported bumper harvest in the state.\n\n\n\nAccording to Kassa, the rainfall starts on time and continues till November, saying the situation has made high yield of crops possible in the state.\n\n\n\nHe urged farmers to reserve a portion of the crops for their consumption against the rising inflation in the country.\n\n\n\nIn Kogi, a farmer, Mr Wale Oloruntoba, said farmers in the state had also recorded bumper harvest.\n\n\n\nAccording to Oloruntoba, everything they planted such as Beniseed, beans, yam, soybeans and groundnuts, yielded very well, adding that guinea corn too has been growing well.\n\n\n\n\u201dWe thank God for the level of rainfall this year because as farmers, we have experienced bumper harvest of crops such as yam, soya beans, maize and beniseed,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nMrs Esther Audu, the National President, Women in Agriculture Cooperative Federation Ltd. told NAN that rainfall had impacted positively on farm produce and food items in the 2021 cropping season.\n\n\n\nAudu said that under normal circumstances, the impact of the rains on the cost of food would have been great and favourable.\n\n\n\nHowever, she said that the reverse was the case, because farmers could not cultivate much crops because of the fear of attacks by herdsmen and kidnappers.\n\n\u201dSo, there is not much difference in the cost of food,\u201d Audu said.\n\n\n\nShe said that rice, yam, maize, groundnuts were the crops the farmers were able to cultivate at nearby farmlands.\n\n\n\nIn a related development, in Plateau, an agriculture expert, Mr Emmanuel Kwapdimma, said the state experienced unusual rainfall pattern during the 2021 cropping season, which he described as \u201ca mixed fortune\u201d for farmers in the area.\n\n\n\nKwapdimma who works with the Plateau Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, said that the rain started late, ceased mid season and stopped early.\n\n\n\nHe said that the unusual pattern negatively affected crops such as rice and maize, but favoured potatoes, soybeans, and cowpeas.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor potatoes, the water was enough, but it was not for maize because maize is usually planted late, same for rice,\u201d Kwapdimma said.\n\n\n\nHe said that the unusual situation had adversely affected harvest which in turn had negative impact on food security.\n\n\n\nAccording to Kwapdimma,\n\nif there is low yield per hectare, it will have ripple effects on food security generally.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you were getting 30 bags and then it is reduced to 20 bags, there is likelihood that it will affect food security.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is one of the impacts of climate change on food security,\u201d he said.\n\nMr John Wuyep, Chairman All Farmers Association (AFAN), Plateau chapter, also told a tale of woe.\n\n\n\nWuyep said there was a shortfall in the rainfall pattern in the state, and it affected crops especially rain-fed rice, maize and others.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe rain stopped at some point and before it returned, most of the crops had withered.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor most of this year, farms did not retain any water and such is not good for rice and other crops that need water to thrive.\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, crops such as cowpea, potatoes and others that don\u2019t need much water did well,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nMr Amos Shinat, Chairman Plateau Potato Value Chain, told NAN that the rainfall pattern did not affect potato much.\n\n\n\nShinat said that except in places where the soil was gravel in nature and generated heat during the period that the rain ceased, there was nothing to complain about.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have gone round the village markets, and you will observe that the farmers have bumper harvest.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the rainfall pattern had affected it, we wouldn\u2019t have seen much yield like that.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf at all the rain affected us, maybe out of 100 farmers, 10 or 15 were affected depending on the nature of the land.\n\n\n\n\u201cThose that have good yields were far more than those that did not have,\u201d she explained.\n\n\n\nThe situation is, however, different in Niger, as the state chapter of AFAN said the sudden seizure of rain during the season would bring about poor yields and subsequent increase in prices of foodstuff.\n\n\n\nThe Vice Chairman of the association, Alhaji Abdulrahman Yusuf, who stated this, was emphatic that there would be no bumper harvest in the state in 2021 unless government took proactive measures to assist farmers with dry season irrigation equipment.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere was drought in between, so it will affect crop production negatively.\n\n\u201cThere has been break in the rain pattern for over three weeks now,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\n\n\nHe said that the cessation of rainfall would result in low yield for rice because many of the swampy areas where farmers cultivated rice did not get enough water to make it swampy.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe inadequate rain has resulted in stunted growth for our rice. Therefore, we are going to have poor yields,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\n\n\nThe chairman said that other crops that would be affected negatively owing to inadequate rainfall were soybeans and sorghum which required adequate rainfall to mature.\n\n\n\nHe explained that cowpea such as beans would do well as it did not require heavy rain to mature.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, some farmers in Nasarawa State have lamented the low crop yields being recorded in the state, which they blamed on the commencement of early rains that were not sustained.\n\n\n\nOne of them is Mr Abel Abogonye of Shabu community who complained that the early rains impacted negatively on his yam farm.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen the rain started late February, so many of us started planting yams.\n\nUnfortunately the rain ceased around March, but returned and lasted till the end of May, when most yams became stunted.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe yield is not as we had in 2020. At about this time last year, we were selling 10 tubers of yam for less than N3,000 because of the bumper harvest. Now, 10 tubers of yam, depending on the size, ranges between N5,000 and N7,000,\u201d Abogonye said.\n\n\n\nBlessing Wuni, a beans and water melon farmer, said the irregular rainfall affected her yields this harvest season.\n\n\n\n\u201cA 100 kilogramme bag of melon now sells for N108,000 as against N53,000 it was sold same time in 2020.\n\n\n\n\u201cBeans now sells for N1,200 per measure (Mudu) as against N350 same time last year,\u201d Wuni said.\n\n\n\nShe however, said that farmers in the area were expecting bumper harvest of crops such as guinea corn and millet.",

          "text": "The Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Folashade Yemi-Esan, has called for a strategic approach to civil service operations, to ensure sustainable growth in Nigeria.\n\nYemi-Esan said this in her keynote address on Saturday night, at the official launch of a book entitled: \u201cAgents of change: the transformational journey of such a one\u201d authored by Dr Olusegun Olasode, in Abuja.\n\nShe described the book as inspirational, saying that to elicit change effectively in Nigeria was a peculiar task, but one that compatriots must do, because the civil service was the nation\u2019s engine room.\n\nAccording to her, the civil service in Nigeria occupied a strategic position and \u201dif we cannot get it right in the civil service, then I do not know how Nigeria would survive\u201d.\n\n\u201cI believe that we must institute systems structured that will last forever in Nigeria. Systems that even if we do not know are not there, the system will run itself and give us the desired effect.\n\n\u201cWhatever we are doing without a strategy we cannot win; although in Nigeria we have this saying that we are very good at developing policies, we are very good at developing visions.\n\n\u201cOur mission anywhere in the world, we are the best, but how do we implement all those things?\n\n\u201cThe onus is on us as civil servants to ensure that the vision of the administration becomes our agenda, as a reality in our own time\u201d, the head of service said.\n\nShe reiterated the need for a strategic approach in the civil service, while urging Nigerians to draw lessons from the book as agents of change, to promote national growth.\n\nThe author, Olasode said that book was centred on teaching the reader to recognise whether he or she had the capacity to make positive change happen, irrespective of levels and forms.\n\nIt may not be just to become president, governor or director of a company, but in every little space we could be agents to make something better.\n\n\u201cWe all have talent, ability and gifts; we must apply them in the right way; we have better leaders who are younger than we the older ones.\n\n\u201cIt is not about age, it is not about degree, it is about someone who has vision; leadership and strategy which must work together to make positive change happen.\n\n\u201cEvery leader lays out their vision, but what the book talks about is to make that vision happen and what strategy they should adopt, to make that vision a reality,\u201d Olasode said.\n\nHe further stressed the need to mentor young people at the early stages of their lives, so as to promote positive change in the country.\n\nA clergyman, Pastor Kunle Shoyele, commended Olasode for publishing the book, saying that it would be a blessing to the world, citing portions of the Holy Bible to urge Nigerians to always seek divine wisdom to overcome situations.\n\n\u201cPeople have to be in charge, even when we do not have what it takes to be in charge. As long as it is good to be in charge or be in control, desire what it takes to be in charge.\n\n\u201cIt takes wisdom, power and knowledge, to know what to do to be in charge,\u201d Shoyele said.\n\nThe 132-page book centred primarily on discovering one\u2019s potentials as agent of change.

Therefore, I commend the Board for providing the necessary policy directions required to drive management\u2019s daily activities,\u201d Danbatta said.\n\nDanbatta also appreciated the effective coordination of the 2021 BMR by the retreat consultants led by Prof. Pat Utomi, in ensuring effective facilitation of proceedings, deliberations and brainstorming sessions at the Retreat.\n\nWith the theme: \u2018Expect More, Deliver Result\u2019, this year\u2019s strategic annual retreat of the Commission\u2019s Board and Management, was attended in-person and virtually by Board members and Senior Management Staff of the Commission.\n\nThe retreat follows the unveiling of two key documents \u2013 the Strategic Management Plan (SMP), 2020-2024, and the Strategic Vision Plan (SVP), 2021-2025. The SVP is a streamlined version of the SMP, and the SMP took life out of the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (2020-2030), the National Broadband Plan (2020-2025) and the Federation Government\u2019s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan.\n\nThe SVP, which has five central vision, also has three supporting documents, namely: implementation strategies and timelines; monitoring and evaluation framework; and implementation responsibility matrix. The objective of the SVP is to enhance regulatory focus and efficiency in the delivery of NCC\u2019s mandate.\n\nWithin this context, the Commission has focused this year\u2019s retreat on taking account of remarkable successes recorded in the last one year and how the Commission hopes to innovate its way toward addressing industry challenges militating the consolidation of the growth of telecommunications sector.\n\nAt the end of the three-day Retreat, an eight-point communique was read out as a synthesis of all the deliberations for submission to NCC Board and Management to guide the regulatory activities of the Commission over the next one year. Implementation of the communique is expected to birth a new lease of expectations and dedication towards making 2022 a more rewarding year innovation and growth for the telecom industry.\n\nOver the years the NCC, as a world-class regulatory agency, has held annual Board and Management retreats, affording it the opportunity to rejig its culture, processes and strategic objectives for enhanced operational efficiency and regulatory excellence.",

          "text": "Farmers in the North \u2013 Central and Taraba have narrated different experiences from the effects of irregular rainfall patterns on harvest during the 2021 farming season, as the cropping season rolls to an end.\n\nIn a survey conducted by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in the zone, some of the farmers said the rains impacted their crops positively as they were already recording bumper harvests.\n\nOthers, however, submitted that the rains had ceased too early, which made them experience poor yields.\n\nExperts are of the view that the irregular rainfall patterns which subsequently affect harvest in these parts of the country can also be attributed to the global problem of climate change.\n\nIn Benue, it was a joyous note as farmers said that the rainfall recorded in the state in the 2021 planting season affected their crops positively and had led to a bumper harvest for most.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nOne of them is Mrs Mbaoron Tyoakaa, a yam farmer, who said that the rainfall impacted positively on her crops.\n\n\u201cI am yet to commence full harvesting of my crops but I am sure that I will have better yields at the end of the day.\n\n\u201cI have harvested only a small portion and the harvest is good,\u201d Tyoakaa said excitedly.\n\nAnother grower, Mr Terdue Ijir, a soybean farmer, said that he had a very good harvest from the 2021 cropping season.\n\n\u201cI have harvested all the soybean that I planted; though I am yet to thrash it I know that I will get more bags when compared to the 2020 harvest.\n\n\u201cI am grateful to God for the harvest because he provided us with enough rainfall,\u201d Ijir said.\n\nA farmer who grows both soybean and rice, Mr Titus Atondu, said that the bumper harvest experienced by farmers in the state had also affected the price of their yields.\n\nAtondu said that before the bumper harvest, a 28 \u2013 kilogramme bag of soybean was sold for N35,000 but now it is N28,000.\n\n\u201cAlso, a 28kg bag of rice was sold for 32,000 and some N30,000 but now it is sold for N25,000 and N24,000 respectively for the same size of the bag,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Director, Agricultural Services in the state, Mr Thomas Unongo also commented.\n\nUnongo said that farmers in the state were given seeds that could withstand drought and all types of infections, and that helped them to have a bumper harvests.\n\n\u201cThey were also given water-resistant crops and they planted, so, no matter the amount of rainfall, they will still have a bountiful harvest.\n\n\u201cMost farmers in the state will have bumper harvest because most of them applied the \u201dGood Agronomic Practices,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, farmers in Taraba have expressed delight over the bumper harvest recorded in the 2021 cropping season due to the steady rainfall enjoyed in the state throughout the season.\n\nThose of them who spoke with NAN in Jalingo noted that the rains had a very positive impact on their crops during the season.\n\nAmong them was Mr Simon Ijir, a rice farmer, who said that the rainfall which lasted up till November had resulted in bumper harvest for him and other farmers in the state.\n\n\u201cThis cropping season is exceptional because there has been steady rainfall that led to a bumper harvest for many crops,\u201d Ijir said.\n\nHe, however, lamented that the bumper harvest did not cause a drop in prices of foodstuff in the state due to the current inflationary trend in the country.\n\nEqually, Alhaji Aliyu Suleiman, a maize farmer, said that the adequate rainfall had put smiles on the faces of farmers as it resulted in greater yields of many crops.\n\nAccording to Suleiman, even the beans that he normally mixes with maize has done exceedingly well due to the steady rainfall witnessed during the cropping season.\n\nMrs Mary Aso, a beniseed farmer, said the steady rainfall had helped greatly in enhancing bumper harvest in 2021.\n\nDr David Kassa, the Taraba Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, said that farmers of various crops had reported bumper harvest in the state.\n\nAccording to Kassa, the rainfall starts on time and continues till November, saying the situation has made a high yield of crops possible in the state.\n\nHe urged farmers to reserve a portion of the crops for their consumption against the rising inflation in the country.\n\nIn Kogi, a farmer, Mr Wale Oloruntoba, said farmers in the state had also recorded bumper harvests.\n\nAccording to Oloruntoba, everything they planted such as Beniseed, beans, yam, soybeans and groundnuts, yielded very well, adding that guinea corn to has been growing well.\n\n\u201dWe thank God for the level of rainfall this year because as farmers, we have experienced bumper harvest of crops such as yam, soya beans, maize and beniseed,\u201d he said.\n\nMrs Esther Audu, the National President, Women in Agriculture Cooperative Federation Ltd. told NAN that rainfall had impacted positively on farm produce and food items in the 2021 cropping season.\n\nAudu said that under normal circumstances, the impact of the rains on the cost of food would have been great and favourable.\n\nHowever, she said that the reverse was the case because farmers could not cultivate many crops because of the fear of attacks by herdsmen and kidnappers.\n\n\u201dSo, there is not much difference in the cost of food,\u201d Audu said.\n\nShe said that rice, yam, maize, groundnuts were the crops the farmers were able to cultivate at nearby farmlands.\n\nIn a related development, in Plateau, an agriculture expert, Mr Emmanuel Kwapdimma, said the state experienced an unusual rainfall pattern during the 2021 cropping season, which he described as \u201ca mixed fortune\u201d for farmers in the area.\n\nKwapdimma who works with the Plateau Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources said that the rain started late, ceased midseason and stopped early.\n\nHe said that the unusual pattern negatively affected crops such as rice and maize, but favoured potatoes, soybeans, and cowpeas.\n\n\u201cFor potatoes, the water was enough, but it was not for maize because maize is usually planted late, same for rice,\u201d Kwapdimma said.\n\nHe said that the unusual situation had adversely affected harvest which in turn had a negative impact on food security.\n\nAccording to Kwapdimma, if there is a low yield per hectare, it will have ripple effects on food security generally.\n\n\u201cIf you were getting 30 bags and then it is reduced to 20 bags, there is a likelihood that it will affect food security.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the impacts of climate change on food security,\u201d he said.\n\nMr John Wuyep, Chairman All Farmers Association (AFAN), Plateau chapter, also told a tale of woe.\n\nWuyep said there was a shortfall in the rainfall pattern in the state, and it affected crops especially rain-fed rice, maize and others.\n\n\u201cThe rain stopped at some point and before it returned, most of the crops had withered.\n\n\u201cFor most of this year, farms did not retain any water and such is not good for rice and other crops that need water to thrive.\n\n\u201cHowever, crops such as cowpea, potatoes and others that don\u2019t need much water did well,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Amos Shinat, Chairman Plateau Potato Value Chain, told NAN that the rainfall pattern did not affect potatoes much.\n\nShinat said that except in places where the soil was gravel in nature and generated heat during the period that the rain ceased, there was nothing to complain about.\n\n\u201cWe have gone round the village markets, and you will observe that the farmers have a bumper harvest.\n\n\u201cIf the rainfall pattern had affected it, we wouldn\u2019t have seen much yield like that.\n\n\u201cIf at all the rain-affected us, may be out of 100 farmers, 10 or 15 were affected depending on the nature of the land.\n\n\u201cThose that have good yields were far more than those that did not have,\u201d she explained.\n\nThe situation is, however, different in Niger, as the state chapter of AFAN said the sudden seizure of rain during the season would bring about poor yields and subsequent increase in prices of foodstuff.\n\nThe Vice-Chairman of the association, Alhaji Abdulrahman Yusuf, who stated this, was emphatic that there would be no bumper harvest in the state in 2021 unless the government took proactive measures to assist farmers with dry season irrigation equipment.\n\n\u201cThere was a drought in between, so it will affect crop production negatively.\n\n\u201cThere has been a break in the rain pattern for over three weeks now,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nHe said that the cessation of rainfall would result in a low yield for rice because many of the swampy areas where farmers cultivated rice did not get enough water to make it swampy.\n\n\u201cThe inadequate rain has resulted in stunted growth for our rice. Therefore, we are going to have poor yields,\u201d Yusuf said.\n\nThe chairman said that other crops that would be affected negatively owing to inadequate rainfall were soybeans and sorghum which required adequate rainfall to mature.\n\nHe explained that cowpea such as beans would do well as it did not require heavy rain to mature.\n\nMeanwhile, some farmers in Nasarawa State have lamented the low crop yields being recorded in the state, which they blamed on the commencement of early rains that were not sustained.\n\nOne of them is Mr Abel Abogonye of Shabu community who complained that the early rains impacted negatively on his yam farm.\n\n\u201cWhen the rain started late February, so many of us started planting yams. Unfortunately, the rain ceased around March, but returned and lasted till the end of May, when most yams became stunted.\n\n\u201cThe yield is not as we had in 2020. At about this time last year, we were selling 10 tubers of yam for less than N3,000 because of the bumper harvest. Now, 10 tubers of yam, depending on the size, range between N5,000 and N7,000,\u201d Abogonye said.\n\nBlessing Wuni, beans and watermelon farmer, said the irregular rainfall affected her yields this harvest season.\n\n\u201cA 100-kilogramme bag of melon now sells for N108,000 as against N53,000 it was sold same time in 2020.\n\n\u201cBeans now sells for N1,200 per measure (Mudu) as against N350 same time last year,\u201d Wuni said.\n\nShe, however, said that farmers in the area were expecting a bumper harvest of crops such as guinea corn and millet. (NAN)",

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nThe pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, has described as hypocritical the statement made by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), that the Federal Government was expecting a request for \u2018reconciliation\u2019 or \u2018political solution\u2019 to the prosecution of the Yoruba nation activist, Sunday Adeyemo, fondly called Sunday Igboho, and Nnamdi Kanu of the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) for their agitations for self-determination.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Mr Jare Ajayi, who made this known in a chat with Sunday Sun at the weekend, stated that the government should rather \u201cwithout further delay, create an opportunity for meetings to be held, where the issues that engendered self-determination agitations would be discussed and resolved amicably.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\n\u201cTo us in Afenifere, and indeed, to many who believe in orderliness and rule of law, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, committed no offence. So, the question of he, or anyone on his behalf, making a case for a political solution does not arise. It was the government, through its agencies, that invaded his house on July 1, 2021, killed two people, vandalized his property and went away with some of his aides and property.\n\n\u201cThe same government has been making a lot of efforts to get him extradited from the Republic of Benin to Nigeria.

Costs running into billions of naira were even awarded against the Federal Government.\u201d\n\nThe Afenifere spokesman observed that the government is now talking about \u2018reconciliation\u2019 in order to save its dented face, adding that since the government has now realized that it had made grave mistakes in the cases of the two self-determination agitators, Igboho and Kanu, it should do the needful by discontinuing the legal processes it is pursuing against them.\n\n\u201cIt should also allow them to move freely and enjoy their fundamental human rights fully,\u201d Ajayi stated.\n\nHe noted that the government should also comply with the verdicts already given by the courts in respect of the agitators and compensate them for what they have suffered.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "title": "Leaders planned meeting with President: Outcome of talks with",
          "text": "Managing Director/Editor-in-Chief of The Sun Publishing Limited, Onuoha Ukeh, recently led a team, comprising Iheanacho Nwosu (Editor, Daily Sun), Tope Adeboboye (Editor, Saturday Sun), Chidi Nnadi (Editor, Sunday Sun) and Magnus Eze (Head, South East Bureau), to Ebonyi State.\n\nThe visit was rounded off with an exclusive no-holds-barred interview with Governor David Nweze Umahi, where he spoke passionately about why he turned Ebonyi to a construction site; his signature projects, the security situation in the Southeast and the increasing agitations for self-determination in Nigeria.\n\nUmahi also disclosed his next political plans, urging that the Southeast be given due consideration in the 2023 Presidency. Excerpts:\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nIt can be rightly said that Ebonyi under you has been a construction site, with the magnitude of projects you have executed. Since this is happening at a time of dwindling economy, may we ask how you are financing these projects?\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nI see what is happening in Ebonyi State as God\u2019s grace; God\u2019s mercy and the determination of a people to rise up from \u2018the dust of the nation\u2019 to The Salt of the Nation. First and foremost is that no man can make any of these modest achievements we\u2019ve recorded without the hand of God upon the person. We came to leadership by the fingers of God and we had five-fold covenant with God because it was not for us to be. We made a covenant with God, so what we see is a product of that covenant. Let me say that to head the people at any level of leadership is a product of two things: one is the fear of God and two is the determination to leave legacies behind. We thank God first; then the willingness of the people, the sacrifices of those working with me, my determination and the grace of God upon my life are what I could say are responsible for our modest achievements. Mind you, if we ever borrowed, it might just be the money we borrowed internally to enable us pay salaries before our IGR and federal allocation could come. So, I can vehemently tell you that we have not really borrowed to finance any project. When it comes to foreign loans, we had not obtained any until about last two months ago when we succeeded in concluding what my predecessor started in terms of foreign loans for the Abakaliki 199km Ring Road passing through the eight local government areas of Ebonyi North and Central. Out of that 199km, we have done about 58km on our own mostly on concrete. So, the total loans portfolio is about 150million US Dollars and from June next year, we will start paying back. One success about that is that we insisted that we must use concrete because from experience in this part of the country, as you are doing asphalt, before you finish, the failure on some sections of the road will be staring you in the face. We insisted and we dragged it for two years. Eventually, I signed undertaking that if they exceed the budget, I will put in state funds.\n\nOther borrowings were those that happened before I came in as governor; like the national borrowing that all the states did for HIV/AIDS, then, for the Abakaliki Storm Water Project-one of the most beautiful flood control measures you will ever see in this part of the country. It\u2019s about 90 per cent done and we have started repaying the loan since 2015. The other loan will be the one that is common with all the states, like from the Excess Crude Account; we borrowed for agriculture and of course, it\u2019s centrally deducted from our FAAC Account. So, it\u2019s important to state this very clearly that we have not borrowed as a state to put in any infrastructure.\n\nWhat is your driving force in engaging in infrastructure development?\n\nThe people first; don\u2019t forget that I was party chairman, I was deputy governor. So, within those years, I had under-studied the people\u2019s needs. For instance, the Ecumenical Centre which is even better than the one built by CAN in Abuja. It\u2019s part of my covenant with God; He told me to build a place of worship that any Ebonyian anywhere in the world that is troubled, that will face the direction of that edifice and call upon His name, that He will answer. Then the Abakaliki Mall; I feel that we should be able to have a befitting mall. I invited one of the big departmental malls; and what they gave us was very small, and I wondered why people should always think small about Ebonyi. So, one of the driving forces is to rewrite the history of Ebonyi State. We can\u2019t think small so as to build confidence in the people, and raise the integrity of the Ebonyi man; this will bring out his best to compete anywhere. The worst thing is for a man\u2019s confidence to be eroded and poverty can do that; a combination of conspiracy can do that. The departmental stores said that we should bring N6 billion; we will command 20 per cent, we will build the road, and the infrastructure, we put all that and in two years, we sell off our 20 per cent. I did the calculation and I knew that with N6 billion, we are done with the mall. The mall you saw did not take us up to N10 billion, including the road, infrastructure and everything. Now, we have a mall belonging to the state and we can give it to any facility manager \u2013 local or foreign to manage. The important thing is that we have that infrastructure which nobody will take away from Ebonyi State. We also have the Iyere flyover-bridge in Edda. Every year we lose up to 50 people within that axis. Fortunately, I was the one who started the project in 2004 under the then Governor Sam Egwu. Five companies had come and gone there; expatriates, they couldn\u2019t do anything. That was the time you could do a road without stone base. I did that project successfully until he left office. My predecessor, Elechi inherited the road and I was able to complete it. It was one of the roads still standing until God brought me in and I was able to make it a concrete road. The section from Amasiri to Nguzu is about 45km and we have about 1.5km to complete that project. Why did we go into the flyover bridge? I have been there, seen lives lost, no big truck can carry load and climb that hill. So, the flyover bridge is to reduce the slope from 35 per cent to about seven per cent. That\u2019s what we are doing. It\u2019s the normal slope for bridges and flyovers. What about the medical college? It was actually supposed to be a campus of Ebonyi State University for Medicine only. But when the Registrar of the Medical Council came, he said that this was more than being a campus of a university. He said I should allow the Ebonyi State University to continue to partner with the Federal Teaching Hospital Abakaliki which we handed over to the Federal Government and then let this become the University of Medical Sciences. That\u2019s what gave birth to that, but the idea is to cut down medical tourism. In that hospital, we have virtually everything \u2013 the cancer centre which the President graciously gave us; the building and the equipment, the isolation centre under SDGs from the Federal Government, then part of the structure of the kidney transplant centre and eye centre, are also gifts from the Federal Government. But beyond that, everything there from scratch is from Ebonyi State Government. And that took us less than two years. So, we have cancer centre, the best eye centre; artificial bed, surgery centres that you can stay outside the country and perform surgery. We have over six theatres to perform surgeries; we have the kidney transplant, the liver transplant, the best lab one can find anywhere in the world. We also have what is not obtainable anywhere in Africa; the dialyzer production. This is a major component that is used to care for kidney disease and transplant. We got a company in Switzerland; then sent the Nigerian Ambassador there to go and understudy them. We\u2019ve paid 100 per cent for the dialyzer plant, so we are going to have the plant in Ebonyi State. We have the patent; so, anywhere that the plant would be built again in Africa, Ebonyi State is going to be a beneficiary. Let me also add that we recently got the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) to establish the heart surgery centre in that university. The idea of that university is a place to produce the best medical students; the idea is that we have a department for traditional medicine, where traditional medicine will be developed. Another thing is that the university is a complete community in the sense that there is no student that is going to stay outside the campus; there\u2019s no senior lecturer that would live outside the campus. You have everything there; the cinema, different sports complexes for staff and students, there are swimming pools, it\u2019s a complete community that would depend substantially on solar. The water will be non-stop. Still on your question, the road is the most important infrastructure, you have to develop the road, not stomach infrastructure. You have to send the children to school and you have to develop the healthcare system, then have to empower the people. But unfortunately, we have to revisit the desire of our people to work. What makes China tick is that everybody is working. We will still build 5km road in each of the 13 local government areas; I don\u2019t think that there is any local government that we don\u2019t have 20km concrete road. We know the problem of our people and that\u2019s why we are addressing them. There is no local government headquarters in the state that we can\u2019t access within 45 minutes from the state capital. What about the airport that we are building? We have Enugu, Abia, Cross River, Benue and partially Akwa Ibom states as the catchment areas. We are an agricultural state, so, we think of how to sell our vegetables. We want to develop our commerce. We want to develop along that side aeronautical engineering where planes can come for checks. We are also building the first concrete runway for planes and we are happy doing that. It\u2019s over 14 inches thick; the terminal building is the largest you can find anywhere in Nigeria. Before the end of January 2021, we would have been able to build up to 2.2km of the runway, so, we will be looking at about 1.3km next year. By May next year, we should be able to hold the 7th anniversary celebrations of the administration there.\n\nYou were quoted as saying that direct labour was the best approach to achieving result in government. What do you mean, especially when people allege that direct labour scheme is a form of conduit to siphon money?\n\nIf the use of direct labour is a way of carting away money and it\u2019s going to the people, then, it is empowerment. That\u2019s the only thing I will say because even if you walk on water, your enemies will say that you are blowing dust. But the important thing is that any project that we conceive and execute, take it to anywhere in this country, you will never get that cost. Our cost is like 40 to 50 per cent and the quality is of utmost standard. When we started building the first flyover, there was petition to the EFCC that it was a way to siphon money; that one was by contract. The EFCC operatives came and stayed in the state for three months without our knowledge. One of the pillars we were casting was what frightened the people they sent. After three months, they took pictures and went back. Another thing that happened was a similar petition to the ICPC. They sent people to come and see what we were doing. Those who came were biased; they were bought over and they went and wrote stinker against us. The then Chairman said their report was inconsistent with what he was seeing in the social media. So, he came by himself using taxi from Enugu. When he got to Ebonyi State, he took Keke disguising himself. He told us this during the award they gave to us. So, after visiting the place, he went back and asked them how they got the report they had submitted. He then told them that they had to go back to Ebonyi with their own money to do the job well. The important thing is that if you say that direct labour is a conduit for siphoning money, siphoning it to where; has any of these projects been evaluated if there is no prudence? Direct labour jobs are given to the stakeholders and the ministries, so, how do you get the money back from them? It\u2019s the most dangerous thing to do. Whether it\u2019s direct labour or contract, you don\u2019t make more than 10 per cent profit from here. And I bet anybody who wants to try, let him come and take any of our flyovers. Our twin flyovers cost us less than N1.3 billion, each one up to 500m length, some are 300m length. Who can build that at that rate? The Senate committee came with their equipment and tested the flyovers; you can ask them their comments.\n\nEven when your critics agree that your projects are of high quality with some of them well ahead of the state, but there are many who also believe that some of these projects have no bearing to the needs of Ebonyi people, while others are worried about their sustainability. What\u2019s your take?\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what I want to do; to build projects that are ahead of time, projects of the future. One of my critics had even said that I build flyover where there is no water; but bridges are built where there is water and not flyover. What we are building is to secure the future of our people and it\u2019s beginning to yield results. If you check, before 2015, you wouldn\u2019t see holdup anywhere in Ebonyi State. But security-wise, the infrastructure and roads we are building, in the evening you will see a lot of holdup. So, without these flyovers, you imagine what could have happened. We have about six flyovers on the African Trans-Saharan highway running from Enugu going down to Ebonyi, to Ogoja to Cameroun. Imagine how busy that road would be without flyovers. Before we built these flyovers, in the presence of my wife, some children were crushed to death at some of these intersections as soon as we came on board. So, lives are being saved through these flyovers. These projects are actually well thought out for the future of this state. For instance, the medical college. Government runs nothing, we had advertised for those who can run it, but because of COVID-19 and insecurity in the country, we didn\u2019t get response from foreign investors. We actually want foreign investors who can run schools and hospitals to take it over. So, the last alternative is to talk to the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference because they have their own university and it\u2019s an organised community. They came and said that the way we described the place was much lower than what they saw. So, they are very much interested. We have agreed to run the university as a state for a year, then, they take over. During my tenure, they will take over the place and run. We\u2019re working on an MOU. The NUC has approved; admission is ongoing and we will do the first matriculation in December and a lot of people are applying. All the equipment that we have for specialised areas of medicine, we have agreed that there will be retainership for maintenance and running for three years. It\u2019s part of our payment agreement and we have paid for over 95 per cent of these equipment. We are also making some contingent plans to ensure that these things are out of the hands of government. We have advertised for the running of the mall; no government runs malls. We are currently processing the advertisement; over 50 persons and companies have applied. When I went to see Mr. President and sought for financial assistance to help me get some equipment for the airport; some of my friends started criticising me, saying why are you not sourcing funds for Southeast, why are you doing so for Ebonyi? My response to them is that I\u2019ve done a lot for the Southeast as Chairman of the Governors\u2019 Forum. Through my effort during a delegation to Mr President, he approved N10 billion for the rehabilitation of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport through the Ministry of Aviation; note that government spent N5 billion for the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. Concerning the Second Niger Bridge, when the former Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari was there, he was always in touch with me over the project. We made efforts to ensure that the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority is funding the project. When the initial railway corridor to Maiduguri was designed, Abakaliki and Awka were excluded. I went to see Mr. President for that. So, if you are building for the entire family, you have to also build for yourself. There is nothing wrong in asking for financial assistance for my state from the President. A lot of states have asked for assistance \u2013 Ekiti and Kebbi have asked. So, what\u2019s wrong with my asking for assistance from Mr. President? He is the father of all. We have agreed that when we finish, we will hand over the airport to the Federal Government to concession and run. Entering the airport, one side is for the aeronautical engineering while the other side is what they call medical economic processing zone. We\u2019ve already gotten the approval; what is left is for them to start work. We want to leave most of our projects in the hands of private investors.\n\nThe most critical issue in the Southeast today is insecurity. As Chairman of South East Governors\u2019 Forum, where are we on the issue?\n\nThe issue of insecurity in the region is a little bit complex. Our problems are self-inflicted. We started on a good note; note of marginalization, note of not having equal treatment and I say yes, but they needed to be defined. You can\u2019t make a blanket argument and you can\u2019t insult the governors; you can\u2019t insult the president, is it part of the agitation? I wasn\u2019t in tune with the method of the agitation. There was a time we came together as governors and leaders and said let\u2019s know the agitation; it didn\u2019t start today. Of course, Dim Odumegwu Ojukwu started it and at some point made a blanket statement, saying we shouldn\u2019t do another civil war. And then came Ralph Uwazuruike of MASSOB, but there were all peaceful dialogue during Uwazuruike, which of course, our brother Nnamdi Kanu was part of it before he broke away. Whatever happened that made these agitations turn to hate speeches against the leaders of other regions and also against us, I do not know. But I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s the right way to go. If you want to be on your own, you don\u2019t need hate speech to do that. If there was marginalisation, did it just start with this administration? The answer is no. We had had virtually all the opportunities in the previous administrations. Why was it that our people did not use those opportunities to redress these issues? Why didn\u2019t they do it during Obasanjo or Jonathan? Today, some of the people in vantage positions then are the ones writing open letters to Mr. President. In the Southeast, you see several abandoned federal projects, probe a little; you will discover that some of our sons and daughters frittered the funds meant for those projects. So, when it comes to the issue of marginalisation, Mr. President believes that we should sit on a table and discuss it. If our people are shortchanged in terms of promotion, just say it open, Mr. President this is not right. A lot of things are happening in my government which I don\u2019t know, but unless you bring it to my knowledge that\u2019s when you can hold it against me. That\u2019s where we are; we want our children to bring their points so that we reason together. Don\u2019t forget that the Federal Government had sent a delegation led by the Defence Minister to find out what was the problem; they urged us to bring our strong points so that we reason together. We can\u2019t resort to violence and say we want a nation of our own. The unfortunate thing is that the matter has gone beyond IPOB. The kidnappers, the armed robbers, the cultists; they now get themselves recruited without the endorsement of IPOB and we see the killings that are going on now, they are carried out by these armed robbers. There have always been armed robbers; armed robbers are found everywhere. They find it so easy to wear the toga of the IPOB and commit their evil. And we said to IPOB, you need to redeem your name whether proscribed or not so that we now know these criminals and deal with them accordingly. Don\u2019t forget about people talking; some are talking out of fear, some are talking out of profiteering, some people are talking out of political benefits. I don\u2019t talk about all these things because when God gives you leadership of any sort, He will demand a return for it. I know that the way we are going about it is not the right way. Whether our brother Nnamdi Kanu is before the court or not, I prefer that this violence should stop; I prefer that we identify the people doing the killings and face them squarely. IPOB said that they are not the ones; but they need to redeem their names while we seek political solution. We need political solution to the issue. Ohanaeze Ndigbo has set up a committee that has gone ahead to collate all the problems- marginalisation and other issues. They have given it to us and we\u2019ve shared it to the five Southeast governors; we are making inputs and by the time we do the collection, we would be able to know where we stand. We would hold another meeting and we will go before Mr. President and say \u2018Sir, these are the feelings of our youths\u2019. I feel this is the way to go. That is the basic truth; anyone who wants to deceive himself or herself can go ahead. I am not a politician; by the time 2023 comes and if it pleases God, I will go back to my business. But while I am on this seat, I owe our people the truth, I owe God the truth to see what we can do to bring peace in the Southeast. I am not looking for anything. I am not worried because this is a phase. I am doing everything possible to bring peace; to bring understanding, to let our people have a collective of voices into one and let the Federal Government say to us go to hell. Then, we come back home and say what do we do as a people? You don\u2019t shave a man\u2019s head in his absence. There has never been a time there was a referendum where all the Igbo came together and said they want Biafra. So, you may want Biafra; I don\u2019t want Biafra, but everybody should come together. Those who want Biafra, if the Federal Government says to us \u2018to hell\u2019, then they can have Biafra. Those who don\u2019t want Biafra like in Ebonyi State, we don\u2019t want Biafra, because when we were together, we were badly marginalised; our people were good for house boys and girls and nobody is thinking not to do that again. It could still repeat. We are afraid to be house boys and house girls again. For self-determination sake, allow us to come to the level of other states and then we can compete. Right now, we can\u2019t compete.\n\nWhy is it that the Southeast governors can\u2019t speak with one voice even on the issue of security for the region; just recently the Anambra Governor was said to have accused his colleagues from the zone of being responsible for the violence in his state? Also, we noticed that the new medical university is named after you, why?\n\nI don\u2019t think the Anambra governor had said that. I spoke with Prof Charles Soludo to ask him whether the governor actually said that and he said contrary to that, that the governor said that Ebonyi governor is a gentleman. This happened just few days back because I wanted to respond to that. But what I had said to that piece of material on social media is that this is a very critical time; all leaders must avoid hard drugs and alcohol because for anybody to say that, he must be a product of hard drug and alcohol. I wouldn\u2019t know how the governor of Imo State would send his people to go and be killing people in Anambra State or the Governor of Ebonyi State would send people to be killing people in Anambra. If there is anybody from Imo State that is causing violence in Anambra, so far he is in Anambra, that person is an indigene of Anambra State. Just like Anambra people that are here, if they are causing insecurity, I cannot say that Anambra people are causing violence for me; they are my subjects and I have to deal with them according to the law. Let me say that I never saw Governor Willie Obiano say that; I never heard him say that. Regarding the Ebubeagu; the last time we were in Enugu, it was agreed that all the states must inaugurate the security network before the end of the year. Abia State has signed Ebubeagu into law. In fact, this Ebubeagu are not new; we all had our vigilantes before now, but the Southeast leaders were looking for a common name and common joint action, so that what is happening in Imo will be happening in Abia and there will be collaboration. There will be a control centre in Enugu and, of course, we would have our tracking system. There was no time that we said Imo people would be recruited and posted to Ebonyi State. There\u2019s nothing like that. In Ebonyi State, Ebubeagu is fully functional, not partially functional. This month, we are going to launch it because we agreed to launch it individually and before January, we will do joint launching in Enugu. I don\u2019t want to discuss security on the pages of newspaper, but if you ask the security people, they will tell you the marvelous achievements that the Ebubeagu had recorded in the state. For me, we are speaking with one voice. It was the Neighbourhood Watch in Ebonyi that was turned to the Ebubeagu. It\u2019s the Forest Guards in Enugu that was turned to Ebubeagu; we had the Bakassi Boys in Abia State turned to Ebubeagu; we had the Kpochapu in Anambra State turned to Ebubeagu. These are not new, but they are working. But the problem is that everyone that the Ebubeagu arrest, they would shout that Ebubeagu are after IPOB. This person might not be a member of IPOB, but once he is into criminal activity and is arrested, they would shout that Umahi is after IPOB; Ebonyi is after IPOB. That\u2019s the impediment. If you say that our people are not speaking with one voice, I will say yes, but whether governors are speaking with one voice, I will say yes because we cannot afford not to speak with one voice. So, the Ebubeagu is working and you have to also know that Ebubeagu is a rebirth of our vigilante that has always been there. And some opposition people have been worried whether the Ebubeagu would be used during the elections, but we have been asking for state police. If you are pushing it in the National Assembly, the Ebubeagu is also something like state police that will have their own command and all that. Nonetheless, when you commit a crime here and you\u2019re a member of the Ebubeagu, we have the law; we have sent some of the Ebubeagu people to face the law when they misbehaved. Our law on Ebubeagu is very strong because if you don\u2019t do that, it\u2019s like you are training a lion. If there are no codes to train the lion, it can turn against the owner. That\u2019s why you do not do politics with security. On the naming of the University of Medical Sciences after me, it was wholly the idea of the State House of Assembly. One day, one governor called me and asked why I named the university after myself. I said to him: \u2018build your own and name it after yourself.\u2019 What is your problem, is to build it or to give it a name; what\u2019s in a name? The truth is the name of that university now is David Umahi Nweze University of Medical Sciences, but that\u2019s not my intension. My intension is that it can answer King David University, referring to the King David of the Bible. I sent a name to the House of Assembly, but in their own wisdom, they changed it to David Nweze Umahi University, and for me, it sounds odd. So, when we go to the House of Assembly to turn it to a private university, we are also going to insist that it bears King David and if the Catholics are running it, it will bear King David Catholic University of Medical Sciences.

          "text": "From Sola Ojo, Kaduna\n\nIt is no longer news that politicians and voices of reason from the Southeastern part of the country have been clamouring for power shift to their region after the expiration of the tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.\n\nTo the President of Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF), Yerima Shettima, the region was not ready to champion the affairs of the country based on his view as captured in this interview.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nHe also scored President Muhammadu Buhari low in three critical areas of the national economy just as he called on Security Chiefs to do more to address the state of insecurity in the country. Excerpt:\n\nWe have seen alliances across political parties in recent times ahead of the 2023 presidential election. Should all political parties agree to zone their presidential candidate to the Southeast, do you see a possibility of that region coming up with a consensus candidate that will be acceptable to its political heavyweights and the country as a whole?\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nThe Southeast has already shot itself in the foot. With this madness going on in the Southeast, who will entrust them with power? Let us be very practical. Not because I don\u2019t like them, ordinarily, they shouldn\u2019t have allowed this nonsense to get to the level it is today. In all honesty, it will be very difficult. Some of them were courageous and bold enough to come out to say they were not prepared for the presidency now. You know it. We are not joking with the country because this is a serious business.\n\nAre you unaware of the gentleman agreement across political parties to rotate power between the North and South?\n\nWell, I am not a part of that gentleman agreement which means it is not binding on us as a people. If it is not constitutional, it is not binding on us. To me, the issue of a rotational presidency has already been jettisoned since 2011. Ordinarily, Jonathan could not have contested after he completed the last two years of late Yar\u2019Adua. He would have allowed the North to come up with another consensus candidate that would have contested to fill the term for the North going by that gentleman agreement. In all faces of justice and equity, the 16 years of PDP, the North had only two years. Even if we add the eight years of Buhari to that 16 years, the North will still be having 10 while the South will be having 14. So, where is justice if we are talking about equity and fairness? We can see then that the gentleman agreement is not binding and even if we say let\u2019s overlook the legitimacy aspect of it on moral ground, how do we justify 14 to 10 years by the time Buhari completes his eight years tenure? On a normal circumstance and in the spirit of fairness and justice to the North, courtesy demands that we give this slot to the North. But under the democratic arrangement, it is hard to justify this idea of a rotational presidency. Let the best steps forward and let Nigerians decide on who they want so we can look more into competency when we allow it open, the best will be out.\n\n\u2026Irrespective of the region such a fellow comes from?\n\nNot necessarily the region per se. If I have my view because of the platform that I represent, Nigerians also can decide and we will certainly do that, if that is what they want and we will go for it. But as it is today, it is wrong on moral ground for anybody to think of zoning presidency to any region outside the North.\n\nSo, what are those qualities Nigerians should look forward to as they decide their next president after the expiration of the tenure of President Buhari in 2023?\n\nCompetency in the areas of patriotism. Age will also play a major role. We are looking at 60, 50 down to 40. Left to me, I will look at someone between 40 and 50 years of age and worse case, 60.\n\nDo you or your organisation, AYCF, has anyone in mind?\n\nNo. We are still looking inward. We are still consulting. We have been talking with a lot of them, but I wouldn\u2019t want to mention their names until the time is ripe for that. So far so good, we have vibrant ones who are doing wonderfully well even at the level of governors, we can see what they are doing.\n\nLet quickly talk about the issue of security as it affects the country and Kaduna State which is the political hub of the North\u2026\n\n(Cuts in) Yes, the issue of security affects Kaduna just as it affects other parts of the country where things were not done right. Over the years, we talk more, but act less. We have spent so much on the issue of security without equivalent results. It is either the people managing our security affairs are not doing well or some people somewhere are trying to sabotage the efforts of the government even when they are within the circle because today issue of security has become a business by some people at the expense of other people\u2019s lives. They will seat and raise money to improve our security architecture, but someone will just squash the money and get away with it without anybody questioning him which is not good for this administration.\n\nLet\u2019s talk a bit about the tenure of Buhari which is about six and half years now. To you, how has the country faired under his administration?\n\nFactually, we expect more than what we have seen so far from him. Let me narrow this down to three points \u2013 fight against corruption, security and good governance. In all fairness, he has done lower than expectations in these three areas. In terms of security, we can all see where we were in 2015 and where we are today in 2021. In 2015, we were faced with issues of terrorism and a few kidnappings. But today, banditry and kidnapping in the Northwest have marred the entire country.\n\nThe current leadership of the Nigerian armed forces are doing better than what was obtained in the past. But then, we are taking time to access them because they came to the office not quite long. Let\u2019s give them the grace of the next six months and see whether this madness will be put under control. And if they fail, we will tell Mr President that they failed.\n\nHave you or anyone close to you been kidnapped? Have you ever paid ransom to redeem anyone close to you? What is your position on the payment of ransom to bandits?\n\nI have heard many people kidnapped and the issue of payment of ransom should be discouraged. But sometimes, it is difficult to do. Even when states are saying they are in charge, we don\u2019t see that in practical terms. For instance, someone has his family taken hostage and he can afford to pay ransom for his or her release, certainly, he will prefer to pay because of the perceived trauma his loved ones may go through while in custody. It is a terrible development and since life is worth living, anybody who is in a position to sort his way out would do so rather than wait for promises by security forces that never see the light of the day.\n\nWhat specific message do you have for your constituents, I mean young people ahead of the 2023 elections?\n\nWe should be very focused, determined and take our destiny into our hands to ensure one of our own becomes the president. By that, I mean someone between the age bracket of 40 and 50. We are looking at some governors which we will identify when we get there, but I will not mention any name for now.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "By Omoniyi Salaudeen (Lagos), Fred Itua and Ndubuisi Orji, (Abuja)\n\nAll is now set for the final approval of the ongoing amendment of the Electoral Act Bill 2021 which has just been passed into law by both chambers of the National Assembly.\n\nThe passage followed the consideration of the report of the Conference Committee of the Senate and House of Representatives. This week, the Bill is expected to be presented to President Muhammadu Buhari for assent.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nOut of the 21 clauses considered for the amendment, the ones that are of public interest are the electronic transmission of election results and direct primaries for aspirants to all elective positions in all the political parties.\n\nWhile the amendment aims to regulate the conduct of elections in federal, state and area councils in the Federal Capital Territory, it also empowers the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to determine the procedure for voting and reliance on electronic transmission of results during an election.\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nCuriously, as the bill continues to drew applause from members of the public, some governors on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) are making spirited efforts to scuttle the lawmakers\u2019 resolution on direct primaries as legal mode for political parties to pick their candidates for general and National Assembly elections.\n\nIn a bid to terminate the process, the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee had to summon the National Assembly caucus of the party to a meeting over the proposed amendments to the Electoral Act. But the lawmakers turned down the overtures as the Senate went ahead to pass the harmonised version of the Bill.\n\nYet, suspicion is rife that they might go further to prevail on the president not to assent to the bill. Part of the reasons for the governors\u2019 preference for indirect primaries is the desire to keep a stronghold on the structures of the party in their respective states.\n\nTherefore, the deletion of indirect primaries from the new amendment will leave them and others seeking elective positions at the mercy of the electorate. This, many believe, may open a new political war ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nA highly placed source told Sunday Sun that the issue of direct primaries is a direct fight between the governors and the National Assembly members.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cthe lawmakers see the introduction of direct primary as an opportunity to whittle down the influence of the governors in the nomination of party candidates. That is why you see that the governors are fighting against it.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the chairman, House Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Benjamin Kalu, said that with the adoption of the harmonised version of the bill by the Senate and House of Representatives, the Parliament has passed the ball to the Executive.\n\nKalu told newsmen that \u201cthe matter, in the eyes of the parliament has been decided which means that the parliament has done all that the law requires it to do with regard to law making.\n\n\u201cWe have asked the bureaucrats to pass the ball fully to the Executive. I am sure that within seven days or thereabout, the legislation will be migrating to the President who is interested in ensuring that democracy in our country is strengthened. This, he has shown in recent elections in the country where he wanted the people to speak and let the voice of the people be the voice of democracy.\n\n\u201cWe felt that we should let you know that we are done with the Electoral Act Amendment Bill. Today marks the day that we can say to Nigerians that we have removed our hands from the amendment of the Electoral Act because many never believed that we will speed it up the way we have done and that we will get it done with as quickly as possible in view of the 2023 elections that is close by.\u201d\n\nSunday Sun gathered that ahead of the transmission of the bill to the president, both the governors, especially those elected on the platform of the ruling APC, and the leadership of the National Assembly, have shifted their lobby to the Presidency.\n\nIncidentally, the issue of making direct primary compulsory for nomination of candidates by all political parties, was introduced by the House of Representatives during consideration of the report of the House Committee on Electoral Matters, on the Electoral Act Amendment Bill.\n\nThe principal act had given political parties the latitude to determine their mode of primaries. Section 87 of the bill entitled: \u201cNomination of Candidates by Parties\u201d had originally stipulated that \u201cpolitical party seeking to nominate candidates for elections under this Bill shall hold direct or indirect primaries for aspirants to all elective positions, which may be monitored by the Commission.\n\n\u201cThe procedure for the nomination of candidates by political parties for the various elective positions shall be by direct or indirect primaries.\u201d\n\nConsequently, while the APC uses both the direct and indirect primaries to nominate its candidates, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and other opposition political parties nominate their candidates through indirect primary.\n\nHowever, the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila had proposed the removal of \u201cor indirect\u201d in subclause (1). The amendment, which was subjected to vote was approved by the House.\n\n\u201cI will seek an amendment to Section 87. Section 87 provides for either indirect or direct primary. In the true ethos of democracy, I would like to amend Section 87 to delete indirect and make direct primary mandatory,\u201d the speaker had stated. The proposal was okayed by the House. The Senate was to later concur with the House on the alteration.\n\nThe governors, it was gathered are pushing for the bill to be returned to the Parliament, so that the clause making direct primary compulsory can be altered to make it optional. On the flipside, the Parliament is pushing for the Electoral Act Amendment Bill to be signed immediately by the President.\n\nLike the governors, the PDP which is the major opposition party is also opposed to the inclusion of direct primary in the proposed Electoral Act.\n\nThe PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in the party\u2019s reaction to the passage of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, said making direct primaries compulsory was unacceptable.\n\nOlogbondiyan noted: \u201cOur party holds that it is the inalienable right of each political party, within the context of our constitutional democracy, to decide its form of internal democratic practices including the processes of nominating its candidates for elections at any level.\n\n\u201cThe PDP also believes that no political party should force its own processes on any other political party as the direct primaries amendment, a practice of the All Progressives Congress (APC), sought to achieve.\u201d\n\nThe opposition spokesman said that the PDP would make its position on the issue known, within 48 hours.\n\nThough the 48 hours has elapsed, the party was yet to make its position public, as the time of filing this report.\n\nNevertheless, a member of the PDP National Executive Committee (NEC), Okey Muo Aroh told our correspondent that direct primaries would curb corruption and entrench internal democracy in political parties.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe delegate system is corruption-prone and it creates a lot of bad blood in the party. Direct primary is a welcome development. It will enhance the growth of democracy. It will energise the base of the party and make the people at the grassroots to participate actively in selecting the candidate of the party.\u201d\n\nHowever, amidst controversy on whether or not direct primaries should be compulsory for the nomination of candidates for elective positions, stakeholders say there is need for all the gladiators to thread cautiously, so as not to jeopardise the entire bill.\n\nA member of the National Assembly, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told Sunday Sun that the issue of direct primary in the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, is like the the inclusion of third term in the report of the National Political Reform Conference set up by the President Olusegun Obasanjo administration.\n\nThe Senate had thrown out the entire report because of the contentious clause, seeking to approve third term for the president and governors, as well as their deputies.\n\nThus a chieftain of the APC in the Southeast, Chief Chekwas Okorie, while commending the boldness of the National Assembly for the Electoral Act amendment in a telephone interview with Sunday Sun, described those opposed to the amendment as anti-democratic forces.\n\nHis words: \u201cAny person that is not supporting the option of direct primary to elect candidates for political parties is not a true democrat. Once we agree that democracy is all about the people and for the people, then, we must allow the people to choose who they want in a transparent, free and fair direct primary.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, the real problem we have had in the type of people who have occupied leadership position in this country is leadership recruitment in the sense that people are imposed on the people and they have little or no choice.\n\n\u201cThese governors who are kicking now are the ones who will recruit their cronies and thugs and make them councilors, chairmen of councils, and members of the state house of assembly. They also determine who goes to the National Assembly. But with this direct primary, they don\u2019t have that chance any more not even with the brazen manner they have been doing it.\n\n\u201cWe have seen what happened in Anambra State, which was a case of abuse of direct primary and it reflected in the way the election went. It would have been different, if direct primary had been transparent.\n\n\u201cNigerians should celebrate the boldness of the National Assembly to insist on direct primary. It is an inclusive method of recruiting leaders. One must also give kudos to President Buhari for what he is doing to promote both internal and external democratic practice in and outside of political parties. His non-interference is unprecedented. Whatever anybody may have against him, this is one thing anybody cannot take away from him because nobody has measured up to this level of non-interference since 1999.\u201d\n\nA former lawmaker in Ogun State, Senator Gbenga Obadara, also shared the same view, blaming the governors for disallowing the people to participate in leadership selection process.\n\n\u201cIndirect primary has been so much abused by the governors. These days, you will see the governors sitting in their offices writing the names of ward councilors to local government Exco. They don\u2019t allow people to participate in democratic norms. They decide your fate without involving the people in the parties.\n\n\u201cDirect primary is democracy at work. Let the people choose the candidates they want to represent them. The governors are kicking against it because it has taken that power away from them and given it back to the party,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the same breadth, another leader of thought in the North, Senator Rufai Hanga, bemoaned the lack of internal democracy within political parties, arguing that \u201cindirect primary is no election.\n\n\u201cI think direct primary is better for us for now. Governors are kicking because they are always manipulating. They select delegates and make sure whosoever they want gets the parties\u2019 tickets. In effect, that is no election. It is an imposition. But when it is direct primary, the governors cannot be in control of the whole people of the state. It is now left to the parties to make sure that those appearing for election get whatever is given to them.\n\n\u201cIndirect primary is manipulative and fraudulent. It is an imposition by the governors. Some people are already thinking that the governor will go and mount pressure on the president not to sign it. If he does that, that will be a calamity for our democracy. The president must sign it. If he doesn\u2019t, it will be calamitous. We are waiting to see what happens.\u201d\n\nIn his own declaration of support for direct primaries as amended by the National Assembly, Dr Gbolade Osinowo, a former aide of ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo, maintained that it would guarantee inclusive governance.\n\n\u201cI support direct primaries because it is more democratic and more inclusive than indirect primaries. Indirect primaries mean you have to choose your representatives who will represent the interest of the electorate. But direct primary means every card- carrying member of political parties will have an input in the decision-making process. Indirect primary is more prone to corruption and manipulation. And the governors have a lot of influence on representatives than the universal franchise. They want to preserve that advantage to themselves,\u201d he stated.\n\nHowever, a renowned union activist, Chief Frank Kokori, expressing a different view, argued that direct primaries would be more expensive in actual practice than the indirect primaries.\n\nHe puts his argument thus: \u201cI wonder why they took that decision. May be they want to experiment on it and see how it goes. To me, indirect primary is a better option. Direct primary is cumbersome. In case of presidential election, aspirants have to send their delegates round the whole wards in the country. And you know how many wards we have in the country. Even if the primary is at the state level, aspirants would still need to send their delegates to all the wards in the state. It will cost a lot of money. In some cases, the voting point may be up to 30 kilometres. The aspirants have to transport his supporters to the place and possibly give them N1,000 each for feeding allowance. So, direct primary is for the moneybags because, if you don\u2019t have money to transport these people, they won\u2019t come to vote for you. So, it is still prone to manipulation by those who have money. Of course, we all know that governors are the ones that will always decide the choice of delegates for indirect primaries. But then, delegates are always there for anyone to buy.\u201d\n\nBut Okorie, in a swift response, disagreed, insisting that \u201cindirect primary is far more expensive.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is in indirect primaries that presidential aspirants quarantine, if I may use the word, delegates in hotels. Some delegates were known to have been paid $5,000 each to woo their votes. Where would you spend that kind of money at the local level? So, if anything is expensive, it is indirect. For direct primary, you don\u2019t need a single agent because the party leadership will be there to ensure that the election is done properly. If you don\u2019t have supporters among party members, then you are not fit to run. If you have supporters and they are supporting you genuinely, why will you pay them? Popularity and credibility of aspirants will now begin to be factored into selection process.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .\n\nAlso reacting to the fear that the governors could prevail on the president not to sign the bill, Okorie said: \u201cThis bill is a popular one. The governors are running their states; they are not running the Federal Republic of Nigeria. President Buhari has proved that he has his own mind and cannot be easily manipulated. He is also watching the trend and the way people are responding to it. He will do what the people want him to do.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022In raging fire-fight, three jets bombard terrorists\n\n\u2022Borno gov lauds military for resilience\n\n\u2022Nigeria, Niger, Benin plan multinational border force\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nIn a first of its kind since the more than a decade-old insurgency war started, the Nigerian Army yesterday lost a Brigadier-General commanding a Special Forces team, in an ambush by terrorists of the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) in Borno State.\n\nHowever, the military countered the attack by ISWAP with heavy bombardment of the insurgents, following the deployment of three fighter jets to contain the terrorists.\n\nIn a swift reaction, President Muhammadu Buhari and Borno State governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum have mourned the slain officer Commanding the 28 Task Force Brigade in Chibok, Borno State, Brigadier General Dzarma Zirkusu and three other soldiers killed by the ISWAP fighters.\n\nBuhari expressed deep sadness over the death of the Brigadier General and three soldiers who paid the supreme sacrifice in a very rare display of gallantry as they tried to help their compatriots in the war against terrorists.\n\nThe president, in a statement issued by his spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, stressed that \u201cNigeria has lost brave soldiers and I salute their courage.\n\n\u201cMay their souls Rest In Peace. General Zirkusu leaves us sad and devastated. The soldier in him will remain immortal,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nHe urged the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Faruk Yahaya, to accept his heartfelt condolences and that of the nation, and convey same to the members of the families of those martyred.\n\n\u201cI pray to the Almighty to give you and the bereaved families the strength and courage to bear this irreparable loss,\u201d the President added.\n\nIn his reaction, Borno State Governor, Zulum has also commended the Nigerian military for putting up strong resilience in a battle with the ISWAP fighters, who launched the attacks on a military base in Askira/Uba LGA of southern Borno State.\n\nZulum, in a statement by his spokesman, Malam Isa Gusau, paid tribute to troops at the base as well as troops from neighbouring commands, who mobilised to reinforce before they were ambushed.\n\nThe governor, while commiserating with the military over the loss of some military officers and personnel, thanked the fallen heroes for what he called \u201ctheir supreme sacrifices to the Nigerian Nation\u201d, declaring that \u201cthe people of Borno will remain forever grateful to them and all fallen heroes, and will fully support gallant troops currently operating in front lines\u201d.\n\nHe noted that amid the loss of some officers and personnel, the military was able to mount heavy resistance and recorded gains which the state is proud of.\n\nHe commiserated with affected residents for the trauma caused by the attack and shared the pains of anyone who may have turned victim directly and otherwise.\n\n\u201cWe must always affirm our fates in our armed forces, while the armed forces must remain up and doing. We must always recognise what we already know, that insurgents are always plotting with the elements of surprise. Our troops must redouble efforts to be ahead of insurgents. I salute our troops for the resistance put up today.\n\nI salute troops who mobilised to provide reinforcement. I salute the sacrifices of some officers and men we lost today and share the grieves of the immediate families and the Nigerian military. We thank these fallen heroes for their supreme sacrifices to the Nigerian nation. The people of Borno will remain forever grateful to them and all fallen heroes, and will remain fully supported by gallant troops currently operating in front lines,\u201d Zulum said as quoted in the statement.\n\nThe Nigerian Army confirmed the death of the Commander of the 28 Task Force Brigade in Chibok, Borno State, Brigadier General Zirkusu, and three other soldiers in the attack by ISWAP in the Askira Uba Local Government Area of Borno State.\n\nReacting to the incident, the Borno State Governor, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum has commended the Nigerian military for putting up strong resilience in the battle with the terrorists, who launched attacks on a military base in Askira/Uba LGA in the southern part of the state.\n\nThis is coming as Nigeria, Niger, and the Republic of Benin have concluded plans to establish a border force in a renewed bid to contain criminalities in their borders.\n\nThe late Brigadier General Zirkusu was in January 2021, redeployed from the Headquarters 1 Brigade, Gusau to Headquarters 28 Task Force Brigade, Chibok, and appointed Commander.\n\nBefore he was killed yesterday, the highest-ranking army officers killed by terrorists in the northeast were colonels.\n\nWhile the Commander of the 25 Task Force Brigade of the Nigerian Army, Damboa, Colonel Dahiru Bako, was killed by Boko Haram terrorists in September 2020, the Commanding Officer of the Chief of Army Staff Mobile Intervention Battalion in Borno, Col. Hussaini Samaila Sankara died in July 2021 following the injuries he sustained when his vehicle ran into a landmine/IED of Boko Haram.\n\nThe IED blast incident, which occurred on May 30 between Marte and Dikwa, also killed some soldiers who were in the same vehicle as to the late Sankara.\n\nThough the Nigerian Army yesterday confirmed the death of three other soldiers, sources from the frontlines put the number of soldiers reportedly killed during the operation which occurred at Bulguma at four.\n\nBulguma is a few kilometres from Askira town in Askira Uba LGA.\n\nAccording to the sources, the troops of 28 Task Force Brigade, Chibok, were ambushed on their way to reinforce Askira, which was under attack by the ISWAP fighters, who had stormed the town in a large convoy of gun trucks.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday by the Director, Army Public Relations, Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu, the Army stated that the troops of Joint Task Force, North East Operation Hadin Kai were engaged in a fierce gun battle with the terrorists which also led to the death of the Brigadier-General and three other soldiers.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cA gallant senior officer, Brigadier-General Dzarma Zirkusu, and three soldiers paid the supreme sacrifice in a very rare display of gallantry as they reinforced a counteroffensive against the terrorists, and successfully defended the location\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that the families of the senior officer and soldiers had been contacted.\n\n\u201cThe Chief of Army Staff Lt. Gen. Farouk Yahaya deeply commiserates with the families and relations of the fallen heroes. He has also directed that the troops continue in the ferocious counteroffensive and hot pursuit to eliminate the remnant of the fleeing terrorists.\u201d\n\nNwachukwu, in the statement, also noted that the military had deployed five A \u2013 Jet, two A-29, and two Dragon combat with which they destroyed nine gun trucks and one armoured personnel carrier of the terrorists.\n\nHe added that the battle was still on at the time he filed the statement.\n\nMeanwhile, the military has also disclosed that airstrikes conducted by the air component of Operation Hadin Kai decimated scores of insurgents, who gathered for a meeting in the Marte area of Lake Chad.\n\nAfter receiving credible intelligence that ISWAP terrorists were converging at a location in Marte for a meeting in Lake Chad yesterday, NAF aircraft under Operation Hadin Kai were immediately deployed to survey and dislodge the gathering.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that while observing the area, it was noticed that another boat came with more fighters surrounding a likely high-profile personality as seen from the way he was being followed around with a flag.\n\nAfter confirming that the meeting was ongoing, the pilots got the go-ahead to strike.\n\nOther sources also confirmed that top ISWAP Commanders that were at the scene at the time of the strikes included Muhammed Bako, Special Militant Forces Commander (Rijal Ann), Muhammad Malumma, a Chief Judge of Marte; Goni Mustapha, the Chief Imam.\n\nOthers included Muhammed Ba\u2019ana, recently appointed Commander of Kirta; Muhammed Ali, Amir of Kwalaram; Ibn Umar, Chief Prosecutor; Bakura Gana, Commander of Jubularam; and Malam Musa, Amir of Jubularam amongst others were either injured or killed in the strike.\n\nIt was not certain if the new Wali, Shuwaram was among those killed or injured in the attack.\n\nIn another development, the National Security Adviser (NSA), Maj. Gen. Babagana Monguno (rtd), has disclosed that Nigeria, the Republic of Benin, and the Republic of Niger have also launched tripartite Joint Border Patrol Teams (JBPTs) in a bid to strengthen border security in the three neighbouring countries.\n\nMonguno has also stated that terrorist groups, Boko Haram and the ISWAP remained transnational threats to Nigeria.\n\nArms smuggling and unrestrained movement of armed groups through unmanned borders have fuelled insurgency and armed banditry which ravaged Nigeria and Niger while Benin suffered maritime crimes.\n\nMonguno stated these in a paper themed: \u2018Combating Persistent and Emerging Threats to Regional Peace and Security in Africa: Pivotal Role of Nigeria\u2019 at the Internal Partnership Forum in Paris.\n\nHe said Africa\u2019s porous borders remained a major source of concern as this aided smuggling of prohibited items and irregular migration as well as other transnational organised crimes.\n\n\u201cNigeria is bordered to the North by Niger, to the East by Chad and Cameroon to the South by the Gulf of Guinea of the Atlantic Ocean, and to the West by Benin.\n\n\u201cHowever, Nigeria\u2019s extensive land and maritime borders are incredibly porous and poorly manned. This has placed added responsibility on the border security agencies. In this regard, the Nigeria Customs Service has developed the E-Customs strategy while the Nigeria Immigrations Service has equally put in place an Integrated Border Management System (IBMS)\u201d, he said.\n\nMonguno said the move was aimed at strengthening border security.\n\n\u201cIt is necessary to observe that both strategies place a premium on employing technology to complement other existing physical border security arrangements. \u201cFurthermore, as part of efforts at strengthening border security, tripartite Joint Border Patrol Teams (JBPTs) comprising Nigeria, Niger, and Benin Republics were recently established to curb the increasing scale of smuggling of prohibited items as well as irregular migration across the nations\u2019 borders.\n\n\u201cThis has greatly reduced the scale of transnational organised crimes. We are also exploring the feasibility of setting up a border security force in the foreseeable future to secure Nigeria\u2019s border areas\u201d, he said.\n\nMonguno stated that terrorist groups, Boko Haram and the ISWAP remained transnational threats to Nigeria.\n\nHe said the African continent was not immune to such global security concerns.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "INEC: Monitoring Direct Primaries Has Financial, Security Implications",
          "text": "\u2022Says 17,618 workers required for only APC, PDP primaries\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has explained that the monitoring of the direct primaries of the 18 registered political parties in the country has financial and security implications, stating that it will require about 17,618 officials to supervise only the primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in one day.\n\nThe commission further explained that monitoring the direct primaries of the 18 political parties registered so far would involve much staff.\n\nIn the amended Electoral Bill awaiting assent by President Muhammadu Buhari, the National Assembly has restricted political parties to the use of direct primaries to elect candidates for elections.\n\nHowever, the state governors, who are opposed to direct primaries, had expressed fear over the logistical problems it would create for the commission.\n\nSpeaking to THISDAY last night, INEC\u2019s National Commissioner in charge of Voter Education and Information, Mr. Festus Okoye, acknowledged that the monitoring of the direct primaries of the 18 registered political parties has security and financial implications.\n\n\u201cIf a political party decides to organise its primaries at the Registration Area (Ward) level, the commission must deploy monitors to the 8,809 Registration Areas in the country. If the party decides to organise its presidential, governorship, National Assembly, and state assembly primaries at different times and on different days, it means that the commission must deploy four times to monitor the primaries of the party.\n\n\u201cIf a political party decides to organise its primaries at the local government level, it means that the commission must deploy monitors to the 774 local government areas of the country,\u201d Okoye explained.\n\nDespite the huge logistics challenges, Okoye said the commission would surely work out the modalities for the monitoring of the primaries as soon as the law is assented to.\n\n\u201cThe monitoring of direct primaries has financial and national security implications. The ad-hoc staff must be harvested from MDAs or the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) or the universities or other sources as may be determined by the commission and supervised by a certain category of our staff\u201d.\n\nAccording to Okoye, the ad-hoc staff must be trained and transported, adding that some of them must be housed.\n\n\u201cSome of the primaries may go late into the night and we must make arrangements for their security and protection. But the fundamental issue is that the commission has the experience in monitoring direct primaries and the only difference here is that in the present context few parties adopted the direct primary method of selecting or electing their candidates,\u201d he said.\n\nOkoye further disclosed that the entire staff strength of the commission is slightly over 16,000, adding the commission must rely on a certain category of ad-hoc staff to cover the Registration Areas if a political party decides to use the 8,809 Registration Areas for its primaries.\n\nOkoye further noted that INEC will aggregate the figures and design a continuity framework and matrix for monitoring of direct primaries.\n\nOkoye explained that the commission as a constitutional and legal body is bound to give effect to and implement laws legally and legitimately passed by the National Assembly.\n\nHe said INEC does not have a choice in this regard.\n\n\u201cThe moment the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria assents to the Bill, it becomes law and the commission must implement the law passed by the National Assembly which has received Presidential assent. Presently, it is in the realm of speculation on whether the president will sign or withhold assent. The bill is inchoate till assented to by the president,\u201d he added.\n\nHe explained that Section 87(2) of the existing and operative law provides that the procedure for the nomination of candidates by a political party for the various elective positions shall be by direct or indirect primaries.\n\nHe added that the moment a political party gives to the commission the requisite 21 days\u2019 notice, the commission must mobilise and monitor the primaries of the party whether it is by direct or indirect primaries.\n\n\u201cHowever, if the president assents to the bill, it means that all the existing political parties must roll out guidelines on how to conduct their primaries bearing in mind that the fundamental and overriding consideration is ensuring that all aspirants are given equal opportunity of being voted for by members of the party. Each political party must design its methodology depending on its strength and capacity.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Section 4 of the Constitution domiciles the legislative powers of the Federation in the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cIt is within their remit to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Federation. Moreover, section 228 of the Constitution provides that the National Assembly may by law provide guidelines and rules to ensure internal democracy within political parties, including making laws for the conduct of party primaries, party congresses, and party conventions,\u201d Okoye said.\n\nAccording to him, INEC\u2019s responsibility is to participate in public hearings and make suggestions and recommendations.\n\n\u201cAs I have pointed out, our responsibility is to obey and give effect to laws passed by the National Assembly and assented to by the President. Section 228 of the Constitution gives the National Assembly the power to make laws relating to internal democracy in political parties,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Records 17,000 transactions\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nBarely 18 days after its launch, 488,000 consumer wallets have been on-boarded to Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) platform known as the eNaira from over 160 countries through Google Playstore and Apple Store as of Friday.\n\nData obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) at the weekend, also showed that about 78,000 merchant wallets have also been on-boarded to the digital currency infrastructure.\n\nAlso, transactions on the eNaira stood at about 17,000 valued at over N62 million.\n\nThis is an indication of growing enthusiasm for the central bank\u2019s digital currency, which has been described as a game-changer.\n\nThe digital platform had recorded about 200,000 wallets downloads in less than one day that the portal came alive.\n\n\u201cSo far, we have on-boarded over 488,000 consumer wallets and about 78,000 merchant wallets, with these downloads occurring in over 160 countries (per Google Playstore and Apple Store data).\n\n\u201cWe have also recorded almost 17,000 transactions amounting to over N62million with the average transaction being about $9.3 each. These numbers suggest the adoption rate has been excellent.\n\n\u201cIt is a direct liability of the bank, a legal tender and will form part of the currency-in-circulation and will be at par with the physical naira,\u201d CBN said.\n\nThe eNaira was officially unveiled on October 25, 2021, by President Muhammadu Buhari who said the electronic money would boost the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by $29 billion in the next 10 years.\n\nNigeria is the first country in Africa and one of the first in the world to introduce digital currency.\n\nBuhari had said: \u201cIndeed, some estimates indicate that the adoption of CBDC and its underlying technology, called blockchain, can increase Nigeria\u2019s GDP by $29 billion over the next 10 years.\n\n\u201cCBDCs can also help increase remittances, foster cross border trade, improve financial inclusion, make monetary policy more effective, and enable the government to send direct payments to citizens eligible for specific welfare programmes.\u201d\n\nThe president further assured Nigerians of the safety and scalability of the CBDC, adding that the journey to create a digital currency for Nigeria began in 2017.\n\nOn his part, CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, had said with growing interest in CBDC around the world, the CBN had commenced extensive study, consultations, identification of use cases, and the testing of the CBDC concept in a Sandbox environment as far back as 2017.\n\nHe said the objective of the research was to establish a compelling case for the adoption of a digital currency in the country to enable a more prosperous and inclusive economy for all Nigerians.\n\nHe added that following the completion of the preliminary work, the researchers and experts at the CBN were able to establish that a digital currency will drive a more cashless, inclusive, and digital economy as well as complement the gains of previous policy measures and our fast-growing payments platforms.\n\nHe said CBN decided to implement its own CBDC and to name the digital currency, the eNaira, and believes the innovation will make a significant positive difference to Nigeria and Nigerians.\n\nSpecifically, Emefiele said the eNaira will support a resilient payment system ecosystem, encouraging rapid financial inclusion, reducing the cost of processing cash, enabling direct and transparent welfare intervention to citizens, and increasing revenue and tax collection.\n\nHe had also said eNaira would also facilitate diaspora remittances, reduce the cost of financial transactions, and improve the efficiency of payments.\n\nHe added: \u201cTherefore, the eNaira is Nigeria\u2019s CBDC and it is the digital equivalent of the physical Naira. As the tagline simply encapsulates, the eNaira is the same Naira with far more possibilities. The eNaira \u2013 like the physical Naira \u2013 is a legal tender in Nigeria and a liability of the CBN. The eNaira and Naira will have the same value and will always be exchanged at 1 naira to 1 eNaira.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said in a bid to further de-risk the process, the CBN had given careful consideration to the entire payments and financial architecture and has designed the eNaira to complement and strengthen these ecosystems, adding that the bank had also implemented security safeguards and policies to maintain the integrity of the financial system.\n\nThe CBN boss added that there would be strict adherence to the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards to preserve the integrity and stability of Nigeria\u2019s payment system.\n\nAccording to him, 33 banks had been fully integrated and are live on the platform while N500 million had been successfully minted by the central bank including N200 million which had been issued to financial institutions.\n\nEmefiele said the country had made history with the eNaira launch, pointing out that this would be the first in Africa and one of the earliest around the world.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Osinbajo: Strategic Leadership Helped Nigeria Tackle COVID-19",
          "text": "Deji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo has explained that following a Presidential Order in 2020, Nigeria was able to effectively tackle the COVID-19 pandemic by deploying a responsive and effective public health framework, at a time when more developed and wealthier countries were struggling to deal with the fallouts of the global pandemic.\n\nOsinbajo who stated this at the public presentation of the book, \u2018Winning Leadership\u2019 authored by Major-General Pat Akem-Vingir (retired) noted that the step was a good example of strategic leadership in a crisis.\n\nAccording to Osinbajo, with the daunting challenges of the 21st century, such kind of leadership, which can effectively mobilise national and organisational resources to achieve results, is more important now than ever.\n\nHe said Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 response had been celebrated locally and internationally as a result of such strategic leadership.\n\nOsinbajo mentioned the establishment of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, an inter-ministerial interagency team led by the Secretary of the Government of the Federation (SGF) as a reference.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs General Pat Akem argues that Winning Leadership that knowledgeable and agile leadership at the strategic level can mobilise resources \u2013 human, financial and material \u2013 of nations and organisations \u2013 in an effective and result-oriented manner. Such leadership can attain goals and visions and also be able to protect and promote interests. In other words, effective strategic leadership purposefully provides direction and inspires.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest surprises for many was how some of the wealthiest and most developed economies of the world were tragically unprepared to handle a apublic health crisis on the scale and uncertainty of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWhereas countries with more modest economic profiles, quickly deployed a public health framework that was responsive and effective.\n\n\u201cThe task force swiftly issued and enforced COVID-19 protocols for travel and general movement. We restricted travel into Nigeria before most OECD countries did. Once the first case was discovered, the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases, in Ede gave Africa the first genomic sequence for Coronavirus SARS 2. When the first doses of vaccines came, the task force developed the protocols and the public health system already used to mass vaccination campaigns, deployed across the country in every nook and cranny of Nigeria so that the first eligible vaccine candidates received their vaccinations seamlessly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a nation, the threats to our corporate existence today are unprecedented and hitherto unimagined. It is against this background that the author\u2019s prescriptions have to be taken seriously. As he pointed out, exceptional leaders do not just emerge, they are the products of deliberate efforts in policymaking, training, and grooming.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging that there are no silver bullets that leaders can deploy to solve 21st Century economic, social, and security challenges, Osinbajo stated that only knowledgeable, well-developed, trained, and motivated leaders will win.\n\n\u201cThe strategies and techniques of yesterday will not work today, in the corporate workplace, in our public institutions, and even in our homes. Thanks in no small part to the leaps made in technological advancement. The advent of social media has completely changed the nature of human interactions, and with that has added layers of ambiguity and complexity in state-corporate relations. In terms of human capital, what drives today\u2019s workforce is very different even from just two decades ago,\u201d he added.\n\nOsinbajo described the book as an essential contribution to the existing body of knowledge on the subject of strategic leadership.\n\nHe also noted that its public presentation was timely and coming at the most auspicious moment in our nation\u2019s history.\n\nHis words: \u201cMajor General Pat Akem-Vingir has outdone himself with this important new book, and he has articulated military strategies and fresh thinking on the concept of strategic leadership. There are many books and ideas on leadership but one of the reasons why I think this book Winning Leadership is unique in that it draws from the best scholars in the world on the subject\u2014leaders of advanced militaries and C-suite leaders of international organisations and institutions.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Fellow Americans,\n\nNobody knows the joy of winning better than I do, believe me. I have always been a winner for as long as I can remember. Okay? Nobody knows the beauty of fighting to win better than I do. I am always a fighter and when I fight, I win. Everybody knows that.\n\nI have reached the very top. Absolutely. And I reached the top at a very tremendous speed. You all know it. The first time I ran for office, I ran for president. It was beautiful. Right? What usually takes great men three attempts before they get a win, I won in a landslide the very first time I ran. I heard that it has never been done anywhere else in the world.\n\nIn the last four years, I have accomplished for America things that presidents that were in office for twelve years did not accomplish. It is not even close. I made America a big-league winner again. I put billions and billions of dollars into your pockets through my amazing tax cuts. I have shown you that everything is possible if you have the right man to do the right job. Everybody is saying so.\n\nAll over the world, there is huge respect for America again, in some cases, even massive fear. Bigly! Which is good. I made it happen. Nobody messes with America because I highly insisted on it. I placed America first, which is fair. I stopped those out of control dope and overrated countries that get away with murder at the expense of America. It didn\u2019t happen again. Not on my watch! I was tough so that America would be triumphant.\n\nThe world had never seen anything like that before.\n\nBecause of me, the next generation of Americans will grow up knowing that America is the greatest nation on earth, full of courageous men like me. Thanks to me, they will grow up knowing that ours is a Christian nation where it is allowed to say Merry Christmas. Our children and grandchildren will grow up knowing that the whole world is out there for them to dominate and not bow to the sissies who think that we must worship the environment at the expense of the staggering economy that I built.\n\nFrankly, I have done everything that I set out to do \u2013 most of which were things that have never been done before. I have in place the greatest military that humans ever assembled for our incredible men and women in uniform. I assembled it in just four years by rebuilding our powerful military that they destroyed due to neglect and incompetence. I secured America from coast to coast with walls and wires, cages and visa bans. I took care of it, just as I promised I would do. I returned America under God. Before I came, they had taken America to the shrines of the devil.\n\nAmericans love me because of these outstanding accomplishments. I have seen it on the faces of fabulous Americans while I travelled around the country in the last few weeks.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I could stay around and fight. And it is a fight that I know that I will win. But I have decided not to. There is no point.\n\nI believe that I have nothing else left to prove. My achievements will be around till the end of time. I won\u2019t be surprised if, by January 20, 2021, my face would go up on Mount Rushmore to join other presidents of my calibre. It won\u2019t surprise me one bit. People think it is going to happen.\n\nTo all my special supporters, I say thank you for the unbelievable fantastic ride. Don\u2019t despair, for I will send you a brilliant comforter. Those stupid little lightweights on the other side who have no clue may taunt you. When those clowns do, remind the goofy and crooked losers that I made America great again. Tell those terrible lowlifes that they have proved themselves unworthy of Donald Trump\u2019s genius and have opted to reduce America to a Second Class nation in the world. Total Disaster!\n\nSo, my fellow American, I bide you all farewell. May God bless you, and my God bless the United States of America.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump\n\nThe 45th President of the United States.",

          "title": "The Teflon President With Nine Lives Is On His Way Out By Dr. Wumi Akintide",
          "text": "You probably know who I am talking about. The Teflon President with nine lives I have in mind is nobody else but Donald J. Trump. Can any of you reading this write-up imagine Barack Obama, who twice won the popular vote and the Electoral College tallies and who spent 8 good years in the White House without a single scandal, being described as a cat with 9 lives?\n\nNot by a long shot. The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics.\n\nYou would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming to be the smartest President America has ever put in office.\n\nWhat is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that. America under Trump is no longer the America we used to know and the Republican Party has become a den of thieves and sexual predators that have lost their moral compass as a major political party in God\u2019s own country.\n\nIn cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.\n\nEven though the White House was built with slave labor, as widely documented by historians, no black man was ever expected to live in that majestic building that the arrogant Donald Trump, in one of his craziest moments, has described as a \u201cdump.\u201d\n\nThe guy is just too arrogant to admit that the Obama couple was far superior to him and his Melania in intellect and education. Barack earned his education from Columbia and Harvard while Michelle earned her own from Princeton and Harvard.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any better than that for any American President dead or alive but the \u201cC\u201d average student from an undergraduate business program would tell you he is the smartest dude in the universe who never makes a mistake or regrets anything. He sounds to me like a reincarnated Adolf Hitler who told the Anglo-Saxons they were the most superior white race in the world who must dominate the world. Donald Trump is pretty much preaching the same doctrine today. His latest unilateral announcement to make Jerusalem the undivided capital of the Zionist Regime without consultation with any of America\u2019s traditional allies is tantamount to suicide and a move that will go down in infamy, to quote the immortal words of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nDonald Trump once boasted that he was far more experienced than all of the American generals combined. He is therefore seeking to invalidate or demolish anything the first black President had ever done during his 8 glorious years in the White House.\n\nThe one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin. He turned around the American economy while reducing unemployment in America to the lowest it had ever been in 20 years. He killed Osama Bin Laden and he passed into law the Affordable Health Care Reform Law that offered medical insurance coverage to 46 million Americans with the stroke of his pen.\n\nThe Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but his Republican base and some charlatans in the party are buying the cheap blackmail from a delusional outlaw in the White House.\n\nEven though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent.\n\nMy point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again.\n\nIi is Donald Trump that I call the Houdini of American Politics for how and why he has survived up to this moment despite all of the atrocities he has committed as a candidate and now as President for close to one year.\n\nIf Barack Obama had uttered half the statements credited to Donald Trump, he would never have secured the nomination of the Democratic Party in 2008 and would have been ostracized for life.\n\nI seek your indulgence to go back to memory lane to remind some of the fans of this column about the America we used to know before crazy Donald Trump showed up. Eagleton was dropped from nomination as running mate due to a history of mental health illness. Spiro Agnew, Vice President to Richard Nixon, was defrocked for tax evasion and fraud. Joseph Biden was forced to drop out of his Presidential bid at a point in his career because he was found guilty of plagiarism in one of his stump speeches - he lifted a quotation from Neil Kinnock, a Labour Party leader in Britain without acknowledging his source.\n\nGerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in large part because he pardoned Richard Nixon, an unconvicted felon, for obstruction of justice and for displaying ignorance when he stated in one of his debates with Jimmy Carter that the now-defunct Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe.\n\nGeorge Bush lost to Bill Clinton for going back on his \u201cread my lips\u201d pledge not to increase taxes. The voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.\n\nI gave all of these examples to show how Donald Trump would appear to have completely changed all the rules of the game for anyone who will be President in America. Republicans nominated a man who has had more than 4000 litigations against him in the Court of Law, most of those litigations he had to settle out of Court because he was too embarrassed to let them go forward.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who falsely tried to delegitimize the man he was going to replace by claiming Obama was not born in America. Republicans nominated a man whose Trump Plaza Building in New York was already known to be the money laundering capital of the world.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who claimed he loved to sexually assault women by \u201cgrabbing their pussies\u201d because they allowed him to commit the crime because he was a star who could get away with murder. He actually gloated that his supporters would still vote for him even if he had shot and killed a man on 5th Avenue in broad daylight in Manhattan. Republicans nominated and elected a pathological liar who is never ashamed to blackmail his opponents by calling them names and insulting them and getting away with everything.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man whose financial and business record with American banks and financial houses across the board were so bad that no American Bank was willing to do business with him because he had swindled them time and again. Republicans nominated and elected a man who had been divorced three times and who has filed for Bankruptcy more than five times and a man who has bluntly refused to submit his tax returns for public scrutiny because he has managed to avoid paying taxes for more than 20 years.\n\nRepublicans nominated and elected a con artist who is not afraid to lie his way out of every problem and a man who has openly tried to undermine NATO and many of the time-honored agreements all of his predecessors in the White House had committed to for more than 70 years.\n\nThey elected a hoodlum who openly colluded or conspired with the KGB while openly casting aspersion on the credibility of the American CIA and FBI. Republicans elected a man who wants to repeat Harry Truman\u2019s mistake by becoming the second American President to deploy or detonate the nuclear bomb, this time on North Korea.\n\nRepublicans have elected a man who openly emulates and praises dictators like Vladimir Putin. He made it clear he would want to be like them if he had his way. Republicans elected a man who tweets in the early hours of the morning and who has used tweeting as an instrument of policies and presidential orders. They elected a man who on Wednesday made good on his promise destroy the last vestiges of the Camp David Accord by unilaterally moving the capital of Israel to divide Jerusalem, thereby stroking the embers of fire and fury in the Middle East. Republicans have elected a man who has made his inexperienced son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the de facto Secretary of State to the United States through the backdoor.\n\nThe list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less. Republicans elected a man who has claimed that his own opinion or decision is all that counts and who has proclaimed most institutions of the fourth estate of the realm as \u201cfake news\u201d disseminators.\n\nHe has pointed accusing fingers at networks like CNN and print media like the highly respected New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, to mention a few.\n\nWhat atrocity, in less than one year in office, has this President not already committed? The list is inexhaustible. The greatest loser in this entire saga has to be the Republican Party and the clear winner has to be Vladimir Putin who now has the American President in his pocket and dictating to him what he must do or not do. Whoever thought that the whole world is going to turn 180 degrees for America and that Donald Trump is on his way to becoming the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Politics right under our eyes, and Americans appear totally helpless and clueless to do something about it.\n\nIt is a complete outrage and totally incredible!\n\nI rest my case.\n\nDr. Wumi Akintide",

          "title": "INSIGHT: With over 90% of Nigerians at risk, will malaria vaccine be the game changer?",
          "text": "Months after a report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) listed Nigeria as contributing 27 percent of the global malaria cases, Osagie Ehanire, minister of health, said the country needs N352 billion to implement its strategic malaria plan for 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the WHO world malaria report 2020, six countries made up more than half of the cases worldwide, and Nigeria accounted for the highest number of fatalities with 23 percent of deaths. Children under five are the most vulnerable group, while according to statistics, over 90% of Nigerians are at risk.\n\nIt was, therefore, welcome news when the WHO, on October 6, endorsed the widespread use of the RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) malaria vaccine.\n\nThere\u2019s more on the malaria vaccine here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018MALARIA KILLS MORE CHILDREN THAN COVID\u2019\n\nWith concerns on poverty, lack of access to quality healthcare, the thriving anti-malaria drug market, among other issues, there are questions on how much difference the malaria vaccine will make for Nigeria\u2019s population of over 200 million people.\n\nThe National Malaria Elimination Programme (NMEP) is responsible for formulating and facilitating policy guidelines, coordinating activities of stakeholders on malaria control, and providing technical support to states and LGAs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe also have other preventive measures for pregnant women, called intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy, and interventions such as distribution of nets. You know that we\u2019ve been doing net campaigns across different states, even during the pandemic. We ensured that all these interventions didn\u2019t stop during the pandemic because malaria kills more children than even COVID,\u201d Perpetua Uhomoibhi, national coordinator of NMEP, said.\n\n\u201cThe government and partners have continued to roll out interventions for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malaria in health facilities and at community level.\u201d\n\nGbenga Mokuolu, associate professor of paediatrics at the University of Ilorin with over 15 years experience in the care of newborn in the tropics and malaria case management, said although the journey ahead is still far, the country has made significant progress.\n\n\u201cThe fight against malaria is not something that can be achieved with a magic wand. It is a continuous, sustained and intense engagement for us to get the results that we want,\u201d he told TheCable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou need a multipronged approach to deal with habitats that would have ordinarily favoured the multiplication of the mosquito, and you also need human behavioral practices that will limit the possibility of it or the effective treatment of malaria when someone comes down with it.\n\n\u201cNigeria has been taking the relevant steps, and we have been making some progress. As of 2010, when you go to the communities to test how many children between five and 10 years old have the parasite in their blood, you\u2019ll find about 40 percent. But by 2018, the number came down to 23 percent.\n\n\u201cSo, this year, activities are on to conduct such a survey again, and people are gradually being mobilised to different states to collect samples. At the end of that activity, we\u2019ll know the further progress that has been made.\u201d\n\nWILL THE VACCINE MAKE A DIFFERENCE?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPoverty and environmental factors which may be natural or human-induced \u2014 such as refuse dumps, potholes, abandoned ditches and overgrown bushes \u2014 contribute significantly to the spread of malaria.\n\nThe WHO says the vaccine offers some hope for Africa, which shoulders the heaviest burden of the disease. With Nigeria carrying a considerably large amount of this burden, the vaccine is expected to help \u2014 when used alongside other preventive measures.\n\nAccording to Mokuolu, the development of the vaccine is great news.\n\n\u201cIt is a welcome development. It is not yet at the level of a perfect solution, but it is beneficial in reducing the burden of malaria,\u201d he said, adding that while the vaccine is only \u201ccomplementary\u201d, it should be used alongside other measures like mosquito nets since the vaccine does not provide a high percentage of immunity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn whether the introduction of the vaccine will reduce self-medication, Mokuolu said \u201cit\u2019s possible that when some children receive the vaccine, the urge for them and their parents to self-medicate will be slightly lower because they feel the child is protected\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut this is a hypothetical case. When it comes to behaviour issues, you can\u2019t forecast them. We just have to monitor the experience and reaction of people when the vaccine becomes available,\u201d he added.\n\n\u2018WE WANT TO REDUCE MALARIA DEATHS TO ZERO\u2019\n\nSpeaking with TheCable, Godwin Ntadom, chief epidemiologist of the federation and former head of case management and drug policy for NMEP, said the vaccine will give children under five partial immunity, which older children and adults develop overtime.\n\n\u201cDue to constant exposure to mosquito bites and getting malaria infection, overtime, we develop partial immunity to malaria. When a child is born, it does not have that partial immunity and that is why many children below the age of five die. What the vaccine is going to do, is assist children that are less than five years to develop partial immunity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOf course, we\u2019ll still be getting exposed to mosquito bites and having malaria, but before they develop their own partial immunity, this vaccine will assist them with some immunity so that they will not die as a result of malaria.\n\n\u201cThe vaccine is actually coming in to support other interventions to stop them from dying before the age of five. It is an additional layer of protection. Nigeria recorded about 100,000 deaths from malaria in 2019, so with this intervention, if we\u2019re able to reduce that number, it\u2019s an achievement.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re saying in essence is that, well continue to deploy as many interventions as possible. Our goal is to reduce malaria deaths to zero. At that point, we would have gotten malaria elimination.\u201d\n\n\u2018IT\u2019S NOT TIME FOR NIGERIA TO RELAX\u2019\n\nReports from trials of the vaccine advise that other preventive measures be used as well to get maximum protection against malaria. According to the NMEP coordinator, there is a need for sensitisation to ensure that people don\u2019t let their guard down.\n\n\u201cThe vaccine is not 100 percent so people should not think that because their children take the vaccine, then they will relax. It has to be combined with other interventions,\u201d Uhomoibhi said.\n\n\u201cThe vaccine will help, but it doesn\u2019t mean it is a stand-alone solution. We\u2019ll like the media to inform the public that even if they are excited about the vaccine, it is only for children, and it\u2019s not a hundred percent protective.\u201d\n\nWHAT EFFECT WILL IT HAVE ON THE DRUG MARKET?\n\nThe federal government recently secured a credit facility for $364 million to fund medical interventions against malaria in 13 states. There is also a readily-available drug market in Nigeria, with several options on treating malaria in children and adults.\n\nSpeaking on if the vaccine will affect the drug market, Odili Nonso, CEO of DrugIT, said the pharmaceutical industry in Nigeria makes a lot of money from anti-malarial medicine and antimalarials tend to have a larger market compared to other anti-parasitic medications.\n\n\u201cFor every five anti-parasitic medications, you would have about three anti-malarials. The market is very large. For every new pharmaceutical trying to penetrate the market, they tend to start with anti-malarials because it\u2019s more like an easy-get,\u201d he said.\n\nHe, however, said the introduction of the malaria vaccine would not have a significant effect on the revenue of the pharmaceutical industry, given the small demographic targeted.\n\n\u201cIn the long run, it will help tremendously but right now, the only one that has been approved is the Mosquirix and it has only been approved for children below the age of two. That seems to be a very small demographic when combating malaria,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNaturally, children below the age of two are very much protected. They tend to be protected with insecticide-treated nets and they\u2019re properly clothed compared to children younger than that age and adults. If the WHO decides to make a modification to their recommendation and advise that the vaccine be given to older children, then yes, it will have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry with respect to anti-malarials.\n\n\u201cThe vaccine doesn\u2019t have a long term effect; it tends to reduce over time. As much as it\u2019s a light in the dark right now, I think so much work still has to go into place to get something better than that. Within the next five to 10 years, I doubt the effect will be significant on the revenue for anti-malarials.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is acceptance. People would rather go get the anti-malarials which they\u2019ve been using and are a lot more comfortable with than exposing their children to the vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe pharmaceutical industry welcomes the vaccine and will do everything in its power to facilitate its acceptance to ensure that the fight against malaria is won.\u201d",

          "text": "Digital media in Africa is growing fast: traditional media organisations are finding their way to the internet while digital-only media organisations are taking firm root. More Africans are online, they are spending more time on the internet and relying more on digital media more than ever. According to the Social Flagship Report April 2021, created by Global Web Index (GWI), four African countries cracked the top 10 rankings for social media usage based on time spent, as Nigeria ranked first at (3:46), followed by Kenya (3:33), South Africa (3:32) and Ghana.\n\nOn the latest edition of TechCabal Live\u2014a video interview series in partnership with the UK-Nigeria Tech Hub\u2014held on October 25, we sought to understand Africa\u2019s digital media landscape, its challenges and future, and so we spoke with the editors of two of Africa\u2019s top digital newsrooms\u2014Quartz Africa Editor, Ciku Kimeria; and Stears Business\u2019, Editor-in-Chief, Fadekemi Abiru.\n\nHow can digital media in Africa create a profitable business model?\n\nWhile it is normal to get excited about the different innovative news products in the continent\u2019s digital media landscape, Abiru explains that more media houses need to produce more information that helps people understand what is going on around them.\n\nIn Africa, online news is mostly free. Only a few digital news organisations have been able to monetise their digital content. But Abiru wants this to change. \u201cLet people understand that information is something worth paying for. There is a challenge of helping people understand that where there is value, revenue can also be generated.\u201d Abiru believes that value creation is enough reason for digital media in Africa to monetise their online content. She further explains that the concept of \u201ccontent worth paying for\u201d is why Netflix and Spotify operate subscription-based business models.\n\nAbiru believes that for African newsrooms to use the subscription model successfully, they must produce deep, original and insightful pieces that cannot be found elsewhere.\n\nAfrican newsrooms have a talent problem\n\nAbiru complained about a talent shortage and the challenge of retaining talent. Ciku also believes that Africa faces a talent problem but is hopeful that training would go a long way to solve it. She added, though, that it is easier to train good writers on technical skills but very hard to teach good writing.\n\nQuality of work coming from African newsrooms must improve\n\nSpeaking on the quality of journalistic work coming out of African newsrooms, Ciku believes that there is a huge gap between African and, say, American journalism. But she believes the fault isn\u2019t entirely the journalist\u2019s. She says there has been a drop in the quality of journalism schools in Kenya, her home country.\n\nAnother reason for this drop in the quality of journalism is the university system in Africa, where there are scandals of people paying for their degrees.\n\n\u201cNow, when you read what a journalist has written, there are so many typos and errors,\u201d she lamented.\n\nYet another problem Ciku highlighted was funding. She believes African journalists can do amazing work, but their budget is way smaller than that of global publications.\n\n\u201cIf a great investigative journalist wants to go into a project in a place that\u2019s not safe, and his organisation gives him little or no money to do so, you can understand how they will not come up with the same quality of work as a global media house.\u201d\n\nThe major cause of the funding problem, Ciku said, is the environment and not individual journalists.\n\nYou can watch the rest of the conversation below:\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Launched in 2019 by Cregital, a Lagos-based creative design agency, Disha Pages gave users the tools with which to build their own one-page websites from the comfort of their smartphones, without worrying about technicalities such as coding or sorting out a domain name.\n\nCredit: Disha (Medium)\n\nThe product was an instant hit and got considerable adoption among creators and gig workers. Unfortunately, by a little over a year after its launch\u2014at the peak of the pandemic\u2014the company announced that they were shutting down the product.\n\n\u201cHow can we help?\u201d\n\nAs soon as the announcement of the shutdown went up, the Disha team were inundated with calls and messages from baffled well wishers, all of them concerned and wondering what they could do to keep the platform alive. These early conversations were tepid, nothing was concrete\u2014until Flutterwave came into the picture offering a total buyout. The move by the payments giant, which earlier this year became a unicorn, is surprising as both companies operate in different spaces\u2014Flutterwave in payments and Disha in the creator industry. One wonders, then, what the play is here.\n\nIn a call with Flutterwave\u2019s head of product marketing, Onyedikachim Nwankwo, explained that while both companies may run different businesses, their company goals are aligned. \u201cFlutterwave is about creating endless possibilities for everyone, and Disha\u2019s goal of enabling creators achieve success and get paid for their work ties into Flutterwave\u2019s larger mission of helping small businesses thrive.\u201d\n\nNew look for Disha?\n\nIn a statement announcing the acquisition, Flutterwave says that the buyout will grow Disha\u2019s base by providing users with the ability to make, receive and withdraw money from their Disha accounts in over 150 currencies and 34 countries across the world. Despite the acquisition, however, Disha will remain an independent company. According to Nwankwo, \u201cIts original vision will be maintained.\u201d\n\nRufus Oyemade, Software and Architectural Lead at Flutterwave, states that Disha coming under the Flutterwave family means its vision will be explored farther than earlier imagined. \u201cBefore now, when users created a Disha page and linked to a Flutterwave payment link, they got taken off the Disha site. Now, with the acquisition, users can create and accept their payments, all in one place.\u201d\n\nFlutterwave has always played in the creator space, having supported arts events like ArtX Lagos. Now, as the digital world opens up to creators getting paid for their work through innovations such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the payments giant is well positioned to help creators on Disha access global markets and further grow the global creator economy, which is estimated to be worth $100 billion.\n\nFlutterwave became a unicorn in March after reaching a $1 billion valuation, and the company may be set to triple that value in the future to the tune of $3 billion by acquiring more funding.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Exclusive: Meta\u2019s VP MEA and Turkey on Facebook\u2019s transition into the metaverse",
          "text": "At the end of October, social media giant, Facebook, changed its company to Meta. The announcement was made in an hour-long video that explained the company\u2019s decision to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse.\n\nLeading that work in Africa is Derya Matras, Vice President (VP), Middle East, Africa (MEA) and Turkey, Meta.\n\nPrior to her appointment as VP in August, Matras was the Managing Director for the MEA and Turkey region. Before that, she was Country Director for Facebook in Turkey for four years. Derya holds a BSc in electronics engineering from Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey, and an MBA from Columbia Business School.\n\nOver email, Matras talked to TechCabal about Facebook\u2019s rebrand to Meta and how it plans to make money from the metaverse and deal with the challenges that come with building it.\n\nHow is the Metaverse better than Facebook in its current form?\n\nWhen Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world\u2014and we are not turning away from these existing products. Those experiences are going to form a crucial part of the future metaverse ecosystem. The Facebook app is still going to be called Facebook.\n\nThe name Meta is a clear link to our vision for the metaverse. However, the metaverse will exist, whether Meta is there or not. So, Meta means us moving beyond 2D screens towards immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality, to help build the next evolution in social technology. This is a natural evolution for our company as social media and technology evolves.\n\nWhat demographic is the metaverse targeting in Africa?\n\nGiven all that the metaverse has to offer, there\u2019s a lot at stake in making sure its possibilities are open to everyone and not just people from traditionally underrepresented groups. An inclusive metaverse benefits everyone.\n\nIs Facebook building the metaverse because it\u2019s best positioned to build something that\u2019s inevitable?\n\nIn recent decades, technology has given people the power to connect and express themselves more naturally. We started with websites, then we got phones with cameras, and then the internet became more visual and mobile. As connections got faster, video became a richer way to share experiences. If you look back over time, we\u2019ve gone from desktop to web to mobile; from text to photos to video. Now we are looking at what comes next. The metaverse will feel like a hybrid of today\u2019s online social experiences, sometimes expanded into three dimensions or projected into the physical world. It\u2019s the next evolution in a long line of social technologies, and it\u2019s ushering in a new chapter for our company.\n\nIn Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s letter, he mentioned that the \u201cmetaverse will not be created by one company\u201d. Does this mean there\u2019ll be other metaverses outside of Facebook\u2019s metaverse and that they can all exist side by side without Facebook trying to be the only metaverse out there?\n\nThe metaverse isn\u2019t a single product that one company can build. Its success depends on building robust interoperability across services, so different companies\u2019 experiences can work together. And it won\u2019t be built overnight. Many of these products will only be fully realised in the next 10-15 years. While that\u2019s frustrating for those of us eager to dive right in, it gives us time to ask difficult questions about how they should be built. We\u2019ll work with experts in government, industry and academia to think through issues and opportunities in the metaverse.\n\nWe also need to involve human and civil rights communities from the start to ensure these technologies are built in a way that\u2019s inclusive and empowering.\n\nAcross Africa, we\u2019re supporting Africa No Filter, Electric South and Imisi 3D to support creators who have been pushing the boundaries of digital storytelling using immersive technology to amplify African voices.\n\nIs there the potential for other applications and programmes to be built in the metaverse\u2014similar to the blockchain.\n\nWe are at the very start of this. A lot of the technology and infrastructure still needs to be built. It will take at least 5 to 10 years for this vision of the metaverse to come to life. This pace is going to be dictated less by business interests and more by technological realities. Infrastructure needs to be transformed with new technologies, hardware and cooling specifications to be able to support a robust service. And new hardware still needs to be built, including things like hologram displays, projectors, batteries, radios, custom silicon chips, cameras, speakers, and sensors to map the world around you and more.\n\nWhy should Facebook build this? Why not another company?\n\nThis was an important step for us to take on our journey, and as we evolve to Meta, we hope this will better reflect where we are going as a company. Like all businesses, we continue to innovate so that we can bring value to people\u2019s lives.\n\nWe are a social company with investments in technology, like VR; and the metaverse is the next frontier of virtual digital connection\u2014so it\u2019s a natural evolution for our business. But it\u2019s important to reiterate that Meta is neither going to build, own, or run the metaverse on its own. This isn\u2019t going to be a Meta product.\n\nBuilding this will be more like how the internet came about rather than how one app was launched. That\u2019s why we will be collaborating at every stage with other companies, developers, experts, and policymakers. Principles of privacy, safety, and security need to be built in from the start. If we have the principles right, then as a society, we will be better at tackling new challenges with these technologies as they arise.\n\nThe transition to communication via the metaverse will face some challenges considering that it\u2019s not just another app on the mobile phone. What challenges does Facebook expect to encounter in rolling out the metaverse in Africa?\n\nNew innovations bring new challenges, and there\u2019s lots we need to figure out. But that\u2019s why we\u2019re starting this conversation early. We have to be responsible in our approach, and we intend to do that in a number of ways:\n\nNo surprises: In the past, the speed with which new technologies have emerged has sometimes left policymakers and regulators playing catch-up. We don\u2019t want this to happen this time around. A core principle is going to be \u201cdon\u2019t surprise people\u201d. That\u2019s why we are having this conversation out in the open, way in advance of all these technologies being launched.\n\nCollaboration: Partnering with independent experts and organisations will be a crucial part of how we navigate future challenges. We have already launched a two-year $50 million investment in programmes and external research, collaborating with industry partners, civil rights groups, governments, non-profits, and academic institutions to get input as we build these technologies responsibly. This is alongside being a founding member of the XR Association (XRA), which is committed to helping build responsible XR, which includes virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and future immersive technology.\n\nBuilt-in: While we will need to continue to get better at anticipating risks, we won\u2019t be able to see around every corner. That\u2019s why the principles of privacy, safety, and security need to be built in from the start.\n\nFacebook plans to spend ~$10 billion this year on the metaverse project\u2014and even more in the coming years. How will the company make money from this?\n\nIt\u2019s very early, and our focus today is more around building the foundational pieces for the metaverse, like VR, and bringing more people into those experiences. We outlined a few areas during Connect where we think there is an opportunity around commerce. We want to help provide tools for creators and developers so they can build a meaningful business in the metaverse because we think digital commerce will become increasingly important.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that investing in the metaverse also means additional resources invested in issues like safety and security. For example, the $10 billion investment in Reality Labs that we have already announced will include spending on research to better understand how we can responsibly tackle safety and integrity challenges in the metaverse.\n\nAnd, just like the rest of the internet, we expect that free things in the metaverse would likely be powered by ads while there would also be paid experiences that are ad-free.\n\nThis is a very long-term vision. It\u2019s going to take investment over many years before the metaverse reaches scale.\n\nLately, fingers have been pointed at Facebook for inciting civil unrest in Africa and being ill-equipped to staff its Africa offices to properly regulate posts. How does Facebook plan to build the metaverse responsibly?\n\nEvery day, our teams have to balance protecting the ability of billions of people to express themselves openly with the need to keep our platform a safe and positive place. We continue to make significant improvements to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content. To suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true.\n\nWe are on track to spend over $5 billion on safety and security in 2021 alone and have 40,000 people working on these issues, including 15,000 people who review content in more than 70 languages.\n\nHow we build is as important as what we build. And we will be collaborating at every stage\u2014with other companies, developers, experts and policymakers\u2014to make sure that what we build is good for the world.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It\u2019s called Kifta Technologies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKifta Technologies creates cutting-edge defence technology used by private entities and countries globally.\n\nIt makes smart glasses that can identify who you\u2019re looking at and even tell you if they\u2019re a wanted criminal.\n\nInterestingly, the company is the brainchild of a Nigerian textile merchant, Monsuru Anifowoshe.\n\nAfter several cases of stolen, intercepted and even vanished textile containers travelling from Lagos to Kano, Anifowoshe decided to build drones that\u2019ll make sure his containers arrived at their destinations safely.\n\nHardware is hard. However, Anifowoshe is making it work somehow. Kifta\u2019s first Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) prototype cost $450,000 to build, easily a pre-seed raise for a software company in Nigeria.\n\nEmmanuel Paul visited Kifta Technologies HQ and dished all about the gadgets here: Nigeria\u2019s Kifta Technologies produces smart glasses, other cutting edge defence tech for companies and countries worldwide.\n\nOr you can jump straight to the video here.\n\nEquity-free financing by Lendable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to funding, there are two ways to do it. You either give up some shares in your company or get a loan and pay it back later. The former \u2014 a popular option in the startup space \u2014 is equity financing, while the latter is debt financing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLendable, a UK-based debt financing company, typically gives startups between $5 million and $10 million in debt financing. However, it doesn\u2019t finance startups in the idea stage, only those with a proven product that needs to kick things up a notch.\n\nLendable shared how they invest, some of their biggest funding stories, and missed opportunities with Techpoint Africa\u2019s Chimgozirim Nwokoma.\n\nYou can read all about it here: How UK-based debt financing company, Lendable, is providing equity-free financing for African startups.\n\nRabbit\u2019s $11m pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRabbit team. Sourece: TechCrunch\n\nThe grocery delivery business in Egypt seems to be getting a lot of attention lately. Last week, Breadfast and Appetito bagged $26 million and $2 million, respectively.\n\nThis week, it\u2019s RabbitMart, aka Rabbit\u2019s turn. The startup raised a massive pre-seed round of $11 million.\n\nWho invested? Per TechCrunch, the record-breaking pre-seed saw investments from Global Founders Capital and Goodwater Capital, among others.\n\nInterestingly, Rabbit was founded in June 2021 but just came out of stealth in October.\n\nUnlike players like Breadfast and Appetito, Rabbit says it will set itself apart by letting the market call the shots. According to its CEO, Ahmad Yousry, Rabbit, \u201cwe\u2019re going to let the market dictate what we sell. We\u2019re not limiting ourselves as a grocery player.\u201d\n\nThe company employs an Amazonesque system to fulfil orders in 20 minutes. It has a large warehouse in addition to fulfilment centres to speed up delivery.\n\nThe startup plans to add more fulfilment centres in major cities across Egypt over the next year.\n\nFlutterwave acquires Disha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, November 10, 2021, African payments startup, Flutterwave, announced its acquisition of Disha, a platform for creators to curate their content and receive payment.\n\nDisha, which has about 20,000 users globally, was on the brink of shutting down in February 2021 but told users in a tweet that it was \u201cconsidering new options for our company and will share an update as soon as we have made a resolution.\u201d\n\nFounded by former Cregital CEO, Evans Akanno, Rufus Oyemade and Blessing Abeng in 2019, most of the platform\u2019s users were based in the UK, US and Europe. However, it only generated a little over $1000 monthly, according to TechCrunch.\n\nWhat does this acquisition mean for Disha? Flutterwave will provide the platform with a new payout and collection solution to help users receive payments from audiences globally.\n\nWhile Flutterwave makes it easier for creators to receive payments, the acquisition is also a way to invest in a global creator market estimated at $104.2 billion.\n\nMFS Africa raises $100m Series C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDare Okoudjou (Founder and CEO, MFS Africa).

          "title": "COP26 keeps 1.5C hanging by a thread \u2013 experts",
          "text": "The United Nations Climate Change Conference ended on Saturday night in Glasgow with nearly 200 countries agreeing to finalise the outstanding elements of the Paris Agreement but left loopholes for countries to exploit, raised funding for vulnerable communities but comes short of creating a fund \u2013 gaps experts say still leaves the climate vulnerable.\n\nNegotiators agreed that urgent action was needed in accelerating climate action but this didn\u2019t fully reflect in their commitments. Negotiators from India killed the provision to phase out coal while Russia, Australia and Saudi Arabia snuffed out provisions to end fossil fuel subsidies.\n\nWhile the deal has a clear pact to 1.5C, it relies heavily on the good behaviour of countries with a history of disregard for the planet. This is why some experts say it is only a start.\n\nRead also: COP26: Countries reach climate deal, refuse support for world\u2019s poorest\n\n\u201cIf Paris established the scaffolding, Glasgow has progressed the foundations: countries now have a clear mandate to work together to reduce and sequester emissions via carbon markets. Now the heavy lifting to produce meaningful emissions cuts must begin to keep global warming below +1.5 \u00b0C while also ensuring tangible co-benefits for nature and people,\u201d said John Verdieck, Director of International Climate Policy, The Nature Conservancy (TNC).\n\nEchoing this sentiment, COP26 President Alok Sharma said \u201cWe can now say with credibility that we have kept 1.5 degrees alive. But, its pulse is weak and it will only survive if we keep our promises and translate commitments into rapid action. I am grateful to the UNFCCC for working with us to deliver a successful COP26.\n\nThe Glasgow Climate Pact saw 200 countries agreeing to revisit and strengthen their current emissions targets to 2030, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), in 2022. This will be combined with a yearly political roundtable to consider a global progress report and a Leaders summit in 2023.\n\nThe new deal finalises the Paris Rulebook, the guidelines for how the Paris Agreement is delivered \u2013 after six years of discussions. The UN said it will allow for the full delivery of the landmark accord, after agreement on a transparency process that will hold countries to account as they deliver on their targets. This includes Article 6, which establishes a robust framework for countries to exchange carbon credits through the UNFCCC.\n\n\u201cHowever, the rules agreed at COP26 are far from perfect with some major loopholes on timeframes for countries\u2019 climate targets and especially for carbon markets. If exploited, they could seriously undermine efforts to reduce emissions,\u201d said Tom Evans, Policy Advisor E3G.\n\nEvans said that governments must avoid this temptation, uphold strict standards, and stay faithful to the ambition of the Glasgow Climate Pact which gives us the hope of keeping 1.5C alive. This could be a tough ask for governments long used to prioritising profits over the planet.\n\nAccording to the UN, for the first time, heeding calls from civil society and countries most vulnerable to climate impacts, the COP agreed to action on phasing down fossil fuels.\n\n\u201cWhile the fossil fuels phase out pledge was weakened by Australia, Russia & Saudi Arabia, it is still there and the cause of the climate crisis has for the first time since the Kyoto Protocol been called out by the 198 signatories of the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe UK COP26 went further than ever before in recognising and addressing loss and damage from the existing impacts of climate change. There were also commitments to significantly increase financial support through the Adaptation Fund as developed countries were urged to double their support to developing countries by 2025.\n\n\u201cGlasgow offers a gateway but will be insufficient unless World Leaders take actual action in the next 24 months, particularly on finance. Keeping 1.5 alive, protecting against climate impacts, and dealing with losses and damages requires trillions per year. Glasgow did not deliver the finance required but set up processes to do so in textual decisions on the post-2025 goal, adaptation finance, and loss and damage,\u201d said Iskander Erzini Vernoit, Policy Advisor, E3G.\n\nThe UN said work focused on driving the short-term reduction of emissions to limit temperature rises to 1.5C, mobilising both public and private finance, and supporting communities to adapt to climate impacts.\n\nIt said it has seen some wins. \u201cWhen the UK took on the COP26 mantle, in partnership with Italy, nearly two years ago, only 30% of the world was covered by net-zero targets. This figure is now at around 90%. Over the same period, 154 Parties have submitted new national targets, representing 80% of global emissions.\n\n\u201cThe UK Presidency has also been focused on driving action to deliver emissions reductions. We have seen a huge shift in coal, with many more countries committing to phase out unabated coal power and ending international coal financing.\n\n\u201cAlongside this, we have seen a marked commitment to protect precious natural habitats, with 90% of the world\u2019s forests covered by a pledge from 130 countries to end deforestation by 2030,\u201d it said.\n\nCOP 26 also recorded commitments that will lead to a transition to zero-emissions vehicles, with some of the largest car manufacturers working together to make all new car sales zero-emission by 2040 and by 2035 in leading markets. Countries and cities are following suit with ambitious petrol and diesel car phaseout dates.\n\nCurrent policies would leave us on a path to a devastating temperature rise. But work done by independent experts Climate Action Tracker shows that with full implementation of the fresh collective commitments could hold temperature rise to 1.8C.\n\nSharma said the world must now move forward together and deliver on the expectations set out in the Glasgow Climate Pact, and close the vast gap which remains.\n\n\u201cIt is up to all of us to sustain our lodestar of keeping 1.5 degrees within reach and to continue our efforts to get finance flowing and boost adaptation. After the collective dedication which has delivered the Glasgow Climate Pact, our work here cannot be wasted,\u201d Sharma said.",

          "title": "What Ikoyi building collapse means for housing stakeholders",
          "text": "Beyond the pain of loss inflicted on people whose loved ones were killed, the Gerard Road Ikoyi building collapse in Lagos means so much for critical stakeholders in Nigeria\u2019s housing sector, experts say.\n\nThese stakeholders, the experts explain, include the government for regulatory function, investors, financiers and buyers who are consumers of housing products.\n\nThough Nigerians are still waiting for the panel set up by the Lagos State government on the building collapse to complete its assignment before passing judgment, it is generally agreed that whatever caused the collapse could not be unconnected to regulatory failures and non-compliance.\n\n\u201cThe Ikoyi building collapse means the government and its agencies are not doing enough. They have to up their game because a lot of times developers find willing allies in government offices responsible for physical planning, urban development and building control,\u201d according to MKO Balogun.\n\nThat means too that even within its agencies, the government has a lot of work to do.\n\nBalogun notes that time has come for the government to be decisive on infringement of building development codes and laws, recommending that buildings that violate laws should not only be stopped, but also demolished and all affected persons prosecuted and jailed.\n\nThe collapse of Ikoyi building, also known as 360 Towers, has implications for project financiers too. Tayo Odunsi, CEO, Northcourt Real Estate, sees a significant increase in construction risk financing going forward.\n\nOdunsi explains to BusinessDay in a telephone interview that \u201cfinanciers are going to be a lot more cautious and will be asking a lot of questions on developers\u2019 antecedents before committing funds to a project. They will be making demands from the developers on issues bordering on regulatory compliance and the kind of project partners they have assembled.\u201d\n\nRead also: Fashola flags off National Housing Programme web-portal\n\n\u201cThis means that it is going to take a little longer to deliver a project than before because financiers have to take their time to do all the due diligence,\u201d he says, pointing out however that the Ikoyi building collapse would benefit big players in the sector who have built reputation and integrity over the years.\n\nFor investors and developers, the building collapse is a huge lesson on integrity and compliance with building regulations and permit, because, as Balogun states, \u201cit is not enough to blame government officials who collude with developers to do wrong things; it is important to stop private people from going to seek approval for the wrong things.\u201d\n\n\u201cProperty developers must desist from shortcut method while trying to cut cost, which leads to losses and at the same time cause death of innocent citizens,\u201d Olabisi Demola-Alade, chairman, Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers (NIESV), Lagos State chapter, advises.\n\nShe notes that developing a real estate facility for sale or lease requires the developer to see the project beyond profit and prestige, but to see it as a major component of community and national development such that any wrong steps or process failure, deliberate or unintended, can lead to major consequences.\n\nThis presupposes that, more than ever before, investors have to have integrity alongside their business mind. According to Demola-Alade, \u201cReal estate investors and developers should protect their investments and also save lives by embracing ethical practices while carrying out their business.\u201d\n\nBalogun agrees, adding, \u201cRelevant development control should start from registration of permits, not when the development has commenced and it is almost completed. Government should ensure only professionals certified by relevant professional bodies are involved in housing development.\u201d\n\nFor house buyers, the collapsed building is a good eye-opener. It is time to not only look, but also to ask pertinent questions. The era of buying through 3-D pictures is over. Perhaps, before now, many buyers never knew it was possible to buy unsupervised houses or those whose specifications were not approved. All these define the collapsed Ikoyi building.\n\nToo many experts in the built environment, the collapsed Ikoyi building was a disaster waiting to happen. \u201cThe collapse of a 21-storey structure or building is definitely an infrastructure and engineering failure,\u201d Ali Rabiu, president, Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN), says.\n\nOladipo Agida, the CEO, Dradrock Real Estate, also says the building was doomed to go the way it did, saying, \u201cWe learnt that the government approved 15-floors for the developer, but he added six more floors. That alone says it all that the building was a disaster waiting to happen because the six more floors came with additional load, which the building\u2019s foundation was not prepared to carry.\u201d\n\nA professional builder, who does not want to be named, notes that for the building to collapse means there were no professionals on ground to supervise the construction as it progressed. The builder wondered why work had to resume on a building that was sealed and a stop work order issued, yet the regulatory authority looked away.\n\n\u201cWhy was the building sealed in the first place; what was wrong that led to the stop work order; what did the developer do differently that made the government to unseal the building; who was the project supervisor from the government building control agency?\u201d the builder asks.",

          "text": "The clamour for power shift in 2023 may not amount to anything, if the signs emanating from the two major political parties in Nigeria are anything to go by.\n\nDespite the agitation for the zoning of the presidency to the south, especially, South East, it seems, the position would be thrown open for contest for whosoever will.\n\nWhile the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has openly said it was not considering any zoning arrangement in 2023, the main opposition People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), which has zoned its National chairmanship to the north, has also given indication that it could be thrown open for all.\n\nThe \u201cbody language\u201d of the parties appears to have now encouraged some political actors to begin to make moves through sponsorship of groups to drum up support for them.\n\nAlready, while political heavyweights in the PDP such as former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, River\u2019s Governor, Nyesom Wike and former Senate President, Bukola Saraki are battle ready to grab the party\u2019s ticket using all the resources at their disposal, the APC National Leader, Bola Tinubu; former Abia Governor and serving Senator, Orji Kalu, and current Ebonyi Governor, Dave Umahi are also jostling to grab the ticket of the APC, deploying their massive wealth to sway the pendulum to their sides.\n\nThe Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has for several months been in the news as one of the likely contenders as some support groups have since launched for him.\n\nOthers who have also announced their interest include Anyim Pius Anyim, a former Senate President, and Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa, immediate past President of the Nigerian Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria.\n\nA few days ago, a group called, Amalgamated Atiku Support Group (AASG), came up, describing itself as \u201ca coordinating and umbrella body set up to coordinate the activities of support groups interested in volunteering to work with His Excellency Atiku Abubakar in the bid to actualise his aspiration to salvage Nigeria come 2023.\u201d\n\nRead Also: APC throws 2023 presidential ticket, others open\n\n2023 presidential ticket\n\nA support group in Cross River State PDP, The Renaissance Movement, also announced its presence for Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, urging the party to leadership of the party to give its presidential ticket to the governor.\n\nAminu Tambuwal, governor of Sokoto State, has also given indication that he was interested in the PDP ticket.\n\nIn an interview session recently, he said: \u201cNow that we have almost done all the congresses and conventions, I will come back to you after consulting in a matter of a few weeks, few months.\n\n\u201cI have tried it before. It (presidential ambition) was in the air in 2014. After consultation, I decided not to run. In 2018, after consultations with a number of stakeholders I threw my hat into the race. I will commence my consultation extensively now and make it public after,\u201d Tambuwal said.\n\nIn recent years, there have been debates in Nigeria on whose region should produce the president after the expiration of the second term of incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.\n\nIn the last few months, party leaders have been making conflicting statements on the issue, observers fear that if not managed properly it could breed a serious rancour.\n\nAlthough, among political leaders in the South, especially in the South-East, it is expected that after President Buhari\u2019s tenure expires in2023 that power should return to the region.\n\nHowever, it appears that some political actors and stakeholders especially in the North are opposed to the idea. While some would want power to remain in the North, others say that every Nigerian had the right to vie for the presidency.\n\nAlso, there are others who are of the view that competence should rather determine who govern the country and not ethnicity.\n\nSuch is the position of former military leader, Ibrahim Babangida who said recently that the president should emerge through merit and acceptability rather than zoning, stressing that democracy does not align with zoning or power shift.\n\n\u201cWe have to make a choice either we want to practice democracy the way it should be practiced or the way it is being practiced or we define democracy according to our own whims and caprices.\n\n\u201cIf we are going to do it the way it is done all over the world you allow the process to continue, it is through the process that you will be able to come up with a candidate that will lead the country,\u201d Babangida declared.\n\nEqually, Pastor Tunde Bakare said recently that Nigerians should prioritise competence above zoning in the search for the nation\u2019s new president in 2023.\n\n\u201cI said it on the Oct. 3, it is our immaturity politically and otherwise that makes us say that power must either be in the North or be in the South instead of looking for the best, fittest or most competent and people of character who love this country,\u201d Bakare said.\n\nOther notable Nigerians have also spoken against or in support of zoning the presidency to a region in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cA lot of people in the South considers that since Buhari would be spending 8 years in power, that it is only fair for power to be rotated to the Southern Nigeria in 2023, because allowing someone in the North to continue will likely deny the South power at the centre for 8+8 which will be 16 years on a stretch\u201d, Adelaja Adeoye, PDP chieftain and political analyst said.\n\nChudi Amah, a political pundit, said: \u201cWhen the PDP took the decision to zone its national chairman to the North, many people thought it was a hint that the party may be willing to zone the presidency to the South; but this does not seem to be the case or maybe, time would tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe PDP\u2019s recent national convention ended without a clear position on the party\u2019s position on which zone should produce the candidate to fly the party flag in 2023. That has created confusion to the point that we can now see that it is everybody game, which is against the spirit of fairness,\u201d Amah added.\n\nIn the APC, similar situation exists, though the party has not taken a categorical statement on where the presidential ticket would be zoned to, however in recent months, loyalists of some party leaders have begun intense campaign to sell their principal to Nigerians.\n\nMamman Mohammed, director-general, Media to Governor Mai Mala Buni, chairman, of the All Progressive Congress APC Caretaker Committee, said the APC has not determined where its presidential ticket will be zoned to.\n\nMohammed while speaking with Businessday in a telephone conversation, said the task ahead of the party now is how to strengthen the party, build its structures and hand over a truly national party to the Nigerian electorates\n\nThe party has really not reached that position where it will decide whether to zone its presidential ticket or not.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe Chairman, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni, has continued to emphasise that his current assignment is to build a strong and united political party that is acceptable to all, free of acrimonies.\n\n\u201cThat is why following from the various Congresses, the party has constituted reconciliation committees that are working relentlessly to build that cohesion that the party is noted for.\n\n\u201cThe party has also constituted National Reconciliation Committee headed by Senator Abdullahi Adamu to reconcile those still aggrieved.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the committees have been given free hands to settle the issues to avoid unnecessary litigations.\n\n\u201cIt is hopeful to that at the end of the day, the committees will also make their recommendations to the Caretaker Committee, which will provide direction for organising a hitch-free national convention.\n\n\u201cThe party will be approaching the national convention with confidence. The party will be fair to everyone. So, let me assure you that when it is time to choose the party\u2019s presidential flag bearer, it will be a national affair and whosoever emerges will have the backing of everyone in the APC,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking in an interview last year, one of the party\u2019s prominent members, Babatunde Fashola, the Works and Housing Minister, said at the inception of the party seven years ago, there was an agreement that power should rotate between both regions and demanded that it should be respected.\n\nFashola warned that it would be dangerous to abandon the agreement.\n\nLaja Adeoye, political analyst said political parties must be careful so that their platform would not be hijacked by politicians with might and money to thwart the process.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIf you carry Nigerians along throughout the internal party process, you have already done about half of your campaign but if you allow undemocratic process by allowing powerful candidate, especially the moneybags to impose themselves on the party, you will have the generality of Nigerians to contend with at the general election.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is, any party that didn\u2019t get its act right in choosing her candidate will meet a brick wall at the general poll, this is a fact because Nigerians are yearning for a better President, who they think will help them navigate out of this mud.\u201d\n\nPolitical commentator, Kayode Kehinde said the agitations for a Southern or South Eastern president for the two major political parties in Nigeria (APC & PDP) is undoubtedly rooted in the existing orientation that one part of the country is dominating the other and all not being considered the same on the electoral contest floor.\n\nAdeoye further added that political parties must be careful on the kind of candidates they present so as not to ruin their chances of winning, adding that Nigerians are now wiser and would not accept any candidate that would further impoverish them.\n\n\u201cThe country is in total mess at the moment, and from their experience, they won\u2019t want to accept anyhow candidate from political parties, I can bet with you that the 2023 election will be a different ball game all together, because people are suffering now; prices of essential commodities are no longer affordable, people are wallowing in unimaginable poverty, citizens hungrily need a messiah who will help them and not pretenders, and they know the names of those they would want and would not want.\n\n\u201cThey know the names and antecedents of everyone who would want to contest. Take the just concluded Anambra election for instance, Charles Soludo has a beautiful background that naturally attracted people to vote for him; so, same thing may likely happen at the Nigeria 2023 Presidential election, therefore, political parties must get it right, else Nigerians will have to go for the candidate they consider as less evil,\u201d she said.\n\nPaschal Mbawuike, a public affairs analyst, while making case for \u201cjustice and fairness\u201d in determining who emerges as the presidential candidates in 2023, observed that many Nigerians do not believe in zoning, adding however, that it was for justice and equity in a multi-ethnic society.\n\nMbawuike also said that the provision in the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended was the basis for zoning of the presidential tickets by political parties.\n\nConsidering the high rate of insecurity, worsening economic hardship, discordant tunes across the country, and piles of debt hanging on the country\u2019s shoulders, the next president will have enough to work and think about as the level of damage to the country across all spheres is enormous.\n\nWhile many are saying that throwing open the ticket is expected in the early part of the pre-election years, to galvanise interests and kick-start party activities, others think that Nigeria needs to get it right from the onset by pruning the interests and considering equitable and fairness in their selections.\n\nBut, the PDP, according to some observers, has changed and does not see reason in zoning the presidential ticket, as well as the APC, hence party members from across the country, and even from Katsina, president Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s state, are also warming up for the ticket. Some observers are now asking, where lies fairness and equity?\n\nSam Ajanaku Onikoyi, a Nigerian historian and Commonwealth researcher based in Brussels, Belgium, is seeing selfishness and greed playing out in the 2023 presidential ticket across the two major parties.\n\nAccording to him, with the eight years of Buhari, representing the north, power has to shift to the south, noting further that the idea of throwing the ticket open is callous, undemocratic and not in national interest because Nigeria is multi-ethnic, multi-religious and many regions, which must be carried along.\n\n\u201cI read online yesterday that the Sokoto State governor wants to be president, Atiku Abubakar is showing interest again, El-Rufai is also among them. What about other regions. Yes, democracy is a game of numbers, but there should be fairness. If your children keep graduating with first class, do not rub it on the face of your neighbours because they also want their children to be even greater than yours\u201d, Onikoyi said.\n\nIn the same vein, Chijioke .J. Umelahi, an Abuja-based lawyer and former Abia State lawmaker, thinks that politicians will never change and 2023 will confirm that as many of them are jumping ship, seeking for their selfish interests and undermining the general interests.\n\n\u201cIt will be in the interest of the country that every region is given a chance and politicians should have this as a guide. With the many agitations, allegations of marginalization, and intimidation, the political class should make the 2023 presidential ticket available to people from places the foul cries are echoing louder\u201d, Umelahi said.\n\n\u201cI am from Ohafia in Abia State and Abia North, my senatorial zone has produced a governor. Imagine the senatorial zone having two governors ruling concurrently for 16 years, it means other senatorial zones do not exist. Let fairness be considered for 2023, the ticket should not be for the fittest or highest bidder because it is our future we are toying with, and governance at that level should reflect the interests of the entire country and not a section.\u201d\n\nBut Aliyu Dati, a Political Science lecturer at University of Jos, noted that zoning has not been officially gazetted in any party\u2019s constitution or even in the Nigerian constitution, hence it will always be embraced when it favours some people and discarded when it does not as being experienced now.\n\n\u201cDuring PDP\u2019s 16 years, we saw a sustained flow in the zoning arrangement. But I don\u2019t see that happening now because some interests do not respect \u2018gentle agreement\u2019, especially when it does not favour them. I see that gentleman agreement reached before the 2015 presidential election being dishonoured soon,\u201d Dati said.\n\nSpeaking further, the university lecturer, disclosed that with the body language of the major parties, fliers being pasted in public places across the country, media campaigns and praise singing ensuing, the 2023 presidential ticket is going to go to the same hands as politicians are realigning now, safeguarding their interests and not the masses\u2019.\n\nHowever, Onikoyi draws from his experience in Belgium, noting that the people can still make the 2023 presidential ticket and election to count if they unite to fight their common enemy \u2013 selfish politicians.\n\n\u201cHere in Belgium, politicians are accountable to the electorates. During town hall meeting they meet the electorates who pass either a vote of confidence or no confidence. Depending on the vote, the outcome is usually decisive as a politician\u2019s career can end there or boom. We can do that in Nigeria. People should stand for their rights, speak out, stand by your words and agitate for your common interests because the masses are the ones suffering. You can vote in a credible candidate from an unknown party, it must not be from any of the two major parties. Let\u2019s try that in 2023, let\u2019s try the credible man from an unknown party,\u201d Onikoyi said.",

The family of the senior officer and soldiers have been contacted.\n\n\u201cThe Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen Faruk Yahaya deeply commiserates with the families and relations of the fallen heroes.

Nwoba, its spokesman, urged Ebonyi people to join voices with it to stop the acquisition of the public belongings by the Umahis as there\u2019s no basis for which they should be sold without a replacement plan.\n\n\u201cThe attention of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in Ebonyi State has been drawn to the plan by the Ebonyi State Government in connivance with the House of Assembly to cede Ebonyi State liaison office buildings in Aba, Lagos, Abuja and Enugu to the Governor David Umahi\u2019s family. It is worrisome that the Francis Nwifuru\u2019s led House of Assembly could not deliberate extensively on the need to or not auction the property even when the PDP members in the House were objecting to the procedure adopted in deliberating on the letter containing the auction request by the State Government,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cWhy are the Ebonyi offices in Aba and Enugu auctioned outright? Is it to mean that Ebonyi people are no longer in their large numbers in these cities? More worrisome is the fact that there\u2019s no alternative to replacing them. The aim of establishing these liaison offices years back was to receive complaints from Ebonyi people scattered all over the places and attend to their daily needs. It\u2019s significant to note that these offices became redundant immediately Gov. Umahi\u2019s administration came into existence, bearing in mind that he could through the House of Assembly acquire them for personal use. This applies to the Abuja and Lagos offices which he claims sales will be public private partnership driven. We can authoritatively inform Ebonyi people that Gov. Umahi has concluded plans to acquire the property using cronies and which the leadership of the state assembly is aware of.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore urge Ebonyi people to join voices with us to stop the acquisition of these public belongings by the Umahis as there\u2019s no basis for which they should be sold without a replacement plan. We wish also to remind the Ebonyi State House of Assembly that it\u2019s not an appendage of the executive arm of the Ebonyi State Government, that they should at all times be doing the bidding of the executive without following due legislative process. To this end, we call on Ebonyi people to rise against this plan, and in case the governor finally has his way, should hold the Speaker Nwifuru-Umahi House responsible as the House couldn\u2019t listen to the different objections raised by the PDP members in the House towards approval of this obnoxious request on Tuesday and Thursday of this week respectively.\u201d",

          "text": "Former President Dr. Goodluck Jonathan has tasked world leaders to be more committed to climate financing and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in order to arrest the damaging effect of climate change.\n\nHe further asked leaders of developed economies to provide sustained technical and financial support to aid mitigation and adaptation efforts in developing countries as a means of saving the earth from rising temperatures due to global warming.\n\nAccording to a statement by his media adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, the former President stated this on Thursday at the opening ceremony of the 30th National Conference and Annual General Meeting of the Nigerian Environmental Society (NES), held in Uyo Akwa Ibom State.\n\nCommending the World Leaders for some of the decisions reached at the just-ended Conference Of The Parties (COP26) on climate change in Glasgow, Scotland, Jonathan urged leaders of developed countries to endeavor to meet their commitments in funding climate change control efforts.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are all aware that the highly favoured clean and renewable energy is an expensive option, especially at inception and requires huge resources and technology.\n\n\u201cIt will only be meaningful and beneficial to developing nations, if world leaders show more commitment in walking the talk in climate financing.\n\n\u201cThis view was echoed by many leaders of developing nations at the COP26 Summit, particularly our President who presented a case for sustained technical and financial support to developing countries to enhance the attainment of national and global climate change goals.\n\n\u201cFor me, this is the way to go and is most desirable for our common good. The fight against climate change is therefore a cause that requires a concerted global approach.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe experience with Covid19 pandemic has shown that the world needs to always come up with global plans and strategies to address global problems so that nations can key into these plans to resolve issues affecting the whole of humanity.\n\nThe former President also noted that the \u201cglobal effect of climate change including flooding, droughts, accelerated desert encroachment, and erosion which are increasing in intensity and frequency, is felt more here in Africa, even though the continent contributes less than 4 percent of greenhouse gases.\u201d\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement which aims to substantially reduce greenhouse emissions and strengthen the ability of parties to adapt to climate change has not been impressive, especially as the instrument lacks a binding edge.\n\n\u201cThere is also the perception of lack of will on the part of developed and wealthier countries, who are indeed the heavy emitters, to continue to robustly fund mitigation and adaptation efforts in developing countries, like ours.\n\n\u201cThis fear is sustained by the fact that the pledge made 12 years ago in Copenhagen by developed nations, to contribute $100 billion annually towards mitigation and adaptation has never fully materialised.\u201d\n\nHe also challenged the global business community to look beyond the quest for profit and do more to save Planet Earth.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot that big businesses and multinationals companies in Nigeria and elsewhere can do to check pollution and land degradation going on in the Niger Delta and in many other parts of the country where there are mining sites. We should all join hands to reverse the earth\u2019s present dangerous trajectory.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe former President further said: \u201cAs an advocate of democracy and good governance in Africa, I understand that adverse weather conditions, affecting the lives and livelihood of people, could trigger heightened social tensions in our societies, thereby putting democracy and constitutionality in danger. So, the peace of any society is inextricably linked with the stability of the environment.\u201d\n\nHe noted further that as President, his \u201cadministration\u2019s considerable support for the Great Green Wall initiative is a testament of my passion for environmental and climate issues.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigerian rural communities said they have started to benefit from Coca-Cola\u2019s Replenish Africa Initiative (RAIN), backed by a $65 million commitment from the company, to promote equitable and sustainable access to water across all 36 states of the federation.\n\nFloated by The Coca-Cola Foundation, RAIN was created to improve access to clean water across Africa and to have a positive and measurable impact on the lives of those living in targeted communities.\n\nThe chief of Kuchigoro, a growing community within the Federal Capital Territory, Ibrahim Wambi, said the soft drinks maker has built a borehole and two classroom blocks to improve quality of life.\n\nThis\u2019 borehole system, he said, is the primary source of all domestic water in Kuchigoro today, adding that it is also the first time that residents of this town have been able to access pipe-borne water reliably.\n\nWambi stated: \u201cIn addition to the new water source, the new school in Kuchigoro makes it unnecessary to leave the community in order to attend school. These two factors could someday contribute to the growth of this settlement into a new phase.\n\n\u201cBy the time I became chief of this community, there was no primary school. There was no water borehole system. I really appreciate the intervention of Coca-Cola in my community. They have built and fully furnished a block of 2 classrooms. They also built a borehole system \u2013 a marvellous one \u2013 which we are using in the community now.\u201d\n\nAlso, Chief Raimi Okomaalu, the Baale of Osegere Community in Oyo State, applauded the soft drink company for the initiative in his domain.\n\nHe said, \u201cAfter Coca-Cola and its bottling partner, Nigerian Bottling Company, established its plant here in Osegere Town, all the town\u2019s amenities were improved upon. They constructed water borehole projects for us and built classroom blocks for our children.\u201d\n\nIn Osegere, in Kanwa Ward of Kano State, Abdullahi Tuguru, the Councillor of Madobi local government area in Kanwa Ward said prior to the Coca-Cola System\u2019s involvement, accessing water was a major headache for the agricultural town.\n\n\u201cIn his words: If you come to my community, you\u2019ll see that we are farmers. Some are businessmen. If you go around, you will see plantations of sugarcane, rice, okra, etc.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cBefore Coca-Cola drilled this tube well for us, we suffered a lot to get drinking water in our community. Since Coca-Cola intervened, we now have good, safe water. We are a witness to the fact that Coca-Cola is impacting lives in the community. As they mark 70 years in Nigeria, we pray for them and wish them more and more years ahead.\u201d\n\nPlugged into the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 on universal access to clean water and sanitation, the RAIN programme leverages a vast network of partners including governments, the private sector, and civil society organisations. As it is designed to be measurable, RAIN addresses specific community needs, with specific emphasis on water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) alongside other water-based areas of focus.\n\nTo this end, the project\u2019s top priority is investing in access to water and sanitation projects, as well as promoting improved hygiene behaviours for positive impacts on health and development.\n\nThe second priority of RAIN is to promote the productive use of water and minimise wastage and inefficient use. Facets of this part of the program include training and equipping subsistence farmers to use techniques and equipment that minimise wasteful use of water. It also provides education on the long-term effects of human activity on water supply and instruction regarding how best to maximise the economic potential of existing water usage.\n\nThe third priority, which is closely linked to the second, is to promote conservation projects across Nigeria\u2019s most important water basins with both upstream economic usefulness and downstream value as a water source. About 92 waterside communities across Nigeria were selected for this project, with specific consideration given to women and young people.",

          "text": "Nearly 200 nations came together Saturday on a global deal to combat climate change after two weeks of painful negotiation, but fell short of what science says is needed to contain dangerous temperature rises.\n\nRich countries stood accused of failing at the COP26 summit in Glasgow to deliver much-needed finance to vulnerable states that are at risk of drought, rising seas, fire and storms.\n\nBritain\u2019s COP26 president Alok Sharma rounded up the marathon negotiations telling delegates: \u201cIt is now decision time. And the choices you are set to make are vitally important.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Activists Sound Alarm On Climate Anxiety\n\nBut there was last-gasp drama as China and India insisted that language on fossil fuels be weakened in the final summit decision text.\n\nAs the final deal was clinched, a tearful Sharma said \u201cI apologise for the way this process has unfolded. I am deeply sorry,\u201d before banging down his gavel.\n\nDelegates entered the talks charged with keeping the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5-2C degrees within reach.\n\nThey were also tasked with finding the funding for nations most at risk of climate-related droughts, floods and storms supercharged by rising seas.\n\nObservers said the agreement fell far short of what is needed to avert dangerous warming and help countries adapt or recoup damages from the disasters already unfurling globally.\n\nLaurence Tubiana, the architect of the Paris deal, told AFP that \u201cCOP has failed to provide immediate assistance for people suffering now.\u201d\n\nSharma earlier told delegates in the final throes of marathon talks that they faced a \u201cmoment of truth for our planet, for our children and our grandchildren\u201d.\n\nSurvival\n\nThe final text urged nations to accelerate efforts to \u201cphase down\u201d unfiltered coal and \u201cphase out\u201d inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.\n\nLarge emitters China and India had opposed the mention of the polluting fuels, and the language in the final text was significantly more nuanced than earlier drafts.\n\nThe deal also called on all countries to accelerate their emissions cuts by submitting new national plans by 2022, three years earlier than agreed in Paris.\n\nBut after resistance from rich nations led by the United States and EU, the text omitted any reference to a specific finance facility for the loss and damage climate change has already caused in the developing world.\n\nIt instead only promised future \u201cdialogue\u201d on the subject.\n\n\u201cFor some loss and damage may be the beginning of conversation and dialogue,\u201d said Shauna Aminath, the Maldives environment minister. \u201cBut for us this is a matter of survival.\u201d\n\nAlthough host Britain said it wanted COP26 to keep the 1.5C temperature cap in reach, a UN scientific assessment last week said countries\u2019 latest climate plans put Earth on course to heat 2.7C.\n\nThe text noted \u201cwith deep regret\u201d that wealthy nations had also failed to stump up a separate annual sum of $100 billion they promised over a decade ago. It urged countries to pay up \u201curgently and through 2025\u201d.\n\nIt also promised to double finance to help developing countries adapt to rising temperatures by the same date.\n\n1.5C on life support\n\nBut developing nations said it was unfair for the summit to produce an unbalanced agreement heavily weighted toward \u201cmitigation\u201d \u2014 how economies can ditch fossil fuels and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nThey wanted specific instruction on how they can meet the bill of decarbonising while also adapting to the natural disasters supercharged by global warming.\n\n\u201cWe were told that COP26 was the last best chance to keep 1.5C alive but it\u2019s been placed on life support,\u201d Amanda Mukwashi, CEO of Christian Aid.\n\n\u201cRich nations have kicked the can down the road and with it the promise of the urgent climate action people on the frontline of this crisis need.\u201d\n\nThe two weeks in Glasgow saw a number of high-profile announcements from world leaders, such as a commitment to slash methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030.\n\nIt also witnessed mass protests against what activists said was a dangerous lack of urgency.\n\nTeresa Anderson, climate policy coordinator at ActionAid International, said COP26 was \u201can insult to the millions of people whose lives are being torn apart by the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nAFP",

          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has petitioned the United Nations over what it describes as a vicious assault on Justice Mary Odili.\n\nSERAP specifically urged Mr. Diego Garc\u00eda-Say\u00e1n, the UN Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, to \u201cput pressure on the government of President Muhammadu Buhari to conduct a credible, thorough, impartial, independent, transparent, and effective investigation into the vicious assault on Supreme Court Justice Mary Odili by rogue officials.\u201d\n\nSERAP also urged him to \u201cask the Nigerian government to ensure that any investigation into the assault is based on human rights principles and protected from undue influence. The outcome of the investigation must be made public, and the suspected perpetrators and their sponsors brought to justice.\u201d\n\nSERAP\u2019s petition followed the recent invasion of Justice Odili\u2019s Maitama, Abuja residence by armed personnel.\n\nREAD ALSO: Odili Siege: AGF Malami Denies Consulting With Arrested Suspect\n\nIn the petition dated 13 November 2021, and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cThe intimidation and harassment of Justice Odidi is a flagrant assault on judicial independence, and apparently aimed at further weakening judicial independence and the rule of law in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nSERAP said: \u201cThe unconscionable attacks against Nigerian judges would seem to be a deliberate attempt by the authorities to exert pressure on the judiciary and undermine its independence and authority. These attacks are putting Nigerians\u2019 freedoms at risk.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cThe current investigation by the Nigerian police fails to meet international standards, as it is neither independent nor effective. As such, the investigation is incapable of identifying all the suspected perpetrators and their sponsors, and credibly delivering justice in the matter.\u201d\n\nThe petition, read in part: \u201cWe urge you to push for the adoption of a resolution by the Human Rights Council to establish an international, independent, and impartial investigative mechanism into the attack on Justice Odili, and other unresolved cases of intimidation and harassment of the judiciary, and assault on the rule of law in Nigeria since May 29, 2015.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn international investigation into the cases of intimidation and harassment of judges in Nigeria will meet the highest international standards and best practices, and assist the Nigerian authorities to take steps to improve respect for the independence of the judiciary, the rule of law, and access to justice for victims of human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf not urgently addressed, the attacks, intimidation and harassment of the judiciary may render judges unable to defend the rule of law, to provide accountability for the many gross human rights violations in the country, or to protect the rights of the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerian authorities have a legal obligation to take measures to protect the independence of the judiciary, and ensure the safety and security of individual judges.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP urges you to visit Nigeria to carry out a mission to investigate cases of intimidation and harassment of judges, assess the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law, and to continue to monitor the situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe proposed visit would help to support the efforts to bring Nigeria\u2019s justice system in line with international standards, and free of political interference.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerian authorities continue to fail to thoroughly, impartially, independently, transparently and effectively investigate cases of attacks, intimidation and harassment of judges, the very people who protect and guarantee human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the Nigerian authorities have arrested some of the suspected perpetrators, at least ten more persons reportedly involved in the assault on Justice Odili are still at large.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndependence of the judiciary is enshrined in the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended], and under human rights treaties including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights to which Nigeria is a state party.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe attack on Justice Odili is not an isolated incident. There have been several violations of judicial independence and the rule of law in the country. In 2016, for example, Nigerian authorities reportedly invaded in the middle of the night the homes of some judges of the Federal High Court and Justices of the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe authorities have so far failed and/or refused to identify those suspected to be responsible and to bring them to justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn independent judiciary is essential to the protection of human rights and respect for the rule of law. The principles of independence are the hallmarks of the rationale and the legitimacy of the judicial function in every State. Their absence leads to a denial of justice, and makes the credibility of the judicial process dubious.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the principle of the separation of powers, together with the rule of law, that opens the way to an administration of justice that provides guarantees of independence and transparency.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs expressed in the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct, \u201cJudicial independence is a prerequisite to the rule of law and a fundamental guarantee of a fair trial.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to our information, on Friday, October 29, 2021, some people claiming to be soldiers and policemen, invaded the Abuja home of Justice Mary Odili. The perpetrators identified themselves as members of a government joint task force, and used a fraudulently obtained search warrant to attempt gain access into Justice Odili\u2019s residence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe perpetrators claimed they had information that \u201cillegal activities\u201d were going on in the residence.\u201d",

          "text": "Despite the easing of both the COVID-19 restrictions and the output cuts by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Nigeria produced less crude oil and condensates in the first 10 months of 2021 than the corresponding period in 2020, according to the latest data from the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC).\n\nLast year saw severe restrictions of movement in most countries of the world due to the pandemic, resulting in less demand for transportation and industrial fuels and the collapse of oil prices.\n\nThough 2020 was a tumultuous year for the global oil and gas industry, Nigeria produced more crude oil last year than the corresponding period of 2021.\n\nThe report released by the new upstream commission showed that Nigeria has pumped less oil in the first 10 months of 2021.\n\nA THISDAY analysis of the figures revealed that the country has in the first 10 months of this year (January to October), underperformed by 72.6 million barrels of crude oil and condensates when compared to 2020.\n\nNigeria\u2019s total oil production has been on the decline for several months, with Libya overtaking the country in October as Africa\u2019s number one oil producer, according to the most recent figures from OPEC, quoting primary sources.\n\nMinister of State, Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, and the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kyari, recently disclosed that Nigeria would recover between October and mid-November, blaming the difficulty in restarting the oil facilities for the falling production figures.\n\nA number of the country\u2019s oil assets were shut down as a result of compulsory OPEC cuts due to covid-19 and the need to fully comply with the mandatory reduction in production.\n\nHowever, experts have blamed years of under-investment, aging production facilities resulting in frequent shutdowns, sabotage, vandalism, community issues, and incessant force majeure by Joint Venture (JV) partners for the declining production.\n\nThe NURPC figures showed that while total crude oil and condensate of 65.9 million barrels were produced in January last year, it declined to 53 million barrels during the same period this year, a difference of a whopping 12.9 million barrels.\n\nFurthermore, 62.4 million barrels of both crude oil and condensates were produced in February 2020; 65.8 million barrels in March; 62.9 million barrels in April; 55.3 million barrels in May; 51.4 million barrels in June; 52.7 million barrels in July; 52.8 million barrels in August; 50 million barrels in September and 52.3 million barrels of both condensates and crude oil in October.\n\nIn contrast, in February this year, 49.3 million barrels of both liquid types were pumped; 54.2 million barrels in March; 50.6 million barrels in April, 51.4 million barrels in May; 49.1 million barrels in June; 50.8 million barrels in July; 47.4 million barrels in August; 45.9 million barrels in September and 47.2 million barrels in October.\n\nIn total, while 571 million barrels of crude oil and condensates were produced between January and October 2020, in the first 10 months of 2021, it fell markedly to 498.9 million barrels.\n\nThe data showed that Nigeria\u2019s crude oil production declined from 55.1 million barrels in January 2020 to 42.1 million barrels in 2021 and from 52.1 million barrels in February 2020 to 39.8 million barrels in February 2021.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "Barely 18 days after its launch, 488,000 consumer wallets have been on-boarded to Nigeria\u2019s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) platform known as the eNaira from over 160 countries through Google Playstore and Apple Store as of Friday.\n\nData obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) at the weekend, also showed that about 78,000 merchant wallets have also been on-boarded to the digital currency infrastructure.\n\nAlso, transactions on the eNaira stood at about 17,000 valued at over N62 million.\n\nThis is an indication of growing enthusiasm for the central bank\u2019s digital currency, which has been described as a game-changer.\n\nThe digital platform had recorded about 200,000 wallets downloads in less than one day that the portal came alive.\n\n\u201cSo far, we have on-boarded over 488,000 consumer wallets and about 78,000 merchant wallets, with these downloads occurring in over 160 countries (per Google Playstore and Apple Store data).\n\n\u201cWe have also recorded almost 17,000 transactions amounting to over N62million with the average transaction being about $9.3 each. These numbers suggest the adoption rate has been excellent.\n\n\u201cIt is a direct liability of the bank, a legal tender and will form part of the currency-in-circulation and will be at par with the physical naira,\u201d CBN said.\n\nThe eNaira was officially unveiled on October 25, 2021, by President Muhammadu Buhari who said the electronic money would boost the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by $29 billion in the next 10 years.\n\nNigeria is the first country in Africa and one of the first in the world to introduce digital currency.\n\nBuhari had said: \u201cIndeed, some estimates indicate that the adoption of CBDC and its underlying technology, called blockchain, can increase Nigeria\u2019s GDP by $29 billion over the next 10 years.\n\n\u201cCBDCs can also help increase remittances, foster cross border trade, improve financial inclusion, make monetary policy more effective, and enable the government to send direct payments to citizens eligible for specific welfare programmes.\u201d\n\nThe president further assured Nigerians of the safety and scalability of the CBDC, adding that the journey to create a digital currency for Nigeria began in 2017.\n\nOn his part, CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, had said with growing interest in CBDC around the world, the CBN had commenced extensive study, consultations, identification of use cases, and the testing of the CBDC concept in a Sandbox environment as far back as 2017.\n\nHe said the objective of the research was to establish a compelling case for the adoption of a digital currency in the country to enable a more prosperous and inclusive economy for all Nigerians.\n\nHe added that following the completion of the preliminary work, the researchers and experts at the CBN were able to establish that a digital currency will drive a more cashless, inclusive, and digital economy as well as complement the gains of previous policy measures and our fast-growing payments platforms.\n\nHe said CBN decided to implement its own CBDC and to name the digital currency, the eNaira, and believes the innovation will make a significant positive difference to Nigeria and Nigerians.\n\nSpecifically, Emefiele said the eNaira will support a resilient payment system ecosystem, encouraging rapid financial inclusion, reducing the cost of processing cash, enabling direct and transparent welfare intervention to citizens, and increasing revenue and tax collection.\n\nHe had also said eNaira would also facilitate diaspora remittances, reduce the cost of financial transactions, and improve the efficiency of payments.\n\nHe added: \u201cTherefore, the eNaira is Nigeria\u2019s CBDC and it is the digital equivalent of the physical Naira. As the tagline simply encapsulates, the eNaira is the same Naira with far more possibilities. The eNaira \u2013 like the physical Naira \u2013 is a legal tender in Nigeria and a liability of the CBN. The eNaira and Naira will have the same value and will always be exchanged at 1 naira to 1 eNaira.\u201d\n\nEmefiele said in a bid to further de-risk the process, the CBN had given careful consideration to the entire payments and financial architecture and has designed the eNaira to complement and strengthen these ecosystems, adding that the bank had also implemented security safeguards and policies to maintain the integrity of the financial system.\n\nThe CBN boss added that there would be strict adherence to the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards to preserve the integrity and stability of Nigeria\u2019s payment system.\n\nAccording to him, 33 banks had been fully integrated and are live on the platform while N500 million had been successfully minted by the central bank including N200 million which had been issued to financial institutions.\n\nEmefiele said the country had made history with the eNaira launch, pointing out that this would be the first in Africa and one of the earliest around the world.\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja",

          "title": "Nigeria: Monitoring Direct Primaries Has Financial, Security Implications, INEC Says",
          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has explained that the monitoring of the direct primaries of the 18 registered political parties in the country has financial and security implications, stating that it will require about 17,618 officials to supervise only the primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in one day.\n\nThe commission further explained that monitoring the direct primaries of the 18 political parties registered so far would involve much staff.\n\nIn the amended Electoral Bill awaiting assent by President Muhammadu Buhari, the National Assembly has restricted political parties to the use of direct primaries to elect candidates for elections.\n\nHowever, the state governors, who are opposed to direct primaries, had expressed fear over the logistical problems it would create for the commission.\n\nSpeaking to THISDAY on Saturday night, INEC\u2019s National Commissioner in charge of Voter Education and Information, Mr. Festus Okoye, acknowledged that the monitoring of the direct primaries of the 18 registered political parties has security and financial implications.\n\n\u201cIf a political party decides to organise its primaries at the Registration Area (Ward) level, the commission must deploy monitors to the 8,809 Registration Areas in the country. If the party decides to organise its presidential, governorship, National Assembly, and state assembly primaries at different times and on different days, it means that the commission must deploy four times to monitor the primaries of the party.\n\n\u201cIf a political party decides to organise its primaries at the local government level, it means that the commission must deploy monitors to the 774 local government areas of the country,\u201d Okoye explained.\n\nDespite the huge logistics challenges, Okoye said the commission would surely work out the modalities for the monitoring of the primaries as soon as the law is assented to.\n\n\u201cThe monitoring of direct primaries has financial and national security implications. The ad-hoc staff must be harvested from MDAs or the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) or the universities or other sources as may be determined by the commission and supervised by a certain category of our staff\u201d.\n\nAccording to Okoye, the ad-hoc staff must be trained and transported, adding that some of them must be housed.\n\n\u201cSome of the primaries may go late into the night and we must make arrangements for their security and protection. But the fundamental issue is that the commission has the experience in monitoring direct primaries and the only difference here is that in the present context few parties adopted the direct primary method of selecting or electing their candidates,\u201d he said.\n\nOkoye further disclosed that the entire staff strength of the commission is slightly over 16,000, adding the commission must rely on a certain category of ad-hoc staff to cover the Registration Areas if a political party decides to use the 8,809 Registration Areas for its primaries.\n\nOkoye further noted that INEC will aggregate the figures and design a continuity framework and matrix for monitoring of direct primaries.\n\nOkoye explained that the commission as a constitutional and legal body is bound to give effect to and implement laws legally and legitimately passed by the National Assembly.\n\nHe said INEC does not have a choice in this regard.\n\n\u201cThe moment the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria assents to the Bill, it becomes law and the commission must implement the law passed by the National Assembly which has received Presidential assent. Presently, it is in the realm of speculation on whether the president will sign or withhold assent. The bill is inchoate till assented to by the president,\u201d he added.\n\nHe explained that Section 87(2) of the existing and operative law provides that the procedure for the nomination of candidates by a political party for the various elective positions shall be by direct or indirect primaries.\n\nHe added that the moment a political party gives to the commission the requisite 21 days\u2019 notice, the commission must mobilise and monitor the primaries of the party whether it is by direct or indirect primaries.\n\n\u201cHowever, if the president assents to the bill, it means that all the existing political parties must roll out guidelines on how to conduct their primaries bearing in mind that the fundamental and overriding consideration is ensuring that all aspirants are given equal opportunity of being voted for by members of the party. Each political party must design its methodology depending on its strength and capacity.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Section 4 of the Constitution domiciles the legislative powers of the Federation in the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cIt is within their remit to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Federation. Moreover, section 228 of the Constitution provides that the National Assembly may by law provide guidelines and rules to ensure internal democracy within political parties, including making laws for the conduct of party primaries, party congresses, and party conventions,\u201d Okoye said.\n\nAccording to him, INEC\u2019s responsibility is to participate in public hearings and make suggestions and recommendations.\n\n\u201cAs I have pointed out, our responsibility is to obey and give effect to laws passed by the National Assembly and assented to by the President. Section 228 of the Constitution gives the National Assembly the power to make laws relating to internal democracy in political parties,\u201d he added.\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja",
          "summary": "The commission further explained that monitoring the direct primaries of the 18 political parties registered so far would involve much staff.\nHowever, the state governors, who are opposed to direct primaries, had expressed fear over the logistical problems it would create for the commission.\nSpeaking to THISDAY on Saturday night, INEC\u2019s National Commissioner in charge of Voter Education and Information, Mr. Festus Okoye, acknowledged that the monitoring of the direct primaries of the 18 registered political parties has security and financial implications.\n\u201cThe monitoring of direct primaries has financial and national security implications.\nOkoye further noted that INEC will aggregate the figures and design a continuity framework and matrix for monitoring of direct primaries.",

          "text": "The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA on Saturday said it is holding 12 dockworkers at the Apapa seaport in Lagos for an alleged link to the importation of 32.9 kilogrammes of cocaine worth over N9.5 billion in street value.\n\nA statement signed by the agency\u2019s spokesman, Femi Babafemi said a Federal High Court in Lagos had granted an application by the NDLEA for the interim attachment of a vessel MV Chayanee Naree used to import the 32.9 kilogrammes of cocaine into Nigeria through the Apapa seaport.\n\nHe said beside the attachment order, the court also granted NDLEA\u2019s request to detain the Master of the ship, Mr. Tanahan Krilerk and 21 foreign crew members as well as the dockworkers arrested in connection to the case.\n\nThe anti-narcotic afency had on October 13 intercepted the ship at the Apapa seaport following intelligence from international partners and support from other security forces such as the Nigerian Navy, Customs, DSS and the police. A thorough search of the ship led to the recovery of 30 parcels containing cocaine, which weighed 32.9kg.\n\nThe application in suit no: FHC/L/CS/1518/2021, which was filed by the agency\u2019s Director of Prosecution and Legal Services, Joseph Nbone Sunday on Thursday 28th October was granted the following day Friday 29th October by Hon. Justice A.O. Awogboro. An application to renew the remand order was also filed on Friday 12th November because of the volume of evidence coming out from the cooperation of the suspects in custody.\n\nThe NDLEA in a statement on Saturday said its clarification became necessary following claims by the Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria that some of its members are being detained unlawfully by the Agency. Of the total number of 18 dockworkers initially being interviewed by operatives, six of them with no sufficient evidence linking them to the crime had been released while 12 others with significant links are cooperating with ongoing investigation. In line with the intelligence available to the Agency, there is a syndicate of dockworkers, crew members with apparent international conspirators who work in synergy to traffic in the illicit substances. While the substances are concealed in the shipment from the originating Port, the dockworkers assist to pick up the illicit consignment for onward delivery to the Nigerian drug barons.\n\nIn the case of criminal investigation of this magnitude, it is lawful and expedient to investigate those within the purview of the Agency\u2019s reasonable suspicion and those who do not have any serious involvement are let go. Already, two dockworkers are now on the run, after absconding from their place of work, since the beginning of the investigation.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, all the Agency\u2019s actions are guided by international best practices and in line with the Global Maritime Standard Operational Procedure on arrest, seizure and detention of Vessels and crew members.\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",

          "text": "Two strikes from the penalty spot earned Nigeria all three points against the Lone Star of Liberia at the Grand Stade de Tangier, Morocco on Saturday, and set up a tantalizing FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 qualifying Group C finale at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos on Tuesday.\n\nCape Verde\u2019s Blue Sharks came back from a goal down at half time to surmount the Wild Beasts of Central African Republic 2-1 in a simultaneous encounter on the island of Mindelo, meaning the Eagles maintain their two-point cushion at the top of the pool and need only a draw on home soil on Tuesday to reach the potentially \u2013explosive final round scheduled for March 2022.\n\nThe results in Tangier and Mindelo also meant Liberia and Central African Republic, who play in Tangier on Tuesday, are out of the running and all eyes will be on the game in Lagos to produce the group winner. Nigeria are on 12 points while Cape Verde are on 10.\n\nVictor Osimhen took his tally in the qualifying series to three goals when he slammed home from six yards in the 14th minute, after strike partner Kelechi Iheanacho was scythed in the box as he proceeded to beat goalkeeper Wynney de Souza from a long pass.\n\nBoth teams spent much of the time sizing each other up, with the Super Eagles failing to seize on the momentum offered by the first goal to dominate and out-muscle the \u2018hosts\u2019 in front of an empty arena. The Lone Star showed some sparkle and got behind the Eagles rearguard on two occasions only to be denied by an alert Maduka Okoye.\n\nWorkhorse Moses Simon toiled at the fore and at the rear throughout to keep the right side of the Super Eagles going. In the 28th minute, the Super Eagles thought they had scored a second when defender Jamilu Collins strung the ball past de Souza, only to be ruled off-side by Tunisian referee Youssef Essrayri.\n\nOsimhen, energetic and vibrant, should have made it two for Nigeria minutes later, but shot into the sky with only de Souza to beat.\n\nIn the second half, both teams had chances to score but it was Nigeria that added to their tally in added time when Osimhen got behind de Souza after being sent through by Iheanacho, only to be upended by Souza.\n\nIt gave captain Ahmed Musa, who on the day became Nigeria\u2019s senior caps\u2019 record holder by playing his 102nd game, the opportunity to score from the spot.\n\n\n\nEditor",
