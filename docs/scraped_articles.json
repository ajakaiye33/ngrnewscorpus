          "text": "By Emem Idio, Yenagoa\n\nYENAGOA-THE Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, has stated that the adoption of a transparent payment platform University Transparency and Accountability Solutions,UTAS, is critical to resolving the current strike action by the Union.\n\nAccording to ASUU, UTAS has been proven to be a flawless payment platform but lamented that the deep-rooted penchant for corruption within government ethos are all out to frustrate its deployment.\n\nChairperson of ASUU, Federal University Otuoke, Bayelsa State chapter, Dr Socrates Ebo, in a statement in Yenagoa, weekend, on stated that the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System,IPPIS, has been decisively proven to be a porous easily compromised payment platform.\n\nAccording to Ebo, the IPPIS has been ineffective in curtailing waste of resources, adding that in the contrary it has been used to pad payrolls and used to effect all manner of fraudulent deductions from workers\u2019 salaries.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe definitely can\u2019t continue this way, the adoption of a transparent payment platform is critical to resolving the current impasse in the nation\u2019s university system. UTAS has been proven to be a flawless payment platform but the deep-rooted penchant for corruption in our government ethos is all out to frustrate its deployment.\n\n\u201cNo lecturer under IPPIS can say for certain what his salary is. What we find queer is the insistence of some government officials on the use of IPPIS when it is proven to be compromised and corruption-prone.\n\n\u201cUTAS has been designed to be corruption proof. Why would the government not be interested in a payment platform that is cheap, 100% corruption proof, and 100% indigenous? If IPPIS was corruption proof, how would it be possible for a government accountant to loot N80b plus N70b? How could such huge sums disappear under any serious payment platform?\n\n\u201cThe claims of savings by IPPIS are fraudulent. IPPIS arbitrarily cuts workers\u2019 legitimate salaries to cover its heavily corrupt and inefficient tracks to create the false impression of efficiency and savings.\n\n\u201cThe recently paid minimum wage arrears are a case study. So many persons have not been paid till date. In my branch alone, 40 persons have not been paid. While the Minister of Labour thinks that we were paid 3 years arrears, what we received was mere 9 months without any clear template on how the payments were made. Nobody knows what they are entitled to, nobody can ask questions to anybody. Even the university bursars can\u2019t explain how the payments were made and what was paid.\n\n\u201cThe government should get serious with education in this country. In the 60s and 70s, our universities ranked high among our peers. Scholars all over the world were coming to our universities to teach and study.\n\n\u201cToday, our universities are so dead that even our politicians no longer believe in them. They now send their wards abroad for the same education. Yet these are the people killing education in the country. ASUU is the only bastion of defence for quality education in this country.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately when you destroy education you also destroy healthcare. Doctors are taught new procedures and skills at the universities, not at Aso Rock Clinic or National Assembly. Eventually, everyone gets sick and everyone eventually suffers the consequences of the dearth of educational infrastructure.\u201d",

Our country faces one of the biggest burdens from neglected tropical diseases across Africa and we need strong leadership to banish them.\n\n\u201cNigeria has made great strides in the fight against these diseases \u2013 with support from Sightsavers and partners.\n\n\u201cFive states have already interrupted transmission of river blindness and more are close.\n\n\u201cWe must make sure that new challenges such as COVID-19 and climate change don\u2019t threaten progress.\n\n\u201cTreatment and prevention for NTDs need to be integrated into the health system and pressure must be kept up even as the country gets closer to elimination.\n\n\u201cThe government\u2019s pledge recognises that access to clean water, hygiene and good sanitation are fundamental to stopping the spread of NTDs.\u201d\n\nHe added that, \u201cAchieving this will require people from different parts of our health sector to work together and with others \u2013 such as the people responsible for planning infrastructure.\u201d\n\nSightsavers has supported NTD interventions in Nigeria for nearly three decades, starting with river blindness in 1994, and now includes lymphatic filariasis (LF), schistosomiasis, trachoma, and intestinal worms into its programmes.\n\nThis includes supporting community volunteers to go door-to-door to make sure that no one misses drug treatments, surgery for advanced trachoma and hydrocele (caused by LF), as well as surveys and surveillance.\n\nSignificant global progress has been made since the last global summit on NTDs which led to the 2012 London Declaration on NTDs.\n\n600 million people across the world are now no longer at risk from NTDs transforms the lives of people such as seven-year-old Muzi from Sokoto, who missed school and lived in pain because advanced trachoma made his eyelashes turn inwards and scrape his eyes.\n\nHe was at risk of losing his sight completely. But surgery, supported by Sightsavers and UK Aid, stopped this happening. His father, Muhammad was overjoyed by the change: \u201cI think his future is going to be bright because he doesn\u2019t have a problem seeing and he\u2019s been able to go to school, he\u2019s been able to take part in every other activity that every other child can do.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

There\u2019s a billion people on the planet, what does anyone life really mean? But in a marriage, you\u2019re promising to care about everything\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom her findings through interactions with the mature singles, it\u2019s obvious that there are few eligible bachelors available due to the decrease of economic power of the male population.\n\n\n\nShe supplies the interesting fact that only in five Nigerian states, namely, Abia, Ebonyi, Enugu, Ogun and Plateau, are there more females than males!\n\n\n\nHer remarkable case studies includes Sandra\u2019s story in which the gold-digging Obinna eventually dumps Sandra even after introducing her to his parents as his wife-to-be.\n\nIn the case of Nene, she ceded her position to her friend Eky as she was not satisfied with the sexual prowess of Mike who had a very small member.\n\n\n\nBene\u2019s fate was that of forever hearing from her mother: \u201cGo and marry!\u201d\n\nEtta\u2019s woe is that her socialite mother wants her to marry so that she can don aso-ebi with her million friends.\n\n\n\nThere is the unrelieved comfort of fellow singles that see in others that they are not alone in the wahala.\n\n\n\nThe matter gets more complicated with married peers who view the mature singles with \u201cmixed feelings of pity, relief and sometimes envy.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe author who now lives with her husband and children in Canada depicts some characters as \u201cConcerned Citizens\u201d who are unsolicited matchmakers forever on the lookout for potential husbands for the mature single ladies.\n\n\n\nA breed of men that the single ladies can do without gets labelled as \u201cLazies\u201d, who must do no work but eat off the hands of successful women.\n\n\n\nShe delineates the types of single ladies thusly: \u201cSad Single (SS)\u201d, \u201cNonchalance Feigners (NF)\u201d, and \u201cHigh Headed Singles HHS\u201d. She makes a case for living life as a new single by adopting principles such as self-acceptance, cultivating healthy personal relationships, building spiritual relationships, striking a good balance in work and career, being open-minded, and enjoying a good laugh.\n\n\n\nShe cheekily suggests a sexual revolution amongst married women such that they would conspire to give birth to more boys which would eventually lead to so many men competing for too few women!\n\n\n\nWell, maybe Yul Edochie should come to the rescue by marrying off all the single ladies via polygamy!",

          "text": "It was a tragic night for people of Federe, an agrarian community in Lere Local Government Area of Kaduna State, as a gas explosion at a tea shop popularly known as \u2018Mai Shari\u2019 killed a young boy and left 22 others seriously injured ABDULGAFAR ALABELEWE reports.\n\nIt was a quiet night at Federe, a Kaduna community on the border of Plateau State penultimate Thursday. The villagers had no premonition of a looming disaster until Suleiman Idris, the village\u2019s Mai Shayi (tea seller) resumed his evening business.\n\nIdris\u2019 tea shop is located in the very busy part of the community. The area, which could be best described as the village square or market, hosts many other shops and stalls for people doing small businesses like food vending.\n\nMai Shayi, as Idris is popularly called, brought his gas cylinder to his stall. But contrary to his usual practice, he did not install the burner he uses to boil water and fry eggs on the cylinder. While he was out to attend to other things, his young assistants installed the burner wrongly while, unknown to them, the gas was leaking.\n\nAn eyewitness account said the leaking cylinder exploded immediately Idris attempted to make fire and attend to his waiting customers.\n\nA source in the area, Abubaka Lere, told The Nation that the fire resulting from the explosion affected other people in nearby shops as well as children and other people who were doing other businesses in the area.\n\nIn all, he said, 23 people were injured in the incident and rushed to the General Hospital in Saminaka. \u201cUnfortunately, one of the injured victims, a young boy by the name Abdulrazaq Danbaba, later died in the hospital due to the severe nature of his injuries.\u201d\n\nNarrating how the incident occurred, the Mai Shayi, Suleiman Idris, who was also injured in the incident, said he forgot to install the burner on the cylinder and went out to do something. By the time he returned, he found that one of his boys had installed the burner and he assumed that everything was okay. \u201cBut after turning on the fire, I saw that there was a problem because they did not install the burner properly. So, I decided to bring down what was on the fire and reinstall the burner.\n\n\u201cWhile I was trying to do that, fire was already getting to the outlet of the cylinder.\n\n\u201cBefore I could make another move, gas forcefully blew off the cylinder lid and tan and was coming out with force.\n\n\u201cI immediately dropped the cylinder and ran out of the shop. Fire started burning.\n\n\u201cThen at a point, I felt that the fire was going down so I went back into the shop to bring out the cylinder. On getting there, I just heard an explosion and fire caught my dress immediately.\n\n\u201cI ran out of the shop and headed to my house, shouting that people should help me remove the clothes from my body.\n\n\u201cI thank God that people moved swiftly and removed the clothes from my body. If not, I would probably have been burnt to death,\u201d he narrated.\n\nIdris said he had been using gas to fry eggs and cook noodles in his tea shop for long, but he had never experienced such an incident.\n\nHe added: \u201cI feel very bad that this incident occurred. I feel particularly pained that other people got injured as a result of this fire incident that started from my shop.\n\n\u201cBut, there was nothing I could have done to stop it because that is the way it was destined to happen.\u201d\n\nOne of the injured shop owners, Malam Lawal Ali, who was on admission at Saminaka General Hospital, said he had gone to take tea at the shop without an inkling of the looming disaster.\n\nAli said: \u201cI had taken my tea and even left the shop before the incident occurred. I was only caught in it because as I was leaving the shop, I met a friend and we started chatting.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, the tea vendor came out shouting for help. We moved in to help and the fire extended to where we were. We started running but it was too late, because my clothes had already caught fire.\n\n\u201cAs I was trying to remove my clothes, I got people who came to my aid, and from there, they brought me to the hospital.\n\nThe Village Head of Federe, Malam Umar Babangida Ubale, explained that the explosion would not have affected many people but children around the tea shop were there watching when they were supposed to run for their lives. According to the village head, \u201coutside the tea shop, there were children selling food, some were frying soya beans cake. So, when the incident happened, instead of them to run for dear lives, they were busy catching a glimpse of what was happening.\n\n\u201cSo, when the gas cylinder exploded, the fire caught up with many of them and other people outside, including people in other shops and passersby.\n\n\u201cTwenty-three people were affected, some with minor injuries, while others had their faces, arms, legs and even their body burnt.\u201d\n\nThe village head said most of the injured victims were taken to Saminaka General Hospital while about seven whose injuries were very serious were taken to Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital in Kano State.\n\nHe however noted that the community got assistance from the House of Representatives member representing Lere, Alhaji Ahmed Munir, who offered to foot the hospital bills of all the injured people.",

Blood tests were obtained in Nigeria and he travelled to the UK in February this year.\n\n\u201cHe was taken to several medical appointments, in particular a medical appointment at the Royal Free Hospital, and was spoken to by a consultant about the organ harvesting for a kidney transplant.\n\n\u201cThe consultant was concerned about his actual age and was concerned he was not aware he was the donor of the kidney. He only found out that the purpose of his visit was for an organ transplant when he visited the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe couple are charged with conspiracy to arrange or facilitate travel of another person with a view to exploitation, namely organ harvesting.\n\nThe kidney was meant for their daughter, Sonia, who requires a kidney transplant.\n\nThey face a 10 year jail term if found guilty.\n\nDavid is now under the care of safeguarding authorities and the Metropolitan Police, officials said while the accused persons are being remanded in custody.\n\nThe next hearing in the case comes up on July 7 when the court will rule on jurisdiction.\n\nObi to Ekweremadus: My family and I are with you in your travail\n\nReacting yesterday to the arrest and prosecution of the Ekweremadus, Labour Party (LP) presidential candidate Peter Obi sympathised with then on their ordeal and prayed that God might heal their daughter.\n\nObi, writing on Twitter, said: \u201cMy family and I are with the Ekweremadus over their travail.\n\n\u201cWe join all men of goodwill in praying for the healing of their daughter and commit them into God\u2019s hand for justice to be done.\u201d",

It also appeared that the same faith might have befallen the governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, as he could not also make the list\n\nHowever, reacting to the development while appearing on a television political programme, INEC\u2019s National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said the commission is not obliged to publish the name of candidates that did not emerge from validly conducted party primaries.\n\n\u201cIf a political party submits to the Independent National Electoral Commission the name of a candidate that did not emerge from party primaries or did not emerge from valid party primaries, the commission is not obligated to publish the name of such a candidate,\u201d he said.\n\nOkoye however clarified that the commission has not published the final list of validly nominated candidates, emphasising: \u201cthe final list of validly nominated candidates will be published by INEC on September 20, 2022. And that is for presidential and National Assembly candidates.\n\n\u201cWhat the commission has published, as of today, complies with Section 29(3) of the electoral act which says that the moment political parties comply with the provision of Section 29 (1) of the electoral act in terms of the submission of its validly nominated candidates, that the commission shall publish the personal particulars of such candidates in the constituencies where the candidates intend to contest election.\n\n\u201cIn other words, for instance, for a senatorial candidate, if a senatorial district covers four local governments, we will publish the personal particulars of such a candidate in the four local governments.\n\n\u201cSo that is exactly what we have done. And we published the personal particulars of candidates that emerged from valid party primaries. And that\u2019s what the law says we should do.\n\n\u201cSo, if the name of any candidate was not published, or if the personal particulars of any candidate was not published today, the implication is that such a candidate did not emerge from valid party primaries,\u201d Okoye quipped.",

          "title": "Okotie: Nigeria\u2019ll break up if i don\u2019t succeed Buhari",
          "text": "Founder of Household of God Church, Oregun, Lagos, Rev Chris Okotie has warned that Nigeria will collapse if he\u2019s not allowed to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari. He said to avert a national catastrophe, he, Okotie would have to head an interim government.\n\nIn an interview with VINCENT KALU, the pop star-turned cleric said the current political system in Nigeria, including the National Assembly, state assemblies and other government structures must be dismantled, noting that an interim administration headed by him would then midwife a brand new political system for the country.\n\nWhat informed this strange talk about an interim government after Buhari that must be headed by you?\n\nWe are in a juncture in our political evolution that it becomes the logical and the next step to take. The presidential system of government that we have been operating for so many years now has failed woefully. We redefined democracy to be government of the party by the party for the party. To that extent, they excluded Nigerians from the entire process and that is why things have degenerated to the level that we see today. To bring democracy back to the people; to re-establish the parameters in which we operate as a federalism, to rekindle brotherhood, to avoid war, segregation, the interim government is the only next logical step to take.\n\nWhen Chief Afe Babalola recently called for an interim government, he received knocks from across the country. Don\u2019t you think Nigerians might stone you for calling for what some could be described as a \u2018civilian coup\u2019?\n\nNot at all. What I\u2019m proposing is inspiring a conversation in the country where all our people begin to talk about the problem that we face right now. When those conversations have been collated, I will send them as a transcript to the president and to the National Assembly so that they can energise the process that can lead to a transition, not from a regime to a regime, but from this regime to an interim government because Nigeria should be fixed.\n\nAs a lawyer, you know an interim government has no place in our constitution. So how do you implement this system?\n\nThat is what I have just told you. The legislators and the president are Nigerians. Man was not made for the law, but the law was made for man. If the will of the people is that we have problems in the nation today (it is very clear, go to the streets and ask people, there is disillusion everywhere, resentment, anger), and there is the need to do something very drastic for our sake. Democracy is the ascent of the people. If the people say this process is not working, we need to do something urgently; that is why the National Assembly is there. They will now make a law signed by the president for transition into an interim government so that Nigeria can be fixed. I don\u2019t think that there is any difficulty in that.\n\nHow do you think the National Assembly would agree to throw away their jobs and support an unconstitutional arrangement?\n\nI expect that that they are patriots. There comes a time when a man must prioritise the needs of other people than himself. They were sent there as representatives of the people; the government is representing the people. So, if you find out that there is a political system that is not practicable to bring harmony in our society, it is the responsibility of these people to rectify that situation; it is a patriotic duty. I believe that with the scenario we have in the country today where things are really dilapidated, there is enmity (these politicians play the card on religion and ethnicity), we are so polarised , balkanised, I feel that they must recognise that as the only solution and therefore will rise this time as patriots and do the right thing. There comes a time in the affairs of men when you recognise that if you do not do the right thing, it would be catastrophic and cataclysmic and therefore, as intelligent people, lovers of this country, I believe that they would be galvanised by the circumstances to rise to the occasion of this reality. I also believe that the president has been kept by God in the means of all the debilitating illness that he had so that he can do something to protect this country before he leaves, and I believe that this could be his greatest legacy.\n\nDon\u2019t you think a sovereign national conference would address these problems that you have identified?\n\nNo. It is impossible because no subsisting or extant government can give that kind of latitude. It is an interim government where you do not have political considerations that usually work against that which is conducive for harmony and the wellbeing of the people. It is an interim government that can do that because it has no political agenda of its own; it is a corrective mechanism to salvage the political process, otherwise there may be great catastrophe and calamity. That is why none of these confabs has succeeded because an existing political institution like government cannot take that kind of responsibility. That is why it is inevitable at the moment that we move with the interim government for the sake of the corporate existence of our nation.\n\nMany Nigerians would no doubt consider this interim proposition a joke\u2026\n\nNot at all! You can see the signs; you can see how divided Nigeria has become; how polarised we have become. The politicians themselves have divided our nation so that they can rule. But I\u2019m saying, as a patriot, it is my responsibility to proffer solutions. The interim government would correct all of these. For instance, our democracy has been hijacked by elitism, mysticism, Satanism. Our democracy is no longer government of the people by the people for the people. It is now, government of the party by the party for the party. It is an aberration, a terminological inexactitude. So, we need to come back to democracy. That is why I\u2019m saying that this interim government will give an opportunity to proffer a solution. It is what I call, Aborigine democracy. For instance, we don\u2019t need the legislature; we can eliminate the legislature from this tripartite system of government where you have the executive, judiciary and the legislature. So the legislature is totally unnecessary. We can take power and give it back to the people because what the legislature does is to run committees; participate in committees to discuss issues that are already in existence in our polity. You have the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT), Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASSU), etc. These are institutions that are already there, you should involve them in lawmaking instead of getting people who do not understand the mechanism or dynamics of situations that confront the Nigerian people.\n\nMy suggestion is eliminate the legislatures, give the power to these institutions so that when it comes to lawmaking, go to them; they are part of the people. It is what I call, the concept of gregarious socialisation, where lawyers binding with lawyers, doctors binding with doctors, journalists binding with journalists, market women binding with market women. They understand the realities within their own firmament. If you want to make a law on health, you don\u2019t go to senators, but you go to the NMA or the affiliate, they can tell you what is necessary in their society; they emerge from that society. In this way, the financial burden that this nation has been trying to maintain will be eliminated. I call it Government of National Reconciliation and Reconstruction.\n\nWhat do you mean by this system of \u2018elitism, mysticism and Satanism?\n\nThe elites belong to echelon politics. There are those people who have a certain intellectual capacity; they are trusted by their people and have deceived them along the way because they have been in kaput with the rich men, the Plutocrats, the oligarchs, the hegemonies and they come to their people and say, this is the direction because the culture of our people is to follow people we consider to be leaders. Many of them are technocrats who are politically inclined but they pretend that they are democrats, but they only represent their masters. I call it political ventriloquism (somebody who throws his voice at a distance). When they open their mouths to speak, you hear their masters\u2019 voice. They have systematically oppressed the Nigerian people, deceived the Nigerian people and established their own personal agenda for self aggrandizement. They are problem number one. Problem number two is mysticism. These are people who call themselves juggernauts; \u2018without me, nothing will happen.\u2019 They have acquired their money, acquired everything. I call it social irredentism, where everything belongs to me \u2013 I bought this, I bought that, I have everything, I have all the money stored somewhere for the day of reckoning. These ones must be demystified. Problem number three is the Satanism. These are the ones who bring chaos; if my party doesn\u2019t win there is a state of emergency and then there is chaos and there is anarchy. This is the tripartite coalition; diabolical coalition that has militated against the democracy of our nation. But that would end when we have a government that understands its responsibility. One of the things in this interim government is that we would no longer have political parties. It is not necessary. In the definition of democracy, you will never find any reference to political parties mentioned. Political parties were engendered by the rich as a mechanism to suppress the poor, and to keep the rich in the place of power. You don\u2019t need political party system for democracy, what you need is ascent.\n\nAn example. In 2019, President Muhammadu Buhari polled over 15 million votes to become the president. What happened to other millions of Nigerians who didn\u2019t vote? But it didn\u2019t stop him from becoming the president, as long as those people agree that whoever polls the largest votes becomes the president. That ascent is democratic. If you look at the football mundial, you find out that when they were about to pair teams at a particular time in the competition, they put them in a box and people will just come and draw; they say Nigeria will play Brazil. There has never been any quarrel about it because it is a democratic process. So, we don\u2019t need political parties. As we don\u2019t need political parties, we don\u2019t also need ministers or commissioners because the civil service structure has been running for ages. They are political appointees that have no relevance; they are just there as part of the victory charm for their political parties to do whatever they want to do with those positions. If we curtail all of these political excesses, Nigeria will be better for it, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m suggesting.\n\nWhat you are saying, for instance, is that the NMA should be given the power to make laws on health?\n\nYes, that is what I\u2019m saying. Let the constitution enable these people who are within the society; you don\u2019t need other people representing them, let them represent themselves so that if you want to make a law you go to those establishments. For instance, NUT was established in 1931, NBA was established in 1933, NMA was established in 1951, they predate all these political parties; even ASUU was established in 1978. If we are truly practising democracy, then go to the people themselves, why asking people to represent people when the people can represent themselves and they are not paid? All that cost of spending billions on an institution that is a replication of what we already have will not be there again. If you empower these institutions, they will give us laws that are more appropriate and very relevant to them. That would be true democracy; it could be a presidential system devoid of an institution that is unnecessary.\n\nHow long will the interim government last if it is set up?\n\nIt depends on the responsibility and the terms of reference and terms and rules of engagement. The important thing that we need to understand is that you cannot ask a man who is debilitated by some ailments to run a race; you have to fix him first. Nigeria cannot run the race of joining the comity of nations when we are incapacitated, when we are fractured and polarised, it is not possible. We need to fix the nation first before we start talking of the political process.\n\nLook at the party primaries and the things that we have seen in the political arena, it is disheartening and it\u2019s done with so impunity right in your face and that is because we lost sight of what truly democracy is and that is why we need to pause; there has to be a hiatus. Some of our great politicians have qualified for the next election as flag bearers \u2013 Their Excellencies Atiku Abubakar, Bola Tinubu, Peter Obi and others. These are Nigerians first of all and they understand as patriots that this nation is greater than anybody and if they love this nation and I believe they do, they must align themselves with the current situation that something must be done outside what has transpired for so many years. We cannot proceed to the polls, it is a journey in futility and elusive, it is like trying to embrace an elusive phantom. Nothing is going to come out of it and we are back to square one. So, an interim government is the only way forward.\n\nBut these presidential flag bearers are saying that they are well aware of these problems and are prepared to tackle them and reposition the country.\n\nThey may have such intentions, but the concept of the political system that we are operating is faulty ab initio. It is not a question of saying that I will do this and that. I\u2019m saying, the reason we have these problems, which are symptoms of a major pathological situation that we have not addressed, is because we are always addressing symptoms. What are they going to do about the definition of federalism; how are they going to do that because the constitution that we are using doesn\u2019t support federalism. How are you going to change that; how are you going to change that fundamental issue of what is it that holds us together as a nation?\n\nSo, you have to get a new constitution and you cannot do as a sitting government; it is not possible because of political interests. You need a mechanism that is not connected to any political party; that doesn\u2019t have that kind of interest and can sit down dispassionately and say, this constitution is faulty; we need a democratic constitution and not the one that was handed over to us by the military. We need to address issues that affect our relationship. What is federalism to us? What is resource control to us? What is regional xenophobia to us? What are the forces militating against the unity and coherence of our federalism? These are things that must be done dispassionately outside the political parties.\n\nWhere and when did this rain start to beat Nigeria that we got to this level that you are talking about?\n\nIt\u2019s been a long time, but we have the tendency to sweep things under the carpet. Our political ancestors, the patriots that handed over democracy to us, made frantic attempts to bring unity to our country, but it was not that possible. Going back to Independence, you will still find out that Nigeria was balkanised along ethnic lines. It was already there and I believe that the patriots were hoping that with time, our people would rise to a place where these cleavages would diminish to a superficial laceration in terms of national integration. But it didn\u2019t happen. Then the military came in and the country became more divided. So, as we progressed, instead of sitting down and stopping the entire process, and say, let us get a holistic approach to governance, people were more eager to be involved in political offices for self aggrandisement and have nothing to do with the nation. So it has steadily degenerated; a downward spiral and that is why we are here today. Thank God that we still have another chance to rectify these aberrations and put things in proper perspective, and that is why I\u2019m here. That is why I\u2019m speaking at this time, asking our people to join hands so that we can take Nigeria back to a place where healing can occur, where we can ameliorate the opinion of the people and they can rise and say, \u2018ok, we still have faith\u2019. It can only be done with an interim government.\n\nIf political parties are not relevant, what will be the vehicle to throw up leaders?\n\nThat is the example I have given you from football situation. For instance, if we don\u2019t have political parties and we don\u2019t have ministers, you don\u2019t have commissioners, what offices will they be running for? There is only one office you can run for, which is that of the president. There will be no governors. What we will have will be people who are elders, tetrarchs ,who are about 80 years old, who are volunteers, vested in the affairs of a particular state. You look at their qualifications, you look at their antecedents; how much they served the country, you collate their names, put them into a box and there is a draw. They are working with the civil service, professional associations who have now been empowered and given legislative powers. Their role is purely supervisory. That way, politics is no longer business. Anyone who is looking for service will be these people in that age or joining an association to make sure that they promote the cause of that association. If we do so, there is no access to the money, and a lot of these people who are in politics today will have to find another profession because politics is the biggest business to them. More so, our political conscience has not been developed enough to follow an American model; that is why we are where we are. We must evolve a system that caters to the cultural sensibilities of our people; understanding how our people are, and knowing that if you give access to funds, governmental monies, you are going to breed more corruption and we are intelligent enough and that is why I\u2019m suggesting this mechanism. If we follow this suggestion you will find out that the people are in charge of their destiny and no one person will come and tell them what to do with the money of a state or how they want to dispense these monies. It will be the responsibility of the people themselves.\n\nWhy must you be the person to run this \u2018interim government\u2019?\n\nI\u2019m the person to run it because you cannot know a product better than the manufacturer. It is a concept I evolved; therefore, you cannot understand it better than I do. Secondly, I have never been a part of this problem; a part of any major political party. If I wanted a political career, I would have joined APC or PDP, but I evolved a political party so that I would have a podium to talk to Nigerians about the future of our country, not for political office. Many of these people whose names are being touted today were neophytes when I ran for president in 2003. The concept of national leadership has not even registered in the metrics of their political thoughts. If I had joined PDP or any other party at that time, I would have been a chieftain by now, but I wasn\u2019t looking for a career, I was looking for a solution for a nation that was gradually disintegrating. That is why I have sat back, prayed about it and came out with a solution. Thirdly, I have paid my dues, denominated in resilience and tenacity; I\u2019m a known face. I\u2019m successful at what I do and Nigerians need someone who has not been a part of this system, who has that compassion and intellectual capacity and understands the pain of the people. I have never been drawn into the vortex of partisan politics, and that is why I believe that I can handle the job.\n\nNow if Nigerians, the legislators and the presidency don\u2019t buy into this your proposal, what does it portend for the country?\n\nIt will bring disaster, catastrophe, calamity and tragedy. You can see where we are headed; the indicators are very clear that if we do not do something now while we have the time, this nation will break into fragments. It could even lead to war because there is so much anger, there is so much resentment. The politicians have divided us into ethnicity and religion. That is why we must do something at this point in time. Only a credible leader can have the kind of support from Nigerian people for this kind of project because they themselves know what is going on. Things are so bad. I have been a pastor for about 35 years, and I work with people and I know the pain, their anguish, the resentment that is growing in the polity; we must do something to assuage the situation. Those who know Chris Okotie know that I only stand on the truth. I believe that as I begin to expatiate and elucidate this concept, our people will listen because they know that is the only way forward. If not we are back to square one. We don\u2019t need a regime change; we need a system change. Nigeria must change its system of operation. That is the only way we can have peace, unity and prosperity.\n\nYou ran for president three times and failed. With this interim government proposal, people would ask, aren\u2019t you trying to get political power now through the backdoor?\n\nIt\u2019s such a jejune \u2018infantility\u2019; that is such a political naivety. If Buhari had run on the platform of Fresh Democratic Party, would he have won an election? No. If former President Olusegun Obasanjo had run on the platform of Justice Party, would he have won the election? No. If former President Goodluck Jonathan had run on the platform of Fresh Democratic Party, would he have won? No, because they understand that politics is a game of numbers. If I wanted a political career, I would have become a member of the dominant parties. Anybody who is making that kind of statement, as far as I\u2019m concerned, is totally illogical. Some people cannot decipher the Chris Okotie enigma and sometimes they articulate incoherent inconsistency because it is not logical. You cannot beat PDP on a platform of a political party that does not have structures. I didn\u2019t go into politics for a political career; I went into politics to teach, to demonstrate to the people that it is possible to be patriotic, to have a nation that understands nationalistic sentiments. That is why I didn\u2019t join those parties. So anybody who makes that kind of statement is na\u00efve. Why are they all struggling to be the flag bearers of APC and PDP? It is for obvious reasons that in today\u2019s politics people don\u2019t vote for personalities, but they vote for parties.\n\nGive us a glimpse of this interim government arrangement?\n\nWe are going to offer the world a new concept of democracy, which is people-oriented, which is a mechanical externalisation of the true definition of that concept. When the Greek called it democracy, they were speaking from two words: Demos \u2013 people and Cratus \u2013 invisible power. That is, when you look at governance, what you see is people and their power. But in Nigeria what you see is the party and that is not democracy. What we are going to do is to bring back the true definition of democracy by giving power to the people. The only way you could do that is to eliminate the legislature. Once we put that into practice, other parts of the world would begin to adopt it. If you take a look at the world today, politics is dominated by the rich. The party concept of politics was introduced by rich men to hoodwink the people into thinking that they were involved in the democratic process. What I\u2019m proposing will demystify this and bring democracy back to the people.\n\nBy the time this your concept is applied, what system of government do you call it \u2013 presidential, parliamentary?\n\nI call it Aboriginal Democracy because it goes back to the roots. This is government from the people for the people with the people. It will be a new concept completely; you have an executive, the judiciary and the people. If you want to become part of the lawmaking process, you join your union or association, but if you want to run for an office you don\u2019t need to join a political party, you just go by the mechanism that would be set up, maybe by the Ministry of Justice or Internal Affairs. If you qualify, your name will be put into a box and a draw is organised. You don\u2019t need to campaign.",

Those that won sporting laurels in various sporting events like the Olympics, Commonwealth Games and subsequent African Cup of Nations will also be included in this Wall of Fame.\n\n\u201cFor the 1980 National Football team referred to above, Air Peace shall sponsor an event where they would be celebrated and honoured.

On the night of celebrations in their honour, Air Peace shall equally give out certain financial rewards to all members of that team including the heirs or spouses of the deceased ones amongst them.\u201d\n\nOnyema noted that sports have become a potent tool not only for national peace, unity, and cohesion but also a powerful channel for international relations and diplomacy.\n\nHe explained that these iconic past sportsmen and women are being honoured in recognition of the powerful tool that football has become in fostering unity in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him, such minor gestures would go a long way to encourage the youth to have faith in the nation, besides encouraging broad nationalism as against ethnic and religious nationalism.\n\nOnyema, through his airline, has been at the forefront of supporting Nigerian sports. In September 2021, Air Peace penned a sponsorship deal with the Nigerian Football Federation, NFF, for the National Teams, as their official carrier.

Why are our plants not generating at fullest capacity? Why are the distribution companies not receiving enough power? We are making so much money in oil and gas, but actually not in power. We have committed over a billion dollars into this.\u201d\n\nHe said since humanity appreciates the contribution of engineers and scientists, they should activate their value to solve the power problem confronting the nation rather than point accusing fingers at the government and individuals.\n\nIn his lecture titled, \u2018Sustainable Development and Energy Generation in Nigeria\u2019 the General Manager (Lagos Region), Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), Olugbenga Ajiboye, emphasised on why there had been collapse of the national grid, saying that there is no agreement between the transmission and distribution companies.\n\n\u201cThere is no concrete agreement between the sector which NEC is trying to make possible by signing an agreement. In a situation where one partner defaults, there is bound to be a system collapse especially when you cannot match the generation with the distribution consumption, there will be deficit of power or imbalance. It will result in frequency swinging or dwindling.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the generating and transmission companies must fulfill their obligations which should be binded by law, adding, \u201cby that sequence, the consumption will balance the generation and there will be minimal disruption to it. We have a legal will to do it which the regulator is working on.\u201d\n\nAjiboye, however, listed some of the challenges affecting electricity availability in Nigeria to include, insufficient gas supply, inadequate infrastructure, ageing equipment, liquidity issues, overloaded transmission network, civil unrest among others.\n\nThe chapter Chairman, Sunday Oluwagbenga Akinbode, said a lot of its members are poised to move the institute forward and solve some of the challenges inherent in the community, adding that with its codes and standards, it will be better positioned.",

          "text": "Chuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday assured that the ongoing voter registration exercise may be extended to at least an additional 30 days.\n\nThis is contrary to the position by the House of Representatives Chairman on Electoral Committee, Aisha Dukku, who said that the exercise will be extended by 60 days.\n\nThe INEC National Commissioner for Information and Chairman Voter Education, Festus Okoye disclosed this while addressing some restive prospective and eligible voters in Port Harcourt, Rivers State.\n\nAccording to Okoye, \u201cWe are going to extend this registration process to make sure that every eligible Nigerian is registered.\u201d\n\nHe lamented the eleventh hour rush by Nigerians in the registration exercise.\n\n\u201cThis voters\u2019 registration started eleven months ago. We started this process on June 28 2021 for online and on July 7 2021, we started the physical registration exercise.\n\n\u201cWe have announced that this exercise will end on June 30, but I am assuring you that this exercise will be extended. We are going to continue to ensure that every eligible Nigerian that shows up for the exercise is registered.\n\n\u201cIf you show up, we are going to register you. But if you have registered before and registered again, you are engaging in an exercise in futility. Whatever you have done is nonsense because when we take this machine to our office, it will dictate that you have registered before and we will cancel your fresh registration,\u201d Okoye said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIf you have registered before we will leave that one and cancel the new one.\n\n\u201cSo, if you have registered before and your PVC is defaced or lost, tell us and we will give you a new PVC.\u201d\n\nOkoye further said, \u201cthose of you, if you answer Philip previously in the past and now use a new name Joseph, when you cross your face, it will come and your efforts will be useless and we will cancel the fresh one.\n\n\u201cWe are going to make sure that the exercise is extended to at least the next 30 days. Every person that wants to vote will be given the opportunity to register. I commend your patience.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, INEC is favourably disposed to an extension of the CVR but will do so in the context of making sure that all those that registered have the opportunity of getting their Permanent Voters Cards ahead of the election.\n\nHowever, he said, \u201cThe Federal High Court sitting in Abuja and presided over by Hon. Justice Mobolaji Olajuwon on the 20th of June 2022 granted an ex-parte application restraining the Commission from stopping the CVR on the30th day of June 2022 or on any other date pending the hearing and determination of the Motion on Notice led by SERAP and other individuals. The Court adjourned to the 29th day of June 2022 for the hearing of the Motion on Notice.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe Commission being a constitutional body and guided by the tenets of the rule of law and due process will comply with the said Court Order pending the hearing and determination of the Motion on Notice.\n\n\u201cThe implication of this is that the registration of voters will continue in all the centres pending the hearing and determination of the issues in the suit,\u201d Okoye stated.\n\nINEC programmed that the voter registration will end on June 30. It had earlier on May 31 this year stopped the online registration of voters.",

          "text": "The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has confirmed the recovery of cash, vehicles and other items worth billions of Naira from a military contractor fronting for former Chief of Army Staff, Tukur Buratai in Abuja.\n\nBuratai, a retired Lieutenant General was the COAS between 2015 and 2021.\n\nAzuka Ogugua, the spokesperson for the commission, disclosed the arrest in a statement on Friday.\n\nOgagua identified the suspect as the Managing Director of K Salam Construction Company Nigeria Limited, Mr. Kabiru Sallau.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how ICPC officials last Thursday invaded a property in Abuja, recovering cash, vehicles and wrist watches worth billions of naira from a man who said they belonged to Buratai.\n\nSources said the anti-graft agency was tipped off about the cash haul by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) during a probe of Kabiru.\n\nSubsequently, the NFIU transferred the matter to ICPC, which deployed its operatives to invade the property in Wuse 2 of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the huge cash was part of the billions of naira earmarked for the purchase of arms and ammunition by the Muhammadu Buhari-led government.\n\n\u201cLast week Thursday, ICPC officials stormed a house in Wuse area of Abuja, beside National Open University and arrested a man, Kabiru Salisu (Sallau) after they saw N850 million cash in the house,\u201d a source had told SaharaReporters on Thursday.\n\n\u201cHe claimed the money belonged to Tukur Buratai who was in Cotonou at that time.\n\n\u201cOfficials of the ICPC took him to an office where another N1 billion in cash was also discovered. Also, bulletproof cars, BMW, G-Wagon worth N450m were recovered.\u201d\n\nReacting in a statement on Friday, Ogugua said acting on intelligence, the commission raided the residence in Wuse 2, Abuja, where the expensive items were found.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe Commission wishes to state that ICPC operatives raided a property in Wuse 2 of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, on Thursday, 16th June, 2022 between 5:00pm and 12:00am in suspicion of money laundering.\n\n\u201cFacts available for the time being indicates that the property is owned by owner of K Salam Construction Company, a military contractor.\n\n\u201cThe Commission recovered money and other items from the property viz. N175,706,500; $220,965; G-Wagon; 2022 editions of BMW and Mercedes Benz cars; customized mobile phones; several designer wrist watches, including three Rolexes, and some property documents.\n\n\u201cThe Commission arrested the Managing Director of K Salam Construction Company Nigeria Limited, Mr. Kabiru Sallau and investigation is ongoing. The Commission is yet to conclude its investigation and prefers not to preempt its outcome and also avoid the frenzy of a media trial.\u201d\n\nA source had earlier said the commission was under pressure to reduce the amount found in the ex-army chief\u2019s house to as low as N30 million.\n\nIn March 2021, Nigeria\u2019s National Security Adviser (NSA), Babagana Monguno revealed that funds running into billions of naira meant for the procurement of arms and ammunition under the past service chiefs were unaccounted for.\n\nHis revelation came a few months after President Buhari replaced Buratai and other service chiefs.\n\nOthers were former Chief of Defence Staff, Gabriel Olonishakin; Chief of Air Staff, Abubakar Sadique and Chief of Naval Staff, Ibok Ibas.\n\nAccording to Monguno, neither the money nor the arms were on the ground upon the resumption of the new service chiefs.\n\n\u201cNow that he (President Buhari) has brought new people (service chiefs), hopefully, they will devise some ways\u2026 I\u2019m not saying the former service chiefs diverted the money, but the money is missing. We don\u2019t know how, and nobody knows for now,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cThe President will surely probe this matter. As we speak, the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum too is also wondering where all the money went. I can assure you the President takes issues of this nature seriously.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that preliminary investigation showed the funds are missing and the equipment is nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cWhen the new service chiefs assumed office, they also said they did see anything on the ground.\u201d\n\nSahara Reporters had in a series of publications in 2016 exposed how Buratai procured expensive assets in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, between 2013 and 2015, from proceeds of crime.\n\nHe and his two wives in 2013 paid the sum of 1,498,534.00 AED (N120 million/$419,000) for the first property, Project TFG Marina Hotel Unit 2711.\n\nSale documents indicated that the first property was handed over to the Buratais on January 13, 2013.\n\nEleven days after he was appointed by President Buhari, the retired Army General made arrangements for the purchase of a second property from the same company in Dubai.\n\nBetween July 24 and August 17, 2015, he paid a total sum of N42.2 million into TFG Sigma 111\u2019s account in Nigeria (Skye Bank 1770380452).\n\nEvidence exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters revealed that Buratai made N10 million payments on July 24 and August 7 respectively.\n\nThree days later, another N10 million was paid into the real estate firm\u2019s account. The phone number on the Skye Bank teller is 08033349740. Saharareporters investigations showed that it belonged to a Nigerian Army Major, Emmanuel G. Adegbola of the Nigerian Army Finance Corps (N/10808).\n\nOn August 17, 2015, the Chief of Army Staff paid the sum of N3,270,000 into the account.\n\nBuratai, who owned up to purchasing the two properties in Dubai, however, claimed that he amassed his wealth through \u201cpersonal savings\u201d and not ill-gotten gains.\n\nHe added he made a lot of money from his snake farm along Keffi-Abuja Highway in Nasarawa, just 50 kilometres from the nation\u2019s capital.",

          "text": "The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has confirmed the recovery of cash, vehicles and other items worth billions of Naira from a military contractor fronting for former Chief of Army Staff, Tukur Buratai in Abuja.\n\nBuratai, a retired Lieutenant General was the COAS between 2015 and 2021.\n\nAzuka Ogugua, the spokesperson for the commission, disclosed the arrest in a statement on Friday.\n\nOgagua identified the suspect as the Managing Director of K Salam Construction Company Nigeria Limited, Mr. Kabiru Sallau.\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how ICPC officials last Thursday invaded a property in Abuja, recovering cash, vehicles and wrist watches worth billions of naira from a man who said they belonged to Buratai.\n\nSources said the anti-graft agency was tipped off about the cash haul by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) during a probe of Kabiru.\n\nSubsequently, the NFIU transferred the matter to ICPC, which deployed its operatives to invade the property in Wuse 2 of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the huge cash was part of the billions of naira earmarked for the purchase of arms and ammunition by the Muhammadu Buhari-led government.\n\n\u201cLast week Thursday, ICPC officials stormed a house in Wuse area of Abuja, beside National Open University and arrested a man, Kabiru Salisu (Sallau) after they saw N850 million cash in the house,\u201d a source had told SaharaReporters on Thursday.\n\n\u201cHe claimed the money belonged to Tukur Buratai who was in Cotonou at that time.\n\n\u201cOfficials of the ICPC took him to an office where another N1 billion in cash was also discovered. Also, bulletproof cars, BMW, G-Wagon worth N450m were recovered.\u201d\n\nReacting in a statement on Friday, Ogugua said acting on intelligence, the commission raided the residence in Wuse 2, Abuja, where the expensive items were found.\n\nThe statement read, \u201cThe Commission wishes to state that ICPC operatives raided a property in Wuse 2 of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, on Thursday, 16th June, 2022 between 5:00pm and 12:00am in suspicion of money laundering.\n\n\u201cFacts available for the time being indicates that the property is owned by owner of K Salam Construction Company, a military contractor.\n\n\u201cThe Commission recovered money and other items from the property viz. N175,706,500; $220,965; G-Wagon; 2022 editions of BMW and Mercedes Benz cars; customized mobile phones; several designer wrist watches, including three Rolexes, and some property documents.\n\n\u201cThe Commission arrested the Managing Director of K Salam Construction Company Nigeria Limited, Mr. Kabiru Sallau and investigation is ongoing. The Commission is yet to conclude its investigation and prefers not to preempt its outcome and also avoid the frenzy of a media trial.\u201d\n\nA source had earlier said the commission was under pressure to reduce the amount found in the ex-army chief\u2019s house to as low as N30 million.\n\nIn March 2021, Nigeria\u2019s National Security Adviser (NSA), Babagana Monguno revealed that funds running into billions of naira meant for the procurement of arms and ammunition under the past service chiefs were unaccounted for.\n\nHis revelation came a few months after President Buhari replaced Buratai and other service chiefs.\n\nOthers were former Chief of Defence Staff, Gabriel Olonishakin; Chief of Air Staff, Abubakar Sadique and Chief of Naval Staff, Ibok Ibas.\n\nAccording to Monguno, neither the money nor the arms were on the ground upon the resumption of the new service chiefs.\n\n\u201cNow that he (President Buhari) has brought new people (service chiefs), hopefully, they will devise some ways\u2026 I\u2019m not saying the former service chiefs diverted the money, but the money is missing. We don\u2019t know how, and nobody knows for now,\u201d he had said.\n\n\u201cThe President will surely probe this matter. As we speak, the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum too is also wondering where all the money went. I can assure you the President takes issues of this nature seriously.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that preliminary investigation showed the funds are missing and the equipment is nowhere to be found.\n\n\u201cWhen the new service chiefs assumed office, they also said they did see anything on the ground.\u201d\n\nSahara Reporters had in a series of publications in 2016 exposed how Buratai procured expensive assets in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, between 2013 and 2015, from proceeds of crime.\n\nHe and his two wives in 2013 paid the sum of 1,498,534.00 AED (N120 million/$419,000) for the first property, Project TFG Marina Hotel Unit 2711.\n\nSale documents indicated that the first property was handed over to the Buratais on January 13, 2013.\n\nEleven days after he was appointed by President Buhari, the retired Army General made arrangements for the purchase of a second property from the same company in Dubai.\n\nBetween July 24 and August 17, 2015, he paid a total sum of N42.2 million into TFG Sigma 111\u2019s account in Nigeria (Skye Bank 1770380452).\n\nEvidence exclusively obtained by SaharaReporters revealed that Buratai made N10 million payments on July 24 and August 7 respectively.\n\nThree days later, another N10 million was paid into the real estate firm\u2019s account. The phone number on the Skye Bank teller is 08033349740. Saharareporters investigations showed that it belonged to a Nigerian Army Major, Emmanuel G. Adegbola of the Nigerian Army Finance Corps (N/10808).\n\nOn August 17, 2015, the Chief of Army Staff paid the sum of N3,270,000 into the account.\n\nBuratai, who owned up to purchasing the two properties in Dubai, however, claimed that he amassed his wealth through \u201cpersonal savings\u201d and not ill-gotten gains.\n\nHe added he made a lot of money from his snake farm along Keffi-Abuja Highway in Nasarawa, just 50 kilometres from the nation\u2019s capital.",

The institutions have repeatedly said the petrol subsidy policy in Nigeria is not targeted at those most in need.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a recent interview, President Muhammadu Buhari said most western countries are equally implementing subsidies.\n\n\u201cWhy would we remove ours now? What is good for the goose is good for the gander!

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Kune, a Kenyan food tech startup that delivered ready-to-eat meals at affordable prices, is closing down today, the company\u2019s founder and CEO Robin Reecht announced.\n\nIn a statement posted to his LinkedIn page, Reecht cited a stifled economy and inflated food prices as circumstances that contributed to Kune\u2019s closure. \u201cWith the current economic downturn and investment markets tightening up, we were unable to raise our next round. Coupled with rising food costs deteriorating our margins, we just couldn\u2019t keep going,\u201d he said.\n\nThe announcement comes just 4 months after the startup began its commercial operations at established meal centers around Nairobi. Around that time, Kune leadership also declared its intentions to raise $3.5 million in its second round of funding.\n\nBut while Kune was well-liked by its customers, the startup\u2019s journey wasn\u2019t without its fair share of controversy. Last June, Reecht faced the mighty lash of Kenyans on Twitter (best known as KoT) after he shared in a TechCrunch interview that he was inspired to launch Kune after taking a trip to Kenya in November 2020 and having trouble finding affordable, ready-to-eat meals.\n\n\u201cAfter three days of coming into Kenya, I asked where I can get great food at a cheap price, and everybody tell [sic] me it\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible because either you go to the street and you eat street food, which is really cheap but with not-so-good quality, or you order on Uber Eats, Glovo or Jumia, where you get quality but you have to pay at least $10.\u201d\n\nReecht, who is white and French, founded Kune just one month later.\n\nKenyans were aggrieved by his comments, and did not hesitate to voice their critiques. They argued that Reecht\u2019s ability to secure funding so quickly was due more to his white privilege than his business plan, which some believed aimed to solve a nonexistent problem. Those discussions gave way to a larger conversation about white privilege and favouritism in tech, as well as Kenya\u2019s neglect of its local founders.\n\nIn his statement, Reecht said that even though Kune had sold more than 55,000 meals and acquired more than 6,000 individual customers and 100 corporate customers since the start of the year, its $3 per meal price point wasn\u2019t enough to sustain its growth.\n\nAddressing Kune\u2019s investors, he said, \u201cNot only did you invest in Kune but you gave us your time, brain-width, connections, and emotional support. I am deeply sorry that Kune\u2019s vision didn\u2019t come true. To betray your confidence is something for which I will never forgive myself.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "These founders are helping companies make decisions with data",
          "text": "On a drab January day in 2018, in Pamplemousses, Mauritius, 2 friends, Joseph Rutankangwa and Eric Sewankambo, sat in Rutakangwa\u2019s apartment and decided to start a company. It wasn\u2019t their first time venturing into business together; only the previous year they\u2019d tried building an aggregator to curate data from various African countries which multinational companies could use. The problem was: there was simply no available data to be gathered. Generally speaking, data about Africa is scarce, and even when it is available, it can be inadequate and outdated.\n\nAt the time they decided to give their business aspirations a second chance together, Rutakangwa and Sewankambo had been consulting for multinational consumer goods companies that were looking to expand into African markets. In their work, they often encountered the data gaps. Government ministries and countries\u2019 chambers of commerce (did not have detailed information about consumer persona and behaviour in Africa\u2019s markets. While these offices might, for example, present data on what percentage of a country had electricity, they had nothing on how many homes exactly had power, or how many of them experienced power cuts each month, or how long these power cuts lasted. A solar company entering into many African markets would thus have little information to work with. Such gaps in the data cost businesses money in wasted marketing efforts, and make it tough for the continent to attract further investment.\n\nRutakangwa understands why these costly business errors occur: the data the multinational companies rely on\u2014often collected by market research firms\u2014is assumed African countries to be monolithic and did not provide companies with enough detail with which to make market expansion decisions.\n\nAnd so, when Rutakangwa and Sewankambo launched Rwazi, a Mauritian-based startup that provides multinational organisations with on-ground data to facilitate effective decision making, they decided that they\u2019d collate data that dealt in the specifics. \u201cI want to know the details,\u201d Joseph tells me, firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to tell me the market share of this [brand] is 75%. What is 75%? Is it 6,255 outlets? Is it 10,800? I don\u2019t want the percentage. I want the exact number, exact location, exact contact, and exact images [of these shops].\u201d\n\nDespite Rutakangwa and Sewankambo understanding the problems with multinational consumer goods companies accessing useful data, figuring out the most effective way to collect this data was initially challenging.\n\nAt first, they tried using retailers and sales reps to collect information. But both groups proved inefficient as they are incentivised to falsify the data\u2014retailers because claiming that they stock products they actually don\u2019t have gets them freebies from companies; and sales reps because success in their jobs meant reporting, always, that their products were in stores.\n\nThey changed their approach. They figured companies were trying to sell to consumers, not retailers or sales reps; only a consumer would be truthful about the availability of a product and their access to it. So, Rutakangwa and Sewankambo employed regular local consumers, called \u201cmappers\u201d, to collect the data from shops and households.\n\nThese mappers collect data within the neighbourhoods closest to them at any given time. Think Uber, but for data collection.\n\nIllustration: For shops, when a mapper signed up to the Rwazi platform receives a mapping order from a toothpaste company to find out how many shops around them sell toothpaste and what brands they carry, the mapper accepts the request, then proceeds to locate and count how many shops in the area sell toothpaste. They also document what brands they stock, and at what prices. For households, the mappers meet consumers in their homes and quiz them on the brand of toothpaste they use, why they use it, their experience using it, what it costs them, and so on.\n\nA mapper can only submit data while they are still at a shop or household. Every shop is already geotagged on the Rwazi platform. When a mapper submits the data, Rwazi verifies the information by checking that the shop or household\u2019s geocoordinates matches the mapper\u2019s current location.\n\n\u201cSynergy\u201d\n\nFor this story, I spoke to Rutakangwa and Sewankambo 3 days apart, but some of the things they told me could easily have been convergent thoughts from 2 people in the same room at the same time. The week of our conversation, they are in Los Angeles participating in the Techstars Accelerator, and they have been stunned by how differently from the rest of the world success for African founders is defined. They have met with Western founders whose startups make up to $3 million in annual revenue but who consider this feat modest. \u201cBack home,\u201d Sewankambo says, \u201cif you\u2019re making $3 million dollars [a year], you\u2019re a conglomerate!\u201d\n\nRutakangwa and Sewankambo have been friends for 7 years, having met as business management undergraduates on the Mauritian campus of the African Leadership University, where Rwazi\u2019s story first began to shapen. Their roles as COO (Sewankambo) and CEO (Rutakangwa) may state sharply defined responsibilities\u2014Sewankambo deals with operations and customer delivery while Rutakangwa\u2019s handles customer acquisition\u2014but they are not fussy about the demarcation. \u201cWe tend to switch, depending on who can do it faster or better,\u201d Sewankambo says. \u201cSometimes, I talk to clients, sometimes he talks to the operations team.\u201d\n\nThey both say \u201csynergy\u201d when describing their partnership, painting a picture of complementariness, where, during conflict, one founder\u2019s scepticism is another\u2019s faith. A few months into Rwazi\u2019s launch, they had begun receiving mapping orders from clients from outside the consumer goods industry\u2014medicine, pharmaceuticals, hospitality, fintech. Sewankambo was concerned about them servicing these orders that had nothing to do with consumer goods as that could mean Rwazi taking on work in industries they had no prior experience in. But Rutakangwa saw things differently: in principle, mapping data for hospitals and pharmacies was the same as mapping for beverage and liquor companies. They ended up accepting these orders, which they claim increased their revenue and client base.\n\nWhere next, after Techstars?By 2050, Africa will make up 25% of the world\u2019s population; Rutakangwa and Sewankambo have this at the back of their minds as they use the access granted by Techstars to court more US-based clients looking to understand consumer habits and trends in African markets, raise seed worth $3 million, and evolve Rwazi\u2019s product by incorporating machine learning and AI into it so it can perform simulations, make forecasts, and generate automatic reports. Today they have 20,000 mappers spread across 60 countries and over 100 cities; by the end of the year, they aim to onboard 1 million mappers spread across their current coverage.\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "title": "Restoring voter enthusiasm in Nigeria\u2019s electoral process",
          "text": "Finally, the primaries are essentially over\u2014barring the races in dispute. Now, it is time for the everyman to get involved. The recent interest in the internal party mechanisms for selecting candidates brought to light a slew of worrying phenomena: the so-called \u2018dollarisation\u2019 of delegates, the role of consensus candidates, et cetera.\n\nThe interest in and criticism of this process augurs well for the next stage of this crucial stage of our democracy as voters take centre stage. Political participation in Nigeria has declined over the last few cycles and off-cycle elections. The Anambra State governorship elections in 2021 recorded a 10 per cent voter turnout. INEC recorded a similar turnout in the Lagos East Senatorial by-election in December 2020. In presidential elections, the decline has been marked, reaching a low of 35% for the 2019 presidential elections.\n\nAt Run To Win, we sought to analyse why this trend has persisted by speaking to young people between the ages of 18-35 in two states, Lagos and Cross River. In face-to-face interviews and focus groups, nearly 1,000 young people were surveyed across both states.\n\nThe main reason young people are not participating in elections? The feeling that their votes do not count. This sentiment is much heard in casual conversation, and their concern reflects the lack of faith in the electoral system to deliver free and fair elections.\n\nRead also: 2023: INEC disproves claim of voter registration centres in Niger Republic\n\nSecondly, becoming a voter is a long, bothersome, inconvenient process for young people. Between that and the long lag between registration and collecting PVCs, it\u2019s understandable why young people don\u2019t pick up their PVCs when they are finally ready. INEC\u2019s attempt to ease the process by introducing online pre-registration was hampered by its inability to deal with the surge of new physical registrations after the drive ended.\n\nWe recommend that INEC restore the online pre-registration portal to ease the pressure on its offices and resources. The commission may also need to consider a small extension to the overall CVR process to allow registration for willing would-be voters. We also suggest a public awareness campaign around the collection of uncollected PVCs, as well as encouraging voter turnout overall by assuring Nigerians that their votes will count.\n\nWhile voter registration drives have been necessary and impactful in the past, voter turnout is the real problem with electoral participation in the country. This problem has not received much attention up to now. Low voter participation indicates that the political system lacks legitimacy, presenting challenges to social cohesion.\n\nAddressing these barriers to increased voter participation will move the country in the right direction on its democratic journey.\n\nRemi Ogunkayo is political director at Run To Win, a non-partisan organisation which aims to increase the participation of young people in every aspect of Nigeria\u2019s political process",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria has continued to print money to finance the federal government\u2019s budget deficit, a development that may undermine its ability to tame inflation, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) has said.\n\nThe EIU noted that the CBN tightened monetary policy with a 150-basis-point hike in the policy rate in May 2022 as inflation stayed on an upward trajectory.\n\nIt said: \u201cExpectations of inflation in Nigeria are understandably high after years of annual price growth above the central bank\u2019s 9 percent target ceiling.\n\n\u201cThe ability of the CBN to tame inflation through raising rates may be undermined by its continued direct financing of the budget deficit.\u201d\n\nThe EIU said building credibility in the target rate had not been a priority in recent years. \u201cThe continued printing of money at the same time as tightening policy would prevent effective control of the price level, and is highly likely,\u201d it added.\n\nIt said CBN\u2019s May policy rate hike followed the onset of a global tightening cycle prompted by the inflationary fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to the EIU, advanced markets are bringing or have brought quantitative easing programmes to a close ahead of interest-rate rises to tackle second-round pass-through effects.\n\n\u201cBy contrast, the CBN has continued to print money for the federal government, whose overdraft facility with the CBN reached N19 trillion ($46 billion) in April 2022, up from N17.4 trillion at end-2021. The CBN is also operating a range of direct lending schemes for the agricultural, manufacturing and energy sectors, currently totalling about N3.6 trillion ($9bn),\u201d it said.\n\nThe EIU said as crude oil production had been underwhelming, the public finances had not benefitted much from crude prices of more than $100/barrel for most of 2022.\n\nIt said: \u201cAt the same time, the authorities are maintaining an immensely expensive petrol subsidy and the fiscal deficit is going to be large by Nigerian standards in 2022.\n\n\u201cAll prudential rules on the government borrowing through the overdraft facility have long been broken, but fiscal responsibility laws to prevent the Treasury from market borrowing in excess of the budget are taken more seriously. The CBN has repeatedly stepped in directly as a lender.\u201d\n\nRead also: CBN faults misleading report on payment of overseas tuition\n\nAccording to the EIU, it seems highly plausible that the CBN will continue financing a widening budget deficit through the overdraft facility.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe cost of the subsidies for 2022 keeps mounting as petrol prices move higher internationally, with the annual projection having already risen from N3 trillion at the start of 2022 (a forecast from the national oil company that even the finance minister thought curiously high at the time) to over N4 trillion as announced by the president in early April.\n\n\u201cWorld crude prices have climbed another 20 percent higher since then. The subsidy bill comes directly out of government revenue so money printed by the CBN would mostly be for other government purchases.\n\n\u201cIf the overdraft gets larger, it would be a clear sign that the CBN is politically unable or unwilling to take a clear stance on inflation and the anchoring of expectations.\u201d\n\nThe EIU noted that Nigeria\u2019s inflation hit 17.7 percent in May in line with its full-year forecast for 2022, saying insecurity in most of northern Nigeria continued to weigh on supply chains.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war and a lingering but ebbing COVID\u201119 pandemic are external interruptions, it said.\n\n\u201cThe EIU does not expect inflation to return to the 9 percent inflation target ceiling in 2022\u201126, partly because of policy inconsistencies,\u201d it said. \u201cOur current projection for average inflation in 2023 is 13.4 percent but price growth could run higher depending on how far the CBN deviates from its stated policy of monetary tightening.\u201d",

          "text": "Recently, there have been uproars on and off social media about Ike Ekweremadu, former deputy senate president and his wife, Beatrice, who were arrested by the United Kingdom Police over alleged child trafficking and conspiracy to harvest an organ of a child.\n\nOrgan trafficking sometimes known as transplant tourism describes the commercialism that drives the illegal organ trade.\n\nThe United States National Organ and Transplant Act of 1984 lists human organ as the human kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, bone marrow, cornea, eye, bone and skin or any subpart thereof and any other human organ or any subpart thereof, including that derived from a fetus. A report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) stated that children in extremely low-income families are particularly vulnerable to organ transplants, including in countries in West Africa, making up one of every three victims worldwide\n\nAccording to the United Network for Organ Sharing, organ trafficking is defined as the purchase of a transplanted organ abroad while bypassing laws, rules or processes of any or all countries involved.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), organ trade is the buying and selling of organs outside of national medical systems and for profit. Global Financial Integrity (GFI) estimates that 10 percent of all organ transplants including lungs, heart and liver, are done via trafficked organs.\n\nHowever, the most prominent organs that are traded illicitly are the kidneys, with WHO estimating that 10,000 kidneys are traded on the black market worldwide annually, or more than one every hour.\n\nRead also; NYSC DG solicits support of stakeholders for its health initiative\n\nIn Nigeria, the most trafficked organ is the kidney. From the year 2015 to 2020, a total of 651 kidneys were transplanted illegally from the country, Global Database on Donation and Transplantation reported.\n\nIt is estimated that the illegal organ trade conservatively generates approximately $840 million to $1.7 billion annually, according to GFI.\n\nGFI estimates that prices paid to individuals for their organs vary significantly. For kidneys, payments reportedly range from hundreds of dollars to individuals from less developed countries to up to $20,000-$30,000 in more developed countries.\n\nIn 2020, the Global Database on Donation and Transplantation said 129,681 organs were transplanted annually. From the total sum, 36,125 were harvested from deceased donors and 15 transplants were done per hour.\n\nMost countries forbid the sale and purchase of organs except Iran. The middle eastern country is the only place in the world where citizens are allowed to buy and sell their organs legally.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, \u201corgan trafficking may be facilitated by corrupt officials or criminal groups and may include brokers or other middlemen who connect individuals providing the organ with prospective recipients, negotiate the price, and identify medical facilities where the transplant can occur\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, even with the estimated flow of funds crossing $1 billion annually, it is difficult for both the law enforcement agents and anti-money laundering professionals to detect related financial activity, according to a report by the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS).",

We have witnessed the deterioration of democracy in established democracies, like the United States. Democratic norms are faltering as autocratic leaders and politicians with subversive intentions have found ways to use mainstream and social media to control cognitive outcomes through disinformation and manipulation.\n\nDemocracy presupposes the existence of an educated electorate, who are able to evaluate information. Indeed democracy thrives when there is a well-informed and engaged citizenry. However, for a well-informed and engaged citizenry to exist, the media must not just inform the public, but analyze and present information and unbiased date that can and should shape policy.\n\nThe AUN-Premium Times Data Hub is is a unique collaboration between higher education and media to inject more data-driven analysis into civic discussions and journalism. The Development Hub will use data and analysis to build an evidence base for change.\n\nThe purpose of this Hub is to present data and analysis and a platform for discussion on every major sphere of development, including gender, poverty, education, health, economic growth and employment, governance and democracy, peace and security and the role of technology.

It is the political parties themselves that has been given the locus to submit this particular list and in this case, there is no personal interference between the commission and the political parties.\n\n\u201cWe open the portal \u2014 what we called \u2018candidate nomination portal\u2019 \u2014 and we give an access code to the national chairman of each of the political parties that conducted primaries with which they upload the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates.\n\n\u201cSo, if a political party has uploaded the list and personal particulars of a candidate that did not emerge from valid party primary, INEC is not under a constitutional and legal obligation to publish the particulars of such a candidate.\u201d\n\nOkoye added that a candidate who was validly nominated at a primary, but whose name was excluded by the party, can seek redress from a competent court.\n\nHe also said the list published on Friday is not the final document for the 2023 polls, adding that the final list will be published at a later date.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government, through African Network for Economic and Environment Justice (ANEEJ), on Thursday, said that the $322.5million recovered Abacha loot, has been shared to 1.9million poor and vulnerable Nigerians.\n\nThe said funds were stolen by former Military Head of State, Gen Sani Abacha and were recovered between 2018 and 2022.\n\nBefore making the disbursement, the money accrued an interest of $11 million where it was deposited.\n\nExecutive Director of ANEEJ, Rev. David Ugolor made this disclosure while briefing Journalists on, in Abuja.\n\nHe said an interest of $11 million accrued from the money where it was saved and it was disbursed to around 1.9 million poor Nigerians selected without political bias.\n\n\u201cNo politically motivated data was used in selecting the beneficiaries; the National Social Register was used to determine those who will benefit and the register is updated regularly to remove those who have died,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cthe Abacha loot that was recovered have been exhausted, we have a responsibility to inform Nigerians and then to make sure to tell them what the money was used for.\n\n\u201cIt is a very controversial issue that people sit down at home and begin to point fingers that Abacha\u2019s money has been stolen. What we have done with this monitoring is very ground breaking.\u201d\n\nUgolor, however, expressed concern that when the federal government stopped disbursing the funds to the beneficiaries in 2021, four states which are Kebbi, Ondo, Edo and Enugu were excluded .\n\nHe said updates on the disbursement of the Conditional Cash Transfer showed that four states had been left out since 2019 due to technical reason.\n\nHe said: \u201cfour states have not been benefiting from the distribution of these N5,000, so we started an advocacy and the advocacy yielded the results and the government responded through the National Cash Transfer Office (NCTO) and we have since paid all these four states. The four states are Edo, Ondo, Kebi and Enugu.\u201d\n\nIn December 2017, Switzerland returned USD322.5 million of stolen funds (illicitly acquired by the late General Sani Abacha\u2019s family) to the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Finance, however, requested that the funds be used to finance the $500 million IDA-financed National Social Safety Net Program (NASSP) in the form of Conditional Cash Transfers to poor and vulnerable Nigerians, which is one of the poverty alleviation programmes under the National Social Investment Programme.\n\nA Swiss court in March 2015 ordered that the funds be repatriated on the condition that the World Bank monitors their use. Consequently, a Memorandum of understanding was entered into between the Nigeria government, the Swiss government, and the World Bank, which also identified Network on Asset Recovery (NAR) made up of civil society organizations led by ANEEJ as an independent monitor for the purpose of providing an independent report on the use of the funds.\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Justice then developed and finalized terms of reference for civil society organizations monitoring the $322.5million recovered Abacha loot and recognized ANEEJ as one of the CSOs representing the NAR in interactions with the Federal Government of Nigeria. The task was to monitor and report on the use of the funds to targeted beneficiaries.\n\nIn 2018, ANEEJ commenced the monitoring exercise under the Monitoring of Recovered Assets in Nigeria through the Transparency and Accountability (MANTRA) project. Through the MANTRA project, ANEEJ worked with six regional partners, and engaged a total of 35 CSOs and over 500 monitors for the exercise in six geopolitical zones of the country.\n\nThe exercise produced the first disbursement report of the $322.5million covering the August/September 2018 payment round to beneficiaries in 19 States.",

They walked slowly with radiant smiles and laughter whilst a convoy of cars followed them from behind.\n\n\u201cIt was the dramatic return of a great and beautiful queen who was simply resplendent and who shone as brightly as the morning star.\n\n\u201cThere are some moments that words cannot capture or express and this was one of them. After two long years of contentious silence and acrimonious separation, she graced us with her presence and came home,\u201d he said.\n\nThe All Progressives Congress chieftain further said, \u201cIt was joy all around to see the return of this great lioness. Every single one of the 60 people that live and work in our home was happy to see her and some even shed a few secret tears of joy.\n\n\u201cMama Aragorn displayed such courage, grace, dignity, and class. This was a moment that I shall cherish for many years. This was a triumph for all lovers of peace and sons and daughters of righteousness.\n\n\u201cThis was the day that the power of God was made manifest, that joy came to Zuma close, and that the Lion of Aso Drive roared in glory, victory, power, and strength.\n\n\u201cThis was a moment that proved beyond all reasonable doubt that patience, restraint, understanding and peace bring nothing but joy and blessings.\n\n\u201cThis was a moment when light overcame darkness and when the secret prayers of four handsome little Princes were answered.\n\n\u201cThis was a moment when love, mutual respect, truth, and mutual forgiveness triumphed and Satan was put to shame.\n\n\u201cThanks for coming, Mama Aragorn. We love and appreciate you. Always did, always will. And though we have gone our separate ways the bond and cord that exists between us through our four beautiful boys can never be broken.\n\n\u201cI also offer my thanks to my loyal and faithful wife and a true Daughter of Zion, Mama Remi, and to Mama Folake, Mama Arwen, my beautiful daughters Folake and Remi, my son Nicholas and my entire family and household for their collective and unconditional love, understanding, resilience, loyalty, support, and patience.\n\n\u201cYou stood firm, strong, and bold and you kept encouraging me even through the raging storm and darkest moments. Love conquered all and saw us through and so it shall continue to be.\n\n\u201cFrom generation to generation our circle of love, our fellowship, our family, our children, and our loved ones shall rise and go from strength to strength.\n\n\u201cIn every situation and circumstance, we shall prevail and the God that we serve shall never forsake us.

If you look at the reports we have been receiving from all over the nation on the issue of banditry, insurgency, kidnapping, herders/farmers clashes, there are daily occurrences.\n\n\u201cWe have had issues of jungle justice in the past week and those involved were lynched. But why did I call this expanded meeting? I went to Owo in Ondo where a Catholic church was attacked. I looked at the location of the church itself and I saw that it is inside the community, which shows that if they had had a rapid reaction, they would have caught those people responsible for the attack.\n\nEarlier, the state\u2019s Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Matters, Chief Bayo Lawal, expressed confidence that the meeting would proffer solutions to the security challenges in the state.",

          "text": "Lincoln University, United Kingdom has banned Ike Ekweremadu from his duties as a visiting professor pending the conclusion of the organ harvesting allegation leveled against him.\n\nAccording to a report by Daily Mail UK, the ban was imposed by the institution following the arrest and subsequent arraignment of Ekweremadu and Beatrice, his wife, at the Uxbridge Magistrate Court in London for alleged plans to harvest the kidney of Ukpo Nwamini David, a minor, on June 23.\n\nDavid was said to have been trafficked using a fake passport.\n\nEkweremadu and his wife are accused of facilitating David\u2019s entry into the UK to transplant his kidney into their daughter who is suffering from kidney failure. The former Deputy Senate President of Nigeria was recently appointed a visiting professor of Corporate and International Linkages by the British school.\n\n\u201cVisiting professors are often, as is in this case, non-resident at the university, unpaid and advisory,\u201d a Lincoln University spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned about the nature of these allegations, but as this is an active police investigation, we cannot comment further at this stage.\n\n\u201cWhilst this matter is subject to investigation, this person will not be undertaking any duties as visiting professor at Lincoln.\u201d\n\nDavid claimed he did not know he was in the United Kingdom to donate a kidney until he went for a hospital appointment with the Ekweremadus. A doctor at the Royal Free Hospital in Camden, London, was concerned that David might not be aware he was a kidney donor. The doctor also doubted that the minor was 21 as his passport claimed.\n\nWhile appearing in court on Thursday, the senator and his wife, who is a medical doctor, however, denied trafficking David to the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cThe victim was 15. In Nigeria, he was approached by both defendants. He was homeless on the streets of Lagos. They deceived him and promised him a better life in the UK. He was given a passport for a 41-year-old. The passport was illegally obtained by these defendants,\u201d Damla Ayas, the prosecutor, told the court during the couple\u2019s first hearing.\n\n\u201cHe was provided with a medical travel visa saying the purpose of the travel was to provide medical treatment for the defendants\u2019 daughter who was undergoing dialysis about several health issues.\n\n\u201cIt was premeditated; it was planned. Blood tests were obtained in Nigeria and he traveled to the UK in February this year.\n\n\u201cHe was taken to several medical appointments, in particular, a medical appointment at the Royal Free Hospital, and was spoken to by a consultant about the organ harvesting for a kidney transplant.\n\n\u201cThe consultant was concerned about his actual age and was concerned he was not aware he was the donor of the kidney. He only found out that the purpose of his visit was for an organ transplant when he visited the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe Ekweremadus was arrested at Heathrow Airport as they attempted to board a plane to Turkey.\n\nDavid is now under the care of safeguarding authorities and the Metropolitan Police.\n\nFresh twist\n\nDavid\u2019s (the young man who was to donate a kidney to Sonia , daughter of Senator Ekweremadu) passport has emerged, indicating that he is 21 years old.\n\nAccording to information on the data page of Nwamini\u2019s international passport, which Ekweremadu provided in an introductory letter in the medical visa application submitted to the British High Commission in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital, he was born on October 12, 2000.\n\nThe date of issuance of the passport is indicated as November 4, 2021 while his date of birth is October 12, 2000. This puts the age of the passport holder in question at 21.\n\nBut under British law, being above 18 is not enough to be an organ donor, as the question of consent is another burden the Ekweremadus will have to discharge.\n\nYet, questions would remain with respect to whether the birth date on the passport is indeed his real age.",

It is the political parties themselves that has been given the locus to submit this particular list and in this case, there is no personal interference between the commission and the political parties.\n\n\u201cWe open the portal \u2014 what we called \u2018candidate nomination portal\u2019 \u2014 and we give an access code to the national chairman of each of the political parties that conducted primaries with which they upload the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates.\n\n\u201cSo, if a political party has uploaded the list and personal particulars of a candidate that did not emerge from valid party primary, INEC is not under a constitutional and legal obligation to publish the particulars of such a candidate.\u201d\n\nThe INEC spokesperson added that a candidate who was validly nominated at a primary, but whose name was excluded by the party, can seek redress from a competent court.\n\nHe also said the list published on Friday is not the final document for the 2023 polls, adding that the final list will be published at a later date.",

          "text": "The Supreme Court has struck out a suit by President Muhammadu Buhari and the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami SAN seeking to void the provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022.\n\nIn a judgment on Friday, a seven-member panel of the apex court, headed by Justice Musa Dattijo Mohammed, was unanimous in holding that President Buhari, having participated in the making of the law by assenting to it, could not turn around to fault its provisions.\n\nThe court upheld all the grounds of objection raised by the National Assembly, through its lawyer, Dr. Olukayode Ajulo, against the competence of the suit marked: SC/504/2022.\n\nThe President and the AGF had through their Lawyer, Lateef Fagbemi SAN argued among others, that Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act was made in excess of the constitutional powers of the National Assembly and therefore, unconstitutional and illegal.\n\nThe Supreme Court, however, agreed with Ajulo that the suit is not one of such cases in respect of which the court\u2019s original and additional jurisdictions could be invoked under Section 23(2)(1) of the Constitution and Section 1(1)(a) of the Supreme Court (Additional Jurisdiction) Act 2002.\n\nThe court faulted the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the suit was informed by the National Assembly\u2019s failure to give effect to President Buhari\u2019s request that Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act be deleted for allegedly offending the provisions of the Constitution.\n\nThe apex court held that the President lacked the constitutional or legal rights or power to request or compel the National Assembly to amend or make an Act.\n\nIn the lead judgment, Justice Emmanuel Agim noted that the suit touched on the essence of the powers given to the President by Section 58(4) of the 1999 Constitution, which he exercised by participating in the making of the E. A. 2022.\n\nJustice Agim held that since the President aided the creation of the Act, with the support of the AGF, both plaintiffs could not turn around to query its legality.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe Constitution did not provide for the involvement of the court by the President after exercising his powers under Section 58(4) of the Constitution one way or the other.\n\n\u201cI agree with the argument by the counsel to the National Assembly (Ajulo) that this suit is reprobation of what the first plaintiff (the President) had approbated, and this cannot be allowed in law.\n\n\u201cHaving assented to the Electoral Bill 2022 and thereby accepted that it has become law, he cannot, therefore, bring a suit, contending that the actions resulting from his assent is not constitutional, desirable and justifiable, thereby detracting from his assent.\n\n\u201cAs it is, one of the cumulative requirements in Section 1(1)(a) of the Supreme Court (Additional Jurisdiction) Act 2002 for the invocation of the additional jurisdiction of this court to entertain an originating suit between the President and the National Assembly does not exist.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiffs have no legally enforceable legal right or power that gives life to questions raised for determination in the originating summons, and that can be protected or enforced by the reliefs claimed for.\n\n\u201cThe dispute, in this case, does not involve any question or include the existence or extent of any legal right to the plaintiffs. Therefore, this suit cannot be entertained by this court in the exercise of its additional jurisdiction under Section 1(1)(a) of the Supreme Court (Additional Jurisdiction) Act 2002\n\n\u201cEven the original jurisdiction vested in this court by Section 23(2)(1) of the 1999 Constitution to determine disputes between the federation and the state or between states cannot be invoked unless the dispute involves any question on which the existence of a legal right depends.\n\n\u201cThere is no part of the Constitution that makes the exercise of the legislative power of the National Assembly subject to the direction and control of the President of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe first plaintiff\u2019s (the President) written request to the National Assembly to amend the Electoral Act 2022 by deleting Section 84(12) therein, is a violation of Section 4(1) of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cThis suit, which was filed in response to the refusal of the National Assembly to grant the said request is an employment of the judicial process to help realise the said violation.\n\n\u201cThe court cannot be engaged in this kind of unconstitutional and illegal enterprise. The suit is, therefore, an abuse of the judicial process,\u201d Justice Agim said.\n\nHe further agreed with Ajulo that the court lacked the jurisdiction to entertain the suit, and added that there was no useful purpose to be served by determining the case on the merit.\n\nOther members of the panel \u2013 Justices John Okoro, Amina Augie, Mohammed Garba, Abdu Aboki and Ibrahim Saulawa \u2013 agreed with the lead judgment.",

          "text": "A consultant working in a NHS hospital refused to remove a vital organ from a 15-year-old allegedly trafficked to London from the streets of Lagos by the former deputy president of the Nigerian Senate and his wife, a court has heard.\n\nThe doctor at the Royal Free in Camden became suspicious about whether the alleged victim was aware he was the donor of the kidney and whether he was 41 as his passport claimed.\n\nIke Ekweremadu, 60, and Beatrice Ekweremadu, 55, are accused of taking the homeless youngster to the UK from Nigeria to transplant his organs into their daughter who is suffering from kidney failure.\n\nThe 15-year-old was given the passport of a 41-year-old in order to get into the UK, but did not know he was there to donate a kidney until he went on a hospital appointment in London, a court heard on Friday.\n\nAfter he arrived in the capital in February he had a string of medical appointments about kidney donation, but a consultant at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, North London, became concerned about the boy\u2019s real age and if he knew he was there to donate an organ, it is alleged.\n\nMr Ekweremadu has been an elected senator at the Abuja-based parliament since 2003 after moving into politics after years as a lawyer. His wife, five years his junior, is an academic and doctor and also a major public figure in Nigeria. They are believed to have four adult children. Both deny trafficking the boy.\n\nProsecutor Damla Ayas told Uxbridge Magistrates Court yesterday: \u2018The victim was 15. In Nigeria he was approached by both defendants. He was homeless on the streets of Lagos. They deceived him and promised him a better life in the UK. He was given a passport for a 41-year-old. The passport was illegally obtained by these defendants.\n\nHe was provided with a medical travel visa saying the purpose of the travel was to provide medical treatment for the defendants\u2019 daughter who was undergoing dialysis in relation to a number of health issues.\n\n\u2018It was premeditated, it was planned. Blood tests were obtained in Nigeria and he travelled to the UK in February this year.\n\n\u2018He was taken to several medical appointments in particular a medical appointment at the Royal Free Hospital and was spoken to by a consultant about the organ harvesting for a kidney transplant.\n\n\u2018The consultant was concerned about his actual age and was concerned he was not aware he was the donor of the kidney. He only found out that the purpose of his visit was for an organ transplant when he visited the hospital\u2019.\n\nPolice were alerted to potential offences under modern slavery laws last month.\n\nEkweremadu has been in the UK for at least the past fortnight having met with members of the Nigerian community in Britain in Lincoln around ten days ago.\n\nHe tweeted: \u2018It was a pleasure and an honour to receive a letter of appointment by the University of Lincoln, UK, as Visiting Professor of Corporate and International Linkages. I also got a highly treasured gift \u2013 a copy of the Magna Carta. It was created in 1215, about 807 years ago\u2019.\n\nThey arrested the couple two days ago at Heathrow Airport as they attempted to board a plane to Turkey \u2013 where it was suggested that the procedure could take place \u2013 the court heard.\n\nEkweremadu, 60, is said to have had \u00a320,000 on him at the time of his arrest, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe child is now under the care of safeguarding authorities and the Metropolitan Police, officials say.\n\n(Dailymail)\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Supreme Court on Friday struck out the suit challenging section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 banning political appointees from voting at the primaries of political parties, for being incompetent and lacking in merit.\n\nThe Attorney-General of the Federation/Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, on behalf of the federal government, had filed the suit on the grounds that it violates the rights of political appointees and that it is in conflict with provisions of the constitution.\n\nThe section reads: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nIn a counter-affidavit filed by the parliament, the lawmakers argued that the constitution empowers them to make laws, and therefore, urged the Apex Court to strike out the suit instituted by President Buhari and AGF.\n\nThe apex court, in a unanimous decision described the suit as an abuse of court process and subsequently struck it out.\n\nAccording to Justice Musa Mohammed-Dittjo, who led a seven-man panel of the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs having earlier assented to the said section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022, cannot turn around to approach the court to strike it down.\n\nThe apex court faulted the federal government\u2019s request on the grounds that, \u201cthere is no provision in the Constitution that vests the President the power to challenge the constitutionality or desirability of a legislation after he has assented or denied his assent\u201d, especially in the instant case.\n\nThe panel in the unanimous judgment delivered by Justice Emmanuel Agim, agreed and upheld the submission of counsel to the National Assembly, Kayode Ajulo, that the suit is not one of such cases in respect of which the court\u2019s original and additional jurisdictions could be invoked under Section 23(2)(1) of the Constitution and Section 1(1)(a) of the Supreme Court (Additional Jurisdiction) Act 2002.\n\nThe apex court also disagreed with the plaintiffs that the suit was informed by the National Assembly\u2019s failure to give effect to President Buhari\u2019s request that Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act be deleted for allegedly offending the provisions of the Constitution.\n\nAccording to Justice Agim, the suit touched on the essence of the powers given to the President by Section 58(4) of the 1999 Constitution, which he exercised by participating in its making.\n\nJustice Agim held that since the President aided the creation of the Act, with the support of the AGF, both plaintiffs could not turn around to question its legality.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe Constitution did not provide for the involvement of the court by the President after exercising his powers under Section 58(4) of the Constitution one way or the other.\n\n\u201cI agree with the argument by the counsel to the National Assembly (Ajulo) that this suit is a reprobation of what the first plaintiff (the President) had approbated, and this cannot be allowed in law.\n\n\u201cHaven assented to the Electoral Bill 2022 and thereby accepted that it has become law, he cannot therefore bring a suit, contending that the act resulting from his assent is not constitutional, desirable and justifiable, thereby retracting from his assent.\n\n\u201cAs it is, one of the cumulative requirements in Section 1(1)(a) of the Supreme Court (Additional Jurisdiction) Act 2002 for the invocation of the additional jurisdiction of this court to entertain an originating suit between the President and the National Assembly does not exist.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiffs have no legally enforceable legal right or power that gives life to questions raised for determination in the originating summons, and that can be protected or enforced by the reliefs claimed for.\n\n\u201cThe dispute in this case does not involve any question or include the existence or extent of any legal right to the plaintiffs. Therefore, this suit cannot be entertained by this court in the exercise of its additional jurisdiction under Section 1(1)(a) of the Supreme Court (Additional Jurisdiction) Act 2002.\n\n\u201cThere is no part of the Constitution that makes the exercise of the legislative power of the National Assembly subject to the direction and control of the\n\nPresident of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe first plaintiff\u2019s (the President) written request to the National Assembly to amend the Electoral Act 2022 by deleting Section 84(12) therein, is a violation of Section 4(1) of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe court cannot be engaged in this kind of unconstitutional and illegal enterprise. The suit is therefore an abuse of the judicial process.\u201d\n\nHe further agreed with Ajulo that the court lacked the jurisdiction to entertain the suit, and added that there was no useful purpose to be served by determining the case on the merits.\n\nOther members of the panel \u2013 Justices John Okoro, Amina Augie, Mohammed Garba, Abdu Aboki and Ibrahim Saulawa \u2013 agreed with the lead judgment.\n\nPresident Buhari had in February this year signed the amended Electoral Act, 2022 with a caveat that the National Assembly deletes the said section in the interest of deepening the nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nAlthough, the National Assembly had declined the president\u2019s request, it was not until Justice Inyang Ekwo of a Federal High Court in Abuja, restrained the lawmakers from acceding to the president\u2019s request.\n\nThe restraining order followed the suit and an exparte application filed by the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) asking the court to forbid the lawmakers from deleting the said section on the grounds that only a competent court can take such action.\n\nBefore the federal government\u2019s suit at the apex court, two separate individuals had approached both the Federal High Courts in Ibadan and Umuahia requesting the court to strike down the section for breaching the Constitution, adding that the constitution had already taken care of the qualification and disqualification of persons seeking political offices.\n\nWhile the Ibadan division of the Federal High Court, dismissed the suit on the grounds of jurisdiction because the plaintiff lacked the requisite locus standi to initiate the suit in the first place, the court in Umuhia, agreed with the plaintiff and ordered the striking down of the section and in addition ordered the federal government to delete it from the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, the Court of Appeal in a judgment, set aside the decision of the Umuahia Federal High Court for want of jurisdiction, but agreed that Section 84(12) was unconstitutional and discriminated against a certain class of citizens (the political appointees).\n\nFollowing the conflicting decisions and confusion the three judgments of the Federal High Court and Court of Appeal had created, the federal government accordingly approached the apex court for an interpretation of the said section.\n\nHouse: Judgement is Victory for Democracy\n\nThe House of Representatives has hailed the Supreme Court for striking out the suit seeking to void the provision of section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nSpeaking to THISDAY, the House Spokesman, Hon. Benjamin Kalu described the judgement as \u201cunequivocally lucid, a victory for the advancement of democracy and the nation\u2019s rule of law.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed the legislative supremacy of the National Assembly, and has also done that in the spirit of doctrine of separation of powers, understanding that the efficiency of government will be driven by this democratic principle where every arm stays within the parameters of their mandate and to become the best in their assignment.\n\nThe House Spokesman added: \u201cWe have not lost sleep from the time this matter went to the Supreme Court for interpretation, because we knew that what we put together was in consultation with the public that gave us their mandate. And what we came out with was a reflection of the consultation we had with the Nigerian people. It is all about advancing our democracy.\n\n\u201cJust like the mantra of the House has always been, \u201cNation Building a Joint Task\u201d the supreme court has restored the confidence of Nigerians in participatory democracy with the integrity of this judgement, delivered without fear or favor, but with Nigeria and Nigerians at the center of it all.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has reaffirmed the legislative supremacy of the National Assembly, and has also done that in the spirit of doctrine of separation of powers, understanding that the efficiency of government will be driven by this democratic principle where every arm stays within the parameters of their mandate and to become the best in their assignment.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, the Supreme Court has laid their own brick in the efforts towards electoral reform by this judgement. They have added their own bricks to Nation building through the electoral reform and electoral act 2022. So we are glad, and I\u2019m sure Nigerians ought to be glad.\u201d\n\nAlex Enumah and Udora Orizu in Abuja",

          "text": "The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Friday published the particulars of the presidential candidates, vice presidential candidates, senatorial and House of Representatives candidates for the 2023 elections with the names of Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan and that of the former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, missing on the senatorial list.\n\nAlso Friday, INEC explained why some of the names submitted by the political parties were missing from the list published by the commission.\n\nLawan, Akpabio and Umahi, had been listed by the All Progressives Congress as candidates for Yobe North, Akwa Ibom North-west, and Ebonyi South senatorial districts, respectively.\n\nAll three had also contested the APC presidential ticket and lost.\n\nBut the leadership of the party decided to compensate them with the senatorial tickets in a manner not transparent.\n\nIt is believed that the three men were excluded on the list placed in various constituencies of the elective positions, because they did not emerge through validly conducted primary elections.\n\nLawan, who obviously did not participate in the Yobe North primary election had his name sent to INEC by the APC at the expense of Bashir Machina, who won the primary.\n\nIn Akwa Ibom State, an earlier primary election held on May 27 had produced Udom Ekpoudom, a retired Deputy Inspector-General of Police.\n\nBut the APC dumped Ekpoudom and allowed an illegal fresh primary that produced Akpabio.\n\nUmahi also had a primary election that produced his brother cancelled for a fresh one, but it was not recognized by INEC.\n\n\u201cLawan, Umahi and Akpabio are not on the list. I can confirm that to you.\n\nThey did not emerge through valid primaries and so, we can\u2019t accommodate them,\u201d a top INEC official told THISDAY Friday night.\n\nEkpoudom and Machina were also not listed by INEC for the elections.\n\nSpeaking Friday on a television programme, INEC\u2019s National Commissioner, Festus Okoye, said the commission was not under obligation to publish the names of candidates submitted by political parties if there are questions over the validity of primaries featuring such candidates.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you look at section 29 (1) of the Electoral Act 2022. Section 29 says \u2018every political party shall not later than 180 days before the date appointed for a general election under this act submit to the commission in the prescribed forms, the list of the candidates they are proposing to support at the election, who must have emerged from valid primaries conducted by the political parties.\n\n\u201cThe commission does not submit the list of candidates. It is the political parties themselves that has been given the locus to submit this particular list and in this case, there is no personal interference between the commission and the political parties.\n\n\u201cWe open the portal \u2014 what we called \u2018candidate nomination portal\u2019 \u2014 and we give an access code to the national chairman of each of the political parties that conducted primaries with which they upload the list and personal particulars of their nominated candidates.\n\n\u201cSo, if a political party has uploaded the list and personal particulars of a candidate that did not emerge from valid party primary, INEC is not under a constitutional and legal obligation to publish the particulars of such a candidate.\u201d\n\nThe INEC spokesperson added that a candidate who was validly nominated at the primary but whose name was excluded by the party can seek redress from a competent court.\n\nHe also said the list published on Friday was not the final document for the 2023 polls, adding that the final list will be published at a later date.\n\nMeanwhile, INEC on Friday released the formal report on APC Yobe North Senatorial primary, confirming that Lawan did not participate in the primary held May 28 in Gashua.\n\nThe APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, had last Monday, while presenting the Ekiti State governor-elect (Biodun Oyebanji) to President Muhammadu Buhari, insisted that Lawan participated and won the primary election.\n\nBut INEC, in the Certified True Copy of the Yobe North senatorial primary election report issued to Bashir Machina, did not list Lawan as one of the participants and stated that Machina won primary election.\n\nThe INEC\u2019s report, sighted by THISDAY in Abuja on Friday, indicated that Machina scored 289 votes from the 300 delegates that took part in the election.\n\nThe report dated June 23, 2022, did not corroborate claims by Adamu that Lawan won the ticket.\n\nThe report was prepared by the Resident Electoral Commissioner in the Yobe State through the acting Head of Department of EPM.\n\nThe report read, \u201cThe Senatorial Primary for zone \u2018C\u2019 comprising Bade, Yusufari, Jakusko, Nguru, Karasuwa and Machina local government areas respectively.\n\n\u201cThe primary was held at the Government House in Gashua, the headquarters of Bade Local Government Area.\n\n\u201cThe Primary started by 11am as scheduled. Security agents and respective electoral officers of the affected local government areas were all present at the venue.\n\n\u201cThe primary was conducted by one Alhaji Danjuma Isah Munga.\n\n\u201cThe primary started with opening prayer from the Secretary of the Planning Committee, Alhaji Lawan Modu-Sheriff.\u201d\n\nThe results by INEC showed that 300 delegates were present and dully accredited.\n\nIt also indicated that the poll was conducted by open ballot.\n\nMachina had last Monday vowed not to step down for the Senate President, insisting that he won the primary and that he remained the candidate of the APC for the Yobe North Senatorial District for the 2023 National Assembly election.\n\nAdamu claimed that a primary was held and that Lawan purportedly emerged winner.\n\nInvestigation by THISDAY Friday revealed that Machina would file a suit to defend his alleged stolen mandate at a Yobe High Court next Monday.\n\nLawan lost the APC presidential ticket to Bola Tinubu and returned to his senatorial district for the party\u2019s senatorial ticket but met strong resistance from Machina.\n\nThere was apprehension Friday when supporters of Machina organised a solidarity protest where they swore that their candidate won\u2019t step down for Lawan, who has repeatedly represented the constituency since 2007.\n\nMachina had also written the leadership of the party last Monday, and vowed not to willingly relinquish his mandate.\n\nPart of the letter read, \u201cI write to reaffirm my continual aspiration as the All Progressives Congress unequivocal senatorial candidate for Yobe North Senatorial District, following my clearance and participation at the party primaries, where I pulled 289 votes out of the 300 total votes cast.\n\n\u201cI write to reaffirm that I remain committed to the mandate which I won at the primaries and I have not in form or manner communicated otherwise. I have been informed of a purported malicious and mischievous report and insinuation to the contrary.\n\n\u201cPlease note that I never at any time signed or communicated in any form any intent to vacate the mandate, which was won at the primaries.\n\n\u201cI am totally committed to my mandate and I am working towards delivering Yobe North Senatorial District to our great party, the All Progressives Congress.\u201d\n\nAdamu has however warned Machina, over his insistence on the party\u2019s senatorial ticket for the district.\n\nSpeaking with journalists in Abuja on Thursday, the APC chairman said the issues affecting the party on primaries were not unusual, adding that they had been resolved.\n\nHe said: If you don\u2019t know how to set a trap for a thief, the thief will set the trap for you. Machina should be careful; his issue is getting out of hand. As far I am concerned as chairman, my party did not violate any law.\n\n\u201cIs there any law that says you cannot contest for a position after contesting for another one. No law prohibits anyone from doing so.\u201d\n\nChuks Okocha and Sunday Aborisade in Abuja",
