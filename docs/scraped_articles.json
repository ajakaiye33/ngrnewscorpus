Gen. Mohammed Marwa (retd.), said the agency would continue to support efforts by other security agencies, especially the armed forces, to restore law and order across the country.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe three armed bandits were arrested by our officers on patrol in Malumfashi LGA of Katsina on Thursday, August 5, on their way from the Igabi LGA of Kaduna State to Kankara LGA in Katsina for another devilish mission.\n\n\u201cA Toyota Corolla with the number plate, Kaduna TRK 149 AE, three AK-47 rifles with magazines and ammunition, different types of charms, rings, cash and other items, were recovered from them.

A fabricated high calibre G3 rifle, along with 78 rounds of live ammunition of 7.62mm calibre and five empty shells of same were discovered inside.\n\n\u201cHowever, I asked that Celestine Christian be transferred to Abuja because of the calibre of weapon found with him, which he claimed he manufactured.\u201d\n\n\\Copyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The Senator representing Bayelsa West in the National Assembly, Senator Henry Seriake Dickson, has said that he has nothing to hide from anti graft agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.\n\nDickson spoke while playing the host to the local chairmen from Bayelsa State who paid him a solidarity visit on Thursday following his invitation by the EFCC on allegation on flood funds diversion and undeclared assets.\n\nThe former Governor reiterated that he has declared the assets in question which he acquired before he became Governor to the Code of Conduct Bureau for the fifth time.\n\nHe said that the indisputable evidence of the declaration of the assets are before the CCB and the investigating body, the EFCC.\n\nHe stressed that he had nothing to hide on his eight year rule in Bayelsa which was marked by unprecedented development in the state in all sectors.\n\nSenator Dickson who also spoke on the alleged diversion of N17.5 billion flood funds said that no such donation was received in Bayelsa during the 2012 flood crisis and he cannot misappropriate funds that never existed in the first place.\n\nHe recalled that the state government set up the Flood Management Committee under the Deputy Governor which received logistic support from the government at the time.\n\nDickson who expressed shock at the allegation stated further that the Government set up the post Flood Rehabilitation Committee headed by distinguished and trusted men of integrity, a former National Security Adviser, the late Gen Owoye Azazi, Chief Doukpola and Barrister Iniruo Wills as chairman, Vice Chairman and secretary respectively. When the late General Azazi died tragically, Senator Dickson appointed Chief Doukpola to head the committee.\n\nAccording to him, the only cash donation which was received in the state was N500 million from the Chairman of Globacom, Chief Mike Adenuga which was publicly and properly handed over to the committee in a ceremony. This was publicly acknowledged by the committee.\n\nHe added that the call of the state government for donations because of the devastating effect of the flood was ignored even by the Federal Government though some public spirited individuals donated relief materials.\n\nHe said that the petition written by the NGO had no name of donor and the name of the bank that received or transferred the N17.5 billion.\n\nDickson expressed further shock that he did not contest any reelection in 2019 as alleged in the petition to the EFCC.\n\n\u201cI am happy with the support that I continue to get and what you people are still doing, supporting the state government in building a strong party and a strong government\u201d\n\n\u201c I thank you for your relentless support and services to our dear state. You all know our track record and all what we did even in the management of the councils and our attitude to public finances. So there shouldn\u2019t be any worry. We are not in doubt that the investigating institution will be fair in this issue.\n\n\u201cI assure our people that we have nothing to hide. The allegation about flood donation was frivolous as there was no such thing. The state Government under my leadership had to support the flood committee headed by Gen Azazi \u201d\n\n\u201cIt is also untrue that I did not declare the assets in question to the Code of Conduct Bureau. As a matter of fact, I have declared them for the 5th time.\u201d\n\nLeader of the delegation, and Chairman of the Southern Ijaw Local Government Area, Mr Nigeria Kia said that it would be unacceptable to the grassroots for anybody to take deliberate action to bring down the Senator who they described as one of the most vocal voices in the Niger Delta.\n\nThe council chairmen called on the Federal Government to ensure fairness in the ongoing probe of allegations made against Senator Dickson by a non governmental organization.\n\nThey pledged their support to Senator Dickson for his unique leadership style which they said created the opportunity for them to be council chairmen.\n\nThey noted that Dickson has the record of a Governor who did not touch local government funds for eight years.\n\n\u201cHaving heard and saw what happened to our father and leader yesterday, we deemed it right to pay a solidarity visit to him as our father in politics who has made it possible for us to be where we are today,\n\n\u201cIf we, the grass root politicians, who have enjoyed the support of our father heard this and we don\u2019t avail ourselves the opportunity to visit him, it will not be well with us. That is why we are here to support him and pray that all will be well with him by God\u2019s special grace.\n\n\u201cAnd also to let the government and the authorities know that our father today is one of the voices (if not the loudest) in the Niger Delta and this idea of bringing down the voice of the Niger Delta is unacceptable to the grass root politicians.\n\n\u201cIt is also our humble prayer that those in authority should be very rational in taking any decision or any action they want to take in this matter.\n\n\u201cWe are with you and will still stand firm and strong with you,\u201d Kia said.",

          "text": "By Lukman Olabiyi and Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nThe family of Gani Fawehinmi has expressed sadness and shock over the demise of Mohammed, eldest son of the late activist and legal icon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all saddened and still in shock but will announce his funeral arrangements in due course after consultations with all relevant stakeholders,\u201d eldest daughter of the late activist, Mrs Basirat Biobaku, spoke at a press conference in their residence at Ikeja GRA, Lagos, yesterday.\n\nMohammed died after a brief illness at a Lagos hospital at the age of 52 on Wednesday night after he reportedly complained of breathing difficulties.\n\nShe stated that caused of death of Mohammed could not be ascertain yet due to fact that the family is yet to lay hand on the medical report.\n\nShe added that everything regarding the funeral arrangement would be delay till the eldest son of family, Saheed who is currently not in the country, return from America.\n\nThe late Mohammed obtained a law degree from the University of Buckingham, England and was called to the Nigerian Bar in 1998.\n\nThe deceased was chairman of Nigerian Weekly Law Reports. In 2003, he had a terrible accident in Lagos, which affected his spinal cord and confined him to the wheel chair.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerians from different walks of life have continued to pay tribute. Among them were President Muhammadu Buhari, Governors Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu and Joe Okei-Odumakin.\n\nBuhari, in a statement by his media aide, Femi Adesina, condoled with Ganiat, mother of the deceased, and the entire family, urging them to find comfort in God, who gives and takes, and to draw consolation in the fact that the departed robustly fought a debilitating condition, which confined him to the wheelchair for many years.\n\n\u201cHis body may have been broken, but his spirit was virile, agile, and he kept the flag of the family flying, doing justice to the memory of his late father,\u201d the president said.\n\nGovernor Fayemi described the death as shocking, unfortunate and loss to the generality of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cIt is a great loss not only to the late Fawehinmi\u2019s family and the civil society organisations but also the masses whose rights he fought to protect.\u201d\n\nFayemi said like his father, he was passionate about getting Nigeria to work better for the citizenry. He said he always sought a better Nigeria through constructive criticisms of the government.\n\n\u201cIn spite of his health challenge, Mohammed continued in the acts of his father who also fought for the masses as their advocate.\n\n\u201cHis vision, courage and patriotism were just like his father\u2019s. His demise will definitely create a huge vacuum in the fight for the liberation of the masses.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Governor Sanwo-Olu described the passing of Mohammed as a colossal loss to the civil society movement in Nigeria. He said like his father, he stayed the course with his persistent fight for the rights of the Nigerian people and did not live under the shadows of his father as he had grown to become a dependable comrade.\n\n\u201cAs a civil rights activist, he spent his life in the service of humanity and particularly for the emancipation of the Nigerian people. Mohammed Fawehinmi was as consistent as his father, the late Chief Gani Fawehinmi. He kept the flame of his father burning by fighting for the masses even on his wheelchair,\u201d the governor said.\n\nAsiwaju Tinubu, in a condolence message by his media aide, Tunde Rahman, in Lagos described him as a committed activist.\n\nAccording to him, Mohammed, like his father, was a lawyer committed to engendering societal change and development through the instrumentality of the law.\n\nThe leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) noted that he had kept the activist\u2019s fire of his dad burning since his passing.\n\n\u201cBut for the incapacitation arising from his devastating road accident, Mohammed would surely have risen to the full stature of his potential.\n\n\u201cEven then, he refused to be constrained by his physical state or confined to the wheelchair.\n\n\u201cRather, he continued to battle in court defending the poor, weak and oppressed Nigerians like his dad.\n\n\u201cLike his father also and like activists they both were, Mohammed also mounted the streets to agitate for democracy and good governance.\u201d\n\n\u2022Brightly burning candle dimmed by death\n\nDr Joe Okei-Odumakin, president, Women Arise for Change Initiative described the deceased as a chip off the old block in every way.\n\n\u201cMohammed attended rallies and kept the flame of activism burning in the Fawehinmi clan and indeed, the national circle of activists.\n\n\u201cHe relegated the designs of a fateful accident aside and performed all his obligations creditably.\n\n\u201cWe are devastated by the sudden death of our dear Mohammed Fawehinmi. This one death too many, was communicated to us quite early but the shock was arresting, alongside the need to find the best way for the immediate family to absorb the effect of this tragedy.\u201d\n\nShe said that late Fawehinmi would be sorely missed and prayed that Almighty Allah would erase his shortcomings and grant him Aljanat Fridaus.\n\n\u2022Pity he died in his prime -Afenifere\n\nThis is as cchieftain of the pan-Yoruba group, Afenifere, Senator Femi Okurounmu, described the late Muhammed, who was among dignitaries at the GRA residence, said it was a pity he died in his prime.\n\n\u201cMo\u2019 It\u2019s a pity you had to leave us so unexpectedly. You fought your condition valiantly but God Knows best we can\u2019t question him Rest in peace, Your uncle.\u201d\n\n\u2022Outstanding man -Pastor Ighodalo\n\nIn his tribute, Senior Pastor of Trinity House church, Pastor Ituah Ighodalo said: \u201cMuhammed was a very wonderful soul, he was a very outstanding man. He was very focused, very determined inspite of his personal challenges. He was a fighter for the masses, a man who wanted things done properly. He was a friend to us and would be greatly missed. His presence was always largely felt, may his soul and the souls of the departed rest in perfect peace\u201d\n\nMr. Wahab Shittu expressed sadness over the untimely demise of Mohammed saying that the legal profession has lost one of its brightest members in his prime time.\n\nHuman rights activist, Femi Aborisade said \u201cMuhammed, even after the death of his father, continued to fight for the masses of this country. In spite of his spinal-cord injury on wheelchair, he was always participating in protests and was not bothered about being teargassed and traumatised by security agencies.\u201d\n\n\u2022Spirit of a Lion\n\nFormer head of chamber of Fawehinmi\u2019s law firm, Mr. Ugwuzor Adindu said \u201cMuhammed was my brother, I called him my general. You will not know we are not from the same mother. Throughout the time we were together in his father\u2019s chamber, he gave me the power and courage to administer the office without any interference. Muhammed has the spirit of a Lion, even after the accident, he never gave up. He believed he was going to walk. His death is a great loss to all of us\u201d.\n\nNnaemeka Amaechina, who had worked in Fawehinmi\u2019s law firm said \u201cMohammed lived and loved life. He loved people and has a very good, sincere and loving heart. He imbibed the values of his father who was a human rights activist and stood for and with the people. He had regard for other people and has altruistic tendencies just like his late father.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was very frank and bold like his father and would have fitted well into his the shoes he left but for the accident he had years back. I Pray that God will strengthen the family particularly the mother at this challenging times.\u201d\n\nKalu: He played noble roles in advancing cause of people\n\nFormer governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu has lamented the passing of first child of late legal luminary and human rights activist, Chief Gani Fawehinmi, Mohammed, who died at the age of 52.\n\nDescribing the late Mohammed Fawehinmi as a cerebral lawyer and upright human rights activist, the former Governor condoled with the government and people of Ondo state over the sad loss.\n\nWhile praying to God to grant the deceased eternal, Kalu urged the Fawehinmi family to be comforted in the remarkable life Mohammed Fawehinmi lived.\n\nHe said, \u201cthe death of the eldest child of late legal luminary, Chief Gani Fawehinmi, Mohammed is shocking and painful.\n\n\u201c The younger Fawehinmi in his life time played noble roles in advancing the cause of the people.\n\n\u201cHe was successful in his profession and humanitarian gestures.\n\n\u201c The deceased left behind good legacies worthy of emulation\u201d.\n\nKalu prayed for the repose of the soul of Mohammed. Fawehinmi.\n\nGreat loss to legal profession \u2013Lagos NBA chairman\n\nMr Ikechukwu Uwanna, Chairman, Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Lagos Island branch, has described late Mohammed Fawehinmi as a thorough professional whose life represented excellence and hard work.\n\nHe said his death was a great loss to the legal profession.\n\nThe NBA chairman noted that Mohammed had the tenacity to rise above every challenge even physical challenge.\n\nUwanna said he was saddened by the demise of Mohammed and prayed for the repose of his soul and condoled those he left behind.\n\n\u201cWe pray that the legacy of the Fawehinmis\u2019 in the legal profession will not dewindle.\n\n\u201cWe pray that it will shine very bright despite this setback,\u201d the NBA chairman said.\n\nUwanna advised young lawyers to emulate the life and times of Mohammed in the legal profession and work hard to leave a mark in the profession.\n\nAccording to him, the legal profession today is in a state where there is need to work hard to revive and rejuvenate its name.\n\n\u201cI think that all of us need to work hard and emulate the life and times of late Gani Fawehinmi and his son, Mohammed, who have done their part and passed on.\n\n\u201cWe need to ensure that we contribute our own quota to the improvement and development of our profession. I think this is very critical,\u201d Uwanna said.\n\nMohammed, the first son of late Gani Fawehinmi, SAN, was born on Feb. 21, 1969.\n\nHe had his primary education at Kotun Memorial School, Surulere, Lagos, and attended Federal Government College, Sokoto.\n\nHe was a graduate of Business Administration from the University of Lagos in 1991.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.\n\nHe obtained an LLB degree from the University of Buckingham, England and was called to Nigerian Bar in 1998.",

The request was considered an \u201coutrage \u00e0 magistrat\u201d (contempt of court) by the AG, who ordered her immediate arrest.\n\nHello All!\n\n\n\n1st, Congrats for amazing mobilization today.\n\n2nd, stay mobilized. @africatechie is still under arrest.

She sits on the boards of many corporations including AfriLabs Foundation, ActivSpaces, Digital Africa, WHO Foundation, Eneza Education, Suguba, Djibouti Telecom, US Exim SAAC, and the UNECA Center for Digital Excellence.\n\nEnonchong is an advisor to Venture Capital for Africa (VC4Africa), the largest online community dedicated to entrepreneurs and investors building African companies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nIn 2017, she was named as one of the 100 Most Influential Africans in Science, Tech & Innovation by the New African Magazine and Jeune Afrique\u2019s 50 Most Influential Africans.

          "title": "Beyond funding, MAGIC Fund\u2019s value-add helps early-stage founders scale",
          "text": "For a founder, the startup world is an exciting yet very challenging one.\n\nWhile there have been many startup success stories over the past two decades, globally, the majority fail to make it past early-stage due to a number of reasons; inadequate funding, business model/strategy failure, or product/market challenges.\n\nThe odds are even greater for startups based in emerging regions like Africa, where there is a dearth of funding, an economy-crippling infrastructure gap, a massive consumer base with low purchasing power, political hostility and uncertainty as well as fragmented markets.\n\nA lack of access to capital is often cited as the biggest reason businesses fail in Africa and other emerging markets. But apart from funding, it can be helpful for founders in such markets to also get mentoring \u2013 preferably from people who have first-hand experience \u2013 as they embark on their startup journey with unknowns and untread paths.\n\nWith this in mind, a global collective of startup founders with expertise in several industries and geographies has been providing both access to capital and mentorship to early-stage startups and founders for more than three years.\n\nA fund by founders for founders\n\nMAGIC Fund, launched in 2017, is an early-stage venture capital fund built by founders turned investors. It has 12 founders from across the world who act as general partners with the Co-founder and CEO of Helium Health, Adegoke Olubusi, serving as managing partner, and Matt Greenleaf as operating partner.\n\nThe fund is built on two theses. One, that pooling funds and resources of individual founder-investors together open the group to more opportunities for investments, which they could then evaluate better using their diverse skill sets.\n\nMost founders-turned-investors go the angel investing or venture capital way alone, a practice that often comes with geographical and expertise limitations.\n\nRealising this, Greenleaf and MAGIC\u2019s other partners \u2013 who met Olubusi when Helium Health was going through the Y Combinator accelerator programme in 2017 \u2013 co-invest together.\n\n\u201cMAGIC is like a fund of micro funds built by founders,\u201d Greenleaf told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cBefore we started, we were all into some kind of investing as founders but realised that with our expertise in particular industries, it would make more sense to consolidate our collective intelligence and streamline our angel investment practice through a fund,\u201d he explained.\n\nMAGIC Fund 1 was $1.5 million, comprising the founders\u2019 personal monies according to Greenleaf.\n\nWith its first fund, MAGIC invested in over 70 companies at pre-seed and seed stages across Africa, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Southeast Asia.\n\nHelping founders on their journey\n\nTwo, MAGIC believes that smaller funds run by founders perform best in early-stage investing. Thus, the fund backs startups solving challenges across the world at their earliest stages.\n\nMAGIC has provided founders with more than just money, Greenleaf notes.\n\nUnlike traditional investors whose main focus is getting sweet returns on investments, the founders-investors at MAGIC with startup experience also look out for how much value they can drive for startups invested in.\n\nMAGIC\u2019s investment comes with support for founders through knowledge sharing and sessions with experts in relevant fields. This way, they help early-stage founders find product-market fit, fine-tune business models, and fundraising strategies for successful seed rounds.\n\nAccording to Greenleaf, the Fund\u2019s partners offer mentoring, advice, and network connectivity to support investee-founders as they scale their businesses.\n\n\u201cWe bring that general knowledge and know-how to help other founders run a company from zero to 100,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have people in the team who have started multiple companies and have access to people who have helped build unicorns. With that collective knowledge of the team, we provide mentorship.\u201d\n\nMAGIC Fund\u2019s expanded team.\n\nSome of the startups MAGIC has invested in and supported so far include Bankly, Mono, Eden Life, Evolve Credit, Indicina, Bamboo, Chronus Health, Oxygen, Kiwibot, etc.\n\nBy investing in startups and mentoring early-stage founders, Olubusi believes the way MAGIC Fund operates provides the general partners an opportunity to give back to their ecosystems.\n\n\u201cLater-stage founders whose companies have gone beyond the initial pre-seed, seed, or product-market fit stage have a very critical role to play in facilitating and helping grow their ecosystem,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the things we get to do at the fund.\u201d\n\nWhat next?\n\nAfter seeing success from its investments \u2013 MAGIC Fund 1 performed 5x over the period of three years, according to Olubusi \u2013 the company has raised a second fund of $30 million announced recently.\n\n\u201cWe had fully deployed the first fund so we thought: why not scale up the strategy since it worked so well and bring a few more people on board?\u201d Greenleaf said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a full-time dedicated team for fund 1 but now have that and 15 general partners who help with different industries. Obviously, $30 million is a lot of money to deploy and manage.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSome of the new partners joining the MAGIC team are the founders of startups invested in under Fund 1 but have exited. According to MAGIC, one-third of the new fund was contributed by the founder-general partners.\n\nMAGIC\u2019s limited partner base is diverse, with 50% of them black and 33% women. Some of the LPs are Paystack\u2019s Shola Akinlade, Olugbenga Agboola, the CEO of Nigeria\u2019s Flutterwave, and Hendra Kwik of Payfazz in Southeast Asia, Katie Lewis, Michael Seibel, Kirsten Connell of Octopus Ventures, Tim Draper, etc.\n\nJoining as partners are Evercare\u2019s Temi Awogboro, Troy Osinoff, Tom Chen of Stitchroom, Elvis Zhang of Oxy2, Medumo\u2019s Adeel Yang, and Juice\u2019s Michael Lisovetsky.\n\nMagic Fund 2 will be writing $100,000 to 300,000 checks at pre-seed and seed stages, Greenleaf revealed. The global fund is sector agnostic and plans to focus on fintech, healthcare, SaaS and enterprise, women\u2019s health, developer tools, etc.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "I want more women to become angel investors \u2014 Yemi Keri on angel investing and building Rising Tide",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

With the work our epidemiological team has been doing, we know that the Delta variant is already with us here in Nigeria. We are beginning to witness an increase in COVID-19 cases across the country.\n\n\u201cThis visit is to check our response arrangements and emergency facilities, which we used for the first and second waves of COVID-19 to make sure that they are in shape and are ready for the response that we are currently planning for the third wave.\n\n\u201cThe Edo State COVID-19 response team has been reactivated; l am the chairman of the team and the deputy governor is the chairman of the Technical Committee.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nIt poured cats and dogs on Thursday, 8th July, 2021 in Benin City. Amidst the rain, fully kitted Corps members were spotted on many streets of the town walking in the rain encouragingly in groups as they carried out sensitization exercise on environmental sanitation in a bid to key into Governor Godwin Obaseki\u2019s Urban Renewal Program for healthy environment and create awareness on sustainable environmental management and regeneration.\n\nThey were visibly drained from the rain but they had inner strengths that kept them going. They were quick to remind any colleague who mumbles from fatigue of the famous NYSC anthem lines that; \u201d under the sun or in the rain, with dedication and selflessness\u2026\u201d This brought back camp memories that put smiles on the faces of the young patriots. Now they understood the anthem they sang every day during the three weeks camp orientation exercise to actually mean that they signed up to the clarion call irrespective of the atmospheric condition.\n\nBut the rainy Thursday sensitization exercise was just a prelude to the sanitation exercise that would come on Saturday, 17th July, 2021 National Environmental Sanitation Day which NYSC set aside for Corps members to carry out environmental sanitation and sensitization in their various host communities.\n\nThe disciplinary NYSC officials in Oredo have not doubt instilled discipline in the serving Corps member which has put the Corps members always on the go when duty calls. So when the Corpers\u2019 Liaison Officer (CLO), Afemi Samson posted a reminder on the WhatsApp group that reads:\n\n\u201cAttention Corps members, there will be a National Environmental Sanitation Day! Which will hold on Saturday, the 17th of July, 2021.Corpers are advised to come out in large numbers to clean their environment, and also sensitize the people on Sanitation! Irrespective of your CDS group or where you stay, you are all advised to participate in making your environment clean\u2026\u201d they were not dazed a bit!\n\nOn Saturday, 17th July, corpers serving within Benin metropolis were spotted in every nook and cranny of the town carrying out sanitation. From cutting of grasses to disposing of waste bins. As usual what ordinarily would have been tiring turned out to be fun filled as they exhibited a high level of team spirit on the exercise.\n\nCommunity Development Service (CDS) is one of the four cardinal programmes of NYSC in which corps members contribute positively to the development of their host communities throughout the period of national service. Corps members are expected to use one day in a week for group CDS activities. They are not expected to attend duties in their places of Primary assignment on CDS days. Such days are dedicated to the execution of projects and programmes that will improve the living conditions of their host communities.\n\nThere are 16 CDS groups, one of which is Enviromental Protection & Sanitation group (NEMA/NESREA vanguard) that carries out sanitation on weekly basis but to commemorate the epochal National Environmental Sanitation Day, Oredo Corps members irrespective of the CDS groups all turned out en masse to carry out the sanitation exercise.\n\nIt is worthwhile mentioning that since its inception in 1973, the National Youth Service Corps has been making great contributions in the social, political and economic transformation of the nation.\n\nIn recent times, NYSC has been in the vanguard of the nation\u2019s drive to correct the imbalance in our rural-urban development through the various community development programmes executed by corps members. These programmes have revolutionized our communities in the areas of education, environment, healthcare delivery, agriculture, communication, infrastructure, technology, economic empowerment, poverty eradication, social services and above all national consciousness and socio-cultural regeneration.\n\nBy carrying out this selfless and patriotic exercise, the Corps members have underscored the commitment of the scheme to a clean and sustainable ecosystem that supports the life of all living in it, man, plants and of course animals.\n\nKeeping our environment clean is the duty of every citizen, from personal hygiene to our surroundings, let cultivate the culture of cleanliness. Remember the popular adage that says \u201ccleanliness is next to godliness\u201d.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSinafi Omanga is a serving Corps member with The Nigerian Observer, Benin City.\n\n...",

          "title": "Mixed Reactions Trail Planned Return Of Toll Gates",
          "text": "Stakeholders in the transport industry yesterday, reacted differently to the plan by the federal government to reintroduce toll gates on the country\u2019s highways.\n\nWorkers\u2019 unions and Nigerians, who commented on the announcement by the minister of works, Babatunde Fashola, after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting in Abuja, also gave conditions for accepting the move.\n\nThe Kano State Chairman of National Union of Road Transport Workers, Alhaji Bala Gwarzo, has described the recent resolve of the federal government to reintroduce toll gates on our highways as a complete drawback considering its negative consequences on the plight of its citizens.\n\nThe chairman made the disclosure in an interview with our reporter yesterday, in Kano saying that introduction of toll gates would only compound the already battered economic condition of their members who are mostly drivers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said before the banning of toll gates, there was an outcry by the general public on the need to stop it based on several complaints received daily, which were all centred on exploitative tendencies.\n\nThe toll gates, according to the chairman, were basically the centres of extortion among the officials assigned to take such responsibility and to some extent, security agents who hide under that cover to exploit the drivers.\n\nHe said toll gates are not encouraged in a civilised setting and if the government insists on reintroducing them, it should make sure that all the highways are either reconstructed or rehabilitated to standard.\n\nHe called on the government to change its mind and allow the drivers to face the current economic realities that are biting harder in the country.\n\nOn his part, another state official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the government should always try to focus on issues that would better the lives of its citizens, rather than compounding their problems.\n\nLeaders of the transport workers union in Kwara State were cautious in their reactions to the re- introduction of toll gate fees by the federal government.\n\nThe state chairman of Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN), Alhaji AbduRahman Onikijipa, said the transporters would await implementation of the fee before making their position known on it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a proposal by the federal government and the government has said that implementation would commence only when the affected roads have been made motorable. We want to wait till that time before we make our position known.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, if the government goes ahead to implement it, we will also make necessary adjustments in the cost of our service. It\u2019s what we buy that we will sell,\u201d Onikijipa stated.\n\nBut, the chairman of the state\u2019s branch of the National Union of Road Transport Owners (NURTW), Alh Ariwo Ola, declined comment on the development.\n\nHe said it\u2019s only the national headquarters of the union that can talk on the issue.\n\nReacting on the reintroduction of N200 and N500 toll gate fees on the highway, comrade Abubakar Abubakar, secretary, Plateau State chapter of Trade Union Congress (TUC) told LEADERSHIP Friday in Jos that the reintroduction of toll gates on Nigeria\u2019s highway is a welcome development.\n\nAccording to him, if only the operators would do the needful by ensuring proper accountability with a view to maintaining the existing and construction of new roads with the proceeds from the toll gates, Nigerians would heave a sigh of relief.\n\nIn the same vein, the chairman of National Road Transport Workers (NRTW) NTA Motor park, Alhaji Ibrahim Maikudi, said his association is yet to meet to take position on the concession of roads by federal government, but however, said in his personal opinion and as a transporter, if it comes with good intention, it is a welcome development that should be embraced by all.\n\nMaikudi argued that if there are toll gates, they would serve as security checkpoints and the proceeds would be used to maintain the existing roads and the construction of new ones.\n\nIn Lagos State, the general secretary of Federation of Informal Workers Association of Nigeria (FIWON), Comrade Gbenga Komolafe, has described the plan to reintroduce toll gates across the country as an act insensitive to the plight of Nigerians.\n\nSpeaking with LEADERSHIP Friday, Komolafe said he wondered which roads would be used in collecting money in view of the hard conditions motorists are facing based on neglect of all roads across the country.\n\nAccording to him, reintroduction of toll gates at a period when people are still feeling the impact of COVID-19, is an act of insensitivity at the highest level.\n\nFor motorists in Kaduna State, the move is in order provided the roads would be put in good condition, while others said insecurity on the roads should be given priority and the roads made safe for motorists.\n\nMr Josiah Ejimatswa, who runs Kaduna- Abuja routes said, \u201cThe toll gate is not the problem, but is the road good enough to warrant collection of such toll gates? Government should ensure that the roads are good enough first. The roads are not even safe, we travel with fear, may God help us,\u201d he prayed.\n\nFor Alhaji Mundi Yahaya, he said,\n\n\u201cGovernment should think of something meaningful to do and not reintroducing toll gates which some people use to enrich themselves through printing of personal receipts. There is no truth in Nigeria, corruption is everywhere,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Stakeholders in the transport industry yesterday, reacted differently to the plan by the federal government to reintroduce toll gates on the country\u2019s highways.\n\nWorkers\u2019 unions and Nigerians, who commented on the announcement by the minister of works, Babatunde Fashola, after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting in Abuja, also gave conditions for accepting the move.\n\nThe Kano State Chairman of National Union of Road Transport Workers, Alhaji Bala Gwarzo, has described the recent resolve of the federal government to reintroduce toll gates on our highways as a complete drawback considering its negative consequences on the plight of its citizens.\n\nThe chairman made the disclosure in an interview with our reporter yesterday, in Kano saying that introduction of toll gates would only compound the already battered economic condition of their members who are mostly drivers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said before the banning of toll gates, there was an outcry by the general public on the need to stop it based on several complaints received daily, which were all centred on exploitative tendencies.\n\nThe toll gates, according to the chairman, were basically the centres of extortion among the officials assigned to take such responsibility and to some extent, security agents who hide under that cover to exploit the drivers.\n\nHe said toll gates are not encouraged in a civilised setting and if the government insists on reintroducing them, it should make sure that all the highways are either reconstructed or rehabilitated to standard.\n\nHe called on the government to change its mind and allow the drivers to face the current economic realities that are biting harder in the country.\n\nOn his part, another state official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the government should always try to focus on issues that would better the lives of its citizens, rather than compounding their problems.\n\nLeaders of the transport workers union in Kwara State were cautious in their reactions to the re- introduction of toll gate fees by the federal government.\n\nThe state chairman of Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN), Alhaji AbduRahman Onikijipa, said the transporters would await implementation of the fee before making their position known on it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a proposal by the federal government and the government has said that implementation would commence only when the affected roads have been made motorable. We want to wait till that time before we make our position known.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, if the government goes ahead to implement it, we will also make necessary adjustments in the cost of our service. It\u2019s what we buy that we will sell,\u201d Onikijipa stated.\n\nBut, the chairman of the state\u2019s branch of the National Union of Road Transport Owners (NURTW), Alh Ariwo Ola, declined comment on the development.\n\nHe said it\u2019s only the national headquarters of the union that can talk on the issue.\n\nReacting on the reintroduction of N200 and N500 toll gate fees on the highway, comrade Abubakar Abubakar, secretary, Plateau State chapter of Trade Union Congress (TUC) told LEADERSHIP Friday in Jos that the reintroduction of toll gates on Nigeria\u2019s highway is a welcome development.\n\nAccording to him, if only the operators would do the needful by ensuring proper accountability with a view to maintaining the existing and construction of new roads with the proceeds from the toll gates, Nigerians would heave a sigh of relief.\n\nIn the same vein, the chairman of National Road Transport Workers (NRTW) NTA Motor park, Alhaji Ibrahim Maikudi, said his association is yet to meet to take position on the concession of roads by federal government, but however, said in his personal opinion and as a transporter, if it comes with good intention, it is a welcome development that should be embraced by all.\n\nMaikudi argued that if there are toll gates, they would serve as security checkpoints and the proceeds would be used to maintain the existing roads and the construction of new ones.\n\nIn Lagos State, the general secretary of Federation of Informal Workers Association of Nigeria (FIWON), Comrade Gbenga Komolafe, has described the plan to reintroduce toll gates across the country as an act insensitive to the plight of Nigerians.\n\nSpeaking with LEADERSHIP Friday, Komolafe said he wondered which roads would be used in collecting money in view of the hard conditions motorists are facing based on neglect of all roads across the country.\n\nAccording to him, reintroduction of toll gates at a period when people are still feeling the impact of COVID-19, is an act of insensitivity at the highest level.\n\nFor motorists in Kaduna State, the move is in order provided the roads would be put in good condition, while others said insecurity on the roads should be given priority and the roads made safe for motorists.\n\nMr Josiah Ejimatswa, who runs Kaduna- Abuja routes said, \u201cThe toll gate is not the problem, but is the road good enough to warrant collection of such toll gates? Government should ensure that the roads are good enough first. The roads are not even safe, we travel with fear, may God help us,\u201d he prayed.\n\nFor Alhaji Mundi Yahaya, he said,\n\n\u201cGovernment should think of something meaningful to do and not reintroducing toll gates which some people use to enrich themselves through printing of personal receipts. There is no truth in Nigeria, corruption is everywhere,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Kaduna State government disclosed yesterday that 11 hostages escaped from bandits\u2018 camps on the outskirts of Sabon Birni town, Igabi local government area.\n\nThe commissioner for internal security and home affairs, Samuel Aruwan, in a statement, quoted security reports as saying ongoing security operations in the state had dislodged many of the bandits from their camps, leaving them in disarray and enabling the escape of the hostages being held.\n\nThe commissioner further stated that the 11 hostages were a mix of those kidnapped from Dumbin Rauga, Zaria local government area, and also along the Kaduna-Zaria highway.\n\nThe statement noted: \u201cThe escaped hostages were identified as follows: From Dumbin Rauga (all children between ages 7 and 10): Fatima Sani, Aisha Falalu, Amina Aliyu, Hadizatu Sani Bashar Falalu.\n\n\u201cFrom the Kaduna-Zaria Road (abducted while traveling from Maiduguri to Ilorin): Fatima Umar, Zara Umar (and her infant) Hadiza Madu Sharif, Hauwa Ali, Zara Madu Sharif, Maryam Madu.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAruwan further said it was reported that the families of those kidnapped at Dumbin Rauga had collectively paid a ransom of N3million but the bandits reneged on the agreement to release the captives, insisting that two motorcycles must be included in the ransom deal.\n\nHe added that the escapees were recovered by the troops and have since been reunited with their families.\n\nIn another development, troops of Operation Safe Haven reported the rescue of two kidnapped victims, Barira Sulaiman Inusa and Isah Musa, around Kirti village of Jema\u2019a local government area.\n\n\u201cThey have also been reunited with their families\u201d, the statement said.\n\nAruwan said troops also rescued one Mrs Chioma Amanda Silver in Ungwan Sarki Goza village, Mariri, Lere local government area.\n\n\u201cShe had been abducted by bandits who abandoned her on sighting the troops,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that Governor Nasir el-Rufai expressed his satisfaction with the developments, praising the military\u2019s efforts and the degrading effect of the onslaught on bandit hideouts across the state.\n\nHe also commended the swift response of the troops to rescue the kidnapped citizens in Jema\u2019a and Lere.\n\nNotorious Boko Haram Commander Surrenders With Family In Gwoza\n\nA notorious Boko Haram/ISWAP Commander, Adamu Rugurugu, who was in charge of Gwoza and Sambisa general area, yesterday surrendered to troops along with his family members in Gwoza local area of Borno State.\n\nA youth leader from Gwoza who pleaded anonymity told our correspondent in Maiduguri that Adamu Rugurugu surrendered with his three wives, four children and Ak47 rifle to troops in Gwoza.\n\nThe youth leader added that Adamu Rugurugu had been the commander blocking the road linking Gwoza to Sambisa which had witnessed abductions and attacks on civilians plying the Maiduguri-Bama \u2013 Gwoza road.\n\nHe added that the terrorists in recent days had been surrendering to troops in their numbers in both Bama and Gwoza local government areas, adding that their yielding to authority could not be unconnected with the heavy military fire power on the sambisa forest and proximity of the deadly forest to the local government areas.\n\nHe said with the surrendering of Adamu Rugurugu, there is no doubt that very soon his followers will also throw in the towel since their boss has surrendered.\n\nHe further said that the terrorists sometimes front someone to surrender and negotiate their general surrender, hence there might be others waiting behind to come out from the forest.\n\n\u201cAdamu Rugurugu surrendered with his three wives, four children and Ak47 to troops in Gwoza on Thursday. He is an Ameer (leader) on Gwoza road that links Sambisa forest. In the recent days, the terrorists have been surrendering in their numbers to troops in Bama and Gwoza,\u201d the Gwoza youth leader said.\n\nOur correspondent reports that the Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Faruk Yahaya, had while flagging off welfare flight for troops of Operation Hadin Kai at the Air Force Base Maiduguri recently called on terrorists and bandits still waging war against the country to use the window of opportunity created by their other members who are surrendering en mass to troops to come out from the bush and surrender or face the wrath of the raging Nigerian military.\n\n156 Bandits Killed, 64 Arrested, 1000 Surrender In 2 Week \u2013 DHQ\n\nAlso, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) yesterday said its troops have killed 156 terrorists and bandits, arrested 64.\n\nIt added that over 1000 Boko Haram Terrorists/Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) surrendered in Borno State.\n\nThe acting director, Defence Media Operations, Brig Gen Benard Onyeuko, stated this during the biweekly update on the Armed Forces of Nigeria operations across the country covering July 29 to August 12, 2021.\n\nHe said among those arrested include two notorious cattle rustlers named, Mallam Buda Umar from Niger Republic and Mai Hatsi Ibrahim from Gada local government area of Sokoto State as well as four armed bandits and drug peddlers.\n\nHe disclosed that the troops also arrested three terrorists\u2019 collaborators and recovered large quantity of arms and ammunitions from various offensives.\n\nIn his breakdown, he said troops killed 27 killed terrorists, arrested 54 and rescued 29 captives in the North East theatre of Operation Hadin Kai.\n\n\u201cCumulatively, the operations led to the neutralisation of 27 BHT/ISWAP fighters, arrest of 51 BHT/ISWAP terrorists, three terrorists\u2019 collaborators as well as recovery of 35 assorted arms and 1,051 round of ammunition including AK-47 and FN rifles, Dushka anti-aircraft guns, GPMG, PKT guns, 60mm mortar tubes, Makarov pistol and other machine guns, amongst other items.\n\n\u201cIn addition, 29 abducted civilians were rescued within the period under review.

          "text": "Agency Reports\n\nNew census data released on Thursday in the U.S. showed the American white population declined for the first time in history last decade.\n\nIn contrast, there was population growth for people who identify as multi-racial, Hispanic and Asian between 2010 and 2020.\n\nThe release from the U.S. Census Bureau also marks the start of what will be a fierce partisan battle over redistricting, as states use the local data to begin drawing congressional and state legislative districts for the next 10 years.\n\nThe data offered a portrait of an increasingly diverse nation. The non-Hispanic white population, which remains the largest race or ethnic group, shrank by 8.6% over the decade and now accounts for 57.8% of the U.S. population \u2013 the lowest share on record.\n\nPeople who identify as multi-racial increased by 276%, from 9 million in 2010 to 33.8 million in 2020.\n\nFor the first time as a U.S. state, California\u2019s largest ethnic group is Hispanic, at 39.4% of the population, according to the data. In Texas, another large state, the non-Hispanic white population stood at 39.7%, just slightly larger than the Hispanic population at 39.3%.\n\nThe figures also offered new details on the country\u2019s slowing rate of population growth, which was the lowest of any 10-year period save the Great Depression in the 1930s.\n\nMore than half of all U.S. counties lost population from 2010 to 2020, census officials said, and almost all growth occurred in metropolitan areas. As in recent decades, the South and West saw more growth than the Midwest and Northeast.\n\nNew York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston and Phoenix are the five largest U.S. cities; Phoenix, which grew faster than any other city in the top 10, pushed Philadelphia down to No. 6.\n\nThe fastest-growing cities across the U.S. are in suburban areas, data showed. Buckeye, a suburb of Phoenix, saw its population increase by nearly 80% to lead the nation.\n\nThe Villages, a retirement community in Florida, is the fastest-growing metro area in the country, the census said.\n\nThe data, which offers demographic and racial details of every community down to the block level, arrived months later than originally expected after the census took longer to complete due to the coronavirus pandemic. The delay has forced some states to go to court to postpone their redistricting deadlines.\n\nStates use the data to redraw district lines for the U.S. House of Representatives after each decennial census, based on where people now reside.\n\nIn April, the bureau published state-level totals, showing that six states will gain congressional seats next year based on increased populations, as well as additional Electoral College votes starting with the 2024 presidential election. Another seven states will lose seats next year.\n\nElectoral analysts have said Republicans, who control more statehouses than Democrats, could potentially erase the Democrats\u2019 thin advantage in the House through redistricting alone.\n\nSome experts have questioned whether the census data may have undercounted certain populations, given both the pandemic as well as the Trump administration\u2019s unsuccessful effort to add a citizenship question to the survey. Civil rights groups had expressed concern that the failed attempt could nevertheless have dissuaded some immigrants from filling out census forms.\n\n\u201cWhile no data is perfect, we are confident that today\u2019s redistricting results meet our high data quality standards,\u201d Ron Jarmin, the bureau\u2019s acting director, said on Thursday.\n\nBy Reuters/NAN",

          "text": "Hajia Hadiza Shehu Shagari, widow of late President Shehu Shagari has reportedly died of COVID-19 complications.\n\nBala, a son of the late Nigerian leader who announced this in a statement, said she died Thursday at the age of 80.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe regret to announce the demise of our beloved mother, Hajiya Hadiza Shehu Shagari, the wife of H.E late President Shehu Usman Aliyu Shagari, GCFR (Turakin Sokoto).\n\n\u201cWe lost her in the early hours of today, 12th August 2021, at about 3:00 am, after battling Covid-19 at the Gwagwalada Isolation Center in Abuja.\u201d\n\n\u201cHajiya Hadiza Shehu Shagari was 80 years old. Her Jana\u2019iza (Funeral Prayer) will take place today, at 4:00 pm, immediately after Asr prayer, at the National Mosque, Abuja,\u201d the statement added.\n\nBuhari mourns\n\nAnd mourning Hajiya Hadiza\u2019s passage, President Muhammadu Buhari described the deceased as a pillar of strength and support for the family while her husband was serving his fatherland.\n\nThe president\u2019s condolence message was contained in a statement by his special adviser on media and publicity, Femi Adesina.\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari commiserates with family of the late former President of Nigeria, Alhaji Shehu Shagari over the transition of his widow, Hajiya Hadiza Shagari, at age 80.\n\n\u201cHe describes the departed as a pillar of strength and support, holding the fort for the family while her husband busied himself with service to the nation.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari extends condolences to government and the people of Sokoto State, urging the family to be consoled by the good deeds of Hajiya Hadiza.\n\n\u201cThe President prays Allah to forgive the sins of the departed and reward her with Paradise.\u201d\n\nFG rules out lockdown\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government Thursday said there is no plan for a fresh lockdown following the gradual spread of the third wave of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMinister of Health Dr Osagie Ehanire said this while speaking at the weekly ministerial briefing by the presidential communication team in Abuja.\n\nThe minister who said the terrible effects of previous lockdowns on the economy and everyday life were huge, assured Nigerians the new variant of the virus did not pose much threat to warrant any lockdown.\n\n\u201cLockdown is a very, very last measure that countries are taking because lockdown stifles economic activity, restricts your own freedom and your business \u2013 corporate business, government business, private business all are affected.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s not something you do easily. And of course when we were compelled to have that lockdown at the beginning we learnt a lot of lessons. You know, at that time government provided palliatives to release the impact of it, if you couldn\u2019t go to market if you couldn\u2019t do your business.\n\n\u201cBut this is not what government is aiming to do. No government wants to do a lockdown. \u201cIn countries where they have had serious threat, they have had to do what they call a precision lockdown like in the UK.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Israel the other day announced that they\u2019re doing some lockdown, but there\u2019s no more generalised lockdown, but precision lockdown of certain areas.\n\n\u201cSo, many countries do what they call precision lockdown so that not everybody will be affected, only certain areas to avoid too much damage to the economy, to social life.\n\n\u201cAnd we are not at the level yet where we are feeling that threat to do any lockdown. And as I speak to you now there are several countries that are on one kind of locked or the other, if my recollection is correct at least six or seven countries that are doing one form of lockdown or the other. We do not have that on the table right,\u201d the minister said.\n\nLagos reactivates centres\n\nIn a related development, the Lagos State Government Thursday said it has set up ten oxygen treatment centres and 20 sample collection centres as part of its efforts to mitigate the third wave of coronavirus in the state.\n\nSpokesman of the state Ministry of Health, Tunbosun Ogunbanwo announced this in a statement.\n\nThe sites and centres were established during the first and second waves of the pandemic.\n\nSpeaking on the government\u2019s decision, the state Commissioner for Health, Akin Abayomi, said the centres were \u201crejigged and reinvigorated to provide swift oxygen therapy to residents who require it and easy access to COVID testing for citizens who needed to test for COVID infection.\u201d\n\nAbayomi said the government was being proactive to curb the spread of the virus in the wake of the third wave.\n\nHe said the dual-purpose facilities were located in 20 local government areas identified as high burden areas for COVID-19 infection.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cAs part of efforts to mitigate the effect of the third wave of COVID-19 infection in Lagos State, the State Government through its Incident Command Structure has fully activated 10 COVID Oxygen Treatment and Sample Collection Centres as well as 20 Local Government Area (LGA) Based COVID Sample Collection Sites.\n\n\u201cThe 20 Local Government Area (LGA) Based COVID Sample Collection Sites are community-based sites operated by the Medical Officers of Health in each of the 20 LGAs and supervised by the Lagos State Primary Health Care Board in collaboration with the Lagos State Biobank to increase the ease of access of residents to testing.\u201d\n\nAbayomi said the treatment centres would support patients with oxygen while the local government area \u2013based sample collection sites would service patients with any of the COVID symptoms or those exposed to a confirmed COVID case.\n\nHe called on citizens \u201cwho will be visiting these centres to observe and adhere strictly to all non-pharmaceutical interventions of face mask use, social distancing and hand hygiene as part of the protocols to prevent spread of the infection at the sites.\u201d",

I think I have served long enough in the Villa to know the dynamism in the power at the center. I\u2019m the dullest person, at least I still have to offer something that will be meaningful. This is why I said let me give it a shot if it be, fine and good and if it doesn\u2019t the Almighty Allah will not say you did not come out.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the Coalition, Chairman Board of Trustees (BoT) of the Coalition, Mr. Tunde Imolehin, mooted that there was a need for the party to build a foundation that would make it sustainable.\n\nImolehin who was a member of the APC national membership registration) revalidation committee for the Southwest maintained that Yuguda fall in the category of party leaders who can direct the affairs of the party, someone whom everybody would listen to any time he speaks due to his rich background and experience.\n\n\u201cI believe we are here to begin a journey we will never regret, a journey that will be sustainable.

This made the appellants seek redress at the Supreme Court.\n\nIn a majority judgement of four against three delivered on July 28, a seven-man panel of justices of the apex court upheld the re-election of Governor Akeredolu.\n\nBut the other three justices disagreed with the majority judgement, saying the appeal filed by the appellants had merit and ought not to be struck out by the appellate court.\n\nSince the judgement, the verdict of the Supreme Court has become a subject of debate on whether a sitting governor can take up a role such as the Caretaker Committee Chairman of the APC.\n\nThe suit filed by the PDP on Thursday at the Federal High Court in Abuja is the latest among many other reactions triggered by the decision of the apex court.",

As a CEO, this has always been one of my core principles for DAO Maker.\u201d\n\nThe DAO Maker attack comes right on the heels of a massive $600 million hack of cross-blockchain interoperability platform Poly Network, the largest cryptocurrency hack to date.\n\nThe Poly Network hack took place on Tuesday morning, but in a surprising twist, the attacker \u2013 who said they did it just \u201cfor fun\u201d \u2013 have started returning the funds.\n\nAs at Thursday morning, some $342 million worth of funds have been returned to Poly Network.\n\nOmotayo Araoye",
