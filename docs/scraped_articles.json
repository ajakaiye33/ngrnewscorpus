          "text": "Justice Abdulazeez Anka of a Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos State, has sentenced a Nigerian-American-trained surgeon, John Nweke, to 27 years imprisonment for fraudulently obtaining goods from Konga Online Shopping Limited.\n\nThe goods reportedly include 19 expensive smartphones and two cameras valued at N35m.\n\nThe spokesperson for the Police Special Fraud Unit in Lagos State, Eyitayo Johnson, in a statement on Wednesday, said the defendants were arraigned in 2016 before honourable Justice Abdulazeez Anka of Federal High Court, Ikoyi, for conspiracy and obtaining property under false pretences.\n\nHe said, \u201cThey were charged under the Advance Fee Fraud and other Fraud Related Offences Act, No. 14 of 2006. On February 14, 2022, the Honourable Court found the defendant guilty as charged and sentenced him to 27 years imprisonment without an option of fine and ordered him to pay the money back to the victim of the fraud as restitution. The two accomplices, Stephen AnekeIgwe (now deceased) and Kelechi Emenike, were later discharged.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson, in another development, said an appellant and four others were successfully prosecuted in 2019 before Honourable Justice I. N. Buba of the Federal High Court, Ikoyi, for conspiracy and obtaining the sum of N187m from one Alh. Tayo Adeitan, under false pretenses.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe appellant was convicted, sentenced to 20 years imprisonment without an option of fine and ordered to pay back the money to the victim of the fraud, as restitution.\n\n\u201cIn the same year, 2019, he filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence. On February 4, 2022, the Court of Appeal upheld the argument of the Police Special Fraud Unit, dismissed the appeal and affirmed the conviction and sentence.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the PPRO said another appellant \u2013 a corporate entity owned and operated by one Alh. Suleiman Yerima (now deceased), was used as a front to fraudulently obtain the sum of N157m from Dashad Bureau De Change Ltd, under false pretences.\n\nJohnson said in 2019, the Federal High Court convicted the company and sentenced it to a winding-up with all its assets/property forfeited to the Federal Government of Nigeria, as restitution.\n\n\u201cIn 2020, the company appealed the judgement. However, on February 4, 2022, the Court of Appeal, Lagos, upheld the arguments of the Police Special Fraud Unit, dismissed the said appeal and affirmed the conviction and sentence of the appellant,\u201d he said.\n\nThe PPRO also said another appellant and its alter-egos, MfonIni Unam and Uwem Antia, conspired together and used the appellant as a sham company to obtain the sum of N370m from Alh. Tayo Adeitan, also under false pretenses.\n\nHe stated that the company was convicted and sentenced to a winding-up while all its assets were forfeited to the Federal Government, as restitution.\n\nJohnson added, \u201cIn 2020, the company appealed the judgement. On February 18, 2022, the Court of Appeal, Lagos, upheld Police Special Fraud Unit arguments against the appeal, dismissed the same and unanimously affirmed the conviction and sentence of the appellant.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": ".\n\nBy Tunde Oso\n\nThe Mayor of Urhoboland and notable ex-militant leader in the Niger Delta region, Eshanekpe Israel, a.k.a Akpodoro has congratulated the national leader and the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, on his victory at the just concluded party primary held in Abuja, even as he called on party faithful to rally support for the former governor of Lagos State, who he described as the father of Nigeria\u2019s modern democracy.\n\nTinubu, at the party primary had defeated his rivals in a landslide as he polled 1,271 votes while the former Minister of Transport, Mr Rotimi Amaechi, came a distant second with 316 votes just as the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, who a section of the media had tipped to win the ticket came distant third with 235 votes, a development the Mayor said was borne out of hard work by Asiwaju Tinubu.\n\nHe noted that having worked assiduously using the National Democratic Coalition, NADECO to oust the military from power paving the way for democracy to take root in Nigeria in 1991, Asiwaju did cut a niche for himself in the Nigerian project and nation building.\n\nAkpodoro, who is also the Coordinator of the Urhobo Youth Forum for Change, UYFC, said that Tinubu left no one in doubt in his capacity and understanding to lead the Nigerian state out of the woods, having grown the economy of Lagos State as a governor from the paltry sum of N600 million revenue while he served as governor to over N45 billion monthly, adding that Nigerians expect Asiwaju to replicate his success at the national level.\n\nAkpodoro described Asiwaju as an agent of change and accelerated development and that there\u2019s no doubt that he would exit the country as President from it current challenges bothering on security and education.\n\nHe called on APC to put its acts together for victory at last as he commended the northern governors of the broom party for their patriotism and solidarity to the unity and peace in the country by standing their grounds on power shift to the southern region of the country.\n\nPointedly, the Mayor stressed that Asiwaju\u2019s emergence is a victory for democracy, noting that governors under the party from the North made it possible as against the plans by those he described as enemies of Nigeria to plunge the country into unending political crisis by jettisoning the zoning arrangement that he noted had fostered peace in the polity.\n\n\u201cThe APC should build a formidable force against the opposition so that it would emerge victorious at the general elections in 2023. Tinubu worked hard to achieve success and its a victory for all. Party faithful should close ranks to defeat the opposition and we hope they listen. I commend Governors Nasir el-Rufai, Babagana Zulum, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, former Governor Kashim Shettima and other governors, who refused to stand the truth on its head,\u201d the Urhoboland Mayor concluded.",

The total transaction value for the deals was about N10.71 billion, according to calculation by The Nation.\n\nIn a major selloff, billionaire businessman Femi Otedola, who became the single-largest individual shareholder in FBN Holdings with the acquisition of 7.57 per cent equity stake last year, sold about 2.33 per cent equity stake in series of deals valued at N9.3 billion.\n\nAbout 835 million shares were sold by the businessman, reducing his equity stake to about 5.24 per cent.\n\nTrading reports indicated that Otedola sold shares across his direct shareholding and indirect shareholdings, including four indirect shareholding firms where he is the beneficial shareholder.\n\nAlso, four directors of FCMB Group, including the company secretary, yesterday mopped up about 11.4 million shares of the financial services holding group.\n\nAn insider\u2019s source said the transactions by the directors were approved by the board of the group.\n\nRead Also: CBN establishes Banks Neutral Cash Hubs\n\nThe reports showed that Nestle S.A, the majority foreign shareholder in Nestle Nigeria Plc, has been buying retail minority shares through secondary market transactions. The core investor has staked about N1.4 billion on acquisition of retail shares in the past few days.\n\nIn another disclosure, the recently inaugurated chairman of Guaranty Trust Holdings Company (GTCO) Plc, also acquired shares of the company in a deal valued at N4.5 million.\n\nUnited Capital has also reported insider shares purchase by senior management staff and their relative. According to the reports, three senior management staff and wife of a top management staff had acquired shares of the company within the past 48 hours.\n\nInsider deals have come under intense scrutiny at the stock market as capital market regulators seek to plug loopholes that confer undue advantages on directors, major shareholders and others who by virtue of their positions and association have access to sensitive information.\n\nSection 315 of the Investments and Securities Act, No. 29, 2007 (ISA), describes an insider among others as \u201cany person who is or is connected with the company in one or more capacities as a director of the company or a related company; an officer of the company or a related company; an employer of the company or a related company; an employee of the company, involved in a professional or business relationship to the company; any shareholder of the company who owns five per cent or more of any class of securities or any person who is or can be deemed to have any relationship with the company or member and members of audit committee of a company.\u201d\n\nCapital market regulators had recently undertook substantial review of rules to identify possible loopholes and prevent insiders and their related persons from taking undue advantage of the market and the general investing public.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Nigeria\u2019s apex capital market regulator and the NGX Regulation Limited, which regulates trading on the NGX, reviewed their rules and regulations with a view to aligning them with current realities and strengthening the regulatory frameworks against abuses.\n\nThe reviews and amendments included areas such as fairness and equitable treatment in material corporate changes such as mergers and acquisitions, corporate restructuring, spin-off, possession and trading on price-sensitive information, takeovers, consolidation and corporate split among others.",

This is a victory for democracy and Nigerians as a whole. With the manner he went about his campaigns, Asiwaju has proved to be a hero of our democracy.\n\n\u201cFrom day one, he stood his ground that the APC must organise a free, fair and transparent presidential primary if it wanted to remain the party to beat. He advocated that and remained steadfast. This will make the party come out peaceful and victorious in the end.\n\nFayemi: Asiwaju, a long distance runner\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Yinka Oyebode, Fayemi said Tinubu\u2019s emergence represented the collective wish of the vast majority of APC members.\n\nHe added that the former governor \u201chas proven his dedication and competence to lead the country at such an important time in history.\u201d\n\nFayemi who stepped down as an aspirant and endorsed Tinubu at the convention described the APC flag bearer as a \u201clong distance runner,\u201d, who has the capacity to lead the country to greater heights.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is a great moment for our party.

The time for strives is beneath us. As the dust settles, we must form a common front and understand that victory at the general election is our collective target.\n\n\u201cIt is time to justify our zeal and passion for the party. The instruments of the party must be fully deployed for the rescue mission of the nation. Let us expend our strength and reach to replete the party with brighter prospects. Ours is to plough not to plunder.\n\n\u201cOur struggle for the service of the people must reflect in our support and incurable commitment to unity geared towards the good of the people and the country at large.\n\nHe is leader of leaders, says Oyetola\n\nGovernor Oyetola described Tinubu\u2019s emergence as a victory for democracy and a demonstration of his influence and acceptability, not only within the APC but across the country.\n\nHe expressed confidence in the capacity and competence of Tinubu to deliver victory for the APC next year.\n\nOyetola added in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Ismail Omipidan, that the former governor would deploy his administrative acumen to take the country to enviable heights.\n\nThe statement partly reads: \u201cYour emergence is indeed a reward of your tireless efforts and selfless services to Nigeria and Nigerians and of course, humanity as a whole.\n\n\u201cYou are not just a leader of leaders but the finest politician who had used his God-given wisdom and wealth to build humanity and advance the socio-economic fortunes of our dear country.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that your phenomenal leadership and enigmatic fortress had in no measure contributed significantly to the growth and development of Lagos State where you served as a two-term Governor and of course Nigeria as it is evident in your influence across the nooks and crannies of the country.\n\n\u201cWith your antecedents coupled with your outstanding credentials in both private and public sectors, I have no doubt in my mind that your emergence will deliver victory for our party in all elections as this will further justify the quest to elect a candidate with unimaginable qualities that cut across spheres of life\u201d,\n\nAbiodun; Tinubu\u2019s candidacy good for Nigeria\n\nIn a statement yesterday, the Ogun State governor said the emergence of Tinubu was a good omen for the APC and the country.\n\nAccording to him, the victory shows that Tinubu \u201cis widely beloved and accepted within the country\u2019s entire political spectrum, and shows his level of deep interactions and acceptance not only within the ruling APC but across Nigeria.\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis victory indicates that Tinubu as a candidate is good for Nigeria, as it will foster unity, love and understanding amongst Nigerians. His electoral victory cut across all the six geopolitical zones; he had an impact in all the zones. He is the candidate to beat in the 2023 elections.\n\nAbiodun expressed confidence that he would further deepen the nation\u2019s democratic ethos and good governance.\n\nGanduje: he is a bridge builder\n\nThe Kano governor said that the victory of Tinubu showed his acceptability in the North as a bridge builder.\n\n\u201dAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu\u2019s landslide victory in the just-concluded presidential primary election of the All Progressives Congress (APC) shows his high degree of acceptability in the North, as a bridge builder,\u201d Ganduje said in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Abba Anwar.\n\nHe expressed optimism that the election would make APC stronger as the 2023 general elections draw nearer.\n\nThe governor also praised his Northern counterparts for their unanimous decision to shift power to the South and also Buhari for accepting their proposal.\n\n\u201cThis patriotic decision will further cement all parts of the country. President Buhari\u2019s role in making sure that democratic principles are safeguarded in the process is highly commendable and exemplary,\u201d he said.\n\nTinubu will lead APC to victory, says AbdulRazaq\n\nIn his congratulatory message, AbdulRazaq noted that Tinubu deserved his victory.\n\nThe governor said the ballot represented a resounding vote of confidence by APC leaders and members in Tinubu\u2019s capacity to lead the party to another victory.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt was a moment to speak to the direction the party must take to consolidate on its own wins, build on the many successes of President Muhammadu Buhari, and raise a dynamic successor team that is able to take up the challenges of nation-building and development in a peculiar age of changing metrics of governance and collective security. In antecedence, capacity, and reach, there is no doubt that Asiwaju ticks all the right boxes. With his emergence, our party is clearly destined for a big win in the next general elections.\u201d\n\nYahaya: Jagaban, a strong piller\n\nYahaya described Tinubu\u2019s victory as a good omen and an expression of national unity.\n\nHe added that the emergence of the Jagaban of Borgu was \u201da manifestation of his years of personal commitment, sacrifice, tenancy, political experience and service to the nation.\u201d\n\nDescribing Tinubu as an enigmatic leader and a strong pillar with immense influence, Yahaya said he had no doubt that he would give the ruling party a resounding victory next year\n\nThe governor also expressed optimism that when eventually elected as president, Tinubu would bring to bear, his \u201cvast wealth of experience and network as a former governor, Senator and political leader to build on the successes of the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration.\u201d\n\nLagos Speaker:\n\nSpeaker Obasa described Tinubu\u2019s emergence as a well-deserved victory.\n\n\u201dThe outcome of this primary election is the result of hard work and the support of critical stakeholders across the length and breadth of this country who love Tinubu,\u201d Obasa said.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is interesting and exciting how the exercise, which was held under a peaceful atmosphere, ended.\n\n\u201cThis victory is not for Asiwaju alone. It is for our great party. It is for well-meaning Nigerians who aspire for a greater country.\u201d\n\nThe speaker also urged for greater support for the APC presidential candidate as the party approaches the next stage of electioneering ahead of 2023.\n\nTinubu, a dogged fighter, says Daniel\n\nFormer Governor Daniel described Tinubu as a dogged fighter, who would go to any length to achieve his objectives\n\nDaniel, who is the APC candidate for Ogun East Senatorial District, said: \u201dThe Bola Tinubu that I know is a strategic thinker, a great planner and a well-organised personality, which are the attributes that have worked for him not only in politics but also in his business and social relationships.\n\n\u201cIn the last two decades Bola Tinubu\u2019s political trajectory has shown that the sky may be the starting point for him, and this he has clearly demonstrated with the energy he puts behind his campaign and the eventual victory as the Presidential candidate of the All Progressive Congress which has proven bookmakers wrong in all ramifications.\u201d\n\nUba\n\nUba noted that Tinubu\u2019s victory was gained from \u201ca free, fair and credible process.\u201d\n\nHe added that the development also reaffirms Tinubu\u2019s wide acceptability to rescue Nigeria from its current state of despair.\n\nUba said: \u201cAsiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu is not only the choice of APC delegates at the APC special national convention but the generality of Nigerians who believe in his ideology to turn the nation\u2019s economy around for good, through concerted grassroots development, Job creation, total fight against insurgency among others within a short time.\u201d\n\nKeyamo, Ajimobi\u2019s widow react\n\nKeyamo and Florence Ajimobi, who also congratulated Tinubu, said his victory would help strengthen the nation\u2019s unity.\n\nKeyamo also praised Northern governors \u201cfor being the heroes of the convention\u201d by agreeing to cede power to the South.\n\nMrs Ajimobi said her late husband \u201cwould be pleased with the turn of events that saw the emergence of Asiwaju Tinubu, being a core loyalist of his.\u201d\n\nA former spokesman for the APC in Lagos State, Seye Oladejo, said Tinubu\u2019s candidacy of the ruling party represents a breath of fresh air to the nation.",

CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nHe lamented the sorry state of public tertiary institutions in Nigeria claiming the Federal Government has not shown the compassion and will power to end the strike by university lecturers and non-academic staff which has kept Nigeria\u2019s future generations out of school for over two months.\n\n\u201cIn Nigeria, workers in our universities, both academic and non-academic have been on strike for more than two months because of non-implementation of collective bargaining agreement. We call government to bring this strike to an end without further delay.\n\n\u201cWe are appalled and opposed to the growing resistance against trade unionism through obstructions of freedom of association, freedom to organise, freedom to collectively bargain, right to strike and the irresponsible violation of collective bargaining agreements especially by multinational companies. Globally, workers are concerned about the rise of fascism, ultra-nationalism, unilateralism, irresponsible capitalism, and despotism which threaten not only the fabrics of harmonious industrial relations but also the foundations of global peace and our collective survival.\u201d\n\nWabba said the NLC would continue to support the striking universities workers until all issues that led to the industrial action are resolved.\n\nThe NLC president stated that though the Congress earlier issued an ultimatum to the government, which has now elapsed, he said the nationwide strike was put on hold following the intervention of notable individuals in the country.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to achieve from the ultimatum was to get attention, which I would say we were able to achieve. The Sultan of Sokoto, Secretary to the Federation of Nigeria and others intervened and tell us to give them sometime to intervene. We are actually waiting for them. That is also in conjunction with the ILO which believes more in dialogue than shut down. Also for us as a labour centre, strike is always the last option when other avenues have failed. But we are still fully in support of our members in ASUU,\u201d he said.\n\nWabba, however, commended the commitment of social partners in Nigeria for institutionalising Social Dialogue through the resuscitation of the National Labour Advisory Council (NLAC).\n\nAccording to him, this tripartite structure has completed the process of reviewing of the nation\u2019s five Labour laws.\n\n\u201cWe are expecting government to forward these laws to the Nigerian parliament without delay. Similarly, the NLAC has also been utilised to process ILO Convention 190 for ratification. We are confident that this ratification will happen very soon. Together, we can make the world a better place to live, work and raise our families,\u201d he said.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "text": "By Gabriel Dike\n\nThe West African Examinations Council (WAEC), yesterday, expressed concern over the activities of rogue website operators in the ongoing May/June 2022 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE).\n\nThe council in a statement signed by its acting Public Affairs Officer, Mrs. Moyosola Adeyegbe, condemned candidates and parents for patronising rogue website operators.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nAdeyegbe drew the attention of stakeholders and the public to the unwholesome activities perpetrated by unscrupulous elements in the conduct of the 2022 WASSCE.\n\n\u201cThe council is aware of the operations of these vile individuals, most especially the rogue website operators, who are hell-bent on sabotaging the noble efforts and concrete arrangements put in place by WAEC to ensure the successful conduct of the examination. The council is equally aware that these individuals perpetrate their dastardly acts through various social media platforms, such as Blogs, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram.\u201d\n\nAdeyegbe said these unpatriotic individuals see WASSCE and other examinations as a business venture and an avenue to make money, thereby deceiving innocent and gullible candidates and their parents.\n\nShe said exam fraudsters lure candidates and their parents by proposing shortcuts to examination success by lying to them that WAEC questions can be accessed earlier than the due date.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing but a lie from the pit of hell. Please, for the avoidance of doubt, and for the benefit of the general public, this is not true. The council works hard to put firm security measures in place to protect the integrity of its test items. Unfortunately, some candidates have fallen prey to the \u2018trash\u2019 being served on these rogue platforms. They no longer read their books because of the promise of access to \u201cWAEC questions!\u201d This is a very sad and dangerous development.\u201d\n\nThe image-maker said the council assured the general public that the rogue website would not go unpunished as they will be brought to book and made to pay for all their crimes, noting \u201cthe council will stop at nothing to ensure that the fight against this societal ill is won at all costs. We are grateful to the Nigeria Police Force for the robust collaboration in this regard.\u201d\n\nThe council reminded candidates that there are no shortcuts to examination success ands warned that any candidate caught in the act would be appropriately sanctioned as approved by the Nigeria Examinations Committee (NEC), the council\u2019s highest decision-making organ on examination-related matters.\n\n\u201cIt will be painful to spend six years in secondary school and not have any results to show for their learning and efforts.\u201d\n\nAccording to her, the council advised parents to encourage their children/wards to study hard and desist from patronising these evil peddlers who are out to destroy the destiny of their children/wards.

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nRecalling the partnership with the military formation dating back to 2017, the INEC boss said their involvement in the prosecution of the 2023 elections would assist in the conduct of free and credible poll.

It was carried out by / terrorists mounted on 150 motorcycles carrying three AK47 wielding persons each.\n\n\u201cWhen the armed killers were carrying out the killings around 3pm the villagers mobilized to repel the attackers at Maikori village. The valiant natives who came out in large numbers from neighbouring villages were already driving back the invaders and taking control of the situation when a helicopter appeared.\n\n\u201cTo the horror of the natives, the white painted helicopter, faced the brave natives instead and started gunning the youths from the air, clearly leaving out the killers who can be distinctly identified by the mode of dressings and from their positions.\n\n\u201cThere was no way that poorly armed farmers using crude weapons could face the combined fire strength of better armed terrorists and a gun mounted helicopter.\n\n\u201cWith no other options, the Adara youths had to scamper for safety.\n\nThis enabled the attackers to burn down the whole village. The covering fire of the helicopter also enabled the attackers to escape unhurt. As a result of the attack, 25 persons, mostly men were killed. 16 men, 5 women, and 4 children were killed.\n\n\u201cWe not yet sure how many of the casualties were caused by the gun shots from the helicopter. But some injured persons are taking treatments in various hospitals.\n\n\u201cSome houses were burnt at Ungwan Sarki but Maikori village was completely destroyed.The ECWA church in Dogo Noma was razed down.\n\n\u201cSome houses in Unguwan Sarki and Unguwan Gamu were also burnt.\n\nThe burial of victims was disrupted on Monday, 6/6/2022 as the terrorists were sighted in nearby bushes.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, many people are still missing and some of them are believed to have been abducted by the assailants. So far, not contacts have been made.\n\n\u201cThe attacked has caused serious panick leading to the displacement of thousands of people in the area. Most of the displaced persons, especially women and children are still relocating to places like Katul Crossing, Kachia, Idon and Maraban Kajuru.\n\n\u201cThe attack has compounded the already very bad humanitarian situation in Kajuru LGA because Kutura Station and other neighboring villages were similarly destroyed and displaced on 8th April, 2022.\n\n\u201cThe Adara Development Association(ADA) wants the Nigeria Air Force to thoroughly invistigate this incident and determine if the helicopter and the crew belong to the Nigeria Air Force. There have been too many reports of helicopters dropping weapons and provisions to bandits in their locations both in and out of Adara Chiefdom. The Nigeria Air Force should speak on this incident to clear the air.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on government and other people of conscience to come to the aid of our displaced and dehumanized people.\n\n\u201cThe ADA also wishes to express its outrage with the Kaduna State Governor for abandoning the people to the mercy of terrorists\u201d.",

Voting had to be halted due to fears over security of the process. There were issues of accreditation and crowd loitering too close to the designated point of voting. Hawkers of soft drinks, water and such other essentials practically took over the arena. It took the election and planning committee some valuable and security personnel some time to restore order before voting resumed.\n\nThose, who stepped down for Tinubu were former Minister for Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio; former governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun; Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi; Governor of Jigawa State, Abubakar Badaru; former Speaker of House of Representatives, Hon. Dimeji Bankole; Senator Ajayi Boroffice and the only female aspirant, Uju Ohanenye.\n\nTinubu, who was the first to address the special convention, held at the Eagle Square, Abuja, however, boasted as having the capacity to articulate a vision of progress for the country if elected candidate of the party and ultimately, president of the country.\n\nBut President Muhammadu Buhari, who spoke before voting commenced, enjoined the delegates to vote the candidate with the best chance of emerging victorious at the general election.\n\nVice-President Yemi Osinbajo, who also took his turn to address the convention after all other aspirants had taken their turns, spoke to the heart of the delegates, when he said there was no one they would wish the nation well and still vote someone they did not believe in.\n\nAt the same time, the National Chairman of APC, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, yesterday, told members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party that washing their dirty linen in public was not a mark of courage but a mark of irresponsibility and indiscipline.\n\nBuhari, while addressing the delegates, noted that the critical task ahead of the Adamu-led National Working Committee (NWC) was to continue to forge the unity of purpose among party members and to keep securing needed compromises in the interest of the party.\n\nThe president said the candidate of the party must be knowledgeable, fair-minded nationalist with a very strong belief in the unity of the country and strength of character and purpose to steer the country forward.\n\nBuhari also urged party officials and delegates to follow due process and abide by all extant laws and regulations pertaining to election of the party flag bearer.\n\nHis words: \u201dAs we go into the presidential primary, I urge all to keep to the same spirit. We must avoid acrimony and maintain the spirit of sportsmanship. The critical task ahead of the Abdullahi Adamu-led NWC remains to continue to forge the unity of purpose among party members and to keep securing needed compromises in the interest of our great party.\n\n\u201dI enjoin you all to be fair to all and to create a level playing field for all the presidential aspirants in the coming crucial party exercise.\n\n\u201dPlease, follow due process in all the party decisions and I call on all party members, particularly, the party officials and delegates to abide by all extant laws, rules, and regulations and to consider voting for the presidential candidate with the best chances of securing victory for our great party in the coming general election,.\u2019\n\nWhile noting that the principal challenge before the party was the need to keep a united front, Buhari affirmed that the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party has vested its powers in NWC for the time being, as requested, and in compliance with the party constitution, to ensure smooth party administration and operations in these critical times in the overall interest of the party.\n\n\u201dPlease do not hesitate to call on me and all other appropriate quarters for the help that will propel our great party to the victory that we all seek. To ensure a hitch-free presidential primary, please, let us work collectively in the interest of our great party and our great country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President, therefore, congratulated all the winners, and the newly emerged party standard bearers for the 2023 general election and urged the winner to be magnanimous in victory, particularly, towards fellow aspirants, who conceded to him.\n\nOn his part, Adamu, who came down on the NWC members, frowned at their approach in dealing with issues.\n\nMembers of the NWC, had addressed the press to deflate Adamu\u2019s plan to impose the Senate President, Senator Ahmed Lawan, as the consensus candidate of the party.\n\nIn his response, he said, \u201cOn the 20th of April this year, I drew the attention to the need for our party to be disciplined; that a political party such as APC, the ruling party, at the heart of our national development, must be exemplary and discipline and fidelity in its core values.\n\n\u201cWashing our dirty linen in the public is not a mark of courage, it is a mark of irresponsibility, indiscipline and indiscriminate to obey extant rules and regulations and play by them.\u201d\n\nThe national chairman was of the opinion that unity was the only glue that could hold the party together, saying the ruling party could not go into the general election next year without putting its house in order.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cit doesn\u2019t take rocket science to unite a party; it takes sincerity of purpose, commitment and determination to sacrifice our individual interest and ambitions for the larger interest of the party.\u201d\n\nAdamu, however, noted that the healing process in the ruling party had commenced, addingthat, \u201cthings are not falling apart; things are holding up and I am grateful to you all for standing by me and members of the National Working Committee in seeing that we carry out the first order of business in our party and that is the total reconciliation of all the state branches of the APC that were held hostage by avoidable grievances.\n\n\u201cWe have nothing to gain in portraying our party in a bad light. We have everything to lose in undermining the integrity of our great party. I found it necessary to make this observations.\u201d\n\nAdamu said it was a clear indication that the ruling party had emerged stronger from the grievances, noting that the party was united and speaking with one voice once.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAt the end of the current exercise, we shall begin a steady march towards the 2023 elections, going by our resolute, commitment to win and win big in all levels of elective offices up for contest.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Tinubu, who THISDAY has projected to emerge the APC candidate, said the candidate of the party must be able to unite Nigerians from all parts of the country and must have the experience, leadership, knowledge, and extensive personal contacts to steer a diverse, complicated Nigeria through this challenging period in a dynamic world.\n\n\u201cThe other candidates are all good men. But I sincerely believe I am the person this moment calls for.\n\n\u201cI cannot, on this day, talk of a bright and prosperous future without also declaring my determination to fight terrorism and insecurity to the very end. I mourn the lives already lost and vow to do everything possible to ensure justice and forever erase terror from our land.\n\n\u201cToday, you decide our presidential nominee. Let it be the man, who can best articulate a vision of progress and development then implement it. Let us always honour the promise the APC made to Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nOsinbajo, in his speech, said the future of the country and the children should compel the delegates to vote right, adding that they could not wish the country well and vote for someone they do not believe in.\n\nHe said, \u201c2322 delegates will decide the future of our children and their own children. The future of our children compels all our distinguished delegates to vote right tonight.\n\n\u201cYou cannot wish this country well and vote for someone you do not believe in. To our dear delegates, when you vote tonight, know that your votes tonight carry the answer for the future of our children and for our country.\u201d\n\nThe vice president said the present situation in the country did not need a leader that would learn on the job, adding that it was the main reason he was the best man to take over from the president in 2023.\n\n\u201cOne thing is certain, the circumstances of the country will not allow the next leader to learn on the job. For the past seven years, I have learnt on the job. I will be prepared from day one,\u201d he added.\n\nImmediate past Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, also called on the delegates to ask all the presidential aspirants the sources of their money, adding that, if elected, he would develop the country\u2019s economy.\n\nAmaechi said: \u201cDear delegates, assess us by our contributions. Do not assess us by how much we bring here, because if you assess us by how much we bring here, ask all of us what is our source of revenue? How did we get all these funds?\n\n\u201cThe problem of the Nigerian state is all of us. Nigerian politicians will come and talk to you, bring out money and we accept them. Four years after, they will come back and still make the same promises. Do not vote for me if I lie to you. Do not vote for me if I have not performed but I have performed.\n\n\u201cThere is need to move forward, to ask Nigerians to hire me and fire me if I fail. If you vote for me, the first thing is that we must develop our economy, bringing it back to industrialisation and production. We will rebuild our universities to be places of learning. There will be rule of law. People will be punished for their crimes.\u201d\n\nGovernor of Kogi state, Yahaya Bello, said he was in the race to win, adding, \u201cI didn\u2019t come this far to chicken out,\u201d boasting that at the end of the contest, he would emerge victorious.\n\nPastor Tunde Bakare said his aspiration to be the president of Nigeria wasn\u2019t about him, but about the people of Nigeria.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is about your people, it is about my people, the Nigerian people, who will once again have a reason to believe that they have a stake in their nation when our presidential commission for National Reconciliation, Reintegration and Rebirth restores lasting peace to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe time is now and the hour has come. Tonight, I am not here to step down. By the grace of God, I am here to step up with the support of the delegates as the 16th president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Dear delegates, as we converge in our nation\u2019s capital to collectively take a historic step towards the realisation of a nation that works.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the youngest presidential aspirant, Nicolas Felix, also a pastor, stepped down for Osinbajo.\n\nBut voting was still ongoing at the time of going to press, while only three states had voted, before the planning committee halted the process on account of some challenges.\n\nEFCC: Why We Stormed APC Convention\n\nThe Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), yesterday, explained why operatives of the commission stormed Eagle Square, venue of the presidential primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nAllegations of financial inducement of delegates made the rounds at the primaries.\n\nSome sources claimed that there was inducement of delegates to the tune of $25,000,$30,000 and $40,000 in some cases, which exchanged hands at the venue of the election.\n\nSpokesman of the EFCC, Mr Wilson Uwujaren, in a chat with THISDAY, said the operatives of the commission were at the Eagle Square to monitor the primaries.\n\n\u201cIs it not obvious? It is obvious. We are there to monitor proceedings,\u201d he said.\n\nThe agency had carried out a similar operation during the primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which was won by former Vice President Atiku Abubakar.\n\nBut in spite of the hoopla over financial inducement at the PDP primaries, no arrest was made.\n\nBello: Playing By Rules Only Way to Win Presidency\n\nGovernor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, has declared that the only way the ruling APC could win the presidency again in 2023 was if it played by the rules of the game.\n\nHe said any attempt to exclude some aspirants from participating in the electoral process or skew the process to favour some persons or groups against others would spell doom for the party.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday with newsmen after meeting behind closed-doors with President Muhammadu Buhari, at the State House, Abuja, Bello, a presidential aspirant of the APC, alleged that governors of the party from the North and some elite conspired against him to muscle him out of the contest.\n\nAsked if he was sure that the ruling party would win the presidency in 2023, the governor said, \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic that APC will return to power, if we play by the rules of the game.\u201d\n\nOn what he meant by playing by the rules of the game, he said, \u201cFollow all the laws, non-exclusion of anybody, who wants to participate and carrying everybody along and ensuring that there\u2019s fairness, equity and justice.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated his opposition to the rotational presidency, saying it doesn\u2019t give room for the emergence of a competent person to pilot the affairs of the country.\n\nOn what was the agenda of his meeting with the President, the governor said, \u201cOf course, you know that today (yesterday) is the special national convention of our party, where a presidential candidate from the All Progressives Congress will emerge. Leading up to today, there have been various controversies and issues before today.\n\n\u201cYesterday (Monday), a certain video went viral, that I got angry and I left a particular meeting and then, of course, this is a period, when a lot of lies, a lot of misconceptions, will fill the air. Then, we have our father, the leader of our party, who should always know the reality or the truth, and then I came to brief him exactly what happened.\n\n\u201cWell, some of my colleagues, led by the self-proclaimed leader of them, ganged up to suppress the voice of the people, the voice of over 26 million Nigerians, the voice of the women, the voice of people living with special needs, the voice of the choice of the party. So, that\u2019s exactly what I revolted against. I decided to leave the meeting where such concoction were ongoing. That\u2019s exactly what took place.\u201d\n\nAsked to mention the name of governor that he was talking about, he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mention a name because I am honorable enough. The office I occupy today is an office that should be dignified. Myself, I have respect for leaders, for elders, even if some elders do not respect themselves, I have high respect for those in positions of authority. So, I wouldn\u2019t mention names.\u201d\n\nOn why he was not on the same page with Northern APC governors after several attempts made by the governors as revealed by the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, to make him consider his colleagues\u2019 position of conceding the presidency to south, he said he was not consulted by anyone.\n\n\u201cI am a unifier, I have demonstrated that severally in my state. I have demonstrated that severally in the various tasks that were given me by the party. So, nobody consulted me. Nobody consulted me over the decision that they took and I will rather say that they were railroaded by certain interest who want to be VP at all costs.\n\n\u201cThe issue of turn-by-turn presidency, I continue to oppose it because the insecurity that is facing us today does not respect turn-by-turn presidency, every part of this country is faced with insecurity. Every part of this country is wanting prosperity and the seeming or the disunity that we experiencing today in Nigeria, we want unity in this country and that is exactly what I stand for.\u201d\n\nOnly Tinubu Can Defeat Atiku, Says Group\n\nA pro-Bola Tinubu group, The Consolidation Ambassadors (TCA), has said the former Lagos State governor, was the only one that could defeat the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe group, in a statement titled: \u201cOur Stand\u201d and signed by Dr. Adelanke Peter, said for Nigeria to consolidate on the achievements of President Muhammadu Buhari, a bold, frank, independent, transparent, intelligent, smart-thinker like Tinubu was needed.\n\nPeter said, \u201cAlthough the TCA is not biased towards any presidential aspirant contesting to be the presidential flag bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC). We, however, owe it to the party and party members to guide them in terms of direction ahead of the National Convention.\n\n\u201cThe Consolidation Ambassadors (TCA) with its firm foundation within 36 States of the Federation and FCT, emerged as worthy Ambassadors of the APC who recognised and appreciated the progress made by the President Buhari led administration.\n\n\u201cEspecially in the areas of infrastructure, human capital development, agriculture, anti-corruption, digital economic transformation and all inclusive governance. The group said it resolved to identify and unify all political structures and supporters of the aspirants that contested elective posts under the umbrella of the APC.\n\n\u201cParticularly the 23 presidential aspirants by providing the necessary support to the flag bearers after the primaries. \u201cIt is for this reason, after due consultations and considerations, that we suggest that the party should field a candidate that can stand shoulder-to-shoulder, eye-ball-to-eye-ball, kobo-for-kobo, tactics-for-tactics.\u201d\n\nDeath at APC Convention\n\nThe All Progressives Congress delegate from Buji Local Government Area (LGA) of Jigawa State, Alhaji Isa Baba Buji, has died. He was aged 61. The delegate, who was present to participate in his party\u2019s presidential primaries died yesterday afternoon in Abuja. It wasn\u2019t, however, certain what actually killed Buji. Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, has expressed sadness over the sudden death of the delegate, describing it as saddening.\n\nOsinbajo, in a statement by his media Aide, Laolu Akande, condoled with the family, associates, government and people of Jigawa State and prayed for the repose of the soul of the delegate.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022UK parliament debates massacre, decries rising insecurity in Nigeria\n\n\u2022Ondo confirms 22 dead, 18 injured, 88 casualties\n\n\u2022WHO, Ekiti Obas grieve, condole Akeredolu, victims\u2019 families\n\nMichael Olugbode, Kuni Tyessi in Abuja, Fidelis David in Akure and Victor Ogunje in Ado Ekiti\n\n\n\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has condemned Sunday\u2019s terrorist attack on St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church, Owo, in Ondo State, where 22 persons were reported killed. Guterres, who reacted to the massacre yesterday in a statement by his spokesperson, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, called on the Nigerian government to bring the culprits to justice.\n\nThe secretary-general\u2019s comments came as the United Kingdom\u2019s House of Commons debated the gruesome killing. And a team from the World Health Organisation (WHO), led by the Country Representative and Head of Mission, Nigeria, Dr. Walter Mulombo, visited Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu yesterday in Akure to commiserate with him over the incident.\n\nThe Ekiti State Council of Traditional Rulers lamented the carnage, in a statement yesterday by its chairman, Oba Gabriel Ayodele Adejuwon. The Obas charged the security agencies to be more decisive in dealing with security issues.\n\nA statement from the UN secretary-general quoted him as condemning attacks on places of worship as abhorrent, while urging the Nigerian authorities to spare no effort in bringing the perpetrators of the Owo attack to justice.\n\nGuterres extended his condolences to the families of the victims, wished speedy recovery to the injured, and expressed his sympathies and solidarity with the government and people of Nigeria.\n\nUK Parliament Debates Massacre, Decries Rising Insecurity in Nigeria\n\nThe UK Parliament considered the bloody attack in Owo a matter of urgent international importance. Parliamentary Under-Secretary (Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office), Vicky Ford, said she was horrified by the attack.\n\nFord stated, \u201cI publicly express the UK Government\u2019s condemnation of this heinous act and stress the importance of those responsible being brought to justice in accordance with the law. The High Commission in Nigeria has also expressed our condolences to the governor of Ondo State and offered our support. I know that the House will join me in sending our condolences to the families and communities of those killed.\u201d\n\nThe under-secretary decried rising insecurity in Nigeria and the devastating effect on affected communities.\n\nShe said, \u201cI have raised this issue with the Nigerian authorities on several occasions, including in conversations with Nigeria\u2019s vice president and foreign minister during my visit in February. During that visit, I also met regional governors, religious leaders and non-governmental organisations to discuss inter-communal violence and freedom of religion or belief.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that religious identity can be a factor in incidents of violence in Nigeria and that Christian communities have been victims, but the root causes are often complex and frequently also relate to competition over resources, historical grievances and criminality, so the UK Government is committed to working with Nigeria to respond to insecurity.\n\n\u201cAt our security and defence dialogue with Nigeria in February, we committed to work together to respond to the conflict. We are supporting local and national peace-building efforts in Nigeria, including through the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum and National Peace Committee.\n\n\u201cWe provide mentoring and capacity building to support Nigerian police force units, to improve their anti-kidnap capacity, and we support efforts to address the drivers and enablers of serious and organised crime in Nigeria. At our security and defence dialogue, we reiterated our shared understanding and commitment to protecting human rights for all.\u201d\n\nOndo Confirms 22 Dead, 18 Injured, 88 casualties\n\nOndo State Governor, Mr. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, disclosed that 80 persons were affected by the attack. Akeredolu said 22 people lost their lives, while 56 survivors were on admission at the Federal Medical Centre, Owo; St Louis Hospital, Owo; and Owo General Hospital, as well as some private hospitals.\n\nThe governor gave the details yesterday during a statewide broadcast on the terrorist attack.\n\nAkeredolu said the attack was an attempt to test the will of the people of the state and, indeed, the South-west. He added that the dastardly act had the possible consequence of invitation to national anarchy, saying, \u201cYorubaland and Owo, in particular, have never been conquered before; and it will never happen.\u201d\n\nThe governor promised to commit every available resource to hunt down the assailants and make them pay dearly, stressing that the state would never bow to the machinations of heartless elements in its resolve to stamp out criminals.\n\nAkeredolu stated, \u201cThe site, that is, St Francis Catholic Church, Owaluwa, Owo, presents a gory war-like scene. The Federal Medical Centre, Owo, the St. Louis Hospital, Owo, the General Hospital, Owo as well as some private hospitals in Owo were filled with the injured, most of who were in critical conditions.\n\n\u201cThe most unfortunate part is the lives of innocent children cut down in their prime and some severely injured by the mindless attackers.\n\n\u201cAt Owo, the anger was palpable. The tension was at an abrasive level, just as the urge for reprisals was high. Without doubt, too, the ripple impact of this heinous act as well as the understandably angry reaction across the state could not have been different.\n\n\u201cI urge our people to be calm but remain vigilant. Do not take the law into your own hands. Leave the rest for government to shoulder. I have spoken to the heads of the security agencies. I can assure you that security operatives have been deployed to monitor and restore normalcy to Owo kingdom.\u201d\n\nThe Commissioner for Health in Ondo State, Dr. Banji Ajaka, had revealed yesterday that a total of 22 worshippers were confirmed dead. Ajaka, who spoke in an interview with journalists in Akure, also confirmed the official casualty figure in the attack on the church, which occurred during Mass.\n\nThe official confirmation came less than 24 hours after the Nigeria Police issued a statement, saying it recovered unexploded Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and pellets of expended AK-47 ammunition from the scene of the attack.\n\nAt the time of filing this report, the motive of the assailants remained unspecified, even though the police said they had launched an investigation into the attack.\n\nWHO Commiserates with Akeredolu\n\nA team from the World Health Organisation (WHO), led by the Country Representative and Head of Mission, Nigeria, Dr. Walter Mulombo, visited the Ondo State governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, yesterday at his office in Akure.\n\nAccording to the governor\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, the team was in the state to commiserate with the government and the people over the sad incident.\n\nOlatunde quoted the governor as saying that contrary to rumours doing the rounds, no one was kidnapped during the incident, stressing, \u201cThe terrorists came to maim and kill.\u201d\n\nAs part of measures being put in place to forestall future occurrence, Akeredolu urged public and religious centres to install Closed-circuit Television (CCTV) cameras at strategic places to enhance security. He called on the people to be more vigilant and report strange faces in their vicinities to the authorities.\n\nThe governor appreciated the WHO team for identifying with the state and the support given so far. He said he was surprised that such an act could be carried out even in God\u2019s sanctuary.\n\nAkeredolu stressed, \u201cWhere else is safe if that sanctuary is not safe. In war situation, even soldiers could run into te church for safety. These are mad people, I\u2019m not too sure they are human beings. They have lost their own humanity and there is no way you can regard them as human beings. I think they are animals in human skin.\n\n\u201cInitially, it was rumoured that the parish priest was, probably, kidnapped, but when we got there, the parish priest showed up and said nobody was kidnapped. Nobody. They did not go for the Sunday collection and nothing was taken. Clearly, they were there to maim and kill.\u201d\n\nThe governor solicited more support from WHO in areas, such as social support.\n\nEarlier, the leader of the team, Dr. Walter Mulombo, commiserated with the governor on the sad occurrence. Mulombo also applauded Akeredolu for the leadership he had demonstrated, particularly his prompt response to the situation, despite being outside the state when the attack happened.\n\nHe described the attack on worshippers as unspeakable, saying WHO would offer relevant support.\n\nMulombo said, \u201cI have been engaged in many response emergencies and I can count on my fingers the number of time I saw a hovernor like that in the field going round, making sure things are right. I\u2019m very encouraged and impressed.\n\n\u201cThe World Health Organisation is committed to support your state to respond to all hazard and emergencies, including following up of such unfortunate incident. I have come with my colleagues and also those working in the emergency departments, some specialists who can help in dealing with the situation, and our colleagues who will give social support.\n\n\u201cWe also came with some emergency trauma kits and some other support materials. This is just a contribution and solidarity. We will remain available for any additional support as Ondo State might require to deal with this difficult situation.\n\n\u201cWe are also trying to engage our other UN agencies to come together and see how we can support Ondo to recover from this unfortunate incident.\u201d\n\nEkiti Obas Grieve, Condole with Akeredolu, Victims\u2019 Families\n\nSaddened by the Owo killing, the Ekiti State Council of Traditional Rulers, yesterday, charged the security chiefs to be more decisive in dealing with security issues. The traditional rulers said the killing was not only senseless, but also confirmed how bestial some Nigerians had become in nefarious activities and shedding of human blood.\n\nExpressing their condolences to the governor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, and the entire Obas and citizens of Ondo State, the council, in a statement yesterday by its chairman, Oba Gabriel Ayodele Adejuwon, regretted the unwarranted shedding of the blood of innocent worshippers.\n\nCharging the country\u2019s security agencies to be more proactive in efforts to curtail carnages around the country, Oba Adejuwon, who is also the Onisan of Isan Ekiti, stated that no country could witness investment when security of lives and property had been grossly compromised.\n\nHe charged Nigerians to be security conscious and work in partnership with stakeholders to rid the country of vampires and marauding criminals.\n\nThe traditional rulers said in the statement, \u201cWe are saddened by this murderous act. The church of God is a sanctuary and safe haven for worshipers, but it saddens minds and rendered people spell-bounded how such abode has suddenly become unsafe due to the activities of these criminals.\n\n\u201cWe commiserate with the families of the victims, the Olowo of Owo, Ondo State government, and the entire Nigerians on the demise of these worshippers and citizens of our nation.\n\n\u201cWe are charging the security outfits to be alive to their responsibilities and curtail the activities of these evil doers.\n\n\u201cThe council is also tasking the security outfits to build the right networks, intelligence gathering, and work hard to arrest the perpetrators of this mindboggling and saddening event.\u201d\n\nWomen Groups Call for Restructuring of Security Architecture, Others\n\nA total of 500 women groups, under the aegis of Womanifesto, denounced the attack on St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church in Owo. The women called on President Muhammadu Buhari to restructure the security architecture of the country and amend the 1999 Constitution, which they described as problematic.\n\nThe group also called on the government to, \u201cPublish the identities of all the victims of the Owo tragedy, including those that died as well as the injured, and to demonstrate accountability and carry out a speedy investigation that is conclusive with arrests, successful judicial prosecution and sentencing of the killers.\u201d\n\nCommiserating with the people of Ondo State, co-convener of the group, Dr. Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, in a statement made available to THISDAY, said the failure of the government to properly investigate or take tangible actions to ensure justice or deter future occurrences had continued to exacerbate the security crisis.\n\nThe group said the cold-blooded massacre at the Catholic church was yet another evidence of the blatant disregard for human life and the incessant murder of defenceless citizens by criminal gangs who had been marauding unchecked across the country.\n\nWomanifesto lamented that as a result of the lack of adequate prosecution of terrorists, thousands of innocent people are now widowed and children orphaned.\n\nIt quoted the Nigeria Security Tracker to have reported that over 3, 515 people had died as a result of violent attacks between January and June, 2022, with 1, 214 deaths in March, ranking higher than the 996 deaths recorded in January.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cWomanifesto demands in the medium term, a comprehensive restructure of Nigeria\u2019s security architecture through a national conversation on a new constitution to replace the problematic 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe Owo massacre in which citizens in their place of worship were killed, again raises the question of governance failure, considering that our 1999 Constitution asserts security and welfare of citizens as a primary responsibility of the government.\n\n\u201cWomanifesto finds the current fixation of Nigeria\u2019s public officials and other politicians with the 2023 elections in a country, which has many evident signs of being on the brink of collapse, an unconscionable, unkind, and cynical diversion of energy that should be focused on securing anxiety-numbed citizens.\n\n\u201cWe are shocked that our political leaders are continuing to ignore and downplay the rising trend of daily killings of Nigerians in states across the country at a dangerous time like this and, instead, (they are) giving priority to their personal quest for power. This is utterly condemnable.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Shepard, United States Attorney for Northern District of Illinois, for its verified complaint of forfeiture, stated that \u201cBeginning as early as 1998, Adegboyega Mueez Akande, with others operated an organisation which distributed white heroin, a controlled substance under Title 21 of the United States Code.\n\n\u201cThis distribution operation was conducted on a large scale and the proceeds of the operation substantial.\u201d\n\nThe judgment was that the court ordered: \u201cthat the funds in the amount of $460,000 in account in the name of Bola Tinubu represents proceeds of narcotics or were involved in financial transactions in violation of 18 U.S.C ss 1956 and 1957 and therefore these funds are forfeited to the United States.\u201d\n\nAfter protracted litigation in which Bola Tinubu claimed that the monies legitimately belonged to him, his wife, Oluremi Tinubu, and his surrogate mother, one Alhaja Mogaji, Bola Tinubu finally opted for a stipulated settlement with the US government.\n\nAccording to the settlement order dated September 15, 1993; Hon. Judge John A. Nordberg ordered that the sum of $460,000 held by Bola Tinubu in the First Heritage Bank account be forfeited to the United States Government.\n\nA bigger scandal was uncovered in 2018 when Alpa Beta, a consultancy owned by Bola Tinubu, was caught at the centre of a N100 billion fraud, tax evasion, and money laundering petition written by Mr. Dapo Apara, its Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nAccording to Apara\u2019s petition to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Alpha Beta \u201chas become an avenue for official corruption of government officials, a conduit pipe for massive money-laundering scheme, tax evasion, among other vices.\u201d\n\nIn the petition, sent on his behalf by Adetunji Adegboyega ESG, his solicitors, Apara said: \u201cOver the years the company is being protected and shielded by some powerful politicians and people in the society which made them to always boast of being untouchable, but our client, feeling the need not to keep quiet again and strengthened by his belief in the fact that the government of President Muhammadu Buhari is keen on fighting corruption, which has been the bane of our country, is of the firm belief that it\u2019s time to expose and open the can of worms called Alpha Beta Consulting.\u201d\n\nAlpha Beta first became known when it was appointed as a consultant to the Lagos State Government, arguably its first client, under the tenure of Babatunde Fowler as the Chief Executive Officer/Executive Chairman of the Lagos State Board of Internal Revenue from 2005 to 2014.\n\nThe company got the appointment when Tinubu was Governor of Lagos State. The speculation, which has yet to dissipate since then, is that Tinubu completely owns or is a major shareholder in the company.\n\nIn the same vein, the state has also never denied claims that the company takes about 10 percent of the internally generated revenue of Lagos, estimated in 2016 to be about N40 billion every month.\n\nThe court process was still ongoing when on October 27, 2020, hoodlums burnt the documents during the riotous #EndSARS violence in the state.\n\nThe court papers stating charges brought against Tinubu, his tax consultancy firm, Alpha Beta Consulting, by Apara were burnt, according to claims by Tade Ipadeola, Apara\u2019s lawyer.\n\n\u201cEverything in Igbosere High Court got burnt including the registrar\u2019s copy of our application. In fact, the whole building was burnt to ashes. So, we will have to file again. The registry has been moved to Ikeja.\n\n\u201cWe may have to file the case afresh at the Ikeja High Court but we have not yet been instructed to do so,\u201d he said on October 27, 2020.\n\nApara had claimed in the documents that Tinubu, suspiciously diverted N22,360,000,000 and $4,396,063 from the firm\u2019s account to that of Vintage Press Ltd, publisher of The Nation Newspaper.\n\nIn a writ of summons marked LD/7330GCMW/2020 deposed at a Lagos High Court, Apara, who claims to own a 30 per cent stake in the company, alleged that the former governor reneged on certain agreements reached in the past about the management and control of the consulting firm.\n\nOther fronts used by Tinubu, according to the former Alpha Beta boss, are Olumide Ogunmola and Tunde Badejo.\n\nIn his statement of claim, Apara said during a review of the company\u2019s account, he discovered that huge sums of money earned by the company over the years were not reflected in its account.\n\nHe also revealed how Tinubu used the Osun State governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, as a front for the establishment of the firm.\n\nAlpha Beta Consulting was awarded a contract by the Lagos State Government when Tinubu was governor of the state after a recommendation by a committee comprising the then Attorney-General of Lagos State, Prof Yemi Osinbajo (now the Vice President of Nigeria); Mr Wale Edun, then Commissioner for Finance; and a former Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget, Yemi Cardoso.\n\nThe firm was subsequently given exclusive rights to collect taxes on behalf of the Lagos State Government and was believed to receive about 10 percent commission from the revenue it collected for the state.\n\nHowever, pro-transparency groups and opposition politicians had constantly alleged that Tinubu owned Alpha Beta even though his name was not on any of the company's documents.\n\nHowever, both Tinubu and Alpha Beta denied the allegations.",

          "text": "Mohamed Buba Marwa, chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), says drug tests should be made compulsory for corps members across the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarwa spoke when he hosted Mohammed Fadah, the new director-general of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), and his team at the NDLEA headquarters in Abuja on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to him, making drug tests compulsory at the various NYSC orientation camps in the country would help boost ongoing efforts to tackle the menace of drug abuse.\n\n\u201cThere is the need for drug tests for our youth corps members as they report at the orientation camps. Once they know there\u2019ll be drug tests at the camps, they will abstain from it. The whole essence is to ensure help gets to those who test positive early. This is part of our War Against Drug Abuse, WADA, initiative,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNigeria has a drug issue. We\u2019re determined to ensure this is changed but we can\u2019t do it alone, we need organisations like NYSC to reduce and control demand for drugs. Nigeria has insufficient rehabilitation and counselling centres.\n\n\u201cWe need counselling centres in the primary health care centres at the grassroots, where we don\u2019t have enough manpower to cover and this is where the young men and women of NYSC come in.\n\n\u201cWe can train them in their numbers to serve as counsellors at the grassroots level because majority of drug users only need counselling.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his remark, the NYSC DG said the visit was to appreciate the NDLEA for past support to the scheme.\n\nHe added that the visit is also to seek further collaboration with the agency as the scheme prepares to open orientation camps across the country.\n\nCopyright 2022 TheCable.

          "text": "May may have crawled by, but that didn\u2019t slow Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem down.\n\nFrom Starlink\u2019s upcoming entry into Mozambique and Nigeria, to Ethiopia\u2019s 5G tests, here are the top 10 leading happenings from May 2022.\n\nIn May, African startups raised $437,100,000 across 49 fully disclosed* deals as fintech startups retook the lead.\n\nThis marks a 5.3% increase from what was raised in April 2022.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are fintech, mobility, and AI/deeptech. Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date.

          "text": "The Kenyan government has announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nEarlier this week, a proposal submitted to the Parliament included an amendment to the Excise Duty 2015 of the Finance Bill, which provides for a 20% tax on all digital loans.\n\nLike many other countries on and off the continent, Kenya\u2019s digital lending space is rapidly growing. At least 13% of Kenya\u2019s population of 53.7 million people have taken digital loans from more than 120 digital lenders operating in the country. As at April 2021, the lenders were disbursing over Ksh 2 billion ($17 million) per month in loans.\n\nThe introduction of the tax could also mean increased interest rates for users of digital loan apps like Tala, Branch, Timiza, and O-Kash, most of which already charge high-interest rates from borrowers. Branch, for example, charges a 17% monthly interest rate, while Tala charges as high as 19%.\n\nKenya leans on digital loans\n\nThe proposed tax is the latest in Kenya\u2019s moves to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nSince 2021, the Kenyan Parliament and the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) have taken active steps in curtailing the activities of digital lenders who charge predatory interest rates and engage in unethical loan recovery practices like debt-shaming.\n\nLast year, Parliament approved the Central Bank of Kenya (Amendment) Bill which bestowed the Central Bank with the power to regulate digital lenders. The approval also subjected digital lenders to the Data Protection Act, which prevents them from violating users\u2019 privacy through debt-shaming.\n\nThis March, the CBK also published the Digital Credit Providers Regulations, 2022 which requires digital lenders to obtain licenses from the CBK in order to operate in the country. The regulations also provided that lenders seeking licensing would be required to disclose and verify their sources of income. These regulations have not yet been implemented; the law will go into effect in September.\n\nThe proposed 20% tax could have unintended effects on the millions of Kenyans who use digital loan apps. Parliament will deliberate the proposal until Thursday, June 9th before taking a final decision.\n\nShare this article",

Notifications will now \u201croll in\u201d from the bottom of the screen, while a \u201cLive Activities\u201d API will let developers update notifications in real time.\n\niMessage users can now edit or recall recently sent messages for up to 15 minutes after sending it, recover recently deleted messages for up to 30 days after deletion, and mark conversations as unread so they can come back to them later.\n\nSource: Apple\n\nSimilar to how users can set up shared photo libraries in Google Photos, they can now do the same with iCloud Shared Photo Library. This new feature enables you to add up to 5 other people to a library, and everyone in the library can add and edit group photos. Users can choose which photos to share based on a certain start date, or via share photos face detection. It\u2019s also possible to automatically send captured photos to the shared library.\n\nApple Pay Later\n\nSource: Apple\n\nBuy now, pay later services have been on the rise and Apple has decided it wants a part of the $22.86 billion market.\n\nThe company announced Apple Pay Later, a new feature for Apple Pay to let users pay for purchases in 4 installments over time without interest or any fees. Customers will be able to pay for installments over 6 weeks; after paying the first payment at the initial point of sale, they will be expected to make the following 3 payments every two weeks.\n\nNew MacBooks\n\nSource: Apple\n\nTwo years after releasing the 2020 MacBook Air with the M1 chip\u2014Apple\u2019s custom chip\u2014Apple announced a new version of the MacBook Air with its latest M2 Chip. The M2 chip is said to be 18% faster than the M1 CPU and 35% faster than its GPU.\n\nWhat\u2019s inside the MacBook Air?\n\nIt has a 13.6 inch liquid retina display, TouchID built into the Magic keyboard and 2 USB-C Thunderbolt ports for plugging in monitors and peripherals. The new MacBook Air has a 3.5mm combined audio jack, MagSafe support and will fast charging to get the battery to 50% after just 30 minutes.\n\nSince many activities and interactions are now taking place over video calls, the MacBook Air\u2019s built-in camera offers better resolution (at 1080p) and an improved low-light performance.\n\nThough these new Macs have gone live on Apple product listing site, the tech giant said they can\u2019t be purchased yet until next month. The pricing on the new \u200cMacBook Air\u200c starts at $1,199 for an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU, with a 10-core GPU option available for $1,499.\n\nApple also announced the 13-inch MacBook Pro with M2 and set the pricing at $1,299. There are no design updates for the 13-inch model, and it continues to be the only Mac notebook with a Touch Bar.\n\nMac OS\n\nSource: Apple\n\nThe new operating system for Apple\u2019s Laptops, macOS Ventura, includes a new Stage Manager tool, updates to Spotlight, Mail, and Safari, and other continuity features that bring the operating system closer to iOS.\n\nStage Manager gives Mac users a new way to stay focused on the task in front of them while seamlessly switching between apps and windows. Continuity Camera allows iPhone owners to use the iPhone as the webcam on Mac, while the new Handoff feature allows users to start a FaceTime call on their iPhone and easily pass it over to their iPad or Mac.\n\nSource: Apple\n\nWith shared Tab Groups, family or friends can share their favorite sites in Safari and see what tabs others are looking at live. Users can also build a list of bookmarks on a shared Start Page, and even start a Messages conversation or FaceTime call right from Safari \u2014 great for planning a trip or researching a project together.\n\n\u200cmacOS Ventura\u200c will be available to all supported Macs later this year, with a developer beta released on Monday and a public beta testers in July.\n\nSource: Apple\n\n\n\nPasskeys\n\nSource: Apple\n\nLast month, Apple, Google, and Microsoft announced plans to expand support for a common passwordless sign-in standard created by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium.\n\nApple has already kicked its plans into motion with the announcement that Safari will be able to use \u201cpasskeys\u201d instead of passwords. Passkeys are a new system that allows users to log in to websites and apps with biometrics (like fingerprint sensors or facial recognition) without any text-based passwords in the mix.\n\nThis feature is a move to strengthen internet security. Password-only authentication is one of the biggest security problems on the web, and managing so many passwords is cumbersome for consumers, which often leads consumers to reuse the same ones across services.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Bola Tinubu, emerged presidential candidate of the ruling party Wednesday after a night of politicking ahead of the February 2023 general elections. He defeated five other aspirants to pick the party\u2019s ticket the chairman of the organising committee, announced at xyam morning.\n\nTinubu, a former governor of Lagos State and national leader of the APC contested against 22 others at the Ragle Square in the central business district of Abuja.\n\nOver half of 2,322 delegates elected from across the country voted for Tinubu after seven APC candidates stepped down for him earlier.\n\nTinubu clinched the ticket with 1,271 votes which put ahead of his closest contender, Rotimi Amaechi, the immediate past transport minister, who polled 316 votes.\n\nResults of other aspirants, show that Vice-President, Yemi Osibanjo polled 235 votes, Ahmed Lawan, senate president scored 152 votes, Dave Umahi, governor of Ebonyi State polled 38 votes, Yahaya Bello, governor of Kogi State polled 47 votes, Ben Ayade, Cross River state governor scored 37 votes, Ahmed Sani, governor of Zamfara State, polled 4 votes, Rochas Okorocha, former Imo Governor, Ikeobasi Mokelu, former minister of Information and Tunde Bakare, general overseer of Latter Rain Assembly polled zero votes while there were 13 invalid votes.\n\nThe primary which was earlier fixed for 29-30 of last month, was shifted after the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), extended the deadline for political parties to submit the names of their candidates from June 3 to 9.\n\nMore than 25 party chieftains, serving governors, federal lawmakers, business leaders and ministers had purchased the APC presidential form which was sold for a whopping N100 million. While some aspirants bought the forms for themselves, some groups purchased the forms for their preferred aspirants.\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections, the ruling party\u2019s presidential primary was seen as a make or mar by observers.\n\nHowever, the narrative changed last weekend when the Governors of the APC decided to zone the presidential ticket to Southern Nigeria, a decision which came amid debates in recent times on whose region the party\u2019s presidential ticket should be zone to.\n\nThere had been pressure from Southern Nigeria that since incumbent President, Muhammadu Buhari hails from Northern Nigeria, there was the need for power rotation to the South after the expiration of the President two terms of eight years in 2023.\n\nIn recent days, the aspirants and the contending interests had employed all means at their disposal to clinch the presidential ticket.\n\nPundits had predicted that the outcome of the exercise and the way the leadership of the party would manage the process that would produce the candidate, was crucial for the future of the party and its chances in the 2023 general elections.\n\nThere had been controversies in recent days after President Muhammadu Buhari in a meeting with governors of the APC urged them to back him to choose his successor. The President\u2019s decision came as a shock to APC Governors and party leaders, who did not immediately agree with him.\n\nThen came comment by Tinubu in a meeting with Ogun State delegates, that President Buhari would not have won the 2015 presidential election if not for his influence.\n\nTinubu had said that having helped President Buhari to realise his political ambition it was his turn to support him to rule the country.\n\n\u201cI have served enough. I do not want to become history. It is my turn to become president. It is a matter of right for me. Bring it on,\u201d Tinubu had said.\n\nRead also: Our encounter with destiny (Full Speech of Bola Tinubu)\n\nIn some quarters, Tinubu\u2019s victory would come as a surprise, because it was anticipated and predicted, considering that among the aspirants he is probably the only one with a large support base, structure and most popular across the country.\n\nAlso, the APC national leader is seen as having the financial strength to compete with Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the main opposition, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nTinubu a trained accountant, fondly called Asiwaju of Lagos, and Jagaban, was born in Osun State, South West Nigeria.\n\nHe attended St. John\u2019s Primary School, Aroloya, Lagos and Children\u2019s Home School in Ibadan, Nigeria.\n\nHe also went to the United States to study at the phenomenal Richard J. Dailey College in Chicago, Illinois at the age of 23.\n\nTinubu\u2019s political career in Nigeria began in 1992, when he joined the Social Democratic Party (SDP), and was also elected as a senator, where he represented Lagos West Senatorial constituency.\n\nTinubu became the chairman of the senate committee on banking, finance, appropriation and currency at the National Assembly. He further became one of the founding members of National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) which was a body that rooted for the winner of the June 12, 1993 election.\n\nThe group also canvassed for a military to return power to civilian rule.\n\nAmong Tinubu\u2019s key promises if elected president after next year\u2019s presidential election are; Initiating policy towards fighting poverty, revamping the economy and transforming the country to compete favorably with other oil and gas producing countries in the world.\n\nThe man Tinubu\n\nBola Ahmed Tinubu, fondly called Asiwaju of Lagos, and Jagaban (a title given to him in Borgu kingdom, Niger State) was born in Osun State, South West, Nigeria. He attended St. John\u2019s Primary School, Aroloya, Lagos and Children\u2019s Home School in Ibadan, Nigeria. Tinubu went to the United States to study at the phenomenal Richard J.

While some aspirants bought the forms for themselves, some groups purchased the forms for their preferred aspirants.\n\nAhead of the 2023 general elections, the ruling party\u2019s presidential primary was seen as a make or mar by observers.\n\nHowever, the narrative changed last weekend when the Governors of the APC decided to zone the presidential ticket to Southern Nigeria, a decision which came amid debates in recent times on whose region the party\u2019s presidential ticket should be zone to.\n\nThere had been pressure from Southern Nigeria that since incumbent President, Muhammadu Buhari hails from Northern Nigeria, there was the need for power rotation to the South after the expiration of the President two terms of eight years in 2023.\n\nIn recent days, the aspirants and the contending interests had employed all means at their disposal to clinch the presidential ticket.\n\nPundits had predicted that the outcome of the exercise and the way the leadership of the party would manage the process that would produce the candidate, was crucial for the future of the party and its chances in the 2023 general elections.\n\nThere had been controversies in recent days after President Muhammadu Buhari in a meeting with governors of the APC urged them to back him to choose his successor. The President\u2019s decision came as a shock to APC Governors and party leaders, who did not immediately agree with him.\n\nThen came comment by Tinubu in a meeting with Ogun State delegates, that President Buhari would not have won the 2015 presidential election if not for his influence.\n\nTinubu had said that having helped President Buhari to realise his political ambition it was his turn to support him to rule the country.\n\n\u201cI have served enough. I do not want to become history. It is my turn to become president. It is a matter of right for me. Bring it on,\u201d Tinubu had said.\n\nRead also: Our encounter with destiny (Full Speech of Bola Tinubu)\n\nIn some quarters, Tinubu\u2019s victory would come as a surprise, because it was anticipated and predicted, considering that among the aspirants he is probably the only one with a large support base, structure and most popular across the country.\n\nAlso, the APC national leader is seen as having the financial strength to compete with Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the main opposition, the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nTinubu a trained accountant, fondly called Asiwaju of Lagos, and Jagaban, was born in Osun State, South West Nigeria.\n\nHe attended St. John\u2019s Primary School, Aroloya, Lagos and Children\u2019s Home School in Ibadan, Nigeria.\n\nHe also went to the United States to study at the phenomenal Richard J.

It was so visible to the blinds and audible to the deafs as the joy of the people of Ikpe knew no bound, a suggestion that the people were actually waiting for a day like that where the eluded peace and tranquility would returned to the village. This was no doubt the case on Wednesday, April 13, 2022 as the people breathed fresh air of new life.\n\nThe people in their hundreds commended the Oba of Benin for restoring peace to the village through the resolution which bestowed the traditional leadership of the Community in the hands of the Odionwere, Elders and Okaeghele respectively. I\u2019m fact, prior to the Monarch\u2019s resolution, there have been claims and counter claims to different traditional positions in the village raging from \u201cEnogie,\u2019 \u201cOkao\u201d, and \u201cOhen\u201d as the Claimants\u2019 were using these different positions to lay clam to the traditional leadership of the people.\n\nWhile the people were waiting eagerly to see amongst these three Claimants\u2019who we become the chosen traditional leader in the village, the Odionwere, Elders and the Okaeghele were fervently praying for the right person that would bring the needed peace and development to the people to be chosen amongst the trio Claimants\u2019. This is even as it was strange to the people the three positions (Enogie, Okao and Ohen) as there has never been any of these position or title in Ikpe Village.\n\nLittle did the Odionwere, the Elders and Okaeghele know that the mantle of leadership would be bestowed on them by the Oba. This spanked up wide jubilations amongst the residents and indigenes of Ikpe Village right inside the palace of the revered Benin Monarch. The people eulogies the Oba with different appellations and sang his name to high heavens for what they described as royal resolution.\n\nLeading the rain of commendations, the Village Head, Pa. Thompson Omorotionmwan, said: \u201cI on behalf of the elders and the people of Ikpe Village thank the Oba of Benin for the peaceful resolution of the dispute in the village.\n\nThis traditional dispute has been on for a long time until recently when our great Oba resolved the dispute amicably. This is peace now in our Community and we are poised to developing the village more than before.\n\n\u201cIn fact, there has never been the position of Enogie, Ohen or Okao as we only have Odionwere, Edion and Okaeghele in Ikpe Village. This was further affirmed by the Chief Custodian of our Culture, Tradition and Heritage- Oba Ewuare II. His ruling has again saddled the Off, Edion-nene and Okaeghele with the responsibility of taken care of the village for the one which is the Oba\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on the issue of Ohen in Ikpe, the village head said a woman from Evboarue village has been the Ohen not a man as claimed by One Victor Eghenahiore Ekhoesuehi. \u201cFrom time immemorial, a woman has been the Chief Priestess (Ohen) of the village. There was never a time we have Enogie, Ohen or Okao in Ikpe and these people: Victor Eghenahiore Ekhoesuehi, Solomon Obaze and were only clamming this positions because of the development in the village\u201d. \u201cIndeed, Sold Obaze is from Ova in Ovia North-East Local Government Area of Edo State and want to forcibly become the Enogie of Ikpe, but the Oba has ended that ambition now.\n\nSpeaking with our news crew, the Okaeghele of the village, Mr. Alele Alex Ighiriaho commended the Oba for what he described as erudite and sound ruling, adding that the people of the village would continue to be grateful and loyal to the Oba who he opined has brought unprecedented peace and progress to the Benin Kingdom. We are all going to join hands with our Odionwere, Pa. Thompson Omorotionmwan, the Elders towards developing our village and our mode of chosen Odionwere is based on seniority not when one was admitted into the Elders (Edionfold) forum. Our Odionwere is the oldest man in Ikpe.\n\nMr. Alele posited that one of the beauty of Ikpe is that the people does not indulge in any act of land grabbing or any act of the Proscribed Community Development Associations (CDAs) in Ikpe. \u201cWe don\u2019t indulge in any land grabbing or CDA activities in Ikpe Village. This is why developers are happy coming to our community to acquire landed properties.\n\nSpeaking on his ordeal which led to his reminder in prison custody for over two years, Mr. Alele Alex Ighiriaho while narrating what transpired sternly denied involvement in the death of one Iyobo Ilebor and others maintaining that it his prison custody was caused by some mischief-makers in the village who where not happy with him over his stance to maintain peace in Ikpe.\n\nAccording to Alele: \u201cAfter my appointment as Okaeghele of Ikpe by the Odionwere and the elders, the people then decided that it was imperative with demarcate our boundary with Ukhiri Community and other boundary communities as we have common boundaries with Obagie, Utesil, Evbokagba and Ukhiri Villages respectively.\n\n\u201cDuring this period, we were all working togethe as one in the village including Mr. Michael Agbonlahor, the self-styled Ohen, Solomon Obaze, the self acclaimed Okao, Victor Eghenakhahiore, self cliamed Enogie, and others.\n\n\u201cOn the said day of our boundary demarcation with Ukhiri, it was my assistant, Iyobo Ilebor also known as Agada, and one Dangote were the people that led others for the demarcation as i was not around and they could not wait for me to come before they went for the boundary demarcation with Ukhiri people.\n\n\u201cMind you, the decision to know and have all our boundaries demarcated was a collectively taken by the Odionwere, elders and the people.\n\nIn fact, it was Mr. Michael Agbonlahor that supported the boundary demarcation with the sum of N300,000.\n\nwhile I was at somewhere in a neighbouring village waiting for the people that went for the boundary demarcation to return to Ikpe, information got to me that my people that went for the boundary demarcation were attacked by the poeple of Ukhiri Village.\n\n\u201cI was told that Dangote was shot while the whereabouts of Iyobo Ilebor and others were unknown. So, I left the hotel i was for Ikpe and not quite long after I arrived Ikpe, some of the peole that went for the boundary demarcation started returning back to the villge and said that they did not see Iyobo Ilebor and others as Dangote was shot as Ukhiri people attacked them during the boundary demarcation.\n\n\u201cThereafter, myself and the Okaeghele of Ukhirir were invited to Ugbekun Divisional Police Headquarters by the then DPO, one Mrs, Philo for interrogations and questioning about what happaning during the boundary demarcation exercise. It was at this stage that both elders of Ikpe and Ukhiri now decided to call for an enlarge meeting with a view to unravel what happen during the demarcation. During the meeting with both communities, it was decided that both parties should maintain peace while investigation is ongoing.\n\n\u201cBut this same Michael, the self acclaimed Ohen called and said I should join hands wit him to chase Solomon Obaze,Eghenayahiore, the self accaliamed Enogie and Okao respectivey away from the community so he, Micheal can assume the leadership position in ths village. But i told him no that I cant do what he said I should do that we are all from the same community, hence he becaame angry with me and singlehandedly appointed one Desmond Idele, a maternal relation of mine as a factional Okaeghele of Ikpe.\n\n\u201cSo, Michael and Solomon then decided to cause crisis and confusion in the community until this Wednesday when our Oba now resolved the crisis and brought peace back to our commuvity again. Again, because I refused to join Michael to chase Solomon and Eghenayahiore away from the community, they and brought out the issue of Iyobo Ilebor and accussed me of having hands in the yet to be confirmed death of Iyobo.\n\n\u201cI was arrested by the DSS on frivolious accusations and later reminded to Oko Prison. But I thank God, our ancestors and the great Benin Oba that I was vindicated, discharged and aquitted from the allegation at the hend of the day by the court. Painfully, these persons are still writing different frivolous petition still against me over the issue of Iyobo Ilebor to Alagbon,CIID, Force Headquaters, Abuja.\n\n\u201cI want to state emphatically here again to members of the public that i don\u2019t have hand in the suspected death of Iyobo Ilebor and that it was the communal crisis between Ukhiri and Ikpe that led to the disappearance of Iyobo and others yet to be seen.In fact, as at today, whether Iyobo is dead or alive I don\u2019t know. They were five persons that went missing after the attack of Ukhiri and we have not seeing them till now.\n\n\u201cBut we are hearing that one of the five missing persons has travelled abroad through land and whether Iyobo is alive or not we don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cI have being taken to court in three different occasions over the issue of Iyobo and I am the person that gave this same Iyobo a car, opened business centre for him, rented a flatfor himand als open a business shop for his wife. Someone that was working with me and I have been assistig, how will I kill such person? So, I dont have hand in whatever that happened to Iyobo Ilebor\u201d, he stated.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",
          "summary": "This is even as it was strange to the people the three positions (Enogie, Okao and Ohen) as there has never been any of these position or title in Ikpe Village.\nThis spanked up wide jubilations amongst the residents and indigenes of Ikpe Village right inside the palace of the revered Benin Monarch.\nThis traditional dispute has been on for a long time until recently when our great Oba resolved the dispute amicably.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t indulge in any land grabbing or CDA activities in Ikpe Village.\n\u201cMind you, the decision to know and have all our boundaries demarcated was a collectively taken by the Odionwere, elders and the people.",

But the way to demonstrate that we can get on with this job is to unite.\n\n\u201cThe movement we created in 2013 is beyond individuals. Together, we made history by becoming the first party in our country\u2019s history to unseat a party in power and propel our candidate into the Presidency through a peaceful democratic transfer of power.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that Bola Ahmed Tinubu will safeguard and improve on this democratic achievement and legacy.\n\n\u201dHe is the right candidate for Nigeria\u2019s aspiration because he is the APC\u2019s candidate and under the continued stewardship of our party. Nigeria can achieve greatness and fulfil its destiny in Africa and the World.\n\n\u201cThe high point of this extraordinary convention of our party was the energy of the Presidential aspirants and it is from amongst them that we have chosen the most popular leader.\n\n\u201cI recognise and commend the enthusiasm and self-confidence amongst our party men and women.\n\n\u201cI also thank the delegates for making the right decision leading to the emergence of our candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\u201d",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nNigerian Mining and Geosciences Society, NMGS, has said that its team of professionals have carried out an investigation into the gas emission and flare encountered during the drilling of a water borehole at Caritas University Amorji Nike, Emene Enugu, Enugu State.\n\nThe 31st President of the NMGS, Alabo Charlesye David Charles stated that the team had interacted with the drillers, the members of the community and other stakeholders and also had immediate impression on the geology and geomorphology of the area.\n\nCharles said that the team had submitted its report and the NMGS hereby presents a summary of the findings of which was suspected that the well penetrated a fracture/fault zone which served as a conduit or migration pathway for hydrocarbon (gas) generated in the deeper buried mature shales of the Nkporo/Enugu, Awgu and Eze-Aku geological formations.\n\nHe pointed out that the initial speculation that the flare was methane gas from fracking of the mature and fractured Nkporo/Enugu Formation is discountenanced due to the sustained flare that has maintained its intensity for over 7 days.\n\nHe explained that it was possible that the borehole penetrated the angular unconformity zone separating the Awgu/Agbani Sandstone of the Benue Trough and the Nkporo/Enugu Formation in the Anambra basin since the borehole was sited near the margin of the Anambra Basin.\n\nHe further explained that Stratigraphic traps may have existed in the basal Nkporo/Enugu Formation as interfingering sands or as stratigraphic/structural combination and sub-unconformity traps at this depth.\n\nMaking his recommendations, the NMGS President said that there was an urgent need to extinguish the flare and save the ecosystem and environment from its negative impact disclosing that this could be done by injecting a high-density cement slurry or drilling mud which would be forcefully reinjected into the borehole at high pressure to snuff off oxygen supply and kill the fire.\n\n\u201cDrilling a relief well to kill the pressure and kill the flare may not be feasible because the subsurface geology and structure of the area are not understood.\n\n\u201cRelevant authorities should liaise with experts in the management of blowout and flares in the oil and gas sector in Nigeria on the best method to be deployed in extinguishing the flare.\n\n\u201cFuture deep borehole drilling in areas generally underlain by shales, irrespective of drilling history, should employ rotary drilling method using appropriate drilling mud to limit the effect of blowouts since drilling mud helps maintain pressure balance in wells.\n\n\u201cProfessional bodies like the NMGS with highly experienced and well-trained geoscientists should be involved in efforts by agencies of government and other organizations to find solutions to this hazard and further investigate the gas resources of the area.\n\n\u201cDetailed geological and geophysical studies should be carried out in the area and environs to help unravel the subsurface structure, stratigraphy and hydrocarbon prospects of the area and by extension of the southern Benue Trough and Anambra Basin.\n\n\u201cIf the gas resource in the area is found to be substantial, the federal government and Enugu State Government should develop a framework to harness the gas resources to enhance industrialization and job creation for the benefit of the state and the nation,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe added that as the foremost professional body in Nigeria with a pool of highly experienced and well-trained professionals, the NMGS has played critical roles in the development of the natural resources of the nation.\n\nNMGS is the umbrella professional and scientific body of all Geoscientists and Mining Engineers in the Solid Minerals, Oil and Gas, Water and Metallurgical sectors with a membership strength of over 10,000 cutting across both the private and public sectors.\n\nThe NMGS has statutory representation in several government agencies and organization including the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, the Nigerian Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative, NEITI, the Council of the Nigerian Mining Engineers and Geoscientists, COMEG, the Petroleum Training Institute amongst others.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, NMCO, Engr Simon Obadiah Nkom has said that Nigeria spent $13 million on bitumen importaton in 2020.\n\nNkom made this known at a round table at the just concluded three -day Nigeria-Africa Natural Resources and Energy Investment Summit, NAFNIS, in Abuja.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria was blessed with 42.74 billion metric tonnes of bitumen reserve yet untapped, located in Ogun, Ondo, Delta, Rivers and Bayelsa States.\n\nHe said currently the global market for bitumen was $42 billion, but that the market could increase to $66 billion by 2027 due to its high demand.\n\n\u201cThis shows that there will be rise in the value of bitumen market by 2027 which is why Nigeria should look into bitumen exploration that will bring development to the country.\n\n\u201cNigeria can conserve its foreign exchange when it starts exploration on the mineral and this will bring a boost to our economy.\n\nNkom stressed that Nigeria was ranked 6th in global bitumen deposit as demand for the mineral in Nigeria is high due to high road construction.\n\n\u201cNigeria has more than 160, 000 kilometres of roads to be tarred while only 60,000 are already tarred,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking at the event, Cyril Azobu, the Partner/Mining Leader, PriceWaterhouseCooper said \u201cNigeria is endowed with a good quality of untapped bitumen.\n\n\u201cBitumen is a big demand all over the world, Nigeria can serve as a hub for local supply of bitumen or asphalt for export in sub-Saharan to other countries,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, issued a letter of award on November 11, 2021, to PwC to act as its Transaction Advisor and Programme Manager for the concession of the bitumen block to potential investors.\n\n\u201cProgrammes had been lined up for the successful take for bitumen concession to the right investors, noting that hopefully it will be concluded before the end of this year.\u201d\n\nHe added that the ministry in collaboration with PwC will embark on a sensitisation workshop and an investor conference will be held soon to ensure judicious exploitation of the nation\u2019s bitumen deposits.\n\nAfter repeatedly failing in the past to harness its bitumen reserves, the government in April announced it would grant concessions of bitumen blocks to prospective local and international companies in a bid to end the importation of the mineral deposit in the country.\n\nIt consequently appointed PriceWaterhouseCoopers as its transaction advisor in November 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, the total value of capital importation into Nigeria in Q1 2022 stood at US$1,573.14 million from US$2,187.63 million in the preceding quarter, the National Bureau of Statistics has said.\n\nIn the its newly released data on Thursday, NBS said the figure shows a decrease of 28.09 per cent compared to last year.\n\nWhen compared to the corresponding quarter of 2021, capital importation decreased by 17.46 per cent from US$1,905.89 million.\n\nThe bureau statistics showed that the largest amount of capital importation by type was received through Portfolio Investment, which accounted for 60.87 per cent ($957.58 million). This was followed by Other Investment with 29.28 per cent (US$460.59 million) and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) accounted for 9.85 per cent ($154.97 million) of total capital imported in Q1 2022.",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, Dr Abdulrazaq Garba, has said that there has been an influx of investors because of the quality of geoscience data the agency had generated.\n\nGarba made this known yesterday during an interactive session with newsmen in the agency\u2019s headquarters in Abuja.\n\nHe stated that it was only the right type of data that could attract appropriate investors noting that the the agency has improved from generating surface maps.\n\n\u201cBefore what we do is surface maps but we have improved, we also achieved this using the appropriate tools to produce geodata. We have published the first set of data on geochronology recently, which has to do with ages of minerals,\u201d he said.\n\nExplaining capacity development of the NGSA, the Director General pointed out that the agency was the bridge between the academia and the industry.\n\nHe also said that sustainability was the key to driving the mining sector into greater heights as he solicited for more funding to ensure continued growth and development of the economy.\n\nHe further stated that the success stories of the Nigeria Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, could be seen in the increased revenue generation of sister agency such as The Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, MCO, and Mines Inspectorate.\n\nSpeaking on the NIMEP Project, he said that it was a means to an end adding that there was no end to data generation as Nigeria was still at the upstream where data generation is very important.\n\nHe explained that the project was a success story as it has been able to produce Three Hundred and Thirty Three (333) maps albums presenting the 36 States and resources found in them.\n\n\u201cWhat we had when I came on board was the Interactive maps, currently we have produced Lithostructural maps that has Tetonic information about Nigeria,\u201d he added\n\nHe said Nigeria has high grade hard rock lithium mineral where pockets of occurrences has been discovered stating that its lithium occurrences were of grade and that investors were currently eager to pay large amount for some of the dataset generated\n\nNigerian Pilot reports that lithium is an element valuable for the production of glass, aluminum products, batteries that recharge mobile phones, laptops, digital cameras and electric vehicles.\n\n\u201cNigeria lithium is hot cake now, the mineral was discovered in several parts of the country in the course of the National Integrated Mineral Exploration Project, NIMEP, during exploration and we did investigation and came up with analysis and discovered that Nigeria lithium is of high grade.\n\n\u201cHigh grade in the sense that the standard worldwide for even exploration and mining starts from 0.4 per cent lithium oxide but when we started exploration and mining, we saw one per cent up to 13 per cent lithium oxide content.\n\n\u201cAnother advantage of Nigeria lithium is hard rock lithium found and that is what investors are looking out for worldwide.\n\n\u201cWe even heard discussion with some private companies with mining licences in Nigeria and they conducted test on the lithium and we also collaborated with Canada on that too,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that all data received from NIMEP were quite exciting and would boost the economy.\n\nNIMEP is a hallmark project that provides reliable geo-sciences information needed by investors to make the right mining investment decisions in Nigeria.\n\nHe said that a track of mineralisation almost two to 10 km was discovered close to Abuja, adding that resource evaluation was conducted on the area and anomolous gold, lead and silver were discovered with Tungsten.\n\n\u201cGold mineralisation found there has high content of tungsten which is used as an additive in the production of steel, therefore, any company mining there will be mining gold associated with lead, silver and tungsten.\n\nGarba said that many companies both local and international investors are interested in the data set generated.\n\nHe said that pronouncement would be made soon on companies that had shown interest on those data saying that \u201cwhat we want to do is we are projecting to we concession the areas that are free through the Nigeria Mining Cadastre Office, NMCO, so interested investors can get licence and data and take it to the next level.\n\n\u201cThese are the things we are looking at and working on to ensure that the data we generate are useful to investors.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile in his presentation at the just concluded Nigeria- Africa Natural Resources and Energy Investment Summit, NAFNIS, the NGSA boss disclosed that government had identified seven strategic minerals based on the information available on them.\n\n\u201cThe seven minerals are Coal, Iron Ore, Bitumen, Gold, Limestone, Lead/Zinc and Barite,\u201d he listed.\n\nGarba said that the government had invested funds in generating Geoscience data for those minerals to enable investors have adequate knowledge about them.\n\n\u201cBasically, you will agree with me that the business of mining is not meant for government to do investigation on minerals, but in this our particular climate, we need to take this information up to a particular level whereby the minerals will be attractive to investors.\n\nThe NGSA has over a hundred years been the sole generator and validator of geo data and geological information.",

Now it is time to put the process behind us.\n\n\u201cBecause what we can all agree is that the APC remains the party that can best deliver on the priorities of the Nigerian people. But the way to demonstrate that we can get on with this job is to unite.\n\n\u201cThe movement we created in 2013 is beyond individuals. Together, we made history by becoming the first party in our country\u2019s history to unseat a party in power and propel our candidate into the Presidency through a peaceful democratic transfer of power.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that Bola Ahmed Tinubu will safeguard and improve on this democratic achievement and legacy. He is the right candidate for Nigeria\u2019s aspiration because he is the APC\u2019s candidate and under the continued stewardship of our party. Nigeria can achieve greatness and fulfill its destiny in Africa and the World.\n\n\u201cThe high point of this extraordinary convention of our party was the energy of the Presidential aspirants and it is from amongst them that we have chosen the most popular leader.\n\n\u201cI recognize and commend the enthusiasm and self-confidence amongst our party men and women.\n\n\u201cI also thank the delegates for making the right decision leading to the emergence of our candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\u201d",

They include Tinubu, Osinbajo, Amaechi, Lawan, Umahi, and Rochas Okorocha.\n\nOthers are Yahaya Bello, Tein Jack-Rich, Emeka Nwajiuba, Ben Ayade, Ikeobasi Mokelu, Ogbonnaya Onu, Tunde Bakare, and Sani Yerima.\n\nVIDEO RECAP\n\nAkpabio Steps Down\n\nI am ably qualified to be your President.

And I humbly accept the nomination of this convention to be the presidential candidate of our enlightened, humanitarian and great party, the All Progressives Congress.\n\nI also offer my sincere gratitude to President Buhari for his calm and prudent leadership throughout this process. I thank him, also, for his steadfast determination to ensure a level playing field and a free and fair primary process for every aspirant. Without him, I would not be standing here today as the new flagbearer of Nigeria\u2019s party.\n\nI thank the governors for their invaluable contribution to internal democracy and unity.\n\nI commend the party leadership and organizers for the conduct of a successful convention.\n\nThank you, the delegates, for the confidence you have shown in me. I will prove that your choice was a wise one. You have moved our party and country towards its best future. On your mandate I shall stand.\n\nI commend my fellow aspirants. It is a difficult thing to run for president. The stiff and bold competition you offered made our party stronger and made me better. I must say a special word of thanks to the seven aspirants [Alhaji Badaru Abubakar; Sen.; Ibikunle Amosun; Sen. Ajayi Borrofice; Rt. Hon. Dimeji Bankole; Sen. Godswill Akpabio; Dr. Kayode Fayemi; and Barr.(Mrs.) Uju Kennedy] who chose to step down their personal ambitions for the good of the party and the unity of our purpose.\n\nThe competition is now over.\n\nThose who did not support me, you have nothing to fear. I hold no grudges or grievances.\n\nLet us each agree to join hands in defeating the PDP and beating back our common foes of poverty, terror and violence. We now have a date with destiny in February 2023. Let us win so Nigeria can become the nation it is intended to be.\n\nTo my campaign team and close advisors. Your dedication, long hours, and sound advice have brought me to this point.\n\nI thank my beautiful wife, Oluremi, for her patience and wise counsel. Thank you for standing by my side. I am indeed a fortunate man.\n\nNow, permit me to address the nation.\n\nYes, we face serious problems. But I believe that we have it within us to reach our finest destiny. With help from God, we shall make this nation better for the generations to come.\n\nPresident Muhamamdu Buhari has already laid a solid foundation in security, economy, and anti-corruption. We will build upon this for the salvation of our people.\n\nSo, I ask you:\n\nDo we dare reform our national economy such that prosperity grows as poverty vanishes?\n\nYes, we dare.\n\nDo we dare provide meaningful education and jobs for our youths so that they may strive for a better future?\n\nYes, we dare. Our teeming youth population is our nation\u2019s greatest asset. We will create jobs for our youth from the Zamfara and Osun gold deposits to the vast agricultural lands across the country. We will create new ooportunities in the FINTECH sector, the creative and entertainment industries, digital skills and other areas.\n\nDo we dare feed our nation and provide the farmer a solid income for his toil?\n\nYes, we dare.\n\nDo we dare construct a society where the vulnerable, the weak, the disadvantaged and the elderly are attended to and loved?\n\nYes, for we must care for those who cannot care for themselves.\n\nDo we dare muster our collective strength to conquer terrorism, kidnapping, and violent evil of any form?\n\nYes, we dare.\n\nAfter the PDP convention, I commended Abubakar Atiku. The ensuing contest between our party and his will be one of competing visions.\n\nOur vision is of progress and the future that can be. We must defeat the PDP\u2019s reactionary ideals.\n\nOur better, more progressive vision of Nigeria shall secure a better society for all Nigerians.\n\nMay this be our task arising from this convention. Let nothing stand in the way of our achieving a more just society and a greater Nigeria.https://www.tvcnews.tv/2022/06/ganduje-congratulates-asiwaju-as-apc-flagbearer-commends-other-aspirants-for-sportsmanship/\n\nGod bless the APC.\n\nGod bless Nigeria.",

          "text": "With some last minute intrigues and horse-trading, a former governor of Lagos State, often addressed as National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is projected to emerge the party\u2019s presidential candidate for the 2023 elections.\n\nAccording to exit polls, Tinubu is likely to win most votes in the North-west, South-west, some North-central and doing well in other places.\n\nIndications that the odds might favour Tinubu began to manifest after some of the aspirants started to stand down their aspiration and declare support for him and urged their delegates to vote for him at the convention.\n\nVoting had to be halted due to fears over security concerns thus pushing the process till Wednesday morning. There were issues of accreditation and crowd loitering too close to the designated point of voting. Hawkers of soft drinks, water and other essentials practically took over the arena. It took the election and planning committee and security personnel some time to restore order before voting resumed.\n\nThose, who stepped down for Tinubu were former Minister for Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio; former governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun; Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi; Governor of Jigawa State, Abubakar Badaru; former Speaker of House of Representatives, Hon. Dimeji Bankole; Senator Ajayi Boroffice and the only female aspirant, Uju Ohanenye.\n\nTinubu, who was the first to address the special convention, held at the Eagle Square, Abuja, however, boasted he had the capacity to articulate a vision of progress for the country if elected candidate of the party and ultimately, president of the country.\n\nBut President Muhammadu Buhari, who spoke before voting commenced, enjoined the delegates to vote the candidate with the best chance of emerging victorious at the general election.\n\nVice-President Yemi Osinbajo, who also took his turn to address the convention after all other aspirants had taken their turns, spoke to the heart of the delegates, when he said there was no one they would wish the nation well and still vote someone they did not believe in.\n\nAt the same time, the National Chairman of APC, Senator Abdulahi Adamu, yesterday, told members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party that washing their dirty linen in public was not a mark of courage but a mark of irresponsibility and indiscipline.\n\nBuhari, while addressing the delegates, noted that the critical task ahead of the Adamu-led National Working Committee (NWC) was to continue to forge the unity of purpose among party members and to keep securing needed compromises in the interest of the party.\n\nThe president said the candidate of the party must be knowledgeable, fair-minded nationalist with a very strong belief in the unity of the country and strength of character and purpose to steer the country forward.\n\nBuhari also urged party officials and delegates to follow due process and abide by all extant laws and regulations pertaining to election of the party flag bearer.\n\nHis words: \u201dAs we go into the presidential primary, I urge all to keep to the same spirit. We must avoid acrimony and maintain the spirit of sportsmanship. The critical task ahead of the Abdullahi Adamu-led NWC remains to continue to forge the unity of purpose among party members and to keep securing needed compromises in the interest of our great party.\n\n\u201dI enjoin you all to be fair to all and to create a level playing field for all the presidential aspirants in the coming crucial party exercise.\n\n\u201dPlease, follow due process in all the party decisions and I call on all party members, particularly, the party officials and delegates to abide by all extant laws, rules, and regulations and to consider voting for the presidential candidate with the best chances of securing victory for our great party in the coming general election,.\u2019\n\nWhile noting that the principal challenge before the party was the need to keep a united front, Buhari affirmed that the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the party has vested its powers in NWC for the time being, as requested, and in compliance with the party constitution, to ensure smooth party administration and operations in these critical times in the overall interest of the party.\n\n\u201dPlease do not hesitate to call on me and all other appropriate quarters for the help that will propel our great party to the victory that we all seek. To ensure a hitch-free presidential primary, please, let us work collectively in the interest of our great party and our great country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President, therefore, congratulated all the winners, and the newly emerged party standard bearers for the 2023 general election and urged the winner to be magnanimous in victory, particularly, towards fellow aspirants, who conceded to him.\n\nOn his part, Adamu, who came down on the NWC members, frowned at their approach in dealing with issues.\n\nMembers of the NWC, had addressed the press to deflate Adamu\u2019s plan to impose the Senate President, Senator Ahmed Lawan, as the consensus candidate of the party.\n\nIn his response, he said, \u201cOn the 20th of April this year, I drew the attention to the need for our party to be disciplined; that a political party such as APC, the ruling party, at the heart of our national development, must be exemplary and discipline and fidelity in its core values.\n\n\u201cWashing our dirty linen in the public is not a mark of courage, it is a mark of irresponsibility, indiscipline and indiscriminate to obey extant rules and regulations and play by them.\u201d\n\nThe national chairman was of the opinion that unity was the only glue that could hold the party together, saying the ruling party could not go into the general election next year without putting its house in order.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cit doesn\u2019t take rocket science to unite a party; it takes sincerity of purpose, commitment and determination to sacrifice our individual interest and ambitions for the larger interest of the party.\u201d\n\nAdamu, however, noted that the healing process in the ruling party had commenced, addingthat, \u201cthings are not falling apart; things are holding up and I am grateful to you all for standing by me and members of the National Working Committee in seeing that we carry out the first order of business in our party and that is the total reconciliation of all the state branches of the APC that were held hostage by avoidable grievances.\n\n\u201cWe have nothing to gain in portraying our party in a bad light. We have everything to lose in undermining the integrity of our great party. I found it necessary to make this observations.\u201d\n\nAdamu said it was a clear indication that the ruling party had emerged stronger from the grievances, noting that the party was united and speaking with one voice once.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAt the end of the current exercise, we shall begin a steady march towards the 2023 elections, going by our resolute, commitment to win and win big in all levels of elective offices up for contest.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, Tinubu said the candidate of the party must be able to unite Nigerians from all parts of the country and must have the experience, leadership, knowledge, and extensive personal contacts to steer a diverse, complicated Nigeria through this challenging period in a dynamic world.\n\n\u201cThe other candidates are all good men. But I sincerely believe I am the person this moment calls for.\n\n\u201cI cannot, on this day, talk of a bright and prosperous future without also declaring my determination to fight terrorism and insecurity to the very end. I mourn the lives already lost and vow to do everything possible to ensure justice and forever erase terror from our land.\n\n\u201cToday, you decide our presidential nominee. Let it be the man, who can best articulate a vision of progress and development then implement it. Let us always honour the promise the APC made to Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nOsinbajo, in his speech, said the future of the country and the children should compel the delegates to vote right, adding that they could not wish the country well and vote for someone they do not believe in.\n\nHe said, \u201c2322 delegates will decide the future of our children and their own children. The future of our children compels all our distinguished delegates to vote right tonight.\n\n\u201cYou cannot wish this country well and vote for someone you do not believe in. To our dear delegates, when you vote tonight, know that your votes tonight carry the answer for the future of our children and for our country.\u201d\n\nThe vice president said the present situation in the country did not need a leader that would learn on the job, adding that it was the main reason he was the best man to take over from the president in 2023.\n\n\u201cOne thing is certain, the circumstances of the country will not allow the next leader to learn on the job. For the past seven years, I have learnt on the job. I will be prepared from day one,\u201d he added.\n\nImmediate past Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, also called on the delegates to ask all the presidential aspirants the sources of their money, adding that, if elected, he would develop the country\u2019s economy.\n\nAmaechi said: \u201cDear delegates, assess us by our contributions. Do not assess us by how much we bring here, because if you assess us by how much we bring here, ask all of us what is our source of revenue? How did we get all these funds?\n\n\u201cThe problem of the Nigerian state is all of us. Nigerian politicians will come and talk to you, bring out money and we accept them. Four years after, they will come back and still make the same promises. Do not vote for me if I lie to you. Do not vote for me if I have not performed but I have performed.\n\n\u201cThere is need to move forward, to ask Nigerians to hire me and fire me if I fail. If you vote for me, the first thing is that we must develop our economy, bringing it back to industrialisation and production. We will rebuild our universities to be places of learning. There will be rule of law. People will be punished for their crimes.\u201d\n\nGovernor of Kogi state, Yahaya Bello, said he was in the race to win, adding, \u201cI didn\u2019t come this far to chicken out,\u201d boasting that at the end of the contest, he would emerge victorious.\n\nPastor Tunde Bakare said his aspiration to be the president of Nigeria wasn\u2019t about him, but about the people of Nigeria.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is about your people, it is about my people, the Nigerian people, who will once again have a reason to believe that they have a stake in their nation when our presidential commission for National Reconciliation, Reintegration and Rebirth restores lasting peace to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe time is now and the hour has come. Tonight, I am not here to step down. By the grace of God, I am here to step up with the support of the delegates as the 16th president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Dear delegates, as we converge in our nation\u2019s capital to collectively take a historic step towards the realisation of a nation that works.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the youngest presidential aspirant, Nicolas Felix, also a pastor, stepped down for Osinbajo.\n\nBut voting was still ongoing at the time of going to press, while only three states had voted, before the planning committee halted the process on account of some challenges.\n\nEFCC: Why We Stormed APC Convention\n\nThe Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), yesterday, explained why operatives of the commission stormed Eagle Square, venue of the presidential primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nAllegations of financial inducement of delegates made the rounds at the primaries.\n\nSome sources claimed that there was inducement of delegates to the tune of $25,000,$30,000 and $40,000 in some cases, which exchanged hands at the venue of the election.\n\nSpokesman of the EFCC, Mr Wilson Uwujaren, in a chat with THISDAY, said the operatives of the commission were at the Eagle Square to monitor the primaries.\n\n\u201cIs it not obvious? It is obvious. We are there to monitor proceedings,\u201d he said.\n\nThe agency had carried out a similar operation during the primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which was won by former Vice President Atiku Abubakar.\n\nBut in spite of the hoopla over financial inducement at the PDP primaries, no arrest was made.\n\nBello: Playing By Rules Only Way to Win Presidency\n\nGovernor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, has declared that the only way the ruling APC could win the presidency again in 2023 was if it played by the rules of the game.\n\nHe said any attempt to exclude some aspirants from participating in the electoral process or skew the process to favour some persons or groups against others would spell doom for the party.\n\nSpeaking Tuesday with newsmen after meeting behind closed-doors with President Muhammadu Buhari, at the State House, Abuja, Bello, a presidential aspirant of the APC, alleged that governors of the party from the North and some elite conspired against him to muscle him out of the contest.\n\nAsked if he was sure that the ruling party would win the presidency in 2023, the governor said, \u201cI\u2019m very optimistic that APC will return to power, if we play by the rules of the game.\u201d\n\nOn what he meant by playing by the rules of the game, he said, \u201cFollow all the laws, non-exclusion of anybody, who wants to participate and carrying everybody along and ensuring that there\u2019s fairness, equity and justice.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated his opposition to the rotational presidency, saying it doesn\u2019t give room for the emergence of a competent person to pilot the affairs of the country.\n\nOn what was the agenda of his meeting with the President, the governor said, \u201cOf course, you know that today (yesterday) is the special national convention of our party, where a presidential candidate from the All Progressives Congress will emerge. Leading up to today, there have been various controversies and issues before today.\n\n\u201cYesterday (Monday), a certain video went viral, that I got angry and I left a particular meeting and then, of course, this is a period, when a lot of lies, a lot of misconceptions, will fill the air. Then, we have our father, the leader of our party, who should always know the reality or the truth, and then I came to brief him exactly what happened.\n\n\u201cWell, some of my colleagues, led by the self-proclaimed leader of them, ganged up to suppress the voice of the people, the voice of over 26 million Nigerians, the voice of the women, the voice of people living with special needs, the voice of the choice of the party. So, that\u2019s exactly what I revolted against. I decided to leave the meeting where such concoction were ongoing. That\u2019s exactly what took place.\u201d\n\nAsked to mention the name of governor that he was talking about, he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mention a name because I am honorable enough. The office I occupy today is an office that should be dignified. Myself, I have respect for leaders, for elders, even if some elders do not respect themselves, I have high respect for those in positions of authority. So, I wouldn\u2019t mention names.\u201d\n\nOn why he was not on the same page with Northern APC governors after several attempts made by the governors as revealed by the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai, to make him consider his colleagues\u2019 position of conceding the presidency to south, he said he was not consulted by anyone.\n\n\u201cI am a unifier, I have demonstrated that severally in my state. I have demonstrated that severally in the various tasks that were given me by the party. So, nobody consulted me. Nobody consulted me over the decision that they took and I will rather say that they were railroaded by certain interest who want to be VP at all costs.\n\n\u201cThe issue of turn-by-turn presidency, I continue to oppose it because the insecurity that is facing us today does not respect turn-by-turn presidency, every part of this country is faced with insecurity. Every part of this country is wanting prosperity and the seeming or the disunity that we experiencing today in Nigeria, we want unity in this country and that is exactly what I stand for.\u201d\n\nOnly Tinubu Can Defeat Atiku, Says Group\n\nA pro-Bola Tinubu group, The Consolidation Ambassadors (TCA), has said the former Lagos State governor, was the only one that could defeat the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, in the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe group, in a statement titled: \u201cOur Stand\u201d and signed by Dr. Adelanke Peter, said for Nigeria to consolidate on the achievements of President Muhammadu Buhari, a bold, frank, independent, transparent, intelligent, smart-thinker like Tinubu was needed.\n\nPeter said, \u201cAlthough the TCA is not biased towards any presidential aspirant contesting to be the presidential flag bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC). We, however, owe it to the party and party members to guide them in terms of direction ahead of the National Convention.\n\n\u201cThe Consolidation Ambassadors (TCA) with its firm foundation within 36 States of the Federation and FCT, emerged as worthy Ambassadors of the APC who recognised and appreciated the progress made by the President Buhari led administration.\n\n\u201cEspecially in the areas of infrastructure, human capital development, agriculture, anti-corruption, digital economic transformation and all inclusive governance. The group said it resolved to identify and unify all political structures and supporters of the aspirants that contested elective posts under the umbrella of the APC.\n\n\u201cParticularly the 23 presidential aspirants by providing the necessary support to the flag bearers after the primaries. \u201cIt is for this reason, after due consultations and considerations, that we suggest that the party should field a candidate that can stand shoulder-to-shoulder, eye-ball-to-eye-ball, kobo-for-kobo, tactics-for-tactics.\u201d\n\nDeath at APC Convention\n\nThe All Progressives Congress delegate from Buji Local Government Area (LGA) of Jigawa State, Alhaji Isa Baba Buji, has died. He was aged 61. The delegate, who was present to participate in his party\u2019s presidential primaries died yesterday afternoon in Abuja. It wasn\u2019t, however, certain what actually killed Buji. Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, has expressed sadness over the sudden death of the delegate, describing it as saddening.\n\nOsinbajo, in a statement by his media Aide, Laolu Akande, condoled with the family, associates, government and people of Jigawa State and prayed for the repose of the soul of the delegate.",
          "summary": "According to exit polls, Tinubu is likely to win most votes in the North-west, South-west, some North-central and doing well in other places.\nHis words: \u201dAs we go into the presidential primary, I urge all to keep to the same spirit.\nTo ensure a hitch-free presidential primary, please, let us work collectively in the interest of our great party and our great country,\u201d he said.\nPeter said, \u201cAlthough the TCA is not biased towards any presidential aspirant contesting to be the presidential flag bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\nWe, however, owe it to the party and party members to guide them in terms of direction ahead of the National Convention.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s federal government has said consumption of unsafe or contaminated food was causing the country and other low income economies estimated $95 billion in productivity decline.\n\nThe Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire who spoke at this year\u2019s World Food Safety Day in Abuja, on Tuesday, said the public health burden due to food borne diseases was comparable to malaria and HIV-AIDS.\n\n\u201cUnsafe food hinders development especially on low and middle Income economies which lose around $95 billion in productivity associated with illness, disability and premature death suffered by workers,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking on the diseases resulting from in-take of contaminated food, Ehanire said over 200 diseases were caused by unsafe food consumption.\n\nAccording to the minister, the magnitude of the public health burden due to food borne diseases was comparable to malaria and HIV-AIDS, adding that under five-year children were higher at risk of malnutrition and mortality due to unsafe food consumption.\n\nHe also said the children share about 40 per cent of the food borne disease burden.\n\n\u201cUnsafe food causes one in every six deaths from diarrhea, a major killer of children of the age group,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the World Food Safety Day provided an opportunity to raise awareness about the dangers of unsafe food, government, producers, handlers and consumers having a role to play in making food safe.\n\nOn her part, the Director General, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, (NAFDAC), Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, urged Nigerians to always ensure that only safe, and wholesome food were consumed to boost immunity and improve the body\u2019s natural defenses in fighting diseases.\n\nShe said Nigerians do not need medicines if they eat right, stressing that eating right means making healthy food choices from safe, wholesome, and nutritious foods.\n\nAdeyeye said this during NAFDAC\u2019s celebration of the fourth World Food Safety Day 2022 with the theme: \u201cSafer Food, Better Health,\u201d where she opined that where food is unsafe, \u201cour nutritional goals cannot be achieved.\u201d\n\nIn a statement signed by the Resident Media Consultant to NAFDAC, Sayo Akintola, Adeyeye was quoted as saying that safe food was an essential component of sustainable development and contributes towards improvement of public health, poverty reduction, and increased food security.\n\nShe noted that the theme for this year was very apt, as the world gradually returns to normal with the COVID-19 pandemic having lost its firm grip on the world.\n\n\u201cYou all know my popular saying about not needing medicine if one eats right. Eating right means making healthy food choices from safe, wholesome, and nutritious foods,\u201d she added.\n\nShe stressed that the occasion of World Food Safety Day was an opportunity to create and generate awareness around food safety and situate it as a very significant issue of public health concern, especially in the light of safe, wholesome food being important for boosting immunity and improving the body\u2019s natural defenses in fighting diseases.\n\n\u201cThe theme Safer Food, Better Health is very relevant to us here in Nigeria as a large proportion of the foods we consume are produced by micro- and small-scale producers; these include our smallholder farmers, street food vendors, the traditional, open food markets,\u201d she added.\n\nThe NAFDAC boss however, noted with dismay that their activities were of concern regarding safe food practices or lack of it.\n\nShe added that the foods are frequently exposed to less than hygienic and sanitary conditions, resulting in contamination and leading to incidences and outbreaks of foodborne diseases, situations that are steadily becoming significant food safety concerns.\n\nThe NAFDAC boss disclosed that unsafe foods are the cause of many diseases and contribute to other poor health conditions, such as impaired growth and development.\n\n\u201cWe know that food safety is a shared responsibility, and everyone has a role to play in ensuring we have safer food for better health: from growers to processors, to transporters, sellers, buyers, and those who prepare or serve food.\n\n\u201cPolicy makers, educational institutions and workplaces, as well as consumers are not left out; food safety is the responsibility of all. We must all work together to help achieve safer food for better health,\u201d she added.\n\nShe urged policy makers and food regulators to design all public procurement of food, such as food aid, school feeding and other publicly owned food outlets, so that consumers can access safe and healthy foods.\n\nShe added that they should support policy measures and legal frameworks to strengthen the national food safety system and ensure it complies with food safety standards and regulations.",
