          "title": "Top pastors absent, eminent Nigerians, traders, others bid TB Joshua farewell",
          "text": "Tears flowed as eminent Nigerians, family, friends and benefactors gathered at the Synagogue Church of All Nations, Ikotun Egbe, Lagos, to bid its founder, the late Prophet T.B. Joshua, farewell.\n\nThe late Joshua was buried around 2.53pm on Friday on the church\u2019s premises in the presence of his wife, Evelyn Joshua, his children, officiating ministers and senior members of the church.\n\nMany members of SCOAN were emotional during the ceremony as they were seen wailing and bidding him farewell as the casket bearing his remains was carried out of the church\u2019s auditorium by pallbearers for interment.\n\nThe late evangelist, who hailed from Arigidi Akoko in Ondo State, died on June 5 at the age of 57.\n\nPresent at the ceremony were the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN); the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who was represented by the Commissioner for Home Affairs, Prince Anofiu Elegusi; and representatives of the Delta State Governor, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa; and the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege.\n\nThe ceremony was also attended by the wife of the Ooni of Ife, Olori Naomi Adeyeye-Ogunwusi; wife of a former president, Dame Patience Jonathan; religious, traditional and political leaders from different countries as well as delegations from other countries in Africa, Europe, Asia, South America and North America, among others.\n\nAlso at the ceremony were officials of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control to monitor compliance with the guidelines for the prevention of COVID-19.\n\nTraders shut Ikotun markets to honour deceased\n\nIkotun market on Ikotun Egba Road was shut in honour of the late prophet as a large crowd of residents and traders gathered at the entrance of the church to catch a glimpse of the burial ceremony.\n\nMany of them who could not enter the church gathered in clusters around TV screens provided in the area to enable them to follow the event.\n\nBut security agents from the Nigeria Police Force, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, Federal Road Safety Corps as well as members of the Lagos Neighbourhood Safety Corps were seen in strategic areas outside and on the church premises for crowd control and to present a breakdown of law and other.\n\nJoshua performed miracles as school pupil, supported me when I became gov \u2013 Akeredolu\n\nEarlier, Akeredolu had said though the late Joshua was not born into an affluent family, he grew up as a special child who performed miracles even as a primary school pupil.\n\nHe said, \u201cFrom the accounts of his peers, he was a special child. Maybe he never knew it was miracles he was performing when he was in primary school; he was special because he performed miracles even in primary school, and I say this from the facts I gathered from his mates.\n\n\u201cHe was one who could tell his mate in primary school not to play because he might break his leg. And if he proceeded to play, he would come back with a broken leg. So, he was special. Perhaps, that could have been the reason for his great adventure in life.\u201d\n\nHe said the state government did not prevail on the bereaved family to bury the late cleric in Agiridi Akoko as a mark of respect for the decision of the family of the deceased.\n\n\u201cThe Zaki of Arigidi called me to mobilise me against him (Joshua) being buried in Lagos. Kabiyesi was in tears; he (deceased) was the only person who died and the whole town closed markets and shops for one week. Kabiyesi was convinced that we should bring the body to Arigidi and I said to Kabiyesi, \u2018I\u2019m governor but I think the prophet has a family. Where his remains will lie is for the family to decide, not for me.\u201d\n\nThe governor said T. B. Joshua\u2019s death was a great loss to his hometown and the state, where he had planned to build a church and a university, and would not only be remembered by the underprivileged but also the privileged that benefited from him spiritually and economically.\n\nRecalling how the founder of SCOAN supported him after his election, the governor said, \u201cI can testify personally to the good things I have benefited from him. Pastor T.B. Joshua, when I won election to be governor of Ondo State, came. He drove to Owo, my hometown. I think something happened to his vehicle in Akure but he still managed to get to Owo.\n\n\u201cI saw him in trousers and a shirt and said, \u2018Emmanuel!\u2019 I came over \u2013 no other person has ever done that before \u2013 and he told me I was the governor of the state and had been elected and that he had come to wish me well. He prayed and when he was leaving, he put something in my pocket.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t tell you how much he put in my pocket but it was a great thing he put in my pocket. He said, \u2018As governor, you will need to entertain people. Take this.\u2019 He said, \u2018Madam also will entertain people; give this to her.\u2019 I can tell you I delivered it; you can ask her.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu said the late Joshua ran a purposeful race and was intentional about his ministry.\n\nThe governor, represented by the Commissioner for Home Affairs, said, \u201cThere is a time and purpose for everything in life. Prophet Joshua, whom we are here to honour, ran a purposeful race, was intentional about his pastoral ministry and I chose to dwell on his phenomenal impact.\u201d\n\nAdeyeye-Ogunwusi, in her tribute, described the deceased as a spirit transformed.\n\nSome traders in the area who spoke to Saturday PUNCH described the deceased as a generous man whose selflessness should be emulated by all Nigerians, irrespective of religion.\n\nA driver in the area, Kareem Ganiyu, said, \u201cI am a Muslim. The man is very generous; if others behave the way he did, everything will be okay. We have to love ourselves. In Nigeria, there is no love. That is why things are not in order. Let us love ourselves.\n\nThe treasurer of Ifelodun Fruit Sellers, Fatai Oduntan, said the market was shut as a mark of respect for the late cleric who contributed to the development of the market.\n\nResponding on behalf of the family, the first daughter of the late evangelist, Sarah Joshua, thanked Nigerians and other well-wishers across the world for honouring her father and supporting the family and the church.\n\nEarlier, one of the officiating ministers, Prophet Chris Aldrich, in his sermon titled \u2018The Legacy Lives On,\u2019 said God gave Joshua to the world for a short time for a reason.\n\nAldrich said the secret of the late evangelist\u2019s ministry was the life he lived and his relationship with God.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, they did not understand him, so they called him names. In the beginning, they could not comprehend him, so they condemned him. But today, the story has changed. I think we have a lot of lessons to learn from Prophet T.B.; there is no signboard in his name, yet his name is written in the hearts of many throughout the world.\u201d\n\nTop Nigerian pastors absent at burial\n\nMeanwhile, top Nigerian pastors and religious leaders were absent were Joshua was laid to rest.\n\nAmong the top pastors absent are Enoch Adeboye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God; Pastor Sam Adeyemi of Daystar Christian Centre; Bishop David Oyedepo of the Living Faith Church also known as Winners Chapel; W.F Kumuyi of Deeper Life Church; Paul Enenche of Dunamis Church; and Lazarus Mouka of the Mountain of Fire Church.\n\nOthers are Chris Okotie of the Household of God Church International Ministries; Tunde Bakare of Citadel Global Community Church (formerly Latter Rain Assembly), and Matthew Ashimolowo of Kingsway International Christian Centre.\n\nWhen the televangelist died, the Christian Association of Nigeria and many pastors were initially silent.\n\nHowever, 72 hours after the death of the founder of SCOAN, CAN issued a terse statement to condole his family and SCOAN congregation.\n\nThe condolence, which observers believed was belated, followed condemnation of its silence among Christendom and several organisations on social media.\n\nCritics wondered why CAN would commiserate with others but wait for a long time before making a statement on Prophet T. B. Joshua.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The initial funding includes $382m for North-East Nigeria.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cThis is not only about money. It is also about diplomatic action, smarter financing, and more effective responses to crises.

Bagudu since he assumed office in 2015.\n\nHe cited the renovation of General Hospital, Jega named after the wife of the President, Aisha Muhammadu Buhari, as one of his pioneer projects in the state, as well as the construction of numerous roads, both within Jega town and other rural communities across the local government area.\n\n\u201cI must commend Gov. Bagudu for the construction and commissioning of this modern livestock market in Jega, the commercial nerve centre of the state, Jega.\n\n\u201dIn spite of the paucity of funds, Gov. Bagudu constructed this ultramodern livestock market in Jega. Certainly, the Governor must be commended for this and other developmental projects across the state.\n\n\u201cSalaries are paid as and when due, contractors are not owed, while the Governor is doing his best to support all security agencies, including the Vigilante Groups for security of lives and property of our people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Commissioner for Animal Health and Fisheries, Alhaji Aminu Garba-Dandiga said the livestock market \u201cis a blessing to the people of Jega.\u201d\n\nGarba-Dandiga explained that the governor had been very supportive of his ministry in its efforts of improving the health conditions of animals in the state.\n\nAccording to him, the Ministry for Animal Health and Fisheries would provide two permanent Veterinary Doctors to the market, in addition to Animal Inspection Clinic, to ensure healthy condition of animals.\n\nThe Deputy Speaker, Alhaji Buhari Aliero, as well as State House of Assembly member representing Jega, Alhaji Faruk Nassarawa, who is also the majority leader in the Assembly, applauded the governor for the project.\n\nNassarawa said the relationship between the state governor and the legislative arm of government had been cordial and thanked the governor for approving constituency projects in their domains for the development of their people.\n\nOne of the Fulani leaders, Alhaji Bello Aliyu-Gotomo appreciated the governor for the construction of the livestock market, while expressing optimism that the market would boost the sales and purchases of livestock in the area.\n\nOn his part, the Sarkin Kabin Jega, Alhaji Arzika Bawa-Jega described the project as invaluable to the people of Jega, lauding Gov. Bagudu for carrying out numerous developmental projects, despite the dwindling economic fortunes of the state. (NAN)",

Femi Gbajabiamila, said on Friday, that the Lower Chamber will take some far-reaching security measures in its commitment to support the Executive in addressing the security challenges confronting the country.\n\nHe explained that the interventions by the House were necessary because finding solutions to the challenges was a collective responsibility.\n\nGbajabiamila was speaking in Lagos on Friday where he declared open a two-day National Security Legislative Reform retreat.\n\nThe speaker noted that the initiative was another \u201cevidence of our commitment in the 9th House of Representatives to doing what is required of us to make sure our country can overcome the serious national security challenges that currently threaten the safety and wellbeing of our people.\u201d\n\nParticipants will use the retreat to review seven bills with overlapping mandates on security, intelligence and the related agencies.\n\nWe will give account for our time in govt \u2013 Gbajabiamila to APC\n\nThe bills include the Armed Forces Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021; Police Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021; National Security and Civil Defence Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021; Customs and Excise Management Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021; ECOWAS Convention on Small Arms and Light Weapons, The Ammunition and Other Related Materials (Ratification and Enforcement) Bill, 2021; Economic and Financial Crimes Commission Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021; and the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021.\n\nGbajabiamila said, \u201cHow best to ensure the objectives of our national security and ensure that the men and women who live and work in our country can have full lives, free from the terror imposed by marauders and fundamentalists is now the defining question of our national life.\n\n\u201cHow we answer this question and our ability to overcome the evident challenges of the moment will determine whether or not we can educate our children, attract investment to grow the economy, build critical national infrastructure, create jobs and ensure the continued and prosperous existence of our republic\u201d.\n\nThe speaker, who was represented by the Deputy Minority Leader of the House, Rep. Toby Okechukwu, noted that even if the House was constitutionally handicapped in taking certain necessary actions to address the issue, it would not fold its arms and watch insecurity spiralling out of control.\n\nHe stated, \u201cIn the legislature, we do not control armies, we cannot deploy men and equipment to fight insurgencies and to prevent the taking over of spaces by bandits, criminals and assorted bad actors.\n\n\u201cOur power, and therefore our responsibility, lies in our constitutional mandate to make laws for the good governance of the country. And we serve this mandate by convening ourselves and others in programmes like this, to critically consider problems, advance solutions and agree on a joint strategy for law making, for oversight and collaboration with the executive.\u201d\n\nAccording to Gbajabiamila, the objective of the retreat is to review each of the seven bills, with a view to eliciting discussions that will culminate in the passage of a series of legislation that will strengthen the efforts of the executive in tackling insecurity.\n\nThe speaker explained, \u201cWe do this so that by the time we return to Abuja, we will together and individually work to rapidly advance these reform proposals through the legislative process, with a clear-eyed understanding of the fact that the work we do on these bills will go a long way in ensuring that our country can defeat the forces of violence and strife that challenge us and threaten our peaceful prosperity.\n\n\u201cIn addition to reviewing the bills under consideration, this retreat is an opportunity for us to propose and consider additional security reform suggestions.\u201d\n\nGbajabiamila appreciated the collaborative efforts of the House Committee on Monitoring and Implementation of the Legislative Agenda, National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS), Konrad Adenauer Stiftung Foundation (KAS) and other contributors for the vision to review of the bills, adding that they reflected the recommendations for legislative action made by security/policy experts at the recently-concluded Special Summit on National Security held in Abuja.\n\n\u201cWe are, all of us, partners in the joint task of nation-building, and it is a thing of great joy when we gather together like this with a clear vision, and evident passion to make good the lives of men and women in our beloved country\u201d, the speaker added.\n\nThe Chairman, House Committee on Monitoring and Implementation of Legislative Agenda, Rep. Henry Nwawuba, said the reasons for the gathering was to meet the House of Representatives\u2019 commitment to security sector reform and also to ensure that the bills under consideration could quickly pass through the legislative process for implementation.\n\nIn his opening remarks, NILDS\u2019 Director-General (DG), Abubakar Suleiman, said overlapping and poor understanding of mandates often led to conflicts in many developing countries, mainly due to the long stay of the military in power.\n\nAccording to him, the institute joined other critical stakeholders to address the issue so as to find collective solutions to the security challenges.\n\nOn the essence of the collaboration, the Resident Representative of Konrad-Adenauer Stiftung, Dr Vladimir Kreck, said inter-agency collaboration and overlapping mandates were not strange developments.\n\n\u201cTo overcome rivalry between agencies and to induce synergies, a regulatory framework is necessary, defining the modes of collaboration.\n\n\u201cIt is against this backdrop that in 2020, our organisation commissioned a survey on overlapping mandates of security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies in Nigeria. The analysis of the constitutional and statutory provisions of security agencies illustrated not only the areas of conflicting mandates but also the need for legislative actions in order to provide agencies with a framework that enables synergies and joint approaches.\u201d\n\nAmong those attending the retreat are Reps Abdul Majid Adekoya, Deputy Minority Whip; Abdulrazak Namdas, Chairman, House Committee on Army; Abubakar Fulata, Chairman Rules and Business Committee; Francis Agbo, Chairman, Committee on Drug Law and Narcotics; Leke Abejide, Chairman, Customs and Excise Committee; Gaza Gwefi, Chairman, Committee on Legislative Library, Research and Documentation; Nicholas Ossai, Chairman, Committee on Treaties, Protocols and Agreement; and Victor Nwokolo, Chairman, Banking and Currency.",

It is like a ship or a plane that deserves the best Captain to steer it to the desired destination. I have always asked this question; if zoning or rotational presidency would solve our problem, as at the time Olusegun Obasanjo was the president for eight years, all the problems of the country would have been solved.\n\n\u201cAs at the time the late Musa Yaradua was President, the problems of the north would have been solved. When former President Goodluck Jonathan was president, all of the problems of the Niger Delta would have been solved. Now we have President Muhammadu Buhari and all the problems of the north have not been solved. I am not saying that these leaders haven\u2019t tried their best, they tried their best within the circumstance they found themselves in office or the situation of things at the time. Democracy is all about free choice. Give the majority the freewill to choose who they want. Political parties should not limit the leaders to whom they want to elect.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at it, it is unconstitutional. It is not in the country\u2019s 1999 constitution as amended. If we should continue with the sentiments of this rotation of presidency to this or that region, let\u2019s do it perfectly.\n\n\u201cIf we want to come from the angle of justice and fair play, let\u2019s go back to 1960. From independence, you will discover that all other geopolitical zones as they exist today has produced a President or Vice President. If we take it from 1999, only the North Central and South East hasn\u2019t produced a President but I continue to insist on getting the best person. We need someone who will unify this country and build on the legacy of President Buhari. All over the world, the younger generation are taking charge and Nigeria cannot be left behind,\u201d Bello said.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "title": "Oba of Benin, Obaseki Set for Showdown over Looted Artefacts",
          "text": "*FG demands unconditional repatriation from Germany\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan in Abuja\n\nExcept a compromise is reached, the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, and Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, are heading for a showdown over the impending return by Germany and the United Kingdom of artefacts stolen from the Benin Palace in 1897 during a raid by the colonial invaders.\n\nWhile the monarch favours the return of the artefacts to a museum to be built by the palace within its premises, or in the alternative, a museum to be built and managed by the federal and state governments, the palace believes the governor prefers a private trust to take custody of, and manage the ancient precious artworks.\n\nHowever, Obaseki told THISDAY that he was working on a tripartite arrangement, involving the federal and state governments, the Oba of Benin and a private trust that would manage the artefacts on behalf of the palace and the people.\n\n\u201cI intend to work with the Oba of Benin in an arrangement that would be led by the federal government,\u201d he told THISDAY, accusing a palace chief, Elemai Oseni, of misinforming the revered monarch about his plans.\n\nHe said he would straighten out things with the monarch on his return from Germany, where he and the Minister of Information and Culture, Mr. Lai Mohammed, are currently negotiating and insisting on unconditional repatriation of the artefacts.\n\nNotwithstanding, the brewing quarrel in Benin may become public knowledge today as Oba Ewuare II addresses a historic press conference, the first ever, signposting the importance he attaches to the issue.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that the brewing crisis may replay the bitter aspect of the history of ancient Benin Kingdom dating back to 1897 when Britain invaded the kingdom, subdued Oba Ovonramwen, plundered and looted his palace and sent him on exile.\n\nA Benin chief named Obaseki, said to be the great-grandfather of the current governor, was apprehended by palace historians as one of those who betrayed Oba Ovonramwen and made the British expedition a success.\n\n\u201cThe current standoff, therefore, has a touch of history,\u201d a Benin chief told THISDAY last night, pointing out: \u201cIt is significant that another Obaseki is at play on this occasion.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY gathered that following the imminence of the return of the looted artefacts by the UK, German and French governments, Obaseki came up with a grand plan to form a private trust, not owned by the state government, to take custody of the returning artefacts.\n\nHis plan, it is gathered, is to have the private trust build a museum of West African Arts in Benin, the state capital, where the artefacts would be kept and curated.\n\nLegacy Restoration Trust, a private entity, THISDAY learnt, has since emerged, parading itself as the authorised custodian of the artefacts.\n\nOba Ewuare II is said to have opposed this move on the ground that it would amount to private appropriation of the cultural heritage of his kingdom.\n\nWhile the monarch is said not to be opposed to the idea of the federal and state governments taking custody of the artefacts and keeping it in a museum to be built by them, he has expressed his objection to a private trust managing the ancient artworks.\n\n\u201cOba Ewuare\u2019s position,\u201d said a source, \u201cis that at the least the artefacts should return to the palace where they were stolen, contending that the palace could on its own build a museum where they would be kept and manage.\u201d\n\nThis position was well articulated in a statement by Benin Traditional Council dated 10th May 2021 and signed by the Secretary, Mr. Frank Irabor; and the Executive Assistant, Corporate and Legal Affairs, Mr. Denis Osaretin.\n\nDisowning Legacy Restoration Trust and Legacy and Legal Restoration Trust that it said had been parading themselves as presumptive custodians of the incoming artefacts, it said: \u201cFor categorical clarification, these individuals and groups of persons are not known nor authorised by the Oba of Benin, who is the original owner of the looted artefacts and the custodian of Benin customs and tradition.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, His Royal Majesty, Omo N\u2019Oba N\u2019Edo Uku Akpololokpolo, Oba Ewuare II, Oba of Benin remains the custodia Legis of all insignia, symbols and such other artefacts depicting the rich cultural heritage of the Benin people.\u201d\n\nIt said, the Oba of Benin or his duly authorised representative or body corporate, is, therefore, the only person that can have any dealings with any foreign donours or missions or any international institution over the artefacts.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that following this statement, the Secretary to the State Government had conversations with the palace secretary but the meeting ended in a deadlock with both parties hugging their mutually exclusive positions.\n\nAt the centre of the conflict, THISDAY has learnt, is the potentially huge financial resources that might accrue from the warehousing of the artefacts.\n\nAlready, the German government is committed to an initial donation of 4.5 million Euros to the Edo Museum of West African Arts and Cultural District projected to be built in Benin City.\n\nThis was revealed in a statement on Wednesday by Foreign Minister Maas, which spoke eloquently about the desire of Germany to return the artefacts in its custody and pay adequate reparation.\n\nObaseki too had spoken glowingly about his trust project last month after a meeting with the Chief of Staff to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, during which he sought the federal government\u2019s help to secure the return of the artworks.\n\nObaseki said museums had become catalysts in the evolution and development of cities.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThere is a city called Bilbao in Spain, and that was the head of the Basque separatist movements many years ago.\n\n\u201cThe investment by the Guggenheim Foundation, by the Guggenheim family museum in Bilbao, has changed the economic fortunes of that city.\n\n\u201cToday, Bilbao earns more than a billion dollars from just the presence of that museum in that city. Because everybody wants to come in to see what\u2019s in that museum.\n\n\u201cSo, bringing back these works, this world cherished works, bringing the originals back to their home, I mean, you can imagine for years to come, people, children unborn, all over the world want to come and see these pieces.\u201d\n\nHe said his administration was designing a whole cultural district for Benin, saying that the proposed museum would be situated within the cultural district.\n\nObaseki said: \u201cAs I speak, the planners from Latin America are in Benin City, looking at work and doing the surveys. That process should end in about August.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the museum is going to be a series of, you know, buildings, you have the pavilion where these works will be brought in initially and will be kept.\n\n\u201cWe also undertaking more archaeological excavations, and whatever we find will be kept in the pavilion.\n\n\u201cWe have a national museum that currently exists. And that\u2019s going to be refurbished, then we have the main Edo Museum of West African Arts. And the construction for that will take another one or two years to begin.\u201d\n\nOba Ewuare is, however, resisting the private trust, being promoted and led by Phillip Ihenacho, said to be Obaseki\u2019s business partner in Afrinvest, with Victor Ehikhamenor, Enotie Ogbebor, Eric Idiahi and Babatunde Adebiyi as trustees with renowned Ghanaian architect, David Adjaye as architectural consultant.\n\nTHISDAY learnt the monarch had reached out to the presidency and the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, who appear to be sympathetic to the cause of having the looted artefacts returned to the palace from where they were stolen.\n\nFG Demands Unconditional Repatriation from Germany\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government has urged Germany to ensure an unconditional return of the 1,130 Benin artefacts that were looted from Nigeria in the 19th century and domiciled in German museums.\n\nThe Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, at meetings, held on Wednesday in Berlin with German Minister of State for Culture, Prof. Monika Grutters, and Foreign Minister, Mr. Heiko Maas, said the return should be whole rather than substantial on the heel of remarks by Grutters that the European nation was ready to make \u201csubstantial return\u201d of the 1,130 looted artefacts.\n\nHe added that the issue of provenance, which has to do with the place of origin of the artefacts, should not be allowed to unduly delay the repatriation of the artworks.\n\n\u201cThat they are known as Benin Bronzes is already a confirmation of their source of origin (which is Benin),\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nAt a separate meeting with Maas, the minister reiterated that no conditions should be attached to the return of the artefacts.\n\nHe stressed the need for the parties to commit to definite timelines for the return of the artefacts, in addition to concluding all negotiations in a very short term.\n\nHe said the discussions between Nigeria and Germany on the return of the artworks were not the end of an era but rather the beginning of a new vista of stronger relations, pivoted by cultural diplomacy, between both countries.\n\nHe thanked Germany for taking the lead\n\nin the global efforts to repatriate all artefacts looted from Nigeria and the African continent.\n\n\u201cWe see Germany as a leader in the efforts to take practical steps to repatriate our stolen artefacts, and we hope Germany will sustain that lead,\u201d he said Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, who was also on the Nigerian delegation said a \u201ctransformational\u201d museum was being built-in Benin City to house the artefacts upon their return, as part of a new cultural district in the city.\n\nHe said he was attending the talks to demonstrate the strong partnership involving the federal government, the (Benin) royal family and the people of Edo State.\n\nOn his part, the Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Yusuf Tuggar, said the issue of the repatriation of the Benin Bronzes should be seen as an opportunity to take the cooperation between Nigeria and Germany to a greater height.\n\nHe commended Germany for taking the lead in the repatriation process.\n\nEarlier, the German Minister of State for Culture, Prof. Grutters, had said: \u201cThe way we deal with the issue of Benin Bronzes is important to addressing our colonial past,\u201d describing the issues as \u201can important personal concern.\u201d\n\nShe assured the Nigerian delegation that the 1,130 artefacts would be returned to Nigeria from next year.\n\nShe stated that the fact that Germany had twice sent delegations to Nigeria for talks over the planned repatriation indicated that both sides had moved beyond mere talks, adding that all the museums in Germany stockpiling Benin Bronzes have agreed to cooperate.\n\nOther people on the Nigerian delegation were Director-General of the National Commission for Museums and Monument (NCMM), Prof. Abba Tijani, and Prince Ezelekhae Ewuare, who was invited by the German government.\n\nThey were later taken on a guided tour of the Humboldt-Forum, a royal palace-turned-museum in the heart of Berlin that houses art works from around the world.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*We are discussing with tax authorities, says company\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja\n\nThe Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has commissioned some banks to recover N1.82 trillion from the accounts of MultiChoice Nigeria Limited (MCN) and MultiChoice Africa (MCA).\n\nPreparatory to the collection of the amount, which is arrears of tax liabilities of the companies, the agency has also ordered that all local bank accounts of the two organisations, owners of pay television, DSTV, should be frozen.\n\nFIRS Executive Chairman, Mr. Muhammad Nami, said yesterday that the decision to appoint the banks as agents and to freeze the accounts were due to the group\u2019s continued refusal to grant FIRS access to its servers for audit.\n\nBut in a swift response, MultiChoice Nigeria said it had the media statements made by the FIRS, but had not received any notification from the agency.\n\n\u201cMultiChoice Nigeria respects and is comfortable that it complies with the tax laws of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have been and are currently in discussion with FIRS regarding their concerns and believe that we will be able to resolve the matter amicably,\u201d the company added.\n\nHowever, Nami accused the companies of breaching all agreements and undertakings with the agency and for not responding to correspondences.\n\nNami, in a statement by the Director, Communications and Liaison Department, FIRS, Mr. Abdullahi Ahmad, said Multichoice, \u201clacked data integrity and are not transparent as they continually deny FIRS access to their records.\u201d\n\nHe added that it is important that Nigeria ends all tax frauds that have been going on for too long.\n\nAccording to him, all companies must be held accountable and made to pay their fair share of taxes, including back duty taxes owed, especially VAT for which they are ordinarily agents of collection.\n\nHe accused MultiChoice Nigeria of avoiding to give the FIRS accurate information on the number of its subscribers and income.\n\nHe also accused the companies of being involved in the under-remittance of taxes, which necessitated a critical review of its tax-compliance level.\n\nThe statement added that the group\u2019s performance does not reflect in its tax obligations and compliance level in Nigeria.\n\nNami said: \u201cThe level of non-compliance by MultiChoice Africa (MCA), the parent company of MultiChoice Nigeria (MCN) is very alarming. The parent company, which provides services to MCN, has never paid Value Added Tax (VAT) since its inception.\n\n\u201cThe issue with tax collection in Nigeria, especially from foreign-based companies conducting businesses in Nigeria and making massive profit is frustrating and infuriating to the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS).\n\n\u201cRegrettably, companies come into Nigeria just to infringe on our tax laws by indulging in tax evasion. There is no doubt that broadcasting, telecommunications, and the cable-satellite industries have changed the face of communication in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHowever, when it comes to tax compliance, some companies are found wanting. They do with impunity in Nigeria what they dare not try in their countries of origin.\u201d\n\nFIRS claimed Nigeria contributes 34 per cent of total revenue for the MultiChoice group followed by Kenya with 11 per cent and Zambia with 10 per cent.\n\nBut the rest of Africa where they have a presence accounts for 45 per cent of the group\u2019s total revenue.\n\nNami said information currently at the disposal of FIRS revealed a tax liability of N1.822 trillion for years of assessment, including $342.53 million.\n\n\u201cUnder the FIRS powers in Section 49 of the Companies Income Tax Act Cap C21 LFN 2004 as amended, Section 41 of the Value Added Tax Act Cap V1 LFN 2004 as amended and Section 31 of the FIRS (Establishment) Act No. 13 of 2007, all bankers to MCA and MCN in Nigeria were therefore appointed as collecting agents for the full recovery of the aforesaid tax debt,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe added that the banks are required to sweep balances in each of the above-mentioned entities\u2019 accounts and pay the same in full or part settlement of the companies\u2019 respective tax debts until full recovery.\n\n\u201cThis should be done before the execution of any transaction involving the companies or any of their subsidiaries. It is further requested that the Federal Inland Revenue Service be informed of any transactions before execution on the account, especially transfers of funds to any of their subsidiaries,\u201d he added.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has detected a confirmed case with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant, also known as lineage B.1.617.2 in Nigeria.\n\nThe Delta variant is recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a variant of concern, given its increased transmissibility A statement issued Thursday night by the Head of Communications at the NCDC, Dr. Yahaya Disu, said the variant was detected in a traveler to Nigeria, following the routine travel test required of all international travelers and genomic sequencing at the NCDC National Reference Laboratory, Abuja.\n\nAs part of Nigeria\u2019s COVID-19 response, NCDC said it has been working with the Nigerian\n\nInstitute of Medical Research (NIMR), African Centre for Genomics of Infectious Diseases\n\n(ACEGID), and other laboratories within the national network, to carry out genomic\n\nsequencing.\n\n\u201cThis is to enable the detection of variants of concern, and initiate response\n\nactivities. All data on variants from Nigeria have been published on GISAID, a global\n\nmechanism for sharing sequencing data.\n\n\u201cGiven the global risk of spread of the Delta variant, positive samples from international travelers to Nigeria are sequenced regularly,\u201d it said.\n\nNCDC said that given the high transmissibility of the Delta variant and following its detection in Nigeria,\n\nall Nigerians should ensure strict adherence to public health and social measures\n\nin place.\n\nIt added, \u201cProven public health and social measures such as physical distancing, frequent\n\nhandwashing, and proper use of face masks, prevent infections and save lives. The COVID-\n\n19 vaccine is safe and effective and offers protection against the disease\u201d.\n\nAdditionally, the Centre urged states to ensure sample collection and testing for COVID-19 is accessible to the public, adding that public settings such as schools with accommodation facilities, workplaces and camps should utilise the approved Antigen-based Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for rapid testing of their population.\n\nAccording to the Director General of NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, \u201cAlthough we have\n\nseen a low number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria in the last eight weeks, it is incredibly\n\nimportant that we do not forget to be careful.\n\nThe surge in cases in countries across the world and Africa is an important reminder of the risk we face. Please protect yourselves and the people you love by adhering to the known public health and social measures,\n\ngetting vaccinated if you are eligible and getting tested if you have symptoms\u201d.\n\nThe Centre said that the recommended control measures to limit the spread of the Delta variant \u201cis to continue to\n\nbe testing, following the existing public health guidance and abiding by the current travel\n\nand public restrictions\u201d.\n\nThe Delta variant is recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a variant of\n\nconcern, given its increased transmissibility. The variant has been detected in over 90\n\ncountries and is expected to spread to more countries. The variant has also been linked\n\nto a surge in cases in countries where it is the dominant strain in circulation.\n\nThere are ongoing studies to understand the impact of the variant on existing vaccines and\n\ntherapeutics.\n\nNCDC further said that government had through the Presidential Steering Committee (PSC)\n\ninitiated several measures to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19.\n\nAccording to the agency this includes introduction of travel restrictions from countries where there is a surge in cases associated with widespread prevalence of variants of concern..\n\nIt also said that the national travel protocols including compulsory seven-day self-isolation and repeat test on the seventh day after arrival, were in place to reduce the risk of spread of the virus. It is very\n\nimportant that this is strictly adhered to, to prevent a surge in COVID-19 cases in Nigeria.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari and his power brokers in the All Progressives Congress (APC) have again shaded former Lagos State Governor and APC National Leader, Bola Tinubu, by approving a subtle indefinite tenure for the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee led by Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Buni who had been in charge since when Adams Oshiomhole \u2013 Tinubu\u2019s loyalist \u2013 and his members were sacked in June 2020, ought to have come up with the calendar of the party\u2019s national convention, but Buhari\u2019s loyalists stated that it was not yet time.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the reluctance to announce national convention and choose national executives was to weaken the power and influence of Asiwaju in pushing for his candidates who would then begin more mobilisation for his yet-to-be-announced 2023 presidential ambition.\n\nThe development is already polarizing further the Buhari camp and the Tinubu camp in the APC, while other smaller camps have to take a stand between Buhari and Tinubu in the silent struggle.\n\n\u201cThe indefinite tenure exten\u00adsion granted to the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC is not going down well with us. Buhari has an agenda. Why keep Mala Buni over the party for this long when he has the business of a state to attend to?\n\n\u201cThe Caretaker Committee was inaugurated on June 25, 2020, and the committee should spend six months after dissolution of Oshiomhole\u2019s Nation\u00adal Working Committee. But by December, the Buhari faction in the party extended the committee tenure extended for another six months which brings it to June 20201.\n\n\u201cAgain, a week ago, the 13-member committee went to the Presidential Villa, only to be told they would be in charge indefinitely. This is against the spirit and letters of the agreement for the committee members,\u201d a source in Lags APC, familiar with the development, stated.\n\nSaharaReporters observed that while the APC weeks ago released the formal timetable for congresses from ward level to the state level, it failed to an\u00adnounce date for the national convention, a situation which means that the committee, led by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State will continue in office indefinitely.\n\n\u201cThe president ap\u00adproved the timetable for APC ward, local government and state congresses. Ward con\u00adgresses will hold 24th July, 2021 followed by local govern\u00adment congresses on 14th Au\u00adgust, 2021 and state congresses on 18th September, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that we are not happy but we don\u2019t want to be seen as rocking the boat. We are just bidding our time. We are planning our own strategy too so that the effect will not be monumental on us.\n\n\u201cThis is a party we built from scratch and worked for. At this stage, we cannot allow anything to damage the plat\u00adform just because of the be\u00adhaviour of some people who are inconsiderate and power hungry,\u201d one of Tinubu\u2019s loyalists explained.\n\nSaharaReporters had first in June reported that Tinubu\u2019s obvious absence at the one-day working visit of Buhari to commission various projects in Lagos State is deepening the conflict between the camps of both political actors ahead of 2023.\n\nSaharaReporters had learnt that the Presidency, against its former custom, refused to extend an invitation to Tinubu ahead of the visit which should make him feel welcome at the ceremony, and the camp of the APC leader felt embarrassed by the Presidency\u2019s decision.\n\nTop sources also revealed that Tinubu did not feel comfortable to stay in Lagos during the Presidential visit in order to hide the growing battle between the two from public glare and he instead decided to embark on a journey.\n\nA political analyst, Farooq Kperogi, said on Twitter, \u201cI learned a while ago that Aso Rock didn\u2019t formally invite Tinubu to Buhari\u2019s official functions in Lagos. So, Tinubu jetted off to God knows where (someone said London) to escape public humiliation.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari and his power brokers in the All Progressives Congress (APC) have again shaded former Lagos State Governor and APC National Leader, Bola Tinubu, by approving a subtle indefinite tenure for the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee led by Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Buni who had been in charge since when Adams Oshiomhole \u2013 Tinubu\u2019s loyalist \u2013 and his members were sacked in June 2020, ought to have come up with the calendar of the party\u2019s national convention, but Buhari\u2019s loyalists stated that it was not yet time.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the reluctance to announce national convention and choose national executives was to weaken the power and influence of Asiwaju in pushing for his candidates who would then begin more mobilisation for his yet-to-be-announced 2023 presidential ambition.\n\nThe development is already polarizing further the Buhari camp and the Tinubu camp in the APC, while other smaller camps have to take a stand between Buhari and Tinubu in the silent struggle.\n\n\u201cThe indefinite tenure exten\u00adsion granted to the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the APC is not going down well with us. Buhari has an agenda. Why keep Mala Buni over the party for this long when he has the business of a state to attend to?\n\n\u201cThe Caretaker Committee was inaugurated on June 25, 2020, and the committee should spend six months after dissolution of Oshiomhole\u2019s Nation\u00adal Working Committee. But by December, the Buhari faction in the party extended the committee tenure extended for another six months which brings it to June 20201.\n\n\u201cAgain, a week ago, the 13-member committee went to the Presidential Villa, only to be told they would be in charge indefinitely. This is against the spirit and letters of the agreement for the committee members,\u201d a source in Lags APC, familiar with the development, stated.\n\nSaharaReporters observed that while the APC weeks ago released the formal timetable for congresses from ward level to the state level, it failed to an\u00adnounce date for the national convention, a situation which means that the committee, led by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State will continue in office indefinitely.\n\n\u201cThe president ap\u00adproved the timetable for APC ward, local government and state congresses. Ward con\u00adgresses will hold 24th July, 2021 followed by local govern\u00adment congresses on 14th Au\u00adgust, 2021 and state congresses on 18th September, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that we are not happy but we don\u2019t want to be seen as rocking the boat. We are just bidding our time. We are planning our own strategy too so that the effect will not be monumental on us.\n\n\u201cThis is a party we built from scratch and worked for. At this stage, we cannot allow anything to damage the plat\u00adform just because of the be\u00adhaviour of some people who are inconsiderate and power hungry,\u201d one of Tinubu\u2019s loyalists explained.\n\nSaharaReporters had first in June reported that Tinubu\u2019s obvious absence at the one-day working visit of Buhari to commission various projects in Lagos State is deepening the conflict between the camps of both political actors ahead of 2023.\n\nSaharaReporters had learnt that the Presidency, against its former custom, refused to extend an invitation to Tinubu ahead of the visit which should make him feel welcome at the ceremony, and the camp of the APC leader felt embarrassed by the Presidency\u2019s decision.\n\nTop sources also revealed that Tinubu did not feel comfortable to stay in Lagos during the Presidential visit in order to hide the growing battle between the two from public glare and he instead decided to embark on a journey.\n\nA political analyst, Farooq Kperogi, said on Twitter, \u201cI learned a while ago that Aso Rock didn\u2019t formally invite Tinubu to Buhari\u2019s official functions in Lagos. So, Tinubu jetted off to God knows where (someone said London) to escape public humiliation.\u201d",

          "text": "As the story was breaking on July 7, 2021 that South Africa\u2019s former President Jacob Zuma handed himself to the police at a correctional services facility (prison), in order to begin a 15-month sentence without appeal, I was concerned like most human beings that Jacob Zuma, a 79-year old grandfather and (former) freedom fighter, will find life very difficult inside a prison facility.\n\nJacob Zuma\n\nOn the other hand, I reflected on the unrelenting and serial acts of corrupt enrichment by some members of the ruling African National Congress in privileged positions, the impoverishment of millions of its citizens; the countless abuse of the rights of both the citizens of South Africa and especially the seasonal violence and xenophobia visited upon other African residents and migrant workers in different parts of the richly blessed country!\n\nIt\u2019s sad but true that some of the notorious financial criminals who are making living difficult for those deprived peoples of South Africa rose to power under the umbrella of the African National Congress, that was Mandela\u2019s political party. Hence, within the hour of the Zuma imprisonment breaking news, I wrote on my personal Twitter handle @Chido247 that the \u201cShameful swings of corruption by Zuma n his cohorts damage Madiba\u2019s legacy! Cry, for my beloved Mandela!\u201d\n\nYou may recall that Zuma was forced to resign as president by the ANC due to blatant acts of corruption\n\nThis time, Zuma\u2019s key problem was for contempt from his defying a court order to testify before a judicial commission investigating widespread allegations of corruption during his presidency, from 2009 to 2018. An important report by Mogomotsi Magome of the AP notes that \u201cthe judicial inquiry into corruption during his term as president has heard damning testimony from former Cabinet ministers and top executives of state-owned corporations that Zuma allowed his associates, members of the Gupta family, to influence his Cabinet appointments and lucrative contracts\u2026. In a separate matter, Zuma is standing trial on charges of corruption related to a 1999 arms deal, where he allegedly received bribes from French arms manufacturer Thales. His financial adviser has already been convicted and imprisoned in that case.\n\nZuma has had other legal woes. In 2005, he was charged with rape but was acquitted in 2006 after the court found the sexual intercourse was consensual.\u201d\n\nThose scandalous activities and misconducts are not what Nelson Mandela and Govan Mbeki and Walter Sisulu and Steve Biko and Miriam Makeba and Winnie Mandela and millions of others sacrificed their youth and their lives for!\n\nNo!\n\nSouth Africa is, by most reasonable assessments, among the most endowed and beautiful countries of the world.\n\nI have been to post-apartheid South Africa twice. The first was for a technology business conference. The second was when I traveled as a part of the United States based media who covered the visit of former President Bill Clinton to Southern Africa and west Africa \u2014 during the closing days of March 27, 1998. During this period, the late, great Nelson Mandela was the president of South Africa.\n\nWithout a doubt, South Africans deserve better \u2014 especially after defeating the evil of apartheid, racist and oppressive rule! Somehow that country seems to be losing its focus, again. I explore these issues in more detail and context in my forthcoming 2021 book, MLK, Mandela & Achebe: Power, Leadership and Identity. On the Zuma tangle, one can make the case that it is the rule of law that won and carried the day.\n\nPost-apartheid South Africa had so much promise and hopes for a people and a continent in need of genuine heroes and success stories.\n\n*Dr. Chido Nwangwu, the author of the forthcoming 2021 book, MLK, Mandela & Achebe: Power, Leadership and Identity, serves as Founder & Publisher of the first African-owned, U.S-based newspaper on the internet, USAfricaonline.com, and established USAfrica in 1992 in Houston. He is recipient of several public policy and journalism excellence honors, civic engagement and community empowerment awards and has appeared as an analyst on CNN and SKYnews. He served as an adviser on Africa business to Houston\u2019s former Mayor Lee Brown. @Chido247",

          "text": "Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo says President Muhammadu Buhari will use a simple, commonsense strategy to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaolu Akande, Osinbajo\u2019s spokesman, quoted the vice-president as saying in a statement on Friday.\n\nThree weeks ago, President Muhammadu Buhari set up a national poverty reduction with growth strategy (NPRGS) steering committee, following the approval of the federal executive council (FEC) in April.\n\nSpeaking at the inaugural meeting of the steering committee in Abuja, Osinbajo said the committee would improve the adoption of commonsensical approaches in achieving its objectives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe vice-president said to achieve a different result, the committee will be intentional about its objectives and how to achieve them.\n\n\u201cI really want us to approach this as much as possible, commonsensical so that we are able to resolve all the issues and focus on the real progress,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI want us to look beyond all of what we are going to be doing, there is going to be a considerable amount of paperwork, but a lot of common sense is what grows economies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what other countries have done, not really reinventing the wheel. So, I want us to focus on those commonsensical things so that we can actually move forward.\u201d\n\nCiting the example of Bangladesh\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, osinbajo noted how the country\u2019s manufacturing sector was crucial to its development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said that the committee will consider opportunities in the agricultural sector and how funding can be provided to explore them.\n\n\u201cBangladesh actually exports more garments than we export oil,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCountries that have managed to get out of poverty have created a lot of jobs through industries, and they have developed intentional strategies.\n\n\u201cWe must look at what others have done, the smart things that other people have done, and adopt,\u201d Osinbajo added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think we really need to take a deep dive because governments have made several efforts at poverty alleviation but generally speaking, they have not yielded the sort of results they should yield, and I think it\u2019s because there is a lot of focus on documentation and paperwork and very little commonsense approaches.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo explained that the NPRGS is a national strategy that every tier of government must key into.\n\nHe also added that the private sector must also collaborate with the government to reduce unemployment and lift Nigerians out of poverty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI just want to emphasise that it is a national strategy as opposed to a federal strategy which is why the steering committee is made up of federal as well as state officials,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cEssentially, this effort must also be directed at how to facilitate private sector creation of jobs. The fact is that there is no way that the Federal Government or the State Governments can create the number of jobs that we need.\n\n\u201cWe need to take a few broad looks at the features of what constitutes our present predicaments in terms of job losses and unemployment.\u201d\n\nMembers of the steering committee at the meeting include Kayode Fayemi, Babagana Zulum, and Abdullahi Sule, governors of Ekiti, Borno, and Nasarawa states, respectively.\n\nOthers are Boss Mustapha, secretary to the government of the federation; Muhammad Nanono, minister of agriculture; Niyi Adebayo, minister of industry, trade and investment; Chris Ngige, minister of labour and employment; while Prince Clem Agba, minister of state for budget and national planning, joined the meeting virtually.",

          "title": "Overworked staff, mass exits: The inside story of GTBank\u2019s mobile app and USSD transaction failures",
          "text": "On April 29, Mayowa, 32, was distraught when he couldn\u2019t pay for a 19km Uber ride he had taken to visit a friend in Park View Estate, a well known residential community in the highbrow area of Ikoyi, Lagos. His orange branded Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB) app had not launched as he tried severally to make a transfer from his current account to the empty savings account linked to the debit card on his Uber app.\n\nThinking his MTN data service was the problem, he tried punching his bank\u2019s *737# short code to make the transfer but he got an unresponsive code message.\n\nHe tried again, and again and again without success. Frustrated, he made a last attempt accessing his account through GTB\u2019s mobile website, but it took forever to load. To make matters worse, Mayowa\u2019s buddy was away from home, at a dragging management meeting and wouldn\u2019t pick up his frantic calls.\n\n\u201cTen minutes had passed by now. The Uber driver was looking at me funny. It was embarrassing. I had to plead with him to have some patience,\u201d a laughing Mayowa shared.\n\nOut of Service\n\nMayowa is one of many GTB customers who suffered embarrassment, inconvenience or loss of opportunity, as downtimes on the bank\u2019s USSD or mobile banking services became frequent in the first half of 2021, sometimes stretching days on end.\n\n@gtbank why is your bank frustrating customers? I have not been able to access my GT Mobile App for days now. And when money is sent to my account I don't receive alert be it SMS or Email alert.\n\nI recharged 1k few days ago I was debited, but my phone wasn't credited. \u2014 Precious Oye (@BarrypOye) April 30, 2021\n\nWhat is going on @gtbank_help. I am fed up with you guys @gtbank. Everything is stressful.\n\nWhy have I been experiencing this all evening \ud83d\ude29? Now it's CT11, no more E150.\n\nI am starting to tire of your channels pic.twitter.com/cmLjiiaiEL \u2014 Dr. Ameena (@amkmusty) March 22, 2021\n\nAn employee explained that the E105 and CT11 error codes pop up when a partner firm Clickatell\u2019s server is down or GTB\u2019s API is unreachable to initiate the transaction\n\nBuying airtime on @gtbank app is just pure scam, they would deduct the money n not deliver the airtime and I\u2019m just tired of complaining. \u2014 Abbie \ud83d\udc3e (@Abigailsluvv) June 16, 2021\n\nHow can GTB be silent at a time like this? I know they can see the complaints. Do traditional Nigerian banks no longer care about proving quality customer support & help? Tomorrow, they will still charge us a silly \u2018convenience\u2019 fee \ud83e\udd22 \u2014 Koromone Koroye (@Koromone_K) April 29, 2021\n\nA comparative analysis conducted by TC Insights, of customer complaints on Twitter about the mobile app and USSD services between the first half of 2020 and 2021, showed a 54% spike.\n\nA customer representative with the company explained under anonymity that most of the complaints this year have been about the USSD platform, mobile application, unexplainable SMS charges and lately, One Time Password (OTP) issues.\n\n\u201cThese are the recurring problems and complaints. Just ask any GTB customer. They will share some bitter experiences,\u201d she said.\n\nSeven years ago, Guaranty Trust Bank, Nigeria\u2019s third-largest lender, increased the popularity of mobile banking with its *737# USSD service in Nigeria, introducing a new level of ease to customers.\n\nToday, other banks have adopted it and an estimated 40 million Nigerians use USSD services for mobile banking. According to the GTB\u2019s financial report, its revenue from USSD fees was \u20a62.13 billion ($5.3m) in 2019, a significant 34% increase from the \u20a61.58 billion ($3.9m) made in 2018.\n\nGTB didn\u2019t reveal its USSD revenue for 2020 but it disclosed that the total amount it processed via USSD was \u20a63.89 trillion, a 9.4% increase from the \u20a63.55 trillion processed in 2019. Its mobile app also has over a million downloads on the Google play store alone.\n\nStaff churn and delayed promotions\n\nTechCabal has learnt, from interviews with 19 former and current employees of the bank\u2019s IT division, that the division has suffered a spike in attrition within the last six months. It has resulted in technical gaps and work overload for current employees.\n\nAccording to these sources, the absence of promotions in 2020 for already overworked employees who felt they were deserving triggered the first wave of exits into the labour market which had attractive offers for their talent. The shortage in talent began compounding into increased workload and mounting pressure for remaining IT employees.\n\nAt least ten team members resigned this year from the application development team, a unit which often consists of 20 members, according to a former software developer with the bank .\n\n\u201cI was handling one application then it doubled as a result,\u201d Stanley* said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a particular team where three members left in the space of one month. Now, four people\u2019s responsibilities are being juggled by one person,\u201d another employee, at the time of the interview in May, shared.\n\n\u201cThe pressure is crazy. One person is doing three people\u2019s jobs all in the name of efficiency. That\u2019s why our cost to income ratio will always be the lowest in the industry,\u201d Michael*, an ex-employee exclaimed.\n\nGTB\u2019s operating expense increased by \u20a616.5bn from its 2019 figure (\u20a6131bn) due to additional investment in technology to enable staff to work from home and costs associated with implementing safety procedures as well as COVID 19 protocols.\n\nThe frequent loss of experienced talents without a commensurate hiring rate resulted in gaps in technical capabilities, a source explained.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe application I am managing was handled by two people, but my partner has gone to join another team. If I\u2019m leaving now, a new person can\u2019t cram and get a good grip of everything in my handover note within 3 weeks. We simply need more people on the team!\u201d\n\nThis gap is often reflected when there is a service downtime towards the end of the month caused by server overload. During this period, transaction volume increases due to salary payments and other month-end payments, leading to more pressure on existing resources.\n\nAccording to sources, towards the end of the month, experienced hands would usually be proactive in tracking certain metrics and moving different applications across servers to ensure there\u2019s space for the surge. But in the absence of such hands, performance management and quality control suffer.\n\nTechCabal contacted Guaranty Trust Bank for comments but had not got a response at the time of publishing this article.\n\nIt\u2019s not enough\n\nThe bank appears to have taken some steps to solve at least part of the problem that have caused recurring transaction problems this year.\n\nOn June 2nd, 2021 about 900 staff of GTB received a long overdue announcement: they had been promoted. It offered some consolation to many who had been expecting for a while.\n\nHowever, a software developer who was promoted made it clear that this promotion won\u2019t serve as a solution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still understaffed. The App development team is almost half of what it was at the beginning of the year. They haven\u2019t replaced people. Some people even got promoted but left because they don\u2019t want the stress again,\u201d he said.\n\nAdamu*, a mid-level associate disclosed that complaints have been made to line managers who encouraged the units and explained that recruitments are ongoing for entry-level and experienced hands who will begin resuming from July.\n\n\u201cSo\u2026 let\u2019s wait and see\u201d, he said.\n\n*Name changed to protect their identity.\n\n$1 = \u20a6 400\n\nWritten by Staff Writer Daniel Adeyemi and Editor-in-Chief Adegoke Oyeniyi\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Peter Njonjo wants to change the way food moves in Africa",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nPeter Njonjo started his first business in high school. He noticed a problem; the school canteen was too far from the dormitories.\n\nEvery day, he and his classmates made the tiresome journey from their beds to the canteen to buy bread. Peter\u2019s solution was simple \u2013 buy all of the bread in the canteen, bring it to the dormitories, sell to customers from the comfort of their beds and charge a small fee for this convenience.\n\n\u201cI built a very successful franchise because there were many dormitories so I couldn\u2019t do it alone,\u201d he said to me during our call.\n\nToday, he is solving a similar problem on a much larger scale. He is the CEO and co-founder of Twiga Foods, a company that is taking fresh and processed foods from over 4,000 farmers and manufacturers who are often far away and delivering to more than 35,000 vendors across Kenya \u2013 while charging a small fee for this convenience.\n\nFrom having an incomplete MBA to heading Coca-Cola\u2019s operations across 33 African countries, his story is one of a man who is passionate about making the lives of people just a little easier.\n\nHis name is Peter Njonjo and this is his life in tech.\n\nPeter Njonjo and the case of the incomplete MBA\n\nIf you scroll down to the Education section of Peter Njonjo\u2019s LinkedIn page today you would find an entry for an MBA in Strategic Management from the year 2000 and right below it are the words \u201cMasters Incomplete\u201d.\n\nDuring our call, Peter tells me that he completed the coursework required to get the MBA. The incompleteness would boil down to his final MBA paper and the professor who was in charge of it. Put simply, they were not very cooperative.\n\n\u201cThey were very fussy, they were always changing their minds. And I was very busy.\u201d\n\nYou may ask what could have made a 21-year old Peter too busy to focus all his time on placating his professor \u2013 his job at Coca-Cola.\n\nAround the time when he applied for his master\u2019s program, Peter was also starting a job as an accountant in Coca-Cola with his newly minted degree in finance \u2013 which he had gotten in nine months.\n\n\u201cSo many people have stories of growing up in university and all the partying. For me, it just passed so quickly and I was always in the library.\u201d\n\nDuring the typical two-year window between high school and university, Peter decided to become a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). In that time he made considerable progress. He chose to attend the United States International University Africa (USIUA), a private university in Nairobi.\n\n\u201cBecause of all the work I\u2019d done during my CPA, my undergraduate lasted nine months.\u201d\n\nHis fizzy rise to the top at Coca-Cola\n\nIn 1998, Peter Njonjo was one of the youngest CPAs in the entire country. He joined Coca-Cola as an accountant in that same year and his first task on the job was to reconcile some accounts that just wouldn\u2019t balance.\n\n\u201cI spent very very long hours trying to figure that out.\u201d\n\nBut that was only the start of his 18-year career at the company.\n\n\u201cIf you look at a lot of people who worked in Coca-Cola, the tenures are very long. It\u2019s a company where if your DNA matches that of the company, there are a lot of opportunities for growth.\u201d\n\nAnd Peter was taking as many of these opportunities as he could. For him, it was a case of being an entrepreneur within an existing organisation and owning processes. He was, as he puts it, \u201cusing other people\u2019s money to create value\u201d. This approach endeared him to a lot of people early on and helped to advance him through the ranks so that by the time he turned 31, after 10 years in the company, he became country manager for Kenya.\n\nThree years later, he would be in charge of Coca-Cola\u2019s operations in six countries across East Africa: Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Mozambique. In this time, he would put together deals worth more than a billion dollars in CapEx (Capital Expenditure).\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t slowing down. During his time as general manager of Coca-Cola East Africa, he started his own company with his co-founder and friend Grant Brooke.\n\nTwiga Foods was not the first business they would try to run together. Their first had been a business that involved felling timber and replenishing the plantation where they got the timber from. The business did not work out.\n\nSometime later, Grant came to Peter with an idea. He wanted them to sell bananas.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, I was like \u2018Oh God, this doesn\u2019t sound like one of those things I want to be involved in for the long term. But let me just listen.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd listen he did.\n\nGoing bananas and starting Twiga\n\nA fun fact that would help Peter Njonjo take the leap into the world of bananas is that bananas are one of the biggest traded commodities in the world.\n\nSo the plan was to export bananas. But that was far from a walk in the park.\n\n\u201cWe realised that the supply chains were so broken and there were so many challenges out there. It was not going to be as straightforward as we thought.\u201d\n\nWhen they were unable to sell even one container outside of Kenya, Peter felt it was time for them to sell the bananas locally. But even there, they met broken supply chains that made it hard for them to create any value as many parts of the retail industry was fragmented and informal.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to formalise something that\u2019s informal, you\u2019ll encounter all sorts of challenges.\u201d\n\nOne of those challenges was the absence of a standard for packaging produce. This made it hard for a business like theirs to calculate their gross profit margin per unit because, effectively, the concept of a unit in the market was foreign.\n\n\u201cSo we had to introduce bananas with crates and teach people that you can actually by bananas in crates and buy them ripened instead of buying them and ripening yourself and losing half of it.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of tweaking Twiga\u2019s business model and figuring out the best way to create value, Grant ran the business while Peter sat on the board and helped direct the business. He also continued to rise through the ranks at Coca-Cola, eventually becoming President of Coca-Cola West and Central Africa overseeing 33 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. He would leave this role in 2019 to become CEO of Twiga Foods.\n\n\u201cI had discussed with Grant that if the business ever became too big, then I would be happy to step in. Because, for me, it was a major investment.\u201d\n\nIt was such a big investment for him that while they made attempts to raise more capital for the business, he and his wife decided to sell the home they had built to finance the business in the meantime.\n\n\u201cIt was actually my wife\u2019s idea. We had a term sheet from the lead investor but the due diligence was taking time and I was afraid the company would run out of money before the round closed.\u201d\n\nBut according to Peter, they were fairly confident about where the business was going and so it made sense for them. They would eventually close a $1.75 million seed round.\n\n\u201cAnd I think one of the things you can learn is don\u2019t get too attached to material assets. Instead, focus on legacy and the things you need to build.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlexa, play Legacy by Jay-Z\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m turning 45 this year. I was born and bred in Nairobi, Kenya. I\u2019m the firstborn of four children.\u201d\n\nThat is how Peter Njonjo starts his story on our call. He and his siblings were born to their mother, a retired accountant who is now involved in the family business, and their father, an engineer who is still active in the real estate market.\n\nPeter and his wife Tina have four children. When I ask him about what personal plans he has for him and his family he said, \u201cEnsuring that I\u2019m there for my kids as they grow up and enjoying my marriage with my wife and figuring out things we can pursue that are tied to our passions; be it philanthropy or angel investing.\u201d\n\nFor Twiga, big plans abound as well. In September the company plans to commission the largest standalone banana ripening facility in Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent a good amount of time fine-tuning our business here in Kenya so that should help us scale fast. In the next five years, we want to be in 12 countries on the continent, serving about 100,000 customers a day.\u201d\n\nWith the success it has already recorded in Kenya, Twiga Foods is well on its way to achieving these goals.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "MultiChoice\u2019s bank accounts blocked in Nigeria over alleged \u20a61.8 trillion tax fraud",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) on Thursday said it has directed commercial banks to freeze the accounts of MultiChoice Nigeria Limited (MCN) And MultiChoice Africa (MCA), in an attempt to recover \u20a61.8 trillion in taxes from the companies.\n\nMultiChoice Group is a South African entertainment giant and owner of the popular DStv and GOtv services. Its operations in more than 20 other African countries contribute up to a third of the company\u2019s revenues, with Nigeria being the largest market.\n\nA statement issued by the Director of Communications and Liaison Department of FIRS, Abdullahi Ahmad, accused the company of persistently breaching all agreements and undertakings with the tax agency. MultiChoice also allegedly denied access to their records for auditing, according to a Reuters report.\n\n\u201cThe companies would not promptly respond to correspondences, they lacked data integrity and are not transparent as they continually deny FIRS access to their records,\u201d the executive chair of FIRS, Muhammad Nami, was quoted as saying.\n\n\u201cThe companies are involved in the under-remittance of taxes which necessitated a critical review of the tax-compliance level of the company. Particularly, [MultiChoice Nigeria Limited] has avoided giving the FIRS accurate information on the number of its subscribers and income,\u201d he said.\n\nNami revealed that the revenue service has now instructed banks to sweep the balances in MultiChoice Africa and MultiChioce Nigeria\u2019s accounts before carrying out any other transaction on behalf of the companies. \u201cIt is further requested that the FIRS be informed of any transactions before execution on the account, especially transfers of funds to any of their subsidiaries.\u201d\n\nThe MultiChoice Group reports revenues in primarily two segments \u2013 South Africa and the rest of Africa. According to the FIRS chair, Nigeria contributed 34% of total revenue for the group and the bulk of revenue for MultiChoice Africa.\n\nMeanwhile, MultiChoice\u2019s latest results for the year ended March 31 show that South Africa accounted for 64% of total revenue, while its operations in the rest of Africa contributed 32% of revenue. The rest was generated from its international technology segment.\n\nThe Group, in a statement responding to the accusations, said it had not been formally notified about the matter and the case appeared to be based on \u201cunfounded allegations\u201d that MultiChoice Nigeria had not fully disclosed all its existing subscribers to the authorities.\n\n\u201cWe have engaged openly with FIRS and the engagements are ongoing in a transparent and constructive manner,\u201d it said, adding that it believed the issue could be amicably resolved.\n\nMultiChoice is the latest South African firm involved in a huge tax scandal in Nigeria. In 2018, the Nigerian unit of MTN Group was ordered to pay $2 billion in taxes relating to the importation of equipment and payments to foreign suppliers from 2007 to 2017. Though the tax demand was eventually dropped.\n\nBeing one of DStv\u2019s biggest markets, the tax dispute in Nigeria could significantly disrupt the operations of MultiChoice if it is not resolved quickly.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "text": "Daystar Power, a provider of hybrid solar power solutions to businesses in West Africa, has secured a facility of $20 million from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to fund its project pipeline in Nigeria.\n\nFounded in 2017 by Sunrah Ventures, Daystar Power is an off-grid power service provider whose solutions, \u201cSolar-as-a-Service\u201d and \u201cPower-as-a-Service\u201d provide clean and reliable power while significantly reducing overall power costs for clients.\n\nThe $20 million facility takes Daystar\u2019s total raised funding to $62 million this year. It comes on the back of a $38 million Series-B fundraise in January to expand across West Africa and a $4 million financing for its Ghanaian subsidiary.\n\nThe company, which started out in Nigeria, is now currently active in Ghana, Senegal, and Togo as well, with a representative office in Ivory Coast.\n\nThe IFC investment is split into two equal tranches. Daystar Power will receive a $10 million local currency loan from IFC, which will be provided to its Nigerian subsidiary, Daybreak Power Solutions.\n\nWith the fundraising, the company will invest in hybrid renewable energy systems in Nigeria, where it currently manages and operates 150 power installations.\n\nAnother $10 million subordinated loan will be provided by the Canada-IFC Renewable Energy Program for Africa. Daystar Power is working with the Canadian-funded IFC program, Energy2Equal, to close gender gaps and increase women\u2019s participation in the renewable energy sector.\n\nDaystar Power has 29 megawatts (MW) of installed solar power capacity to date. It plans to expand that capacity to 140MW by 2024, as well as grow its client base in the financial services, manufacturing and agricultural sectors. The IFC investment is important to this ambition.\n\n\u201cThe funds will allow us to grow our installed capacity of solar projects and serve more Nigerian businesses in need of clean and affordable power,\u201d said Jasper Graf von Hardenberg, CEO and Co-founder of Daystar Power.\n\nHardenberg adds that Daystar Power gains \u201cmore than just capital\u201d from the IFC investment. This, according to him, is because the corporation brings a wealth of in-depth knowledge of renewable energy projects and project finance in emerging markets.\n\nThe IFC has financed more than 50 gigawatts of power generation to date, according to information on its website. In terms of renewable energy, the corporation has funded low-cost renewable energy projects with a generation capacity of more than 8 gigawatts in hydropower, 4 gigawatts in wind energy, and 5 gigawatts in solar energy.\n\nMore fundraising news is expected from Daystar Power as it looks to power businesses in West Africa, a region where the rate of access to electricity is 52% on average and power cuts of up to 80 hours are recorded per month, per a World Bank report.\n\nThe company had earlier revealed plans to raise $100 million in the next three years to finance its expansion across the region. The funds, which is a debt, will be raised through five rounds of $20 million each.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article? Please fill out this survey.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

Existing investors like Khosla Impact, ValueStream Ventures, Beta.Ventures, 500 Startups, and Story Ventures participated. New VCs like LocalGlobe, Intercept Ventures, and Future Africa also took part in the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn total, Smile Identity has raised $11 million from investors with this latest funding round. In 2019, it raised $4 million in seed funding.\n\nWhat does Smile Identity do? Founded by Mark Straub and Willliam Bares in 2017, Smile Identity provides identity verification and KYC compliance tools to help African banks, telecom companies, financial service providers, and ride-sharing businesses better engage their customers.\n\nExpansion so far? Following the co-founders\u2019 arrival in Africa, the business has made key strides in its activities, such as the establishment of a local presence in six African countries: Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, Rwanda, and Uganda.\n\nInterestingly, the company claims to connect to over 15 different identity authorities, while its ID validation covers over 250 million identities on the continent.\n\nThe new investment will allow the company to offer even better services and grow in new markets. It will also support more ID types and hire more engineers and staff on the continent.\n\nFor context, read here.\n\nSafaricom increases the cost of airtime\n\nKenyan President, Uhuru Kenyatta, has accepted the Kenyan Parliamentary Committee\u2019s additional taxes proposal.\n\nLast week, I wrote about the Kenyan Parliamentary Committee\u2019s recent call for new taxes on airtime and data service prices. Finally, the bill has been passed into law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause of recent changes to the taxation of telephone and Internet data services, Safaricom, one of Kenya\u2019s top telecom companies, has adjusted the pricing of its products and services.\n\nWhat does this mean for Safaricom\u2019s subscribers? Calls made between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. will now cost Sh4.87 per minute, while calls made between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. will only cost Sh2.50 per minute.\n\nThe cost of Safaricom home fibre for the lowest package will rise to Sh2,999 from Sh2,900, while the silver package increases to Sh4,100 from Sh3,999.\n\nThe gold and diamond packages \u2014 up from Sh5,699 and Sh11,499 \u2014 will now cost Sh6,299 and Sh12,499, respectively.\n\nAdditional fees were also introduced for roaming and international calls. The cost to send a single short message is now Sh1.20.\n\nMeanwhile, the cost of browsing via airtime (without bundles) will increase at a similar rate to voice calls.\n\nSimilar? Mobile network operators, including Airtel Kenya and Telkom Kenya, have also adjusted their calling charges. The two telecom companies have raised the rate of calls to Sh2.78 per minute. Also, the price of Telkom Kenya\u2019s SMS message has increased to Sh1.15.\n\nMarketForce raises $2 million pre-Series A round\n\nFeatured Image Credit: TechCrunch\n\nAnother funding? Yes. Kenyan B2B retail platform, MarketForce, has raised $2 million pre-Series A to focus on its business-to-business (B2B) retail marketplace, RajeRaje.\n\nWho participated in the round? P1 Ventures, Y Combinator, Launch Africa, V8 Capital, Future Africa, GreenHouse Capital, Rebel Fund, Remapped Ventures, and other unnamed investors.\n\nBefore now, the retail distribution platform raised $350,000 in seed round and a $150,000 cheque from Y Combinator as part of the accelerator\u2019s Summer 2020 batch. This round brings the funds raised by the company to $2.5 million.\n\nThe retail distribution platform got into Y Combinator accelerator\u2019s Summer batch 2020, and upon graduation, they decided to attempt the RejaReja model.\n\nRajeRaje is a B2B e-commerce marketplace for merchants and was launched in 2020 to assist informal retail merchants purchase and sell FMCGs and digital financial services.\n\nWith RejaReja, it\u2019s interesting to see MarketForce joining other supply chain revamp startups like TradeDepot and Sokowatch to fix Africa\u2019s unorganised retail supply chains.\n\nRejaReja has more than 15,000 retail customers in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania who use the platform to process thousands of orders daily.\n\nExpansion plans? It\u2019s planning on expanding to Nigeria with the new funds and expanding its product across East Africa.\n\nIncredibly, the founders \u2014 Tesh Mbaabu, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and Mesongo Sibuti, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) \u2014 are computer science graduates with little experience in retail distribution, eCommerce, and fintech.\n\nFor context, read here.\n\nNigeria to block MultiChoice Nigeria and MultiChoice Africa\u2019s accounts\n\nDStv dish.

Yesterday, Thursday, July 8, 2021, Nigeria\u2019s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) announced that it had directed commercial banks to freeze the accounts of MultiChoice Nigeria Limited (MCN) and MultiChoice Africa (MCA) in an attempt to recover \u20a61.8 trillion in taxes from the companies.\n\nWhy did it happen? Abdullahi Ahmad, the Director of Communications and Liaison Department, said the company has continuously violated all contracts and agreements with the tax agency.\n\nBesides, MultiChoice allegedly denied the FIRS access to their records for auditing, according to a Reuters report.\n\nMuhammed Nami, Executive Chairman, FIRS, said that the companies have failed to provide relevant and timely responses to correspondences, and their records are not accurate and accessible.\n\nSo, the banks that handle business for MultiChoice Africa and MultiChoice Nigeria were instructed to perform a balanced search on their accounts before undertaking any other transaction on their behalf.\n\nNonetheless, MultiChoice believes that the case is based on \u201cunfounded allegations\u201d because they were not formally notified on the matter. Also, they said they had not given authorities full access to their subscribers\u2019 information.\n\nMultichoice told Reuters that they had previously engaged in an open, transparent, and constructive dialogue with FIRS, and they hoped that issue could be resolved amicably.\n\nSimilar? In 2018, MTN Nigeria Group was ordered to pay $2 billion in taxes on imports and other payments from 2007 to 2017. However, the demand was later withdrawn.\n\nIf this controversy isn\u2019t resolved soon, it could have an adverse effect on DStv\u2019s operations in Nigeria.

It also added that the group\u2019s performance did not reflect in their tax obligations and compliance level in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReferring to the group\u2019s Nigerian subsidiary, the tax authority said MCN \u201chas avoided giving FIRS accurate information on the number of its subscribers and income.\u201d\n\nAccording to Mohammed Nami, Executive Chairman FIRS, Nigeria contributed 34% of total revenue for the group and the bulk of revenue for MultiChoice Africa.\n\nHowever, per TechCabal, MultiChoice\u2019s results for the year ended March 31 show that South Africa accounted for 64% of total revenue, while its operations in the rest of Africa contributed 32% of revenue. The rest was generated from its international technology segment.\n\nAccording to Reuters, MultiChoice Group makes a third of its business elsewhere on the continent outside South Africa. From the company\u2019s annual report, Nigeria is its biggest market in that segment.\n\nInterestingly, at the close of business yesterday, MultiChoice stocks on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange were down 7.38% from the previous day. The fall reached levels that have not been seen since October 2020.\n\nNigeria\u2019s tax to GDP ratio has steadily declined between 2001 to 2020, reaching a record low of 6.1% in July 2020\n\nWith such an abysmal tax to GDP ratio \u2014 one of the lowest in the world \u2014 the country has tried to increase its tax base. In 2017, it introduced the Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS), from which the government claimed to have raised \u20a670 billion\n\nIn 2019, it also increased its Value Added Tax from 5% to 7.5%, generating \u20a61.53 trillion in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMultiChoice becomes the second South African company to face a crackdown from Nigerian authorities. MTN has been the subject of several penalties, the most recent which occurred in 2018 involved a $2 billion tax bill for payments to foreign suppliers. The bill was later withdrawn.\n\nIn an official reply, MCN said it had not received any notification from FIRS yet. It has however indicated that it is willing to engage the tax authority transparently and constructively. It also said its operations in Nigeria are continuing.\n\nThe company says it has been and is currently discussing with FIRS regarding their concerns and believes they can resolve the matter amicably.\n\nIt remains to be seen if these words will ring true in the coming days.",

They set up the company to eliminate fragmented distribution networks and stores they observed in small retail establishments.\n\nThe company employs fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) distribution networks to distribute digital financial services and FMCG goods because many Kenyans go to these stores for their financial need.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides, the stores serve as points of distribution for financial services.\n\nThese stores also help customers access various forms of financial services such as payments, savings, remittances, and insurance.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the retail startup got into Y Combinator because they utilise FMCG distribution networks. However, upon graduation from Y Combinator\u2019s Summer batch, MarketForce decided to attempt the RejaReja model.\n\nRejaReja model, a B2B e-commerce marketplace for merchants, was launched in 2020 to assist informal retail merchants purchase and sell FMCGs and digital financial services.\n\nThe B2B e-commerce marketplace has prompted MarketForce to join a growing list of startups such as TradeDepot and Sokowatch attempting to revamp supply chain markets for Africa\u2019s informal retailers.\n\nRejaReja provides next-day delivery for hundreds of stock-keeping units (SKUs) from a few FMCG brands. The founders believe that RejaReja represents most of the company\u2019s best opportunities.\n\nIn June 2021, Digiduka, a retail platform founded in Kenya, was acquired by MarketForce.\n\nDigiduka makes it easy for retailers of digital services such as airtime, electricity tokens, and bill payments to resell their products on the platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarketForce\u2019s acquisition of Digiduka allowed it to fully integrate with RejaReja, which provides a mobile wallet for retailers to act as agents for payments and collection via a mobile app, WhatsApp bots, and USSD shortcodes.\n\nMarketForce intends to launch RejaReja in Nigeria and then expand its product to more East African towns throughout.\n\nRejaReja is currently operating in Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, where it claims to process thousands of orders daily on behalf of over 15,000 retail customers.\n\nAs computer science graduates with little experience in retail distribution, eCommerce, and fintech, Mbaabu and Sibuti found it difficult to scale the company initially; however, the company claims to have experienced team members.\n\nAlthough retail distribution is a core business, the CEO stated that finding the right talent and individuals willing to innovate and revolutionise the space has been an interesting challenge.",

He said this in the wake of remarks by Grutters that the European nation was ready to make \u2018substantial return\u2019 of the 1,130 looted artefacts.\n\nMohammed said the issue of provenance, which has to do with the place of origin of the artefacts, should not be allowed to unduly delay the repatriation of the art works, noting, \u201cThat they are known as Benin Bronzes, which is already a confirmation of their source of origin (which is Benin).\u201d\n\nAt a separate meeting with Maas, Mohammed also reiterated that no condition should be attached to the return of the artefacts.\n\nHe stressed the need for the parties to commit to definite timelines for the return of the Benin Bronzes in addition to concluding all necessary negotiations in a very short term.\n\nHe added that the discussions between Nigeria and Germany on the return of the artworks was not the end of an era, but rather the beginning of a new vista of stronger relations, pivoted by cultural diplomacy between both countries.\n\nThe Minister thanked Germany for taking the lead in the global efforts to repatriate all artefacts that were looted from Nigeria and the African continent, adding \u201cWe see Germany as a leader in the efforts to take practical steps to repatriate our stolen artefacts, and we hope Germany will sustain that lead.\u201d\n\nEdo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, who was also on the Nigerian delegation, said a \u201ctransformational\u201d museum is to be built in Benin City, to house the artefacts upon their return, as part of a new cultural district in the city.\n\nThe governor said he was attending the talks to demonstrate the strong partnership involving the Federal Government of Nigeria, the (Benin) Royal family and the people of Edo State.\n\nEarlier, the German Minister of State for Culture, Prof. Grutters, said \u201cthe way we deal with the issue of Benin Bronzes is important to addressing our colonial past,\u201d describing the issues as \u201can important personal concern.\u201d\n\nShe assured the 1,130 artefacts would be returned to Nigeria from the beginning of 2022, noting that Germany had twice sent delegations to Nigeria for talks over the planned repatriation. She said such a move indicated that both sides had moved beyond mere talks, saying all the Museums in Germany stockpiling Benin Bronzes have agreed to cooperate.\n\nOther people on the Nigerian delegation were the Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Yusuf Tuggar and Director-General of the National Commission for Museums and Monument (NCMM), Prof. Abba Tijani.\n\nThey were later taken on a guided tour of the Humboldt-Forum, a royal palace turned museum in the heart of Berlin that houses artworks from around the world.\n\n...",

          "text": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nOver 9,948 persons, as of press time, have signed an online petition urging the Nigerian government and President Muhammadu Buhari to ban the sale of dog meat in Nigeria.\n\nDog meat is a delicacy relished in the south-eastern part of the country. In Akwa-Ibom and Cross River States, it is often prepared with \u2018Kaikai\u2019 (local gin) and Ntong (scent leaves) and sold at major joints.\n\nThe petition, which was started over a year ago by Natasha Choolun, a UK-based international animal rights activist, only began to gain momentum on Thursday, after many Nigerians lended her voices and signatures to the campaign.\n\nThe campaign, which is hosted on Chage.org is titled \u2018\u2018Stop Nigeria\u2019s Barbaric Dog Meat Industry\u2019\u2019.\n\nThe petitioner, Ms Choolun, said the dog meat trade has gained economic value in Nigeria, as neighbouring countries like Niger transport them into the country to meet the growing needs.\n\nMs Choolun, who also said that dog owners are scared of their pet\u2019s safety, is also advocating a ban on \u2018\u2018The Dog Cat Wildlife Meat Trade & Wet markets\u2019\u2019 worldwide.\n\nPetition\n\nThe petition read: \u201cNigeria\u2019s dog meat trade has become so prosperous that dogs are taken from surrounding countries such as Niger and transported into Nigeria, to bolster its growing demand for dog meat, also known as 4O4.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile Nigeria has a growing number of pet owners who have dogs and cats as companions and not for consumption, these owners live in constant fear of having their companion stolen by a local dog or cat thieves, knowing their pet would be sold to a dog trader or butcher, for quick cash.\u201d\n\nChoolun feared that the dog meat industry would make tourists susceptible to transmittable diseases, apart from the gruesome death the \u2018companion animals\u2019 are subjected to.\n\nShe said: \u201dArriving at dog markets, exhausted dogs are unloaded for sale, then crammed back into different cages and reloaded onto different trucks for more gruelling journeys toward dog slaughterhouses, where they face a brutally violent death.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s Slogan \u2018Good People, Great Nation\u2019 should also include its animals and consequently engage police and magistrates to be in sympathy with Nigeria\u2019s animal cruelty laws, to implement and enforce them.\u201d\n\n\u201cLocal residents and international tourists are placed in jeopardy because of the constant threat to health through transmittable diseases such as rabies, related to Nigeria\u2019s dog and cat meat trade.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that Nigeria\u2019s positive new image is tainted by the existence of a cruel dog and cat meat trade which casts a negative shadow over Nigeria. Dogs and cats are companion animals and not food items.\u201d\n\nThe plea\n\nShe urged President Buhari to implement policies that can protect the lives and safety of dogs.\n\nShe said, \u201cWe respectfully ask that the President of Nigeria implement existing laws against animal cruelty, maltreatment and neglect.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso, he should provide funding for traps, neuter and release programs to prevent street dogs and cats from breeding.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll dogs and cats to be vaccinated against rabies, ban dogs and cat meat in Nigeria and shut the trade down.\u201d",

Okpale Ojikpa observed an ambiguity in the First Information Report (FIR) on whether the offences are against Governor Ortom or the state government.\n\nHe added that the said offences were said to be seen on the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) Whatsapp group even when the defendant is not a lawyer.\n\nMoving his oral application for bail, Barr. Okpale argued that the offences against his client were bailable, noting that he (Ode) had in all ramifications displayed a sense of integrity by presenting himself in court without compulsion.\n\nAccording to Okpale, \u201dmy client has shown evidence of a citizen who would not run away from trial or interfer with Police investigation. He has met all the conditions for bail as enshrined in section 166 of Criminal Penal Code, CPC.\u201d\n\nPolice investigator, Inspector Anthony Idoko, told the court that the defendant was arrested on April 22, 2021 and released three days after, maintaining that he was never re-arrested by the Police as he came on his own to the court from his house.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPolice Prosecutor, Hyacinth Gbako, failed in his arguments to oppose the application for bail as he incoherently muttered that the offences against the defendant was published on the internet.\n\nAsked by the presiding Magistrate if the defendant was re-arrested on different charges, Gbako could not explain. Hence, he incurred the wrath of Chief Magistrate who said, \u201cProsecutor you are misleading the court.\u201d\n\nIn his ruling, Chief Magaitrate Vincent Kor noted that the defendant was initially granted administrative bail because he displayed a sense of responsibility..\n\n\u201cI find merit in application for bail by counsel to the defendant and grant him same in the sum of 500,000 naira and a surety in like sum who should deposit a document of landed property with the registrar of the Court, two (2) passports and photocopy of National Identity card.\u201d\n\nAs at the time of filing this report, the defendant was still finding it difficult to meet the bail conditions.\n\nThe case was adjourned to August 31, 2021 for further mention.",

          "text": "Not less than 22 political parties besieged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) headquarters in Abuja on Friday to submit names and particulars of candidates for the November 6 Anambra governorship election.\n\nThe parties, which were part of the 74 parties deregistered by INEC last year, insisted they must be on the ballot papers.\n\nThey claimed to have obtained a declarative judgment by the Appeal Court quashing their deregistration by the Commission.\n\nThe Commission however rejected their request, insisting they remained deregistered.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Nation reports the parties on March 18 submitted letters of notice for governorship primaries for the Anambra poll.\n\nBut the Commission, in a reaction, said it would only recognise and deal with 18 parties for the election pending the Supreme Court judgment regarding its powers to deregister parties.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the parties, National Chairman of United Patriots (UP), Barr. Chukwudi Ezeobika, said the commission refused to accept the nomination forms of candidates who emerged from primaries they conducted.\n\nHe added the commission denied the parties access code with which nomination forms are to be submitted online.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cThe decision by INEC to wrongfully exclude them Parties from the Anambra State governorship election will void the entire process and render the outcome of the Governorship election void as INEC has wilfully chosen to undermine the integrity of our Courts.\n\n\u201cBy refusing to relist these 22 political parties to participate in the scheduled election as Ordered by the Court of Appeal in APPEAL NO. CA/ABJ/CV/507/2020, ACD & 21 ors AND Attorney General Federation & INEC and for refusing these Parties access to contest in the November 6, 2021 Governorship election, INEC has once again shown that it has no regards for the Rule of Law in Nigeria. This behavior is unacceptable as it portends a grave danger to our democracy.\n\n\u201cIn view of the foregoing, the concerned political parties shall take all necessary legal steps to ensure that their rights, as guaranteed under the Law, are fully protected.\u201d\n\nThe affected parties are: the Advanced Congress of Democrats (ACD); Advanced Nigeria Democratic Party (ANDP); All Blending Party (ABP); All Grand Alliance Party (AGAP); Alliance of Social Democrats, (ASD); Change Advocacy Party (CAP); Democratic People\u2019s Congress (DPC) and Green Party of Nigeria (GPN).\n\nOthers are: Peoples Coalition Party (PCP); Progressive Peoples Alliance (PPA); People for Democratic Change (PDC); Young Democratic Party (YDP); Re-Build Nigeria Party (RBNP); Save Nigeria Congress (SNC); Socialist Party of Nigeria, (SPN); United Democratic Party (UDP); United Patriots (UP) and We The People of Nigeria (WTP).

          "text": "\u2026Defectors intimidated by govt instrument \u2013 Secondus \u2026No, APC more transparent \u2013 Gombe gov \u2018\u2026Party\u2019s 2023 chances slimmer\u2019 \u2026We aren\u2019t losing sleep \u2013 PDP \u2026Nemesis catching up with them \u2013 Ojo \u2018\u2026It\u2019s gradually losing grip as main opposition party\u2019\n\nAhead 2023 general elections, governors, lawmakers and other critical stakeholders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have been leaving the party for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). ABDULRAHMAN ZAKARIYAU and BODE OLAGOKE in this report x-ray the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC) and the dark clouds over the leading opposition party.\n\nGovernor of Ebonyi state Dave Umahi left the party last year; the governor of Cross River state, Ben Ayade, also defected to the APC not long ago and only last week, a PDP senator, Peter Nwaoboshi, followed the same route. On June 29, 2021, the Zamfara state governor, Bello Muhammad Matawalle, left the PDP for the APC. Also, all the 24 members of the House of Assembly as well as the three senators and six out of the seven members of the House of Representatives defected to the APC.\n\nNot long ago, the senator representing Delta North Federal Constituency, Peter Nwaoboshi, defected from the leading opposition party to the APC. In Cross River state, thousands of PDP members in Abi local government area, which is the constituency of former Governor Liyel Imoke, defected to the APC. Significantly, after dumping their umbrella for the broom, the crowd proceeded to conduct a symbolic burial of the PDP by setting ablaze a coffin draped in the party\u2019s colours.\n\nOn Wednesday, the last and only PDP member in the House, Jonathan Gaza, who represents Keffi/Karu/Kokona federal constituency of Nasarawa state, also dumped the party for the APC.\n\nAs these defections continue, especially from the opposition to the ruling party, it has brought about a sense of panic in the opposition ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nPDP\u2019s excuses\n\nIn his reaction, the national chairman of the PDP, Prince Uche Secondus, said those who left were intimidated by the instrument of the APC-led federal government. Addressing journalists at a meeting of party leaders recently, Secondus, however, said the PDP would win the presidential election in 2023 \u201cbecause the masses are with the party.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cLet me also emphasise that APC governors and the government of APC are overbearing on the system and moving to poach our governors and this to them is regarded as an achievement. I have never seen where you have an economic crisis, insecurity crisis, then the ruling party poaching governors.\n\n\u201cThey are going after our governors, but we are going after the masses of this country. The governors have one vote each, but we are after the people, the masses. The masses are solidly behind us; the masses are for the PDP and we stand here to state clearly that we shall form this new government coming in 2023 because of the masses and not because of the governors.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame for all the governors that left the PDP for fear. They were intimi\u00addated by the instrument of this government, but I\u2019m hap\u00adpy that the masses in their states especially in Zamfara have not left.\u201d\n\nBuhari gives reasons\n\nOn his part, President Muhammadu Buhari who congratulated Governor Matawalle on his defection to the APC, governors and other politicians for joining the ruling party, saying it\u2019s \u201cbecoming more popular and because of its impressive performance record and commitment to good governance.\u201d\n\nIn a message delivered on his behalf by the secretary to the government of the federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, at the defection ceremony in Gusau, President Buhari said, \u201cI\u2019m proud of your timely and wise decision to join the governing party and our doors are wide open to other politicians who believe in our vision to re-build Nigeria.\n\n\u201cYour voluntary decision to join our party confirms the fact that our agenda for good governance is the only reason why Nigerians are getting attracted to the APC because the other alternative didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nA statement by his presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, further quoted the president as urging APC governors and elected lawmakers across the country \u201cto continue to work harder to ensure our party maintains its popularity and retains power beyond 2023.\u201d\n\nHe reminded all elected party officials that their \u201cperformance at all levels will impact significantly on the fortunes of the party,\u201d adding that \u201cparty leaders should avoid complacency at all times in order to build the APC from strength to strength.\u201d\n\nGombe gov\u2019s take\n\nReacting, the Gombe state governor, Inuwa Yahaya, who ruled out the possibility of the country heading to a one-party system, said PDP members were moving in droves to APC \u201cbecause the ruling party is more transparent.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with one of our reporters, the governor said Nigerians should expect more political parties coming up to join the existing ones as soon as they meet INEC\u2019s requirements and constitutional provisions.\n\nHe said, \u201cA party that is in control necessarily has to attract people that are ready to give their support and they are coming because they realise that APC is more solid, more on the ground and more transparent and open in terms of how it deals with everybody; the high and the low. That is why they are coming; so, we welcome them and anybody that says no should have a re-think because the party is about people and all politicians are invited and welcome to any party that they think belongs to the right track. That is what APC is.\u201d\n\nEx-Edo commissioner\u2019s view\n\nIn his view, a one-time Commissioner for Information in Edo state, Prince Kassim Afegbua, said the continuous defection of governors from PDP to APC was a testimony to the leadership \u201ctactlessness and spinelessness of the Prince Uche Secondus-led NWC.\u201d\n\nAfegbua, therefore, called for the sack of Secondus, warning that the \u201cugly trend if not addressed portends doom and could lead to the collapse of the party.\u201d He, in a recent statement, said, \u201cWhen I raised the alarm two months ago about the gradual decimation of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) by the Uche Secondus leadership, many had thought I was raising dust over nothing.\n\n\u201cThe events of the last one month and the continuing defection of major PDP stakeholders to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) is a further testimony to the leadership tactlessness and spinelessness of the Secondus-led NWC of the party.\u201d\n\nThe statement partly read \u201cIt should be of urgent concern to all stakeholders and organs of the party, including the Governors\u2019 Forum, to arrest this obvious drift which has left our dear party naked before Nigerians, home and abroad.\n\n\u201cThere is a more compelling need to urgently call for a stakeholders\u2019 meeting to mitigate, amongst other things, this obvious decimation of the PDP by a leadership that is utterly bereft of ideas, confused, intellectually hollow, phlegmatic and absentminded in the affairs of the nation and the party.\n\n\u201cAn opposition party that should be gaining momentum because of the leadership failures of the ruling APC is at best losing some of her best hands across the nation and losing the much-needed momentum.\n\n\u201cAll these defections portend bad omen for an opposition party that should gain maximum mileage under a system that has been run aground by the menacing incompetence of the APC-led federal government. On a regular basis, critical stakeholders are defecting to the APC, such bile in the dish.\u201d\n\nAn analyst\u2019s opinion\n\nA public affairs analyst, Samuel James, said with the gale of defections, the chances of the PDP to win the 2023 elections \u201care becoming slimmer.\u201d\n\nIn a phone chat with Blueprint, James said, \u201cWe all know that Nigeria\u2019s democracy is still evolving. In most cases, it is difficult for a ruling party to lose a state that it\u2019s in control of. So, the more states a party controls, the better chances they are to get to win the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cAPC has more governors and more states; out of the 36 States, PDP is in control of 13 while the APC is in control of 22. It simply means that APC is already leading PDP with nine states, from where they can use their governors to make a big difference in the 2023 general elections. So, with all these, the 2023 chances of the party are becoming slimmer.\u201d\n\nPDP scribe\u2019s assurances\n\nDefiantly, the PDP deputy national publicity secretary, Diran Odeyemi, said the party was not losing sleep over the defections of its members.\n\nOdeyemi, in an interview with Blueprint Weekend, said PDP would win the 2023 elections \u201cbecause of the suffering, corruption and the level of insecurity Nigerians are experiencing under the APC administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not losing sleep. We are not, because a political party generally is like an open door and nobody closes it. People can come in and people can go. Since the election will be taking place in 2023, we believe a lot of repairs would have been done for us to win the presidential election.\n\n\u201cWe are going to win the election based on three advocacies: Number 1, virtually all Nigerians have joined PDP in opposing the government of APC. With the suffering, inflation, corruption and with insecurity, everybody has become opposed to this government. So, we believe that Nigeria can not afford to continue suffering. As a result, they are going to vote for the PDP.\n\n\u201cNumber 2, PDP as a political party is going to present a candidate whose performances would have won about 50 per cent of the votes. We are seriously working on this and as soon as we come up with our candidate, Nigerians will clap for us. Finally, we believe as a party we don\u2019t have an internal crisis that will warrant anybody defecting. So, we hope and anticipate that we will reap from their crisis very soon.\u201d\n\nAn expert\u2019s outburst\n\nStating reasons for the defection of PDP governors, a political analyst, Jide Ojo, said \u201cnemesis is catching up with the party for its 16 years of misrule.\u201d\n\nOjo, in a phone chat with our reporter, lamented that, \u201cWe are gravitating towards a one-party state. That is the irony of this whole thing, because we were hoping we are having a de facto two-party system as you have in other democracies like in the UK, where you have the conservative and the labour parties; in the US where you have the republicans and the democrats.\n\n\u201cWhen people have a desire, they will go after it. Yes, about the argument that Uche Secondus needs to go for peace to reign, there are allegations of corruption and embezzlement against him by some members. But then PDP is not new to such controversies.\n\n\u201cThe defections are a nemesis that is catching up with PDP. 16 years in the government; recall how PDP also poached the governors of the opposition to strengthen its hold on power. So, it\u2019s now being treated the way they treated other parties in the past.\u201d\n\nAny way out?\n\nOn the way out for the party to militate against consistent detections, Ojo said, \u201cIt must show beyond just parroting; it must show that it is a born again party. You know part of the problems of the PDP was the imposition of candidates as well as the lack of internal democracy. Look at what happened in their governorship primary election in Anmabra state. Also, remember the South-west zonal congress held in Osun state, it was fraught with vote-padding and other corrupt practices. One wouldn\u2019t have expected that to be happening in the PDP, especially with Secondus apologising for their 16-year misrule, pledging that they had turned a new leaf.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s left for them to do some house-keeping, pursue the rule of law, pursue pro- people policy, and let their governors, senators and representatives be seen to be different.\n\n\u201cThey need to review the party; the chances of the party to win 2023 elections are getting slimmer. They can review their activities as a party and re-build the party; they should make sure their congresses from ward to local government, state and ultimately to the national convention are credible; that will throw up credible candidates.\n\n\u201cIf they can re-build and follow rule of law, if credible candidates emerge from their primaries and they shun money politics, then the party will become attractive to politicians of note.\u201d\n\nAn analyst\u2019s view, BMO\u2019s expose\n\nAn analyst, Musa Ilallah, writing from Maitama, Abuja, noted that the recent defections of top-notch PDP members point to the fact that PDP is gradually losing its grip as a leading opposition party in the country, having failed to provide a mature, foresighted approach as a credible opposition.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) in a signed statement by its chairman, Niyi Akinsiju, and secretary, Cassidy Madueke, \u201cAnd just like that exodus signposted PDP\u2019s loss at the centre in 2015, the latest one is a harbinger of what the opposition party should expect in 2023, especially as APC is evolving into a truly ideological political powerhouse built on integrity.\u201d\n\nIlallah noted further that, \u201cThe high-profile defections and other massive defections of middle and low-level PDP members to the ruling APC explains in unambiguous terms that PDP has failed as a ruling party up to May 29, 2015, and now as an opposition party.\n\n\u201cNon-performance, massive looting and inability of the PDP to deliver the dividends of democracy to Nigerians while in power, despite the enormous funds at its disposal, and lacking the capacity to be a good opposition party have further confirmed that PDP is a sinking ship.\n\n\u201cToday, there is a twist in the narration as opposition members of the PDP are moving massively into the fold of the ruling APC.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s northcentral Kogi state governor Yahaya Bello on Friday kicked against any form of zoning arrangement for the office of the country\u2019s President, describing it as unconstitutional.\n\nGovernor Bello who stated this at an interactive session with journalists is demanding that political parties in the West African country do not limit the choices of citizens and allow them choose the best hands for the job.\n\nAccording to the governor if zoning has been the bane of Nigeria\u2019s problems, former Presidents such as Olusegun Obasanjo, Musa Yar\u2019Adua, Goodluck Jonathan and current president Muhammadu Buhari should have solved the issues facing the southern and northern regions.\n\n\u201cNigeria deserves the best. Nigeria is a ship or a flight that requires the best captain to steer or lead the affairs to the desired destination,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been rotation from PDP almost all this while and what has been our result between then and now.\n\n\u201cIf zoning will solve our problem as at the time Olusegun Obasanjo was the president two terms, all the problems of the south sould have been solved.\n\n\u201cAs at the Musa Yar\u2019Adua came on board, the whole problem of the north should have been solved or when it returned back to the south south, the problem of the riverine, the niger delta or the whole of the south south should have been solved.\n\n\u201cNow we have Muhammadu Buhari, the problem of the whole north should have been solved and I\u2019m not saying all these leaders have not done their best.\u201d\n\nOnly recently, governors of Nigeria\u2019s southern states converged on Lagos state and in a communique demanded that 2023 presidency be zoned to the south.\n\nGovernor Bello thinks the move is unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cDemocracy is all about free choice and about the number, so let the majority choose whomever they want, let political parties not limit Nigerians to who they want to elect into offices.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unconstitutional, not in our own party the APC and it\u2019s not in the constitution if the federal republic of Nigeria. We can\u2019t be picking and choosing when it suits us.\n\n\u201cIf we should continue on this sentiments of rotation of presidency to this region, I say let\u2019s do it perfectly in the interest of equity, fairness and justice. Let\u2019s go back to 1960 when Nigeria got independence, all the leaders we\u2019ve had at national level, you\u2019ll discover that all other geopolitical zones as it exists today have at one time or the other held the position of the president or vice president.\n\n\u201cIf we should go by that, then the Northcentral has been largely shortchanged, then let\u2019s focus our attention on north central.\n\n\u201cThen if we should take it from 1999 then you\u2019re talking about north central and southeast but I continue to insist on let the best candidates emerge.\u201d\n\nBy Abel Ejikeme",
