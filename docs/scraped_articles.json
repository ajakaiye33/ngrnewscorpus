          "text": "A group, Centre for Basic Rights Protection and Accountability Campaign, has petitioned the Rivers State Commissioner of Police, Friday Eboka, over an alleged invasion of the privacy of a 20-year-old woman by a police officer.\n\nThe group, in a petition dated September 6, 2021, signed by its National Coordinator, Prince Wiro, alleged that a police officer simply identified as Benjamin attached to Mile 1, Diobu Divisional Police, Port Harcourt, had barged in on the young woman, Ebube, surname withheld while she was naked.\n\nWiro said the cop had refused to leave the room even when she asked him to leave to enable her to dress up.\n\nThe group urged the CP to order an investigation into the incident which took place on Ogwa Street in the Mile 1 axis of Diobu in Port Harcourt.\n\nWiro said, \u201cWe wrote a petition on behalf of a 20-year-old young lady whose privacy was allegedly invaded by a police officer.\n\n\u201cWe are demanding that the Commissioner of Police should do a thorough investigation into the alleged invasion of the young lady\u2019s privacy and the alleged refusal of the officer to leave the woman\u2019s room even when the woman was naked as of the time he invaded the room.\n\n\u201cWe see the alleged action as a professional misconduct and we ask for a thorough investigation to prove if the officer is culpable or not.

          "text": "Professor Yemi Osinbajo\n\nBy Omeiza Ajayi \u2013 Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has again kicked against calls for secession by separatists in some parts of the country warning that such would be the surest way to extinction.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo gave the warning late Thursday in Abuja while delivering a keynote address at the 2020 Leadership Conference and Awards organized by the Leadership Newspaper Group.\n\nThe Conference which had as its theme, \u201cNational and Regional Security: Role of Political and non-Political Actors in Stabilization and Consensus Building\u201d held at the International Conference Centre ICC, Abuja.\n\nAmong awardees at the event were Central Bank Governor, Mr Godwin Emefiele; President, African Development Bank AfDB, Dr Akinwumi Adesina; Borno state Governor, Prof. Babagana Umara Zulum as Persons of the Year; Gov. Mai Mala Buni of Yobe state and Gov. Godwin Obaseki of Edo state as Politicians of the Year; Gov. Ezenwo Nyesom Wike of Rivers, Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos and Gov. Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara state as Governors of the Year.\n\nOther awardees include the Secretary to the Government of the Federation SGF, Mr Boss Mustapha (Public Service Person of the Year 2020); Late Flying Officer Arotile Tolulope Seraph (Outstanding Young Person of the Year Posthumous Award); Shola Akinlade (CEO of the Year), Abdulrazaq Isa Kutepa (Business Person of the Year); the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC (Government agency of the Year) and the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 (Government agency of the Year).\n\nALSO READ: FG addressed only 2 of 8 ASUU\u2019s demands\n\nSpeaking at the event, Osinbajo said; \u201cOften when we explore the concept of national and regional Security, there is a tendency to situate the discourse around the machinations of externally generated vulnerabilities and external adversaries.\n\n\u201cSo, we argue often that the problem is state fragility in Africa is on account of the colonial origins of her nation-states.\n\n\u201cThe notion for example that Nigeria is a hastily and arbitrarily cobbler together, patchwork of mutually alienated kingdoms and as a result, it has remained plagued by fundamental challenges rooted in its founding.\n\n\u201cNow, this is a popular view but of course it is not the whole true. Indeed it is my humble view that the colonial beginnings of African nation-states do not constitute an inimitable obstacle to nation-building that it is often thought to be. After all, colonialism itself was a historic global phenomenon across states from Africa to Asia to Europe and America.\n\n\u201cThe chief weakness that we have is a human one.

          "text": "From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan\n\nIslamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, is attempting to relocate fleeing terrorists that are being smoked out of the Northern Nigeria via military operations to Oke-Ogun, which is a political division of Oyo State, with 10 local government areas.\n\nThis allegation was made by a socio-political group, under the aegis of Alliance for Oke-Ogun Development (A.O.D), following Gumi\u2019s recent visitation to Igboho, headquarters of Orelope Local Government Area of Oyo State.\n\nNational Coordinator of AOD, Otunba Abiodun Fasasi, in a statement, described Gumi\u2019s visit to Igboho as a clandestine move by him and others to further deepen the alleged \u2018Fulanisation Agenda\u2019 of Nigeria, adding that the move would make Oke-Ogun area, another hotbed of crisis between the dwellers and the marauding Fulani herders.\n\nA video clip went viral on social media recently in which Gumi was seen with a Professor of Hematology-Oncology, Usman Yusuff, making comments at Muslim Grammar School, Igboho, saying the visit was for the continued unity of Nigeria.\n\nFasasi hinted that the recent victory of the Nigerian Army over terrorists in the North East and other parts of northern Nigeria, necessitated the visit of Gumi, Prof. Usman and others to Oke-Ogun area and called on the traditional rulers in the region to be wary of insiders, who are ready to sell out to terrorists.\n\nThe group also called on the Federal Government, especially the Directorate of State Security Service (DSS) to invite Gumi in a bid to finding out the real reasons for the visit of Gumi and others to Oke-Ogun area.\n\nFasasi stated: \u201cIt is rather mindboggling to hear that Sheikh Gumi and his co-travelers were in Igboho, Oke-Ogun.

He recently accused the Nigerian President of political gullibility for tackling the bandits, trivializing the military action ongoing in Zamfara State, known as festival of fire by tagging it \u2018unwise decision that no reasonable solution can come out of.\u2019\n\n\u201cAgainst the backdrop of the above, convincingly we now know better who Sheikh Gumi is, having seen the handwriting on the wall as the military action is neutralising, eliminating and destroying the bandits in their scores and as the bandits are fleeing the northern parts of the country, especially Zamfara and its environs. It\u2019s unacceptable for Gumi and his bandits to see Oke-Ogun, Oyo State as their haven.\u201d\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

Hope Uzodinma within a short time.\n\nHe said: \u201cSeeing is believing. I received invitation to come and see what the governor wanted me to see.\n\n\u201cI have seen it now, justified by his integrity in making sure he is working very hard to get things that are necessary for the good life of the people of the state.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really impressed with what he has done.\u201d\n\nThe President, who emphasised the importance of infrastructure and security, said Uzodimma was going through the same problem as himself at the center to make sure that infrastructure was in place.\n\n\u201cI am very pleased with what I have seen and I assure you that at the center, I will help Imo within the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI thank you very much for being peaceful and providing the weather for us to go round with the governor to see what he is doing in the state,\u201d the president said.\n\nEarlier in a speech, Uzodimma expressed joy that the president made the visit, \u201cdespite challenges\u201d.\n\nHe recalled that his administration commenced virtual commissioning of projects in March by Buhari.\n\nHe described the projects as strategically and economically important to the people of the state.\n\n\u201cWhen I took office last year, I undertook a holistic study of the needs of the people.\n\n\u201cI found out that the infrastructure of the state had totally collapsed as almost all road network were broken.\n\n\u201cOwerri was worst hit with flood sacking most part of the city, while property owners had surrendered to the flood, especially within D-Tiger and Chukwuma Nwoha axis,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor said the second phase of the Naze Road, through Obinze Link Road, which was abandoned for over 15 years, would be inaugurated before the end of the year.\n\nHe said his administration had done 46 roads, including the Mohammadu Buhari Avenue, housing the Federal Secretariat.\n\n\u201cWe are doing more because we believe that with the right infrastructure, our economic development will be hastened and life would be much better for our people.\n\n\u201cThat is what informed our decision to permanently solve the perennial flooding in the capital city, Owerri.\n\n\u201cThe balloon-driven tunnel at the base of D-Tiger Road was built to check flooding in the area and to recover property swallowed by flood in the last 20 years.\n\n\u201cThe tunnel is 2.45 kilometers in length, 1.8 meters in diameter and between 0.9 and 11.5 meters in depth with 94 manholes,\u201d Uzodinma said.\n\nHe expressed confidence that Owerri would become flood-free, when the second phase of the projects would be completed.\n\nHe said the Egbeada Bypass, also inaugurated by Buhari, would help to ease traffic in the city.\n\nHe further said the new Executive Council chambers, which was rebuilt after 40 years, was equipped with modern communication facilities to ease policy and decision making.\n\nHe thanked the president for his swift response to end the \u201cpolitically-contrived security breach\u201d in Imo.\n\nHe expressed his administration\u2019s commitment to the peace and unity of the country by building a mini-Nigeria within the state.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Chairman of the South-East Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ebonyi, Dave Umahi, and Chief Andy Uba, the Governorship Candidate of the Progressives Congress in Anambra, attended the event.\n\nAlso in attendance were some ministers and presidential aides from the southeast, the Executive Secretary, National Agricultural Land Development Authority, Mr Paul Ikonne, and other top federal and state government functionaries.

          "text": "Africa received 5.5m vaccine doses in September\n\nS/Africa hosts regional genomic surveillance centre\n\nBy Onyebuchi Ezigbo\n\nThe weekly COVID-19 cases in Africa have fallen by more than 20 per cent, the sharpest seven-day decline in two months, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said.\n\nIt disclosed that a total of 5.5 million doses were received through COVAX in the first week of September by countries in Africa.\n\nWHO further said it is collaborating with Bioinformatics Institute in an effort to set up a Regional Centre of Excellence for Genomic Surveillance and Bioinformatics in Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nSpeaking during a virtual press conference on COVID-19 pandemic, facilitated by APO group Monday, the Regional Director of WHO for Africa, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, said the continent has recorded more than 165,000 cases in the week ending on September 5 with 23 per cent lower than the week before.\n\nShe cautioned that COVID-19 variants may likely prolong Africa\u2019s pandemic wave.\n\nThe organisation also said the rate of deceleration is slower than the previous waves owing to the impact of more transmissible variants.\n\nShe added that the third wave pandemic appears to be tapering off.\n\nIn a statement issued by the Communications Manager at the WHO Regional Office for Africa, Saya Oka, the regional director said this week\u2019s figure is higher than the weekly cases recorded at the peak of the first wave.\n\nShe explained that the more contagious Delta variant, that partly fuelled the third wave, has been dominant in several countries that experienced the COVID-19 surge.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn southern Africa, for instance, where more than 4,000 COVID-19 genome sequencing data was produced in August, the Delta variant was detected in over 70 per cent of samples from Botswana, Malawi and South Africa, and in over 90 per cent from Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cWhile COVID-19 cases have declined appreciably, the downward trend is frustratingly slow due to the lingering effects of the more infectious Delta variant.\n\n\u201cWe are spearheading critical work and supporting countries in scaling up pathogen surveillance through genome sequencing to detect and respond effectively to COVID-19 variants.\u201d\n\nMoeti disclosed that WHO is working with Bioinformatics Institute in an effort to set up a Regional Centre of Excellence for Genomic Surveillance and Bioinformatics in Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nAccording to her, the centre will support 14 countries before being expanded to serve more countries.\n\nMoeti recalled that last year, WHO and partners established a COVID-19 sequencing laboratory network in Africa which has to date produced nearly 40,000 sequencing data.\n\n\u201cThe continent lags far behind the rest of the world when it comes to sequencing, with only 1 per cent of over 3 million COVID-19 sequences conducted worldwide occurring in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe third wave has shown us how variants can hijack the efforts to tame the pandemic. Countries must step up surveillance because without genomic information, variants can spread undetected. You can\u2019t fix what you don\u2019t measure.\n\n\u201cWHO has also recently provided financial support to countries including Eswatini, Sao Tome and Principe and Senegal to reinforce genomic surveillance. To date, the dominant Delta variant has been detected in 31 African countries, while the Alpha and Beta variants have respectively been identified in 44 and 39 countries,\u201d she said.\n\nThe C.1.2 variant initially identified in South Africa has so far been detected in 130 cases in 10 countries globally, including five in Africa.\n\nAlthough the variant has exhibited concerning mutations, there is no evidence that it is more transmissible or may affect vaccine efficacy, but more research is needed.\n\nAs Africa\u2019s third COVID-19 pandemic wave eases off, vaccine shipments to the continent continue to grow, with around 5.5 million doses received through COVAX in the first week of September. However, only around 3 per cent of the continent\u2019s population is fully vaccinated.\n\n\u201cTo ultimately tip the scales against this pandemic, our best efforts to reduce transmission through public health measures must be met by a significant step-up in vaccine supplies and vaccinations,\u201d she said.\n\nMoeti was joined at the virtual press conference by Prof. Alan Christoffels, Director of the South African National Bioinformatics Institute, and Dr Christian Happi, Professor of Molecular Biology and Genomics and Director at the African Centre of excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases at Redeemer\u2019s University in Nigeria.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

They filled the land with sorrow, tears, and blood, \u2018dem regular trademark\u2019 (as Fela Anikulapo-Kuti would say). Now, the shoe is on the other foot.\n\n\u201cIn the different evil forests, when the Nigerian Air Force strikes from the sky, the remnants of the evildoers not killed immediately attempt to flee. The ground troops then pick them off like flies. I say it again. One has never been prouder of our troops. They are cleaning up the country.\n\n\u201cShocking and disconcerting, however, that in the middle of all these, you still hear words meant to discourage our gallant soldiers.

          "title": "Why Nigeria\u2019s vehicle financing culture is struggling to take flight",
          "text": "Owning a personal vehicle is of economic importance. Next to housing, transportation is often the second largest expenditure for the majority of urban households anywhere in the world. But insufficient purchasing power among middle-class Nigerians coupled with limited or no access to vehicle financing puts cars out of reach for over 90% of the population.\n\nIn developed economies, car loans and vehicle financing schemes help people spread out vehicle payments over several months or even years. However, the auto financing space is still very nascent in Nigeria.\n\nGbenro Dara, the Managing Director of Olist Nigeria, explains to TechCabal some of the reasons behind Nigeria\u2019s significantly costly and inaccessible vehicle financing schemes. According to him, two major factors that influence the access and affordability of car loans are interest rates and the value of the vehicle being financed.\n\nExpensive interest rates\n\nA number of banks and startups currently provide car loans but they aren\u2019t exactly cheap, and accessing them can be difficult due to prohibitive credit criteria and high-interest rates. According to Dara, the latter factor is the biggest drawback when it comes to vehicle financing in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe interest rates available in the auto financing market is the main challenge,\u201d said Dara, who\u2019s led four online marketplaces with significant interests in the automotive sector over the last decade and also pioneered an automated process for used car loans as CEO of Cheki (which was recently acquired by Autochek).\n\nFor car loans, banks in Nigeria lend at rates between 18% to 30% per annum compared to an average interest rate of less than 5% available for a 72-month vehicle financing scheme in the United States.\n\nGetting a loan from commercial banks in Nigeria also comes with a lot of paperwork and processes, making their approval rate very low, at about 20%.\n\nMicrofinance banks, on the other hand, are less strict with requirements, as opposed to larger banks which are more focused on mid-to-large corporate clients. Several microlenders have developed vehicle financing programs, which take the asset as collateral. However, they are still not able to offer car loans at significantly lower interest rates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken out a vehicle loan for 4% per month for a 2-year tenor, and ended up paying almost two times the amount of the invoice value of the vehicle,\u201d Dara said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not entirely the fault of the banks as they derive their interest rates from the prime lending rate of the Central bank of Nigeria.\u201d He however called on banks to do better by innovating more for the growth of the automotive sector in Nigeria.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe tokunbo problem\n\nThe vehicle market in Nigeria remains heavily dominated by imported second-hand cars (popularly referred to as tokunbo), primarily due to the inability of most Nigerians to afford brand new cars, including those assembled locally. According to Dara, the predominance of used vehicles discourages banks from providing car loans.\n\nThere are approximately 15 million vehicles on Nigerian roads with most of them older than 20 years. The average age of private cars in major cities in the country is 14 years, most of which are likely to have been resold to more than five owners. For light commercial vehicles such as danfos and molues, the average age is estimated at 24 years.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, total new vehicle registrations annually in Nigeria are estimated at 400,000 (excluding motorcycles), but only 5% of which are brand new vehicles. The rest are mostly shipped in from North America, Europe, and Dubai.\n\nThese vehicles, which have often suffered accidents, been repossessed, are out of warranty, and with little or no history about prior usage and service, are referred to as \u201cgrey imports\u201d. That is, they are traded outside authorised channels and since they\u2019re not purchased from official manufacturers or accredited dealers, do not come with the service support of the producer.\n\nTo minimise the risks associated with providing credit for imported second-hand vehicles, most banks that finance used cars do so through partnerships with car dealers, and not directly. For example, Tokunbocars.ng is backed by Guaranty Trust Bank, UBA, Zenith, and Sterling Bank.\n\nA drag on the local auto industry\n\nThe lack of proper vehicle financing schemes in the country not only deprives the average Nigerian of a chance of getting a personal vehicle but also has implications on the local automotive industry.\n\nDespite being the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria\u2019s new passenger vehicle sales are far behind sales in countries such as South Africa, Egypt, and Morocco.\n\nGlobally, about 80 to 95% of purchases of cars are done through loans and leasing by government or private entities. In the United States, it is estimated that 85% of all new car purchases are financed.\n\nWithout such financing mechanisms available to buy cars in Nigeria, locally-made brand new vehicles are out of the financial reach of most Nigerians, the majority of whom have seen their purchasing power dwindle over the years.\n\nIn 2020, less than 10,000 brand new cars were sold in Nigeria, compared to over 247,000 in South Africa. According to unofficial figures from auto dealers cited by Dara, up to 80% of the purchases in Nigeria were made by the government and large corporations, mostly with bank credit and at non-retail rates.\n\nBeyond the direct impact on how Nigerians commute, the current state of vehicle financing in Nigeria leaves the country\u2019s auto industry facing challenges that stall its growth potential.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

A writedown of MTN\u2019s Afghanistan business without any proceeds from disposal is estimated to cost about R700 million ($49 million) according to undisclosed sources familiar with the negotiations.\n\nThis move is in line with MTN\u2019s announcement just over a year ago to exit countries in the Middle East over the next three to five years, in order to focus on African markets. The carrier earlier this year abandoned its operation in Syria, citing regulatory demands that made operating there untenable; last month the carrier stated that it was still evaluating options in Yemen and Afghanistan.\n\nThe sale of its Afghanistan unit is crucial to MTN as it plans to raise about R15 billion ($1 billion) from shareholding sales in markets outside Africa. The proceeds will be used to reduce its huge debt of nearly R50 billion ($3.5 billion) for the year to December 2020 as well as allocate more capital investments in Africa by 2025.\n\nUnlike MTN, the other telecom companies operating in Afghanistan, which also includes state-owned Afghan Wireless and Etisalat of the United Arab Emirates, have reassured customers and investors that services will keep running following the collapse of the US-backed government last month while trying to secure the safety of their employees in the country.\n\nMTN currently serves over six million customers in Afghanistan, its planned exit could serve as an opportunity for other Afghanistan telecom players to expand their market share, while MTN does the same in Africa.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

OPay\u2019s recent $400 million raise is the region\u2019s largest venture round, followed by Interswitch\u2019s $200 million investment from Visa and Flutterwave\u2019s $170 million fundraise.

Mobile money adoption has expanded since then, driven by early telecom entrants that had the requisite infrastructure and user base (mobile networks and subscribers) to establish the service.\n\nOrange is Senegal\u2019s largest mobile operator and controls around 50% of the telecom market share with nearly 8 million mobile users, twice as many as runner-up Free, which has 4.4 million subscribers. Expresso Telecom, a unit of the UAE\u2019s Expresso Telecom Group Limited, holds 22% of the market share, with over 3 million subscribers.\n\nAll three telecom firms provide mobile money services under the Orange Money, Free Money, and E-Money brands respectively, and along with banks, dominate the digital financial services space. Other third-party providers like fintech have had to make do with small market shares while competing with incumbents.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBut Wave, a product created by two Americans (Drew Durbin and Lincoln Quirk) to lower the cost of mobile money transactions, piloted in 2016 and officially launched in Senegal a year later, entered the market with a 70% cheaper service.\n\nWave offers free deposits and withdrawals via its mobile application and applies a fixed transaction fee of just 1% for money transfers between individuals. Unlike its competitors, Wave passes additional fees on bill payments from users on to businesses. For users without a smartphone, it provides a free QR-card to transact with agents, who are able to open accounts, receive deposits, and execute withdrawals.\n\nAccording to co-founder Drew Durbin, Wave is building a mobile money service that is \u201cradically affordable\u201d. The startup has had to build its own infrastructure, including agent and consumer applications, an agent network, and QR cards in order to provide its super cheap service.\n\nWave\u2019s co-founders, Drew Durbin (left) and Lincoln Quirk.\n\nThe startup\u2019s low-cost transaction service has helped it take on incumbents, eat into their market share, and turn the entire mobile money industry on its head.\n\nWave\u2019s strategy has managed to shake Orange in particular. To match the ultra-competitive offer that the startup has operated with since May 2020, the telecoms company was forced to lower its prices as well, bringing down bill payment fees to 1% from June 1.\n\nPressure on the network operator also saw it stop users in Senegal from purchasing Orange airtime via Wave\u2019s mobile application, a move that\u2019s been described as anti-competitive by the fintech company and resulted in a dispute currently in the hands of the country\u2019s telecoms regulator.\n\nWave\u2019s branch in Dakar \u2013 which is led by IT veteran Coura S\u00e8ne \u2013 claims to be the largest mobile money player in Senegal with over half of the country\u2019s adults, between four and five million people, making up its several million monthly active users. The Wave app has more than 5 million downloads on Google PlayStore. As reported by TechCrunch, the startup processes billions of dollars in annual volume and has partnerships with UBA and Ecobank for its Senegal operations.\n\nHaving previously raised just $13.8 million since its creation, Wave was able to attract the landmark Series A funding from investors to expand its disruptive business model, which has seen it become one of the most-used mobile money services in Senegal and achieved unicorn status \u2013 startups valued at or above $1 billion \u2013 as a fintech in Africa.\n\nOther African unicorns include fintech startups OPay, Flutterwave, Interswitch, Fawry as well as e-commerce giant Jumia.\n\nWith the fresh investment, Wave plans to deepen its presence in Senegal and Ivory Coast, a country it expanded into recently and is currently running communication campaigns to raise awareness. The startup also intends to grow its 800-man team across product, engineering, and business, as well as expand into other markets it considers regulatory-friendly, like Uganda and Mali.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmeka was eight years old when he dropped out of primary school. He couldn\u2019t read and write at the time, and his environment was not conducive for learning.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in primary school, I used to think I wasn\u2019t cut out for school. And the fact that I was living in the village didn\u2019t help matters. My classmates would tease me, which would discourage and make me sad,\u201d he recounts.\n\nAccording to African Library Project (ALP), a non-profit organisation that builds libraries in rural Africa, 22% (30 million) of Africa\u2019s primary-aged children were not enrolled in school in 2019.\n\nThe ALP also says that 48 million youth aged 15 to 24 are illiterate, while more than 1 in 3 adults cannot read. This translates to 182 million adults who are unable to read and write.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPer Statista, 66.8% of Africans aged 15 and above could read, write, and understand a simple statement in 2019. With an 80% literacy rate, Southern Africa ranked highest, with Northern, Eastern, and Central Africa recording rates above 70%. In West Africa, however, only 51% of adults could read or write.\n\nEmeka believed he wasn\u2019t cut out for school because he could neither read nor write. Something which could easily have been attributed to dyslexia, a learning disability.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that a developmental delay, such as a literacy delay, is not the same as a developmental disability.\n\nDistinguishing development delays from developmental disabilities\n\nA developmental delay simply means that a child is behind on some developmental milestones; it does not indicate a specific health problem.\n\nDevelopmental delays can occur in cognition, communication, behaviour, socialisation or emotional functioning, and motor abilities. That children have any of these delays doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t match their peers.\n\nTherefore, according to Healthline \u2014 an American website that provides medical information and health advice \u2014 early intervention and treatment can help a child achieve normal development as they mature. A delay indicates that the child\u2019s learning problems will be corrected if given enough time.\n\nA developmental disability, on the other hand, is a neurological disorder with long-term outcomes. And the World Health Organization (WHO) states that most disabilities have three dimensions: impairment, activity limitation, and participation limits.\n\nWhen there\u2019s an overlap\n\nStudies have shown that determining whether a child has a developmental delay or a disability can be difficult because a delay can be an early sign of a learning disability, which is not the same as a physical disability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, most professionals can\u2019t detect learning disabilities until a child is old enough to show deficits in courses like math, reading, and spelling.\n\nDespite Emeka\u2019s literacy delay, he could have improved significantly in a better school environment, with supportive parents and early intervention using tech tools. But he only began to make some progress when he was 20 years old after he arrived in Lagos State.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t start to learn how to read and write until I came to Lagos about four years ago. You know, I was surprised to see children as young as seven read and write. That prompted me to buy a smartphone,\u201d he recalls.\n\nWhen mobile phones play a part in literacy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Borgen Project, an organisation in the United States focused on improving poverty through online and community presence, reported that mobile phones help thousands of people in developing countries learn to read.\n\nFor emphasis, a different study by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) reveals that hundreds of thousands of Africans use mobile technology for texting.\n\nAccording to a World Bank report, illiteracy in Africa is caused in part by a lack of books. It states that this situation is amplified by Africa\u2019s rapidly growing student population, resulting in textbook-to-pupil ratios of 1:11 for reading and 1:13 for arithmetic in some countries.\n\nHowever, mobile phones can help solve this problem. Before the widespread use of mobile phone technology, Africa\u2019s adult literacy rate (pdf) stood at 52%; by 2008, the literacy rate had risen to 63%.\n\nWith a smartphone, Emeka\u2019s ability to read and write improved while using Google Voice, Google Translate, and Predictive Text before he could start writing and reading. It also helped that he had supportive friends.\n\nBesides the tools Emeka used, there are many options to choose from.\n\nThree tech tools to improve literacy\n\n1. Read Along\n\nFormerly Bolo, Read Along is a free Google-developed language-learning app for children launched on March 7, 2019, to help children have fun while learning to read.\n\nRead Along includes an in-app reading companion that coaches children by listening to them while they read aloud, offering assistance when they get stuck, and awarding stars when they succeed.\n\nIt works best for children who already have a basic understanding of the English alphabet.\n\n2. Rewordify\n\nCreated by Illinois-based high school special education teacher, Neil Goldman, Rewordify allows you to copy and paste any text. It also replaces difficult words with simpler ones.\n\nDepending on the settings, those simplified words can replace the original ones, be seen with a mouse click, or displayed next to the difficult words. It appears to be very sophisticated, and the precision of the simplified word choices is exceptional. Unlike some other websites, Rewordify does not just display word definitions.\n\nFurthermore, teachers can use the site to create various learning activities based on the text that students can complete.\n\n3. Newsela\n\nNewsela is an Instructional Content Platform that brings together engaging, accessible content with integrated assessments and insights to supercharge reading engagement and learning in every subject. Content on Newsela covers topics students care about that connect to the core curriculum and align with standards.\n\nThis app and website, designed for pupils just learning to read and write, does a great job of combining how to read and write engagingly. Letter sounds are taught in small groups and include audio and physical cues for learning \u2014 students will hear the sounds and trace the letters with their fingers or a stylus.\n\nIt includes a spelling game and sends weekly update emails to parents and teachers.\n\nThese and other tech tools have revealed the importance of technology on literacy as these tools are available to everyone, regardless of age.\n\nLiteracy is crucial in social and economic development. It expands knowledge, and a literate person is more likely to understand and adjust to society. Increased literacy in youth and adults has the power to change Africa.\n\nTherefore, access to technology, the Internet, mobile phones, and tech tools are critical to closing the gap between increased illiteracy rates and the challenges in the way.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Akiddie is scaling to become a storytelling platform for minority kids worldwide",
          "text": "\u201cI came up with the Akiddie idea because I felt my niece deserved better, more representative stories, and that idea still drives what we do today, only that it\u2019s no longer for just my niece, it\u2019s for every child around the world and their right to having content that affirms them.\u201d \u2014 Dominic Onyekachi, CEO of Nigerian media startup, Akiddie.\n\nThe last time we covered Akiddie, we detailed how the startup was creating the most extensive collection of African children\u2019s stories, to give children powerful and culturally relevant stories. In the past year, the startup has been scaling to cater to minority kids across the globe.\n\nUntil recently, most children\u2019s literature from popular culture has mainly featured Western civilisations, and there was a distinct lack of diversity. These authors even proffer that children\u2019s literature had mostly featured white males as the main attraction.\n\nOnyekachi discovered the true extent of this when he visited his niece.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDominic Onyekachi (Co-founder and CEO, Akiddie). Source: Supplied\n\n\u201cNot only were the stories there white and foreign, which I felt wasn\u2019t representative of her, but the themes were also outdated and probably outright sexist. For example, they emphasised marriage as the ultimate achievement for women.\u201d He told Techpoint Africa in 2020.\n\nAs Onyekachi would later discover, this problem was not unique to his niece or even Africans.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison Cooperative Children\u2019s Book Center (CCBC) reveals that compared to 2019, books written by authors of colour increased by 3% from 25.9% to 26.8% in 2020.\n\nHowever, the CCBC reveals that children\u2019s books about racially diverse characters increased by just 1% to 30% in 2020.\n\nA 2019 survey in the UK also reveals that just 10% of children\u2019s literature published that year had a minority character. Though the survey\u2019s methodology did not paint a complete picture, it, at least, showed that despite recent improvements, there\u2019s still much room for growth.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource; Supplied\n\nIn Donna Norton\u2019s 2010 book, Through the Eyes of a Child: An Introduction to Children\u2019s Literature, she argues that children\u2019s literature helps them appreciate their and other people\u2019s cultural heritage and helps them develop emotional intelligence and creativity.\n\nThe predominant feature of Western stories and the relative dearth of minority stories has made the result somewhat lopsided.\n\nLily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, President of America\u2019s National Education Association (NEA), believes that \u201cdiverse literature helps children see themselves as the hero of the story.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn August 2020, just one month after an interview with Techpoint Africa, Akiddie got featured on CNN, and what followed caused him to rethink the company\u2019s business model.\n\n\u201cWe got a lot of emails after our CNN feature asking for us to replicate the model we created for African children for other minorities. On further research, we discovered that the main reason why there wasn\u2019t a lot of minority children\u2019s content was that it was difficult to monetise,\u201d he says.\n\nAfter running through the numerous possibilities, Onyekachi realised that pivoting was a no-brainer.\n\nFrom library to creator platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Moonseeker, by Nigerian actor, fashion consultant and on-air multimedia personality, Denola Grey. Source: Supplied\n\nOnyekachi reveals that instead of collecting children\u2019s stories and maintaining a subscription library, Akiddie is currently a digital content marketplace that allows creators to upload and sell their children\u2019s content either one-off or get them to subscribe to their channel on Akiddie.\n\n\u201cWe now offer content in text, audio, and video formats. They range from audiovisual learning aids covering the entire primary school curriculum to videos that teach etiquette and DIY skills to entertaining stories.\n\n\u201cI came up with this idea because I felt my niece deserved better, more representative stories, and that idea still drives what we do today, only that it\u2019s no longer for just my niece, it\u2019s for every child around the world and their right to having content that affirms them,\u201d he says.\n\nBesides minority children, Onyekachi believes this new model will cater favourably to minority content creators across the globe.\n\nHe argues that aggregating platforms like YouTube Kids pay on ad revenue. To earn a significant amount of money, the content has to appeal to the mainstream/majority of people. For him, representative content from minorities can\u2019t scale because they can\u2019t get the numbers that mainstream content gets.\n\n\u201cFor instance, a story about the Three Little Pigs on YouTube can garner millions of views because it appeals to their majority audience, while a story about Sango or an African folktale would struggle to crack a million views.\u201d\n\nWhile Onyekachi\u2019s assertion seems to be true, with the right backing, there have been a few exceptions in popular culture.\n\nPixar\u2019s 2017 animated movie, Coco, celebrated D\u00eda de los Muertos (the Day of the Dead), a holiday marked widely by Mexicans worldwide in honour of departed loved ones. Interestingly, it grossed $57.8 million in Mexico, and $807 million worldwide, topping China\u2019s and the US\u2019 box office for three straight weeks.\n\nWhile a great deal of research went into Coco\u2019s story, very few minority content creators have the backing of an uber studio like Pixar, and a content marketplace like Akiddie\u2019s might help them reach interested global audiences.\n\nOnyekachi believes that the average minority community anywhere globally has a strong cultural affinity and that parents would pay a premium for content that affirms their culture/religion.\n\nHe states that since the average minority content creator will not get an audience of 10 million on YouTube, Akiddie is helping them sell directly to their community.\n\nUnofficial reports from 2002 claimed that 15 million Nigerians lived in the diaspora, but the country\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs (now Ministry of Interior) put that number at 20 million.\n\nInterestingly, the Lebanese government has stated that there are more Lebanese in the diaspora (15.4 million as of 2018) than in Lebanon (6 million).\n\nFor Onyekachi, Akiddie will aggregate these fragmented communities across the globe, making a huge market share for the creator. The platform also makes it easier to monetise.\n\n\u201cFor example, the average income from one million views on YouTube is about $4,000 (can be a lot higher depending on the creator). A minority creator would struggle to crack one million views on YouTube selling to his community. Still, he can make $4,000 on Akiddie if he/she can convince 1,000 members of his community to buy a $5.30 content or pay a $5.30 subscription to access his/her channel on Akiddie.\u201d\n\nHowever, aggregating communities from ethnically diverse countries like Nigeria with 371 tribes might not be so straightforward. For instance, will an Urhobo family be interested in content from a Tiv creator or vice versa?\n\nAkiddie currently supports payouts to creators in the USA, Canada, UK, France, India, Australia, and Nigeria, and the CEO says monetisation can start in six hours. The company also states that it processes payments worldwide and produces its top-of-the-line content.\n\n\u201cWe also allow for creators to collaborate on a project and share payouts based on pre-agreed ratios. We are currently the only platform that supports content distribution in text, audio, and video,\u201d Onyekachi states proudly.\n\nThe company takes 25% of all revenue generated from the content on the platform to cover creator processing fees, payment processing fees, and content hosting and distribution.\n\nThe company already boasts creators like Yodabox (entire primary school curriculum as video lectures), Bino and Fino (Nigeria\u2019s biggest YouTube animation show), and D\u00e9nola Grey, a fashion consultant, actor, writer, and on-air multimedia personality.\n\nTo learn more about how to become a content creator on Akiddie, click here.\n\nWhat happens from here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnyeckachi is optimistic that Akiddie\u2019s opportunities following this pivot are enormous.\n\n\u201cThis route means Akiddie can also be a vital learning aide, as demonstrated by the fact that you can currently subscribe to Yodabox on Akiddie and have access to all primary school subjects and topics in the form of richly animated videos.\u201d\n\nHe also believes it helps the team come up with innovative monetisation strategies.\n\n\u201cFrom a storefront that allows instant merchandising to a platform that crowdfunds creators in return for a share in their revenues when they start monetising on Akiddie to a content marketplace that allows you to buy the entire rights to content,\u201d he muses excitedly.\n\nWhile Akiddie wants to back minority creators, stellar outings like Coco, and Moana (which features Pacific Islanders), and Disney\u2019s recent partnership with Kugali media to animate Iwaju, show there are opportunities for content creators to go mainstream with relatable minority characters.\n\nWithout revealing too many details, Onyekachi says the company is working on strategic partnerships to make this happen.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s National Broadband Plan set a supposedly ambitious target for the country to attain 70 percent broadband penetration by 2025. However, African peers \u2013 South Africa and Egypt \u2013 currently record 113 percent and 74 percent penetration rates, respectively, according to data from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).\n\nBroadband penetration in Nigeria has been on a free fall in the past seven months, falling from a peak of 45.93 percent recorded in October 2020 to 39.79 percent in July 2021. Experts say this is largely due to the temporary suspension of SIM card sales in order to achieve the National Identification Number (NIN) registration exercise.\n\n\u201cThe drop mirrors the downward trend in the number of active mobile lines, as a result of the regulator\u2019s temporary halt of SIM card sales, and the National Identification Number (NIN) and SIM card integration exercise,\u201d analysts at FBNQuest note in a report.\n\nNigeria is not only behind South Africa and Egypt; it also trails Kenya, which has achieved 48 percent so far. At 39 percent, Nigeria accounts for less than 40 percent of South Africa\u2019s broadband penetration and about 55 percent of Egypt\u2019s penetration numbers. Importantly, it means that almost 60 percent of the population in Nigeria lacks broadband connectivity.\n\nMobile internet connections account for over 99 percent of Nigeria\u2019s broadband base, according to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). The country has largely neglected investment in high speed broadband that has remained below 1 percent for many years.\n\nIt is not the best place to be for a country with the largest number of people in Africa and an ambition to become a full-fledged digital economy.\n\nRead also: The internet, free speech and responsibility (1)\n\nThe difference between Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, and Kenya is that while Africa\u2019s largest economy talks so much about boosting penetration, the other countries are putting their money where their mouth is.\n\nThe Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector in Egypt is very robust, with a growth rate higher than Egypt\u2019s overall level of GDP growth, equivalent to 15.2 percent in fiscal year 2019/2020. Its contribution to the GDP has increased to 4.4 percent in fiscal year 2019/2020 compared with 3.5 percent in 2018/2019. Total investments in the sector increased by 35 percent in 2019/2020 and reached $3.5 billion.\n\nIn contrast, Nigeria has seen a decline of about 20 percent in investment in the telecoms industry in the past 3 to 4 years. Experts say to achieve quality broadband access will require an estimated investment of about $5 billion (~N2.3trn).\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic when businesses were migrating to digital platforms and upgrading their digital infrastructure, little attention was paid to upgrading telecoms infrastructure in Nigeria. A full-year report by the NCC found that capital inflow into the telecoms industry in 2020 declined to approximately $417 million compared with $942.8 million in 2019.\n\nOn the other hand, operators in South Africa made good use of the pandemic to deepen investment in high-speed internet infrastructure. Apart from deploying fibre-to-home infrastructure, companies like Vodacom and MTN switched on 5G mobile networks in three cities \u2013 Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town, with further rollout plans to other parts of the country. MTN launched with 100 sites covering areas of Johannesburg, Cape Town, Bloemfontein, and Port Elizabeth.\n\nThe Kenyan government has also intensified infrastructure rollout in recent years. As of March 2021, the country has completed the backbone section of the project and fibre installed in all 47 counties. Metropolitan fibre civil works have also been completed in 35 of the 47 counties. The available international bandwidth for 2018/19 stood at 4707.46Gbps and the number of broadband subscriptions has grown strongly, rising from 5,327,859 in 2015 to 22,198,610 in 2019. This indicates continuous growth in the sector with the potential for more expansion.\n\nAlthough MTN is also interested in pushing the 5G network in Nigeria, the largest network in Africa is still struggling with losses incurred from the SIM card suspension. As a result, 5G rollout in Nigeria remains at developmental stage.\n\nFBNQuest notes that MTN Nigeria accounted for about 45 percent (about 6.7m) of the total share of internet disconnections, a reflection of its dominance in market share terms. Airtel, Glo, and 9Mobile were responsible for 36 percent, 11 percent, and 8 percent of the lost internet subscribers, respectively.\n\n\u201cStudies by the ITU suggest that a 10 percent increase in broadband penetration is likely to translate to increases of 2 percent and 1.8 percent in GDP for low-income and middle-income countries. On this basis, we estimate the benefit of such investments to the economy at almost c.6.0 percent of GDP. Broadband subscriptions (millions) and penetration rate,\u201d says FBNQuest.",

          "text": "On August 29,2021, Atedo Peterside, founder of Stanbic IBTC Bank, indicted the NNPC in a tweet that there was an allegation the Corporation was dipping its hand into the Federation Account in order to announce bumper 2020 profits.\n\n\u201cThey should come clean and publish details of all dividends received by them and tell us which ones they recently diverted from the Federation to themselves,\u201d Peterside tweeted then.\n\nSince the Corporation released its financial statements Wednesday night many doubts have greeted its N287 billion declared as 2020 profit.\n\nTo arrive at a profit in 2020, the NNPC declared a net impairment reversal of N713 billion in 2020 compared with a loss of N273 billion in 2019.\n\nReversal of impairment is a situation where a company can declare an asset to be valuable where it has previously been declared a liability, according to a global body for professional accountants \u2013 Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA).\n\nAccording to the notes from NNPC\u2019s audited report, \u201cThe impairment reversal in 2020 relate mainly to the recovery of strategic alliance receivable amount from the federation and reversal of the full impairment on receivables which are no longer doubtful.\u201d\n\nFinancial experts have questioned how the NNPC was able to revalue a whopping N713 billion initially assumed to be doubtful receivables from the federation account.\n\n\u201cThese are all exceptional items that won\u2019t happen every year,\u201d Charles Akinbobola, energy analyst at Lagos-based Sofidam Capital, says.\n\nRead also: Oil companies face maintenance worry on Nigerian assets\n\nAnother shocking revelation from the audited report is a 153.95 percent increase from the NNPC\u2019s Other Incomes from N266 billion in 2019 to N675.7 billion in 2020.\n\nThree major components of the Other Incomes include a N110.6 billion refund from the federation, N157 billion from sundry incomes (amounts recovered from the federation relating to strategic alliance balances), and a N250 billion from variation in crude stocks, which represents movements in crude inventory, under-lift and over-lift positions.\n\nKalu Aja, director of finance and operations at a Washington-based Community Foundation of Snohomish County, says the Corporation was able to show positive results due to cash \u201cinfusion\u201d from the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThe cash infusion is more than cash generated from the operations of the Corporation,\u201d Aja states, adding, \u201cTo be legal and clear, this is correct. The question is should a Corporation that has a negative short-term position post billions in accounting \u2018profits\u2019\u201d?\n\n\u201cWould I buy a stock that holds cash in \u201ctrust\u201d and posts negative current assets?\u201d he asks further.\n\nOluwole Adenuga, auditor in Ernst and Young Energy Unit, says no serious analyst would directly rely on the performance for the year without first normalising the earnings \u2013 removing the one-off effects of profits or losses that can muddy the picture of the corporation.\n\n\u201cThe corporation is still loss-making and the normalised earnings would have better reflected the impact of COVID-19 on their business,\u201d Adenuga says.\n\nElochukwu Oguebue, head of finance at American International School of Lagos, notes that despite the media hype, NNPC is still a loss-making entity.\n\n\u201cOne assumption I can make from the disclosure on the impairment reversal and other notes to the accounts is that the Federal Government must have injected funds into NNPC in 2021. Or what else could have prompted the reversal,\u201d Oguebue states.\n\n\u201cTo reverse impairment on receivables, the auditors must have seen a document that convinced them that most of that amount is recoverable,\u201d he notes.\n\nNNPC\u2019s 2020 audited financial statement is the third it has publicly released in its 44-year history. Following the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill, the NNPC is set to become a commercial firm.\n\nAt first glance, the audited report shows that aside from the already announced Profit After Tax (PAT), from a loss position of N1.7 billion in 2019 to N287 billion in 2020, NNPC\u2019s total current assets increased by 18.7 percent compared with that of 2019, while its total current liabilities increased by 11.4 percent within the same period.\n\nThe 2020 audited NNPC report identifies under-recovery, crude and pipeline losses, pipeline maintenance as incurred costs, which the Federal Government allowed the state-owned Corporation to take from its revenues before passing the balance to the Federation Account.\n\nFor instance, in 2020, the NNPC incurred N102 billion on under-recovery, N16 billion for crude and product losses, N53 billion for pipeline management cost, and N32 billion for deregulation losses, which were payable to marketers as approved by the Presidency.\n\nExchange loss, which occurred as a result of translation of foreign accounts payable transactions for domestic crude lifting, increased by 100 percent costing NNPC N72.4 billion in 2020, while employee benefit expenses increased by 10 percent to N397 billion within the same calendar year.\n\nNNPC\u2019s total revenue, which came from the sales of crude oil, petroleum products, gas, and other services, including seismic contracts and gas transmission tariffs declined by 24.6 percent to N3.7 trillion in 2020.\n\nThe auditors of NNPC, made up of PricewaterhouseCoopers, SIAO Partners, and Muhtari Dangana & Co. raised \u201cmaterial uncertainty\u201d about the group\u2019s current liabilities exceeding NNPC\u2019s current assets by N4.6 trillion.\n\nIn 2020, a detailed breakdown showed NNPC recorded group current liabilities of N10.8 trillion, which outweighed the firm current assets of N6.2 trillion.\n\nThe report also explained how NNPC had been sustaining recurring losses over the years, culminating into N1.5 trillion as of December 2020.\n\n\u201cThese events or conditions along with other matters indicate that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the group and Corporation\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern,\u201d PwC, SIAO Partners, and Muhtari Dangana & Co say in a joint statement.",

          "text": "Importers and manufacturers are now counting losses due to the high cost of doing business and poor service delivery at inland dry ports, popularly known as bonded terminals or inland container depots (ICDs).\n\nBuilt for the sole aim of easing or averting congestion at the main port terminals, many bonded terminals in Nigeria have failed to meet up with the purpose of their existence as containers also get trapped in their premises.\n\nConsequently, importers that have their containers transferred to these terminals end up experiencing delays that result in payment of extra cost as demurrage to shipping companies. This is such that an importer could pay as much as N3 million per container to cover transfer charges and demurrage to shipping companies due to the longer dwell time of the container.\n\nBusinessDay understands that Nigeria is yet to leverage the existence of inland ports to deal with the issue of port congestion, as ships still wait for 21 days in the anchorage before having access into the port to berth and discharge cargoes.\n\nRead Also: Cargo movement to river, inland ports, maritime security top agenda for maritime agencies\n\nIbrahim Tanko, national coordinator of the 100 percent Compliance Team of the National Association of Government Approved Freight Forwarders (NAGAFF), says some bonded terminals in Nigeria do not have sufficient equipment and infrastructure to enable container examination in their premises.\n\n\u201cOur containers are being dropped on flooded grounds for examination, especially when it rains, and we must put on a rain boot to be able to access some of these terminals. This has led to some of the content of these containers being damaged, most especially those in cartons, thereby resulting in loss for the importer,\u201d he explains.\n\nAccording to Tanko, some of these bonded terminals do not have forklifts to drop containers for Customs examination, and in most cases, it takes weeks to drop containers for examination, thereby increasing the demurrages paid by importers to shipping companies.\n\nWhile noting that the Nigerian Shippers\u2019 Council (NSC) had mandated bonded terminal owners to put an end to collection of transfer charges, he says importers still pay transfer charges at these terminals.\n\nGiving an insight into the problems associated with doing business at inland ports, Tony Anakebe, a maritime analyst, says it takes time for containers to be assigned from the mother port to inland ports.\n\n\u201cIt also takes time for bonded terminal owners to move containers to their terminals when ships are allocated to them due to challenges with gridlock on the port road. When they finally do, they charge transfer charges to cargoes, which is an extra cost to the importer. And if the barge or truck used in transferring the container encounters a problem on the way, it will take longer and incur extra charges for the importer,\u201d he states.\n\nCiting an example, he says if a container is allocated to Denca Services, it will hire barges or trucks to move the container to its terminal, and this takes weeks or months.\n\nThe delay in moving the containers to the inland ports leads to payment of demurrages by the importer, he states, adding that some of the terminals are mostly located in inaccessible areas due to bad roads.\n\n\u201cBonded terminals still collect transfer charges from importers because the last container my company cleared at Denca in Amuwo-Odofin in Lagos, we paid over N170,000 as transfer charges, which is an added cost to the cost of transporting the container to the importer\u2019s warehouse,\u201d he says.\n\nRecall that in 2020, the NSC under the immediate past leadership abolished the collection of transfer and storage charges by bonded terminal owners to streamline the cost of doing business.\n\nInterestingly, containers transferred to bonded terminals come with bills such as transfer charges to cover the cost of transporting the container from the mother port to the bounded terminal where the owner can carry out Customs\u2019 clearing processes before the container can be taken to the owner\u2019s warehouse.\n\nIn some cases, importers also pay storage charges for containers not lifted directly from the ship but allowed to overstay the rent-free days in the mother port.",

          "title": "Weekly COVID-19 cases in Africa fall by more than 20% \u2013 WHO",
          "text": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that weekly COVID-19 cases in Africa fell by more than 20 per cent, the sharpest seven-day decline in two months as the third wave pandemic tapers off.\n\nMatshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, made this known during a virtual press conference on Thursday.\n\nQuoting reports, she said that the African continent registered more than 165,000 cases in the week ending September 5, a 23 per cent decline from the previous week.\n\nMrs Moeti said that, however, due to the impact of more transmissible variations, the rate of slowing is slower than in prior rounds.\n\nShe said that the more contagious Delta variant that partly fueled the third wave has been dominant in several countries that experienced COVID-19 surge.\n\nAccording to her, in Southern Africa, for instance, more than 4000 COVID-19 genome sequencing data was produced in August.\n\nMrs Moeti said that the Delta variant was detected in over 70 per cent of samples from Botswana, Malawi and South Africa and in over 90 per cent from Zimbabwe.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nAccording to her, while COVID-19 cases have declined appreciably, the downward trend is frustratingly slow due to the lingering effects of the more infectious Delta variant.\n\n\u201cWe are spearheading critical work and supporting countries in scaling up pathogen surveillance through genome sequencing to detect and respond effectively to COVID-19 variants.\u201d\n\nShe said that in collaboration with the South African National Bioinformatics Institute, WHO was at the forefront of the efforts to set up the Regional Centre of Excellence for Genomic Surveillance and Bioinformatics in Cape Town.\n\n\u201cThe centre will support 14 countries before being expanded to serve more countries.\n\nMrs Moeti said that in 2020, WHO and partners established a COVID-19 sequencing laboratory network in Africa which has to date produced nearly 40,000 sequencing data.\n\n\u201cThe continent lags far behind the rest of the world when it comes to sequencing, with only one per cent more than three million COVID-19 sequences conducted worldwide occurring in Africa.\n\n\u201cThe third wave has shown us how variants can hijack the efforts to tame the pandemic,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nAccording to her, \u201ccountries must step up surveillance because without genomic information, variants can spread undetected. You can\u2019t fix what you don\u2019t measure.\u201d\n\nMrs Moeti said that WHO has also recently provided financial support to countries, including Eswatini, Sao Tome and Principe and Senegal to reinforce genomic surveillance.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cto date the dominant Delta variant has been detected in 31 African countries, while the Alpha and Beta variants have respectively been identified in 44 and 39 countries\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe C.1.2 variant, initially identified in South Africa, has so far been detected in 130 cases in 10 countries globally, including five in Africa.\n\n\u201cAlthough the variant has exhibited concerning mutations, there is no evidence that it is more transmissible or may affect vaccine efficacy, but more research is needed.\n\n\u201cAs Africa\u2019s third COVID-19 pandemic wave eases off, vaccine shipments to the continent continue to grow, with around 5.5 million doses received through COVAX in the first week of September,\u201d Mrs Moeti said.\n\nShe said that, however, only around 3 per cent of the continent\u2019s population is fully vaccinated.\n\n\u201cTo ultimately tip the scales against this pandemic, our best efforts to reduce transmission through public health measures must be met by a significant step-up in vaccine supplies and vaccinations,\u201d Mrs Moeti said.\n\n(NAN)",

I am both thankful for the invaluable support of our stakeholders and proud of the resilience NGX Group continues to demonstrate after over six decades. Despite the global pandemic and other economic shocks, it is indeed noteworthy that we have already begun to actualise the benefits of demutualisation including the alignment of stakeholders\u2019 interests in the value created by the new Group under a revised Corporate Governance framework.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on outcomes of the AGM, Ogunbanjo further stated, \u201cWe received approval of new equity-based incentive schemes for employees which are in line with the authority granted to Directors by then Members of NSE at an Extraordinary General Meeting conducted in March 2020 and adhere to global best practices allowing us to attract and retain the best talent. Today, I am more confident than ever that the Group is well-positioned to deliver value to shareholders as we move into a new growth phase.\u201d\n\nThe Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, NGX Group Plc, Oscar N. Onyema, OON, said, \u201cWe thank our shareholders for their support of the resolutions proposed at today\u2019s meeting. Our 2020 results reflect the challenging macroeconomic and market conditions, as well as operational resilience of the Group with income and resulting surplus after tax valued at N6.02Bn and N1.84Bn respectively. In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, we maintained tight cost controls, which reduced expenses by 13% despite investments in technology that allowed us to operate remotely with zero downtime. The Group ended Year 2020 in a sound financial position with net asset growth of over 10% to N31.28Bn.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, NGX Group and its wholly owned subsidiaries \u2013 Nigerian Exchange Limited, NGX Regulation, and NGX Real Estate \u2013 continue to advance the realisation of our vision to be Africa\u2019s leading integrated capital market infrastructure provider. As the Group progresses its plans to list on Nigerian Exchange, we look forward to welcoming a broader group of investors to share in our journey.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s president, Muhammadu Buhari has argued that it would out of place for any Igbo person to consider himself as not being part of Nigeria, given that Igbo people are scattered in every part of the country.\n\nBuhari who was responding to the growing agitation for a separate state of Biafra in the country\u2019s Southeast at a town hall meeting with the zone\u2019s leaders during his one-day official visit to Imo State, said he would strive to leave a lasting legacy of integrity and accountability in the country\u2019s system.\n\nPresident Buhari also told the people that he would want to be remembered as the President who stabilised Nigeria in the area of security, economic prosperity and triumph over corruption.\n\nThis is as the President also said that nobody can accuse him of having companies or mansions anywhere in the country and that he tries to keep himself as clean as possible so that he cannot be taken, hostage.\n\nAccording him, with less than two years left in his eight-year tenure as President, security still remains a major priority for his administration.\n\nA statement issued by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity quoted Buhari to have said, \u2018\u2018If there is no security, there is nothing anyone can do no matter how much you try or the initiative you have.\n\n\u2018\u2018Security is the number one priority and then the economy. When people feel secure they will mind their own business.\u201d\n\nHe told South-East leaders that while fighting corruption in Nigeria had become very sophisticated and difficult, he would continue to strive to leave a lasting legacy of integrity and accountability in the system.\n\nAccording to him, \u2018\u2018Nobody can accuse me of having companies or mansions anywhere in the country and I thank God that I try to keep myself as clean as possible so that I cannot be taken, hostage.\n\n\u2018\u2018I will do my best to ensure that Nigerians that try hard, succeed in their efforts.\u201d\n\nOn the forthcoming 2023 elections, the President reaffirmed his commitment to free, fair and credible polls, urging the leaders to honestly educate their constituencies on the need to hold their elected representatives accountable.\n\nAcknowledging the resourcefulness and enterprising spirit of Igbo people, the President said:\n\n\u2018\u2018The fundamental thing about the Igbo people is that there is no town you will visit in Nigeria without seeing the Igbos being in charge of either infrastructure or pharmaceutical industry.\n\n\u2018\u2018Therefore, it is unthinkable for me that any Igbo man would consider himself not to be a part of Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018The evidence is there for everyone to see that Igbos are in charge of Nigeria\u2019s economy.\u2019\u2019\n\nNoting that no country can make any meaningful progress without the development of infrastructure, the President expressed regret that successive governments at the Federal level contributed to the decay of critical infrastructure in the country.\n\nHe promised that the Federal Government would complete ongoing key projects in the South East, including the 2nd Niger Bridge as well as the railway lines and routes linking the region with other parts of the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018I firmly believe that when you get infrastructure right, Nigerians will mind their own businesses,\u2019\u2019 he said, adding that as a group, the Igbos stand to benefit more from the ongoing development of infrastructure in the country because \u2018\u2018they are more enterprising.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari had earlier commissioned four projects executed by Governor Hope Uzodinma, including the Naze/Ihiagwa/Nekede/Obinze link road, the Balloon Driven/Flood Control drainage at Dick Tiger Road, the Egbeada Bypass road and the New Exco-Chambers, Government House, Owerri.\n\nAddressing Imo residents at the commissioning of Egbeada bypass named after a prominent son of the State, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, the President said he was very impressed with the level of work done by the State government.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am very pleased with what I have seen and I assure you that I will support Imo State within the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn his remarks at the town hall meeting, Governor Uzodinma said Ndigbo believe in a united Nigeria predicated on \u2018\u2018justice, equity and fairness.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe thanked the President for addressing the interests of Ndi Igbo through deliberate policy initiatives designed to give the people a true sense of belonging, including the ongoing construction of the 2nd Niger Bridge, among others.\n\nGovernor Uzodinma said the people of South-East would remain grateful to the President for approving the establishment of a Naval Base in Oguta Local Government Area of the State, adding that as time unfolds, the economic benefits of the base would manifest.\n\nThe Governor also commended the President for strongly supporting the appointment of two prominent Igbos into two key international organisations-Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, Assistant Director-General of Health Emergency Intelligence, World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\nIn his remarks, the President-General, Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide, Prof. George Obiozor assured the President of the continuous support of Ndigbo.\n\n\u2018\u2018Ndigbo is committed to Nigerian unity and there is news for those trying to push us out of Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018Ndigbo in Nigeria are like fish in the ocean and no matter how rough the storm is, it cannot drive the fish out of the ocean.\n\n\u2018\u2018Mr President, it is in this context, that we see a new dawn in your distinguished presence in Igbo land and believe that on your return to Abuja the significance and substance of this visit will form a new foundation of a platform for meaningful dialogue on critical issues of concern to the Igbo nation,\u2019\u2019 he said.",

We never crossed the boundary. No sex,\u201d Tega explained in PUNCH Live on Wednesday.\n\nBoth Boma and Tega were evicted on Sunday, alongside Peace and Michael during the King Size eviction night.\n\nAfter her eviction, Tega made several efforts to clarify that despite her romance with Boma, they never had sex.\n\nA viral video clip had shown Boma kissing Tega passionately in the executive lounge; and another scene showing erotic movements under the duvet. Boma, however, said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nBoma said that there were many moments involving every housemate, such that it could be difficult to recollect some of the issues involving him and everyone.\n\nBoma, who also spoke on PUNCH Live on Wednesday, said that no sex happened and that everything that took place in the House was a mere show, rather than reality.\n\nHe noted that everything was premeditated and that he only apologised for peace sake, to enable him focus on his job now that he is out of the house.\n\nNarrating what happened under the sheets, Tega, who apologised for her actions in the house, said Boma was seen reaching for tissue paper while under the duvet because he had sinuses.\n\nShe said, \u201cI have seen the videos. Boma has sinuses and beside his bed, there are like tiny packs of tissue papers, right. So often, I wake him up to blow his nose. We were kissing. So it is not like we did not kiss, we did.\n\n\u201cWe went in hard, but we had boundaries. No sex; but we needed something for it to look real.\n\n\u201cI also saw videos of when he called me to the executive lounge and I was still trying to take off my nightwear.\n\n\u201cI think I wanted to have a bath when he called me to get dressed fast.

We never crossed the boundary. No sex,\u201d Tega explained in PUNCH Live on Wednesday.\n\nBoth Boma and Tega were evicted on Sunday, alongside Peace and Michael during the King Size eviction night.\n\nAfter her eviction, Tega made several efforts to clarify that despite her romance with Boma, they never had sex.\n\nA viral video clip had shown Boma kissing Tega passionately in the executive lounge; and another scene showing erotic movements under the duvet. Boma, however, said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nBoma said that there were many moments involving every housemate, such that it could be difficult to recollect some of the issues involving him and everyone.\n\nBoma, who also spoke on PUNCH Live on Wednesday, said that no sex happened and that everything that took place in the House was a mere show, rather than reality.\n\nHe noted that everything was premeditated and that he only apologised for peace sake, to enable him focus on his job now that he is out of the house.\n\nNarrating what happened under the sheets, Tega, who apologised for her actions in the house, said Boma was seen reaching for tissue paper while under the duvet because he had sinuses.\n\nShe said, \u201cI have seen the videos. Boma has sinuses and beside his bed, there are like tiny packs of tissue papers, right. So often, I wake him up to blow his nose. We were kissing. So it is not like we did not kiss, we did.\n\n\u201cWe went in hard, but we had boundaries. No sex; but we needed something for it to look real.\n\n\u201cI also saw videos of when he called me to the executive lounge and I was still trying to take off my nightwear.\n\n\u201cI think I wanted to have a bath when he called me to get dressed fast. When he said that, I just took off my nightwear and wore jeans and a singlet, then we went in.\n\n\u201cThe kiss was prompted by us talking about the production crew focused on what we were doing.\n\n\u201cFor those saying he fingered me, that never happened.

One has never been prouder of our military.\n\nI see the hair splitting over whether they should be called terrorists rather than bandits, and I laugh. Sheer sophistry.

A bandit-lover is on record as saying military offensive would not work, and that the bandits \u201care going nowhere.\u201d True? False. They are going somewhere. And that is: hell.\n\nIn my days as a newspaper editor, I remember when a butcher in Sierra Leone called Foday Sankoh died. Now, if anyone was brutal, evil through and through, Foday was. He loved to amputate innocent people. And he would cynically ask if they wanted short or long sleeve. If you chose short sleeve, he cut off the hand from the elbow. If you wanted long, he did from the wrist. After some time, Sierra Leone was swarming with amputees. He was urinating inside the same well from which he would fetch drinking water.\n\nFoday Sankoh was an implacable demon. Till God moved against him. He was arrested, and took ill in custody. Ended in a wheelchair, and lived out his life in misery, facing trial. Then he died. As editor of Daily Sun, my headline was \u2018Foday Sankoh goes to hell.\u2019 Judgmental? Well, he asked for it.\n\nOn the same day, I took a popular British tabloid to read. The lead story was also on Sankoh. The headline? \u2018Next stop: Hell\u2019 That\u2019s it. The stubborn fly follows the corpse into the grave. The evildoers had all the opportunity to turn a new leaf. They were deaf to reason. They deserve what they are getting now, so that decent people can live in peace.\n\nBecause we are the way we are as a people, as intractable as the warfare in the North-west had been, some people have tried to create a false narrative. They said while President Muhammadu Buhari went after separatists and divisive elements in the southern parts of the country with a big stick, he pampered bandits and terrorists in the north. Really? How mean-minded can we be? Well, we have now seen the \u2018pampering\u2019 going on in the north. You love the pampering being handed out simultaneously from the air and the ground by the troops, don\u2019t you?\n\nI have always had the conviction that the ravening clouds shall not long be victorious, they shall not long possess the sky. Yes, we\u2019ve had serious security challenges. They were inherited by the Buhari administration, and they mutated and became hydra-headed. But a government exists to solve problems, and that is what President Buhari had been committed to doing. But some people, out of evil hearts and petty political gains want it to be the definition of the government. He could not secure the country. Thousands of citizens were killed under him. But they will be shocked! The insecurity ravaging the land will soon become history. Where will they then hide their faces?\n\nDr Okolo Oteri Eme is one of the women who love Buhari. To bits.

          "text": "Afenifere, a Yoruba socio-political organization, has challenged the Federal Government to halt its actions and policies that are preventing Nigeria from practicing true federalism.\n\nAfenifere was reacting to the ruling by the Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State on Value Added Tax, VAT.\n\nJustice Stephen Dalyop Pam of the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, while delivering judgments on August 9th in Suit No. FHC/PH/CS/149/2020, filed by the Attorney General for Rivers State against the Federal Inland Revenue Service and the Attorney General of the Federation had said that allowing the federal government, through FIRS, to continue to collect VAT will be negating the spirit of the federal system of government.\n\nReacting, Afenifere commended the judge for the ruling and the Rivers State government for initiating the legal process.\n\nAfenifere, in a statement by its spokesman, Jare Ajayi, said Pam\u2019s ruling has earned the Judiciary in Nigeria an epaulette as an institution that is not only capable of ensuring justice but is actually working on deepening federalism in the country.\n\nAccording to Ajayi: \u201cAfenifere observes that the manner of distributing VAT revenue is patently unfair, unjust and is pitched against the hardworking while rewarding the indolent by a manner of speaking. For instance, Lagos State which generates as much as 55 per cent of this revenue receives less than 10 per cent while most states where less than 5 % is generated get the same amount that Lagos gets. It is quite distasteful.\n\n\u201cThe sum collected by the FIRS is shared among the three tiers of government, with the Federal Government taking 15 per cent, states 50 per cent; local governments, 35 per cent. From the foregoing, it would be seen that the federal government is taking an undeserved larger chunk because when 50 % is shared among the 36 states, what each state gets is a paltry sum. Same for 774 local government councils that share 36 per cent.\n\n\u201cThe state governments should use the opportunity provided by these landmark judgments to explore other areas that the Constitution empowers them to assert themselves as federalists. In other words, they should step up actions that will liberate the states from the stronghold of the federal government that has turned Nigeria into a Unitary State \u2013 in contradistinction to the federal spirit prescribes by the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThey should rest assured of Afenifere support as they give vent to power devolution and entrenchment of true federalism in Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "Fulani socio-cultural group, Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore has described the anti-opening grazing law as satanic and a unanimous decision of southern governors to destroy pastoralists means of livelihood.\n\nThe organisation said the laws will destroy livestock production and send into poverty millions of people that depend on the livestock value chain Butchers, transporters, livestock dealers and consumers who are used to affordable sources of beef and milk.\n\nMiyetti Allah group disclosed this in Masaka community, Abuja suburb on Monday at a press briefing, jointly delivered by its national president, Alh. Abdullahi Bode and the national secretary, Engr. Saleh Alhassan.\n\nThe briefing was attended by national stakeholders of the group with the theme, \u201cNational Cohesion As a Panacea For Peaceful Coexistence Between Farmers And Herders In Nigeria,\u201d and investiture of HRH Queen Mother, Amina Temitope Ajayi Mama Diaspora, as Miyatti Allah brand ambassador.\n\nAlhassan while speaking on behalf of the organisation, called on the National Assembly and President Muhammad Buhari to intervene and stop current attempt by some states governors to criminalise their means of economic livelihood of cattle rearing through the enactment of satanic and obnoxious laws \u2013 \u2018Anti-open Grazing Laws\u2019 targeted at Fulani Pastoralists.\n\nHe further called for proper funding of the National Commission for Nomadic Education and the expansion of its mandate.\n\n\u201cThis oppressive laws and hostile policies being enacted by state governors are fundamentally going against the Fulani Pastoralist culture, economic interest and constitutional rights.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note that inter-state movement of pastoralists is analogous to inter-state commerce, which is an exclusive preserve of the legislative powers of the National Assembly under item 62 of the Exclusive Legislative List.\n\n\u201cTo this effect any action taken by any state Assembly that is in conflict with an above section of the 1999 Constitution as amended is null and void. These laws do not take into cognizance the sociology, economic, production system, climate variations and other push factors that are inherent in pastoralists movements across ecological zones.\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge that Nigeria\u2019s mode of agricultural practice is still primitive all over the country are not consistent with global best practices, so why singling out the pastoralists who have been suffering from the cumulative years of neglect in terms of development from both federal and state governments,\u201d they added.\n\nIn similar a vein, the organisation called on the governor of Benue state, Samuel Ortom to offer an apology to the Fulani race for what it described as tissues of lies, propaganda profiling of the Fulani pastoralist and falsehood against them.\n\n\u201cOur organisation totally condemn the continuous extortion and profiling of the Fulani pastoralists by the Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state and call on him to offer an apology to the Fulani race.\u201d\n\nThe organisation also called on the National Assembly to resuscitate and pass the Grazing Reserves Commission Bill and other Assembly and livestock management bills that were initiated by the previous National Assembly.\n\n\u201cOur Organisation totally condemn the vituperations of one Emir of Muri in Taraba state for the genocidal propaganda against Fulani Pastoralist and have since taken the necessary legal steps against the misguided local monarch and also written to the Taraba state Governor to immediately dethrone him.\n\n\u201cWe commend the courageous efforts of the federal government under the progressive leadership of President Mohammadu Buhari for listening to our consistent call to restore the existing grazing reserves and routes and create new ones, as it is the only sustainable solution to the farmers /herders conflicts in the country.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on the security issues in Katsina and other north-west states, the organisation condemned the banned of interstate cattle movement in Katsina by Governor Aminu Bello Masari, describing him as a confused and unserious governor.\n\nThe body attributed the security challenge in Katsina, Zamfara, Kebbi and other northern states to failure of governance.\n\n\u201cGovernor Masari is confused and unserious. Most of the herders are from Katsina and the governor should have created ranches for herders to serve as a good example for other state governors to emulate instead of playing to the gallery by ban interstate movement of castles\n\nWhat is happening in Katsina, Zamfara, Kebbi and other northern states is the failure of governance because the governments failed to provide education for teeming youths, leading them to the bandit.\u201d",

          "text": "Director General of the Progressives Governors Forum, Salihu Lukman has attributed the major problem of leadership in Nigeria, on skewed inclination of nation building.\n\nHe says Visionary and purposeful leadership are expected to facilitate the emergence of nations, leveraging on strong national institutions, good governance, equity and justice, which enable everyone to fulfill their aspirations.\n\nHe believes Successful nations have common purpose and strong national bond especially when they\u2019re created out of multiple ethnic and religious identities.\n\nIn his words, Mr Lukman says: \u201cPresently, Everybody says there\u2019s marginalisation, unfairness and injustice, but only in relation to group interests, predominantly ethnic. And Hardly, one finds any leader who is raising issues of marginalisation, unfairness and injustice not based on protecting the interests of groups they belong. Consequently, every problem of the country become interpreted based on group interests.\n\n\u201cBut the question remains How can Nigeria manage it\u2019s diversity and build confidence of citizens across every part of the country to have a sense of national belonging?, he queried\n\nSalihu Lukman admittedly says this is one area, which all leaders in the country seems to have common approach defensively.\n\nMr Lukman is of the opinion that If the Nigerian nation is to be developed, there must be leaders who are broadminded enough to campaign for justice, equity and fairness beyond a particular group interests.\n\nHe says therefore, a major challenge of nation building in Nigeria revolves around how to produce a set of true national leaders.\n\nAs long as the determining factor in judging leaders is driven by the frustration that leaders are not meeting citizens\u2019 expectations, prejudiced conclusions against them will be the case. What is it that need to be done to ensure that leaders meet citizens\u2019 expectations?\n\nNo doubt, both President Buhari and APC must be held accountable, But when issues of accountability are reduced to interpreting challenges to mean evidence of failure, it can only re-enforce the conclusion that leaders are bad, which may make it attractive for the campaign to remove leaders out of office, and Most times, the debate about changing leaders is influenced largely by the frustration of getting leaders to meet expectations of citizens.\n\nHe added that It is necessary Nigerians recognise that political parties are the most important democratic bodies to facilitate processes of nation building.",

industry.\n\n\u2018\u2018Therefore, it is unthinkable for me that any Igbo man would consider himself not to be a part of Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018The evidence is there for everyone to see that Igbos

meaningful progress without the development of infrastructure, the President expressed regret that successive governments at the Federal level contributed to the decay of critical infrastructure in the country.\n\nHe promised that the Federal Government would complete ongoing key projects in the South East, including the 2nd Niger Bridge as well as the railway lines and routes linking the region with other parts of the country.\n\n\u2018\u2018I firmly believe that when you get infrastructure right, Nigerians will mind their own businesses,\u2019\u2019 he said, adding that as a group, the Igbos stand to benefit more from the ongoing development of infrastructure in the country because \u2018\u2018they are more enterprising.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari had earlier commissioned four projects executed by Governor Hope Uzodinma, including the Naze/Ihiagwa/Nekede/Obinze link road, the Balloon Driven/Flood Control drainage at Dick Tiger Road, the Egbeada Bypass road and the New Exco-Chambers, Government House, Owerri.\n\nAddressing Imo residents at the commissioning of Egbeada bypass named after a prominent son of the State, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, the President said he was very impressed with the level of work done by the State government.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am very pleased with what I have seen and I assure you that I will support Imo State within the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn his remarks at the town hall meeting, Governor Uzodinma said Ndigbo believe in a united Nigeria predicated on \u2018\u2018justice, equity and fairness.\u2019\u2019\n\nHe thanked the President for addressing the interests of Ndi Igbo through deliberate policy initiatives designed to give the people a true sense of belonging, including the ongoing construction of the 2nd Niger Bridge, among others.\n\nGovernor Uzodinma said the people of South East would remain grateful to the President for approving the establishment of a Naval Base in Oguta Local Government Area of the State, adding that as time unfolds, the economic benefits of the base would manifest.\n\nThe Governor also commended the President for strongly supporting the appointment of two prominent Igbos into two key international organisations-Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, Assistant Director-General of Health Emergency Intelligence, World Health Organisation (WHO).\n\nIn his remarks, the President-General, Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide, Prof. George Obiozor assured the President of the continuous support of Ndigbo.\n\n\u2018\u2018Ndigbo are committed to Nigerian unity and there is news for those trying to push us out of Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018Ndigbo in Nigeria are like fish in the ocean and no matter how rough the storm is, it cannot drive the fish out of the ocean.\n\n\u2018\u2018Mr President, it is in this context, that we see a new dawn in your distinguished presence in Igbo land and believe that on your return to Abuja the significance and substance of this visit will form new foundation of a platform for meaningful dialogue on critical issues of concern to the Igbo

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss Biden\u2019s plans before they were publicly released.\n\nBiden is also expected to outline plans to increase virus testing in schools, in an effort to keep them open safely, amid other measures to show that his administration is working to tackle the alarming rise in COVID-19 cases, which Biden has blamed for last month\u2019s weaker-than-expected jobs report. He\u2019s warned the surge could further imperil the nation\u2019s economy as some pandemic safety net protections expire.\n\nBiden has encouraged COVID-19 vaccine requirements in settings like schools, workplaces and university campuses, and the White House hopes the strengthened federal mandate will inspire more businesses to follow suit.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Health and Human Services, the Indian Health Service, and the National Institute of Health have previously announced vaccine requirements for much of their staffs, and the Pentagon moved last month to require all servicemembers to get vaccinated.\n\nMore than 208 million Americans have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 177 million are fully vaccinated, but confirmed cases of the virus have shot up in recent weeks to an average of about 140,000 per day with on average about 1,000 Americans dying from the virus daily, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAn AP-NORC poll conducted in August found 55% of Americans in favor of requiring government workers to be fully vaccinated, compared with 21% opposed.\n\nMost of the spread \u2014 and the vast majority of severe illness and death \u2014 is occurring among those not yet fully vaccinated against the virus. So-called breakthrough infections in vaccinated people occur, but tend to be far less dangerous.\n\nFederal officials are moving ahead with plans to begin administering booster shots of the mRNA vaccines to bolster protection against the more transmissible delta variant of the virus. Last month Biden announced plans to make them available beginning on Sept. 20, but only the Pfizer vaccine will likely have received regulatory approval for a third dose by that time. Federal regulators are seeking additional data from Moderna that will likely delay its booster approval until October.\n\nOfficials are aiming to administer the booster shots about eight months after the second dose of the two-dose vaccines.",

          "text": "Some 200 foreigners, including Americans, flew out of Afghanistan on an international commercial flight from Kabul airport on Thursday, the first such large-scale departure since U.S and foreign forces concluded their frantic withdrawal at the end of last month.\n\nThe Qatar Airways flight to Doha marked a significant breakthrough in the bumpy coordination between the U.S. and Afghanistan\u2019s new Taliban rulers. A dayslong stand-off over charter planes at another airport had left dozens of passengers stranded and cast doubt on Taliban assurances to allow foreigners and Afghans with proper travel documents to leave the country.\n\nA senior U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to brief the media, provided the number of Westerners on board and said that two very senior Taliban officials had helped facilitate the departure. Americans, green card holders and other nationalities including Germans, Hungarians and Canadians were on the flight, the official said.\n\nAs Taliban authorities patrolled the tarmac, passengers presented their documents for checking, and sniffer dogs inspected luggage laid out on the ground. Some of the veteran airport workers had returned to their jobs after fleeing during the harrowing chaos of the U.S.-led airlift.\n\nIrfan Popalzai, 12, among those boarding the flight with his mother and five brothers and sisters, said his family lives in Maryland.\n\n\u201cI am an Afghan, but you know I am from America and I am so excited (to leave),\u201d he said.\n\nAs the group prepared to board earlier, Qatari officials gathered on the tarmac of Kabul airport to announce the airport was ready for the resumption of international commercial flights after days of repairs. Extensive damage to the travel hub in the frenzied final days of the U.S. airlift that evacuated over 100,000 people from the country had raised questions over how soon the transport hub could resume for regular commercial flights. Technical experts from Qatar and Turkey have been racing to restore operations.\n\n\u201cI can clearly say that this is a historic day in the history of Afghanistan as Kabul airport is now operational,\u201d said Qatari special envoy Mutlaq bin Majed al-Qahtani.\n\n\u201cCall it what you want, a charter or a commercial flight, everyone has tickets and boarding passes,\u201d al-Qahtani added, noting that another commercial flight would take off on Friday. \u201cHopefully, life is becoming normal in Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nThe flight represents the first to depart from Kabul airport since American forces left the country at the end of August, their departure accompanied by a frantic airlift of tens of thousands of foreign citizens and Afghans fleeing the Taliban. The scenes of chaos, including Afghans plunging to their deaths after clinging to military aircraft that was taking off and a suicide bombing that killed 169 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members, came to define the fraught end to America\u2019s two-decade war.\n\nA foreign diplomat, likewise speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to brief the media, said another 200 foreigners, including Americans, would depart in the next couple of days.\n\nIt remains uncertain what the resumption of international flights over the next few days will mean for the tens of thousands of Afghans desperate to flee Afghanistan\u2019s new Taliban leaders over fears of what their rule will hold.\n\nHundreds of other Afghans at risk after the Taliban takeover because of their past work with Americans have gathered for more than a week in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif, waiting for permission to board privately chartered evacuation flights out of the country.\n\nAlthough the Taliban assured the world they would let passengers with valid travel documents leave the country, many of those stranded at the northern airport did not have such papers.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo has forecasted a potential income gain of about $450 billion in the country\u2019s economy through the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nThe VP stated while delivering a message, at the closing of the 2021 Conference of African Insurance Practitioners on Wednesday. He noted that that the AfCFTA which is a trade agreement between AU member states to create a single market followed by free movement and a single-currency union, presented opportunities for African countries.\n\nOsinbajo stated, \u201cBy some estimates, if we get it right, we can bring several million out of extreme poverty and raise the incomes of 68 million others who live on less than $5.50 per day\u201d.\n\nAdding that there are potential income gains of up to $450 billion, and just cutting red tape and simplifying customs procedures alone could drive up to $250 billion of that sum.\n\nAccording to the VP, amidst monumental challenges posed by climate change, particularly energy transition and related issues, the coming decade anchored on the AfCFTA) offers great opportunities for Africa\u2019s socio-economic transformation.\n\nHe urged African insurance practitioners to leverage opportunities in the AfCFTA, adding that \u201cevery smart economic grouping, whether governments or businesses, must be thinking, planning and strategizing for these new times.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the implication for the insurance industry in Africa would be plenty of opportunities as more trade in goods would mean a greater need for insurance services.\n\n\u201cWe can expect to see more well-capitalized insurance providers from other African countries coming to compete in the Nigerian market. And we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if this happens quickly,\u201d Osinbajo said.\n\n\u201cServices can be set up faster than manufacturing plants. Nigerian financial services companies, especially banks, are already in many African Countries, like Zenith, Access, UBA.\n\n\u201cHow about Insurance companies? We should now be looking at developing homegrown international African insurance conglomerates. The time is now.\u201d\n\nOn the issue of climate change, Prof. Osinbajo probed, \u201cHow is the African insurance industry preparing for the interesting days ahead?\u201d\n\nReferencing a Mackenzie podcast transcript, the VP said: \u201cIt was quite eye-opening. While there will obviously be opportunities for new insurance products and solutions, especially in the property and casualty segment of the business, insurance companies must also be prepared for the systemic nature of climate-induced damage, with the possibilities of market failures and more system-wide destabilization.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere in Nigeria, the growing intensity of flooding and damage to vast agricultural acreages might have a knock-on effect on other areas of the economy. Further slumps in the economy are bad for everyone, even insurers.\u201d\n\nHe said, in the past two years, the wealthier countries, after building their economies on fossil fuels, had started banning or restricting public investments in fossil fuels, including gas.\n\nExplaining the implication of the trend on Africa\u2019s growing oil and gas markets, Osinbajo said African insurance companies must be at the forefront of the campaign for a just and equitable transition to a low carbon future.\n\n\u201cThis means that we cannot accept a defunding of gas projects when gas is an important transition fuel for us,\u201d the VP explained.\n\n\u201cNot just to get our people from the environmentally damaging firewood to cooking gas, and also autogas for our auto vehicles, but to also provide much-needed power for industries and domestic use.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo warned that Africa\u2019s economic future might be at risk if the continent did not insist that the necessary speed to zero emissions must not mean disaster for African economies.",
