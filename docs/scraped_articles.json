Justice, justice!\u201d the protesters chanted on Saturday, with some carrying school books as they gathered at a city square in Kabul.\n\nThey held banners that said: \u201cEducation is our fundamental right, not a political plan\u201d as they marched for a short distance and later dispersed as Taliban fighters arrived at the scene.\n\nThe protest was the first held by women in weeks after the Taliban rounded up the ringleaders of initial demonstrations held after they returned to power in August.\n\nThe Islamists had not given a clear reason for their decision, which came after a Tuesday meeting of senior officials in the southern city of Kandahar, the Taliban\u2019s de facto power centre and spiritual heartland.\n\nIt followed months of work by some foreign countries on a plan to support the payment of teachers\u2019 wages.\n\nIt was reported that Afghan secondary school girls had now been out of education for more than seven months.\n\n\u201cEven the Prophet (Mohammed) said everyone has the right to education, but the Taliban have snatched this right from us,\u201d said youngster Nawesa at the demonstration, which was organised by two women rights groups.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban can not oppress the women of Afghanistan,\u201d said another protester, Laila Basim.\n\nSince returning to power on August 15 the Taliban had rolled back two decades of gains made by the country\u2019s women, who had been squeezed out of many government jobs, barred from travelling alone, and ordered to dress according to a strict interpretation of the Koran.\n\nThe Taliban had promised a softer version of the harsh Islamist rule that characterised their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001.\n\nBut many restrictions had still been imposed, if not at the national level, then implemented locally at the whim of regional officials.\n\nSome Afghan women initially pushed back against the Taliban\u2019s curbs, holding small protests where they demanded the right to education and work.\n\nBut the Taliban soon rounded up the ringleaders, holding them incommunicado while denying that they had been detained.\n\nSince their release, most had gone silent.\n\nAFP",

          "text": ".\n\n\u2026promises to deepen electoral integrity, enhance citizens\u2019 participation\n\nBy Gabriel Ewepu\n\nAS Ekiti governorship election draws closer, Yiaga Africa, yesterday, disclosed of building capacity and deployment of 24 Watching the Vote, WTV, Long Term Observers, LTOs, across all 16 Local Government Areas in the State to observe and provide information on the level of preparations and other pre-election activities.\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by the Executive Director, Yiaga Africa, Samson Itodo, where it explained that the essence of training the observers ahead of the election was part of activities of Yiaga Africa, and that the pre-election observation will include observing efforts by election stakeholders in educating and mobilizing the voters ahead of the election.\n\nThe statement reads in part, \u201cEkiti Governorship elections 2022 will be the first major election to be conducted using the newly signed Electoral Act 2022 which provides an opportunity for an assessment of the implementation of the new Act.\n\n\u201cWhile political party primaries had been concluded before the law was signed, the Election Day procedure will be guided by provisions of the new Act. The efficacy of critical provisions like the neutrality of INEC staff, deployment of technology, election results management and other critical provisions expected to promote electoral integrity will be tested in Ekiti.\n\n\u201cEkiti also presents an opportunity for the assessment of INECs preparations for the 2023 elections based on the commission\u2019s ability to improve on its processes and administration of elections learning from the FCT Area Council and 2021 Anambra governorship elections.\n\n\u201cEarly commencement of preparations for the elections, the implementation of the Electoral Act 2022 and new Guidelines for elections, political party activities, stakeholders\u2019 engagement and voter participation remain key areas of assessment ahead of the 18 June 2022 Governorship election.\n\n\u201cThus, Yiaga Africa has trained and deployed 24 Watching the Vote (WTV) Long Term Observers (LTOs) across all 16 Local Government Areas in the state to observe and provide information on the level of preparations and other pre-election activities by all elections stakeholders in the state.\n\n\u201cThe pre-election observation will include observing efforts by election stakeholders in educating and mobilizing the voters ahead of the election to improve on the abysmally low turnout recorded in the 2018 elections.\n\n\u201cThe Long Term Observers were also trained to track, monitor and report incidents of violence that may impact the elections across all the 16 LGAs. The violence monitoring will enable Yiaga Africa\u2019s Watching the Vote to track early warning signs and escalate as necessary to prevent incidents that can hinder the successful conduct of the elections.\n\n\u201cIn addition, WTV pre-elections observers will observe and report issues relating to hate speech, intimidation and harassment of any electoral stakeholder, women, youth and persons with disability and attacks on media or INEC officials. The LTOs will also report any incidents of government restrictions on political activities that may restrict equal participation in the process.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cMajor institutions/stakeholders whose activities will be observed include the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), National Orientation Agency (NOA), Political Parties, and Security Agencies.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the involvement of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) in the electoral process will be observed. Also, as the INEC concludes Continuous Voters Registration (CVR) in Ekiti State, Yiaga Africa\u2019s observers will observe the collection of Permanent Voters Card (PVC) across all LGAs including other voter education activities in preparation for the polls.\n\nthe statement also made it known that Yiaga Africa\u2019s Pre-elections observation findings will be shared with the public via various media of communication including social media and shared with respective institutions for required action.\n\n\u201cRecall that Yiaga Africa\u2019s Board and management paid advocacy visits to Security Agencies, Electoral Management Body, Civil Society Organisations, Leadership of political parties, Traditional leaders and other election stakeholders in the state.\n\n\u201cThis is aimed to strengthen collaborations and bridge gaps in the area of citizens participation while ensuring all stakeholders play their roles to ensure credible and peaceful elections in the state\u201d, it pointed.\n\nMeanwhile, Yiaga Africa assured that its goal is to deepen electoral integrity and enhance citizens\u2019 participation.\n\n\u201c#WatchingTheVote is a comprehensive observation initiative that includes the observation of the pre-election environment, deployment of the Parallel Vote Tabulation (PVT) for Election Day observation and post-election audits.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to deepen electoral integrity and enhance citizens\u2019 participation by providing credible, accurate and timely information on the process and verifying the outcome of election results.\n\n\u201cAlso, the observation is designed to deter, detect and expose fraud and build citizens\u2019 confidence in the process. Yiaga Africa operates as a civic hub of changemakers poised with the onerous mandate of enhancing the quality of democratic governance, public accountability and civic participation.\n\n\u201cYiaga Africa\u2019s Watching the Vote movement is non-partisan, independent, beholden to none and for all Nigerians\u201d, it concluded.",

          "text": ".\n\nBy James Ogunnaike\n\nProf. Jude Mbukanma of Dominican University, Samonda, Ibadan has lamented the disturbing long absence of strong morals of patriotism, uprightness, diligence, contentment, reward for hardwork in the country saying that the restoration of these values will go a long way in tackling the myriad of challenges confronting the country.\n\nProf. Mbukanma disclosed that a situation in our educational system where moral science is relegated while the study of natural science is celebrated will always lead to churning out of products that are morally bankrupt.\n\nThe Professor of Ethics and Philosophy of Religious Studies, according to a statement made available to journalists by the Media Consultant to the university, Prince Cletus Ilobanafor, was quoted to have stated this while delivering the first inaugural lecture of the university with the theme \u201cThe Abandonment of Moral Science In The Pursuit Of Natural Science Education; The Great Mistake In The Theory of\n\nModernization\u201d.\n\nHe said Nigerians and their leaders at various levels of government must embrace the virtues of patriotism and love for the country to lift the nation above its many woes\u201d.\n\nProf Mbukanma said it is therefore important for the subject of moral science which teaches those strong virtues of love, diligence, truthfulness, contentment, patriotism among others to be introduced to the country\u2019s educational curriculum and should be taught from primary school.\n\nHe said, \u201clet us give Moral Science a priority consideration in our educational system as we cannot expect good behaviour if moral isn\u2019t in place and note that virtue is teachable and its reward is happiness.\u201d\n\nThe erudite Professor emphasized that the focus on natural science lies in the defect of modern philosophy of education, adding that though science has given us technology which had proved very useful to humanity but education in natural science and technology does not result in the production of morally-good people in a political society and does not have the miracle of the conversion of human hearts.\n\nHe said \u201cwhen people lack moral education, they make over and again erroneous judgment in their moral choices and same in political life. However, what is needed to be done to curb the human tendency to resort to violence and justify aggression is simply the teaching of Moral Science in families, society, the Political environment and finally in our educational\n\nsystem\u201d.\n\nSpeaking on his Inaugural, he said the duty has been done as he can be very sad if he couldn\u2019t do it, adding that who knows when his stay on earth will be over. He however acknowledged God Almighty for the opportunity to deliver his beliefs on an intellectual journey.\n\nOn the dwindling academic standard in Nigeria, Professor Jude O.\n\nWhile thanking God for the grace to deliver the first inaugural lecture of the university\n\nMbukanma disclosed that the rot being witnessed in the education sector also boiled down to the absence of strong values such as patriotism, commitment, diligence among others.\n\nHe said that \u201cpeople are no longer patriotic, many don\u2019t even see it as a virtue and people don\u2019t like it. I think people don\u2019t obey the details for moral law within their hearts and what can we do? Nigerians have to love the country to be able to solve the problem and in religion, we have to continue to pray that God should touch the hearts of the leaders to do the right things for the country too\u201d.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Vice-Chancellor of the university, Professor Anthony Alaba Akinwale expressed his joy to have his own teacher give the first inaugural lecture at the university where he currently heads.\n\nProf Akinwale said, \u201cIt is very imperative to be reminded that the lecture of today challenges us to ensure that we do not separate politics from morality; and if separated, our challenges in the country will remain insurmountable\u201d.\n\nOther dignitaries at the lecture included the Dean of Science, Dominican University, Prof. Domingo Okorie, the acting Librarian, Mrs Blessing Mbah, Rev Kenneth Nkadi, the Registrar of the university,\n\nProf. Kenneth from Library and Archival Science, University of Ibadan. Others are Most Rev Dr Ayo-Maria Ayoyebi, Emeritus Catholic Bishop of Ilorin), Rev. Fr. Emmanuel Ajewole who represented\n\nMost Rev.

          "text": "The All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday unveiled the official hashtag for its convention.\n\nUnveiling the hash-tag during a virtual news conference, the Chairman of Media and Publicity Committee of the convention, Abdullahi Sule, said that APC was set to host the biggest party convention in Africa.\n\nThe governor of Nasarawa State was represented by Chairperson of the New Media Sub-Committee, Mrs Mary Ikoku.\n\nHe said that the hashtag would be used to give blow-by-blow accounts of development during the convention on social media, websites and applications, such as twitter.\n\nAccording to him, the hashtag, #APCNationalConvention, is to announce the upcoming convention of \u2018the largest party in Africa\u2019, which is holding on March 26, at International Conference Centre, Abuja.\n\n\u201cThis media parley is to unveil to the media and the public the official hashtag of the convention and to reiterate that the party is united.\n\n\u201cIt is also an avenue to tell the world that the party is ready to deliver on those mandates that got it elected into office by millions of Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWe all know the functionality of the social media in expanding and amplifying communication, and this is why we are launching the hash-tag to push home our message on the importance of the convention to the global online audience.\n\n\u201cThe chosen hashtag is \u2018#APCNationalConvention\u2019 and we adopted this to solidify our narrative that we are united party men and women with one aim, which is to have one of the best party conventions ever seen in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nConsensus forces versus election forces\n\nThe forces pushing for convention and election were stuck in a stalemate last night, with each side fiercely seeking an edge.\n\nAn aide of the President was not sure how soon the issues might be resolved. President Muhammadu Buhari had proposed a consensus chairman. His rivals reluctantly stepped down after much persuasion by some governors.\n\nHowever, there is no extensive preparation for an elective convention. There was no trace of ballot paper yesterday for possible use today.\n\nThe long wait for unity list\n\nThe chairman of the Convention Publicity Committee, Nasarawa State Governor Abdullahi Sule, told reporters yesterday that the Unity List was not immediately ready yesterday owing to delay in ironing out some cogent issues at the local level-states and geo-political zones.\n\nWhile some of the zones had their list ready yesterday, others were still consulting. He briefed reporters at the party secretariat around 12 noon yesterday.\n\nNo manifesto by the anointed\n\nWhen party members from many states were asked whether the anointed candidate for chairman ex-Governor Abdullahi Adamu had unfolded his plans for the party, all the people interviewed said they were not aware of his manifesto.\n\nEagle Square ready for convention\n\nAlthough it could not be said that the party was totally ready as at 6pm yesterday, the Eagle Square venue of the convention was ready.\n\nIt wore a new look with colourful banners flying in self-jubilation. A war of posters also ensued. Posters of those contesting for party offices competed for spaces as did those of presidential aspirants.\n\nA big billboard at the site bore the inscription \u2018Fayemi for Nigeria.\u2019 The posters of Tanko Al-Makura also hung on poles in the vicinity.\n\nUncertainty over number of delegates\n\nNo committee or sub-committee member was available to authoritatively speak about the number of delegates being expected at the convention.\n\nA source said: \u201cThe party is pushing for voting by affirmation. Since there is no anticipation toward an elective convention, there is not going to be much accreditation hurdle.\u201d\n\nDay of clandestine meetings\n\nA lot of clandestine meetings took place yesterday at various locations.\n\nThe president had met with the eight chairmanship aspirants on Thursday. It was inconclusive.\n\nAn aide of the president said the meeting was expected to resume yesterday. \u201cThe discussion continues until all issues are settled,\u201d he said.\n\nFor five hours, APC governors were also locked in discussions yesterday.\n\nAn aide of a governor said: \u201cIt is still tough o. There is confusion. The governors are still meeting. I think they will finally come to an agreement.\u201d\n\nLegacy leaders in crucial meeting\n\nBesides, APC founding fathers, some of who seemed to have been sidelined, met to see how they could broker truce between aggrieved governors who are divided over the micro-zoning of the chairmanship slot on the one hand and the governors and the president over his preference for a particular aspirant.\n\nBumper time for hotels\n\nMajor hotels in the metropolis and suburb of the federal capital were fully booked by last night, leaving many delegates stranded.\n\nNational Secretary: Not yet concluded\n\nParty sources said the president had been contacting key stakeholders in the Southwest to replace Iyiola Omisore with Ife Oyedele.\n\nEkiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi and his Ondo State counterpart Rotimi Akeredolu are insisting on the former Osun State deputy governor as national scribe.\n\nThis means that Omisore may not return to the Senate in 2023.\n\nInterior Minister Rauf Aregbesola is said to be rooting for Oyedele.\n\nAlready, Isaac Kekemeke from Ondo State has been tipped for National Vice Chairman (Southwest). Two key party positions cannot be zoned to a single state.\n\nSympathy for disadvantaged states\n\nThe president and the National Caretaker Committee are insisting that states that have not produced national party officers before should be considered for offices that are zoned to their regions.\n\nIn other words, micro-zoning should take cognisance of complaints about exclusion and past cases of injustice.",

          "title": "APC: Fear grips presidential aspirants over consensus option",
          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nA gale of apprehension, fear and anxiety has gripped the camp of some of the presidential aspirants on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) over the possibility of President Muhammadu Buhari adopting the consensus option if the becomes successful in the selection of the national chairman of the party in today\u2019s national convention.\n\nMixed reactions have continued to trail the decision of the party to adopt the consensus option in picking the zonal and national officers of the party, including President Buhari\u2019s resolve to muscle six other aspirants for the position of National Chairman of the party for his preferred candidate.\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nSensing that the success of President\u2019s decision may also be extended to the party primary to determine the 2023 presidential flag-bearer of the party, supporters of some of the aspirants have not only expressed concern, but also vowed to ensure that the plan did not succeed.\n\nAlready, sources in the camps of the support groups of a major contender from the South-West revealed their readiness to draw the battle line, especially on the speculations that Buhari\u2019s ultimate plan is to anoint one of the presidential aspirants and make the party primary a mere formality to only use voice vote to confirm his choice.\n\n\u201cI can confirm to you that we are not comfortable with the speculation that the ultimate plan of President Buhari adopting and imposing a chairmanship candidate on other aspirants is to use the same method for the party\u2019s presidential primary.\n\n\u201cOrdinarily, there is nothing bad with adopting consensus especially as the party has three options of direct, indirect and consensus. However, our fear is that if successfully executed in the chairmanship position during this convention, he may not allow a competitive primary because he will easily impose his choice on others.\n\n\u201cThe best time to kill a monster is to terminate it at the embryonic stage. We are afraid that President Buhari may use it to his advantage to scheme out other aspirants. Nigerians know that our principal is the most suitable and prepared person to rule this country after the 2023 presidential election,\u201d the source who spoke to Saturday Sun in confidence quipped.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\nAn atmosphere of fear and anxiety also pervaded the camp of the supporters of Owelle Rochas Okorocha, as some of the supporters equally expressed fear that the real intention behind adopting the consensus option may be to extend it to the presidential party primary that may tentatively take place next month.\n\nSpeaking informally, a source close to Okorocha\u2019s camp said: \u201cAlthough our principal has not briefed us on the outcome of the meeting with President Buhari, I can confirm to you that we are also nursing the fear that Mr President may adopt this same approach during the presidential primary. We won\u2019t allow such plan for the presidential primary.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, despite the disquiet from the camp of some of the aspirants for the 2023 president, it was an entirely different feeling in the camp of Vice president Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nReacting to the situation, the Director Technology ICT and Strategy for the Osinbajo Support Group, Jeffery Omoh Ozemegwa, expressed confidence that whatever option Mr President adopted will be in favour of their principal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any reason to entertain any fear over the consensus option that Mr President adopted for this convention. I am not sure that it will affect us because the decision was taken by the presidency. It is a collective decision. Don\u2019t forget that our principal has not formally declared his interest.\n\n\u201cThe situation will become more clearer when he declares. We will be very comfortable with any decision collectively reached in picking the presidential candidate of the party. We are sure that our principal Osinbajo will be part of the discussion and agreement reached. We, the 720 groups, will abide by any decision taken provided that it is for unity to rain in our party,\u201d he said.",

Thereafter, he nominated Adamu for National Chairman.\n\nAs at last night, all the chairmanship aspirants had withdrawn from the race in line with Buhari\u2019s directives.\n\nThe Unity List for other NWC positions of the party was not decided during the governors\u2019 meeting with Buhari. The President told the governors to meet and agree on this; that refunds of money spent on purchasing forms be made to all the aspirants unable to make the Unity List.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, as at last night, just a few hours before voting began, the governors could still not agree on the Unity List. So, no list had been sent out.\n\nOne of the positions still in dispute is that of the party\u2019s National Secretary. Some governors want Iyiola Omisore, former deputy governor of Osun State, while some others want Ifeoluwa Oyedele, a 2020 governorship aspirant of the party in Ondo State.\n\n\n\nThe choice of Waziri Bulama (Borno State) as National Organsing Secretary by the governors is also in dispute. Some top party members, including Governor Babagana Zulum prefer Senator Abu Kyari for the job.\n\nThose looking good to make the Unity List are Ken Nnamani (Enugu State) as Deputy National Chairman, South and Adamu Farouk (Jigawa State)) as Deputy National Chairman, North.\n\n\n\nHowever, if the governors are able to resolve the Unity List and send it out this morning as indicated by another source, it means the election today would be a mere academic exercise.\n\n\n\nIt would also mean that any aspirant still bent on contesting is free to do so, but once outside the Unity List, it is surely going to be a losing game, as the governors control the delegates who will vote at the convention.\n\nGovernor of Nasarawa State Abdullahi Sule, who is Chairman Media and Publicity sub-committee for the National Convention, refused to comment on the delay in the release of the Unity List at a press briefing yesterday, but simply said the list would still be released and would be used today.\n\n\n\nOn the issue of political appointees voting at today\u2019s convention, Governor Sule said: \u201cOur delegates\u2019 list is actually statutory. So, if you have a former president as a political appointee, if you have a former Senator as a political appointee, these are already automatic delegates, you know. So, let us not confuse the two because being an appointee does not necessarily take you out of being a delegate, because our delegates are classified clearly.\n\n\u201cSo, most of the lists that we submitted, if you are talking of the ones who have submitted now, we don\u2019t have commissioners, we don\u2019t have advisors, we don\u2019t have all those unless if somebody particularly was a former this or former that, in that case, you know, just being an appointee doesn\u2019t completely exclude such a person from being a delegate.\u201d\n\nThe President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan on Thursday expressed optimism that most of the new NWC members of the APC today will emerge by consensus.\n\n\u201cThe next two days are so important to us that we must get everything spot on so that we don\u2019t allow anyone to cause any problem. Thank God we are reaching consensus all over the states and zones and by the time we go into the convention ground, I\u2019m sure there will be very few elective offices that will have to be voted for. Most would have been achieved through consensus,\u201d Lawan said.\n\n\n\nLawan adds: \u201cWe, as a party, feel that this is a moment that is so critical to the existence of APC in Nigeria. We need to get the convention right. We need to have a very successful, peaceful convention where we elect our leaders that will run the affairs of the party for the next four years. Therefore, every hand must be on deck and what we have done is to come and say our hands are available to be on deck as always.\n\n\n\nProgramme of Activities\n\n\n\nEagle Square, venue of today\u2019s convention, was sparkling yesterday, while virtually all the delegates had arrived.\n\nAccording to the convention programme released by the APC, accredited delegates are expected to start arriving at the Eagle Square by 10 am. Members of the National Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) will arrive by 1:30p.m.\n\n\n\nAPC state governors, National Assembly members, ministers and other party leaders are expected by 2:p.m. The President of the Senate and the Speaker, House of Representatives, will arrive between 2:10p.m and 2:20p.m.\n\nVice-President Yemi Osinbajo will arrive by 2:45p.m while President Buhari will arrive by 3:15p.m. The convention will then kick off.\n\n\n\nThere will be goodwill messages by Youth Wing, Women Wing, People Living with Disability (PLwD) and Diaspora Wing between 3:40 and 4:50p.m.\n\nRemarks by the Chairman, Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) and Representatives of Governors\u2019 from each of the six geo-political zones will take place between 4:50 and 5:20p.m.\n\nRemarks by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate will be between 5:25 and 5:35p.m.\n\n\n\nRemarks by the Vice-President follow between 5:35 and 5:40p.m, while Special Remarks by President Buhari will be between 5:40 and 5:55p.m\n\nAfter the welcome address by the CECPC Chairman, there will be a presentation of two motions.\n\nThese are the motion for the approval of Constitution as amended and the motion for the ratification of all activities carried out by CECPC.\n\n\n\nElections into Zonal and National Offices of the APC will then follow. Then, there will be the declaration of results and swearing in of the newly elected executives. The newly elected National Chairman is expected to make an acceptance speech.\n\nAltogether, 21 NWC positions and 33 non-NWC positions are expected to be filled today.\n\n\n\nAPC Governors, Ministers Present Scorecards\n\nGovernors and Ministers of the ruling APC yesterday in Abuja presented a seven years\u2019 scorecard to the party, to back their performance status over the former ruling PDP as they march towards 2023 campaigns.\n\nThe scorecard was presented at the party\u2019s Pre-Convention Conference with the theme: Consolidating Democratic Change: Scorecard, Impact and the Road Ahead at Shehu Musa Yar\u2019Adua Centre, Abuja.\n\n\n\nAt the event, governors and serving ministers on the platform of the APC took their time to chronicle the events leading to the formation of the party and the successes, challenges, and achievements made by the party, both at the state and national levels in the last seven years.\n\n\n\nPresent at the event were: Governors Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, Babagana Zulum of Borno, Fayemi Kayode of Ekiti, Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola\n\nMinister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, said the APC government social investment programme was yielding good results as Nigeria had emerged the nation with the fastest growing social investment programme in the world.\n\nZainab also disclosed that Nigeria\u2019s economy was now fully diversified due to different economic intervention strategies introduced by the Buhari-led APC government.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Governor has a tendency to change positions randomly and unpredictably\n\nBlessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nThe cross examination of the first defence witness, Jude Igbanoi, in the libel case filed by Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State against THISDAY Newspapers and three others, continued yesterday at the Rivers State High Court, Port Harcourt, with the claimant\u2019s lead counsel, Emmanuel Ukala (SAN), questioning Igbanoi on the interview Wike granted Arise News last year.\n\n\n\nThe governor had filed a N7 billion libel suit claiming that the newspaper\u2019s publication of June 23, 2020, with caption: \u201cWith a Friend Like Wike, Obaseki Meets His PDP\u2019s Waterloo; Almost,\u201d was intended to damage his character.\n\n\n\nYesterday, Ukala said that in the Arise video clips on the Edo election campaign, Wike was very passionate in his speech for the victory of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and then asked Igbanoi if in the interview, the governor displayed any sign of betrayal in his responses.\n\n\n\nThe witness said he was not in the position to say so; but that the claimant had shown by his character and antecedents that he could not be taken seriously for whatever he says \u201cas he has a tendency to change positions randomly and unpredictably.\u201d\n\n\n\nUkala further asked the witness if the said report in THISDAY insinuated that Wike influenced the case in the Federal High Court on who was to be the flag bearer of the PDP in the 2020 Edo gubernatorial election.\n\n\n\nIn response, the witness said: \u201cSince it concerns the party, the court, if within his domain, although a federal high court, the governor would not have a passing interest but committed to the victory of the party. Since the cases concerned his party, and in the heat of the governorship election campaign, he (Wike) would be expected to have more than a passing interest in the cases.\u201d\n\n\n\nUkala further tendered a letter to the court, where he said the governor had asked THISDAY to retract the said report and publish an apology.\n\nThe cross examination of the defense witness was later adjourned by the presiding Judge, Justice Adolphus Enebeli to April 25 and 27.\n\n\n\nSpeaking with journalists outside the courtroom, counsel to THISDAY, Tuduru Edeh (SAN), explained: \u201cThe matter is continuing, the witness has adopted his position in respect of which he has made several comments or at least sustained his defense; all that is before the Honourable presiding justice.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are not here to prejudge what both parties have said until when the court comes to a conclusion. That is the minimum of respect we need to the court.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday, the witness was cross examined again by the counsel to the claimant. There were two videos that couldn\u2019t play yesterday but the transcripts are available. So, we have taken a date to bring them forward, play them again so the counsel can continue and conclude the cross-examination.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are returning to the court on April 25 and 27 for them to conclude.\u201d\n\nIn the video clips presented last Thursday by the defense witness, as evidence to the said report, Igbanoi in a heated argument informed the court that Wike\u2019s various public statements open his character and integrity to public scrutiny and fair comments.\n\n\n\nHe further stressed that Wike\u2019s character since coming into public office had shown him to be such that he would say certain things about someone one day and turn 360 degrees a few months or years later to say the contrary.\n\nIn the video clips, Wike was sighted in a campaign speaking about Obaseki as televised on Channels and TVC News.\n\n\n\nThe court also watched a video clip during an interview with the Governor, televised by Arise News titled, \u201cThe politics and issues in PDP.\u201d\n\nA video clip of Wike praising Amaechi over his performance in Rivers State, when he was the Director of Amaechi Campaign Organisation was also played.\n\n\n\nHowever, during cross examination, Ukala told the defendant witness (Igbanoi) that the publication was intended to smear the integrity of the governor.\n\n\n\nBut in defense, the witness stated that the story was gathered from speeches made by Wike from different occasions of campaign and interviews.\n\nIgbanoi also told the court that the publication had no intention to damage the image of the governor but was only being professional.\n\n\n\nHe stressed that the newspaper was only fulfilling its constitutional duty of informing the public and making a fair comment on the situation during the Edo State governorship election in the said publication.\n\nWhile responding to some of the questions during the cross-examination, he further pointed out to the court that Wike has been a public servant in the past two decades.\n\n\n\nThat his life, therefore, was an open book that was open to members of the public and therefore the media was free to comment on his utterances and actions, whether positive or perceived negative. He cited examples of his televised statements as the Director General of the Rotimi Amaechi Campaign Organisation where he praised Amaechi to high heavens and turned round a few years after to lampoon, castigate and lambast him at every given occasion.\n\n\n\nHe also pointed out that Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki, whose campaign organisation he chaired, was now his number one enemy to the dismay of the public.\n\n\n\nHe stated that Wike has since been apologising to the former Edo State Governor and former APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole openly in the media.\n\nThe governor claimed during his appearance in court that the publication portrayed him as a deceitful, untrustworthy person.\n\n\n\nWike also claimed that THISDAY accused him of undemocratically exerting influence on the primaries\u2019 process of PDP in Edo State in aid of his ally, Omoregie Ogbeide-Ihama, who was the beneficiary of the court order restraining Obaseki from participating in the PDP primaries.\n\n\n\nWike had also told the court that the defendants denigrated him before the entire world as a fake democrat, who engages in meddling in the internal affairs of All Progressives Congress, in order to get at his political enemy, the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nSix Nigerians have been sanctioned by the United States for raising funds in United Arab Emirates (where they were convicted) for the terrorist group, Boko Haram..A statement by the US read: U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated a network of six individuals connected to Nigeria-based terrorist group, Boko Haram. All six were found guilty of establishing a Boko Haram cell in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to raise funds for and provide material assistance to Boko Haram insurgents in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe release added that OFAC\u2019s action followed arrests, prosecutions, and designations in the UAE in September 2021, demonstrating the commitment of the Emirati government to using judicial measures and targeted financial sanctions to disrupt the flow of funds to these networks.\n\nThe Under Secretary of the Treasury, Brian Nelson, was quoted in the release to have said: \u201cWith this action, the United States joins the UAE in targeting terrorist financing networks of mutual concern,\u201d adding that: \u201cTreasury continues to target financial facilitators of terrorist activity worldwide. We welcome multilateral action on this Boko Haram network to ensure that it is not able to move any further funds through the international financial system.\u201d\n\nAccording to the release, OFAC designated Abdurrahman Ado Musa, Salihu Yusuf Adamu, Bashir Ali Yusuf, Muhammed Ibrahim Isa, Ibrahim Ali Alhassan, and Surajo Abubakar Muhammad pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, as amended, which targets terrorists, leaders, and officials of terrorist groups, and those providing support to terrorists or acts of terrorism.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State had designated Boko Haram as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist on November 14, 2013.\n\nThe UAE Federal Court of Appeals in Abu Dhabi had convicted Abdurrahman Ado Musa, Salihu Yusuf Adamu, Bashir Ali Yusuf, Muhammed Ibrahim Isa, Ibrahim Ali Alhassan, and Surajo Abubakar Muhammad for transferring $782,000 from Dubai to Boko Haram in Nigeria.\n\nSalihu Yusuf Adamu and Surajo Abubakar Muhammad were sentenced to life imprisonment for violations of UAE anti-terrorism laws; Abdurrahman Ado Musa, Bashir Ali Yusuf, Muhammed Ibrahim Isa, and Ibrahim Ali Alhassan were sentenced to 10 years in prison, followed by deportation.\n\nIt said the designations will prevent these individuals\u2019 funds from being used further to support terrorism.\n\nTHISDAY can report that as a result of action, all property and interests in property of the individuals named above, and of any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by them, individually, or with other blocked persons, that are in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons, must be blocked and reported to OFAC.\n\nAlso unless authorized by a general or specific license issued by OFAC or otherwise exempt, OFAC\u2019s regulations generally prohibit all transactions by U.S. persons or within the United States (including transactions transiting the United States) that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons.\n\nThe release further said, engaging in certain transactions with the individuals designated entails risk of secondary sanctions pursuant to E.O. 13224, as amended. Pursuant to this authority, OFAC can prohibit or impose strict conditions on the opening or maintaining in the United States of a correspondent account or a payable-through account of a foreign financial institution that knowingly conducted or facilitated any significant transaction on behalf of a Specially Designated Global Terrorist.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Timipre Sylva, minister of state for petroleum resources, says Nigeria is ready to offer its services as an alternative gas supplier to Europe.\n\nHe urged the European Union (EU) to increase investments in gas and hydrocarbons in Nigeria to be able to meet the bloc\u2019s energy needs.\n\nNAN reports that Sylva spoke when he received a delegation led by Samuela Isopi, EU\u2019s ambassador to Nigeria and ECOWAS.\n\nThe minister\u2019s call comes on the heels of the festering war between Ukraine and Russia, which threatens gas supply to European countries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia currently supplies about 30 to 40 percent of the EU\u2019s gas needs.\n\nAccording to a statement issued on Saturday by Horatius Egua, his senior adviser on media and communications, Sylva asked the EU to encourage its oil and gas companies such as Shell, Eni, and Total Energies to scale up investments in the Nigerian gas sector.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we warned against earlier was the speed with which the EU was taking away investments in fossil fuels,\u201d he was quoted as saying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe warned that the speed was faster than they were developing renewable energy. You can see now that what we were warning against is what is happening now.\u201d\n\nHe told the delegation that what stunted growth in the development of gas in Nigeria was fresh investments, and called for a change of attitude on the part of the EU if its requests to increase supplies to Europe would be realised.\n\nAccording to the minister, one of the biggest challenges the sector faces is lack of investments.\n\n\u201cIn the last 10 years, over 70 billion dollars worth of investments came to Africa, but sadly less than four billion dollars came to Nigeria,\u201d Sylva said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, we are the biggest in Africa.

          "title": "Digital Nomads: The pastor turned tech bro",
          "text": "\u201cEven if I have the call of God, it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t have a career. I shouldn\u2019t have to rely on church offerings to survive. Here\u2019s where people have a problem with pastors: they believe that most pastors wait for tithes or offerings. But that\u2019s not me.\u201d\n\nWhen Jay*, a pastor-turned-data-scientist, was in his final year as a computer engineering student at the Oduduwa University in Osun state, Nigeria, he decided his final year project would focus on e-voting in Nigeria. \u201cBut that topic wasn\u2019t approved,\u201d he says. The reason, Jay says, was that the lecturers in charge, at the time, knew nothing about the applications of tech. \u201cThey told me to be realistic. This was 2018, mind you, but they said that tech wasn\u2019t that important in the country, and that I should research something else. I can\u2019t remember what I finally wrote about, but I know it had nothing to do with tech and its potential impact on our society.\u201d\n\nIf the impact of tech on voting would not be important in 2018, the year before Africa\u2019s most populous country conducted its last general elections, when would it ever be?\n\nFor Jay, this event pushed him towards putting his degree to good use and becoming an all-round tech bro. He doesn\u2019t think his lecturers meant any harm, but he believes their lack of knowledge on the impact of tech will have damning consequences on the students they teach.\n\nAlthough he\u2019d been studying computer engineering, Jay already had a first love: ministering. Born to a Muslim mother and Christian father, he believes he\u2019s been ordained by God to preach the gospel. \u201cMy father died early, so I had to live with my paternal grandmother, and that\u2019s where I got introduced to the word.\u201d\n\nFrom his university days, Jay had been working as a minister, teaching the bible under his own ministry. His only worry was how to make an income independent of the church\u2019s income. \u201cI knew I had to have a career outside ministering. The problem most people have with pastors is that a lot of us depend on the church\u2019s income. I didn\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\nSo, during his National Youth Service\u2014a mandatory 1\u2013year programme all Nigerians must participate in, in service of their country\u2014Jay branched out into tech. He developed design skills and worked as a graphics designer for 17 months before moving to another company to work as a user interface designer.\n\nMonths later, in 2020, Jay landed a hybrid role working as a data annotator for a US-based company that uses artificial intelligence to measure consumer needs.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what a data annotator does, you\u2019re right to wonder. It\u2019s an unsung profession. \u201cAs a data annotator, my job is to collect and label data that the AIs will use to forecast how consumers will react to e-commerce products,\u201d Jay explains. \u201cFor example, we take the iPhone 13 and try to figure out its impact on users in the next few years.\u201d\n\nThink of data annotation as teaching or training a computer. Focus on AI increased significantly this decade with $77 billion getting invested in the sector, a 113% increase from 2020\u2019s $36 billion investment. In Africa, though, investment in the AI sector is low, accounting for only 3% of total startup investments. It\u2019s no surprise then that data annotators, whose work primarily focus on AI, are scarce on the continent.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t really hacked the importance of AI on the continent, and that\u2019s why there aren\u2019t many data annotators. Whenever I tell people about my job, there\u2019s a bit of scepticism and doubt. There are always questions about what I do, even from top professionals in the field.\u201d\n\nOn his experience with the job, Jay says he enjoys the process and hopes more Africans would get into the field. If there\u2019s any complaint he has, though, it\u2019s the pay gap between him and his non-Nigerian colleagues working for the same company. In the Nigerian context, the job pays fairly well, with Jay getting \u20a6250,000 ($600)/month plus benefits, including pension, HMO, and a work laptop. The benefits are the same with the company\u2019s non-Nigerian employees, except for one big difference.\n\n\u201cI know some of my US colleagues earn about \u20a62.5 million per month, even though we\u2019re doing the same job for the company.\u201d\n\nEven with the pay disparity, Jay is still pretty comfortable with his job. \u201cIt\u2019s better than nothing, and it helps me provide for my family without having to depend on the church\u2019s income.\u201d\n\nIn addition to his design, product, and data annotation skills, he\u2019s also learning software engineering to help him become an all-round tech bro.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just doing this for me,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the same way I\u2019m teaching the word, I also want to teach tech, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m learning these skills.\u201d\n\nIn the near future, he hopes to bring more people to the altar of tech and preach to them the good news of how much tech can improve their lives.\n\n*Name has been changed to protect the owner\u2019s identity.\n\n\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech. A new episode drops every Wednesday. If you think your story fits the Digital Nomads bill, reach out to us here.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In an email circular that went out from Bento Africa\u2019s board of directors to the company\u2019s customers and partners on Wednesday evening, the board announced that Ebun Okubanjo will be taking \u201csome time off\u201d and handing over all people-related decisions to his co-founder and COO, Chidozie Okonkwo. Chidozie will lead people operations alongside the company\u2019s country directors.\n\nBento\u2019s board\u2019s decision comes a few days after TechCabal exposed the harrowing experiences of ex-employees of payroll startup Bento Africa and how Okubanjo had allegedly been the orchestrator of that through direct and indirect bullying, verbal abuse, and threats to employees.\n\nIn their email to Bento\u2019s customers and clients, the board condemned Ebun\u2019s initial reaction to the story, especially his tweets attacking the credibility of publication TechCabal.\n\n\u201cAs professional Investors and Operators, we were aghast at the defensive and escalatory first tweets of Ebun on the matter, which we quickly moved against. Our responsibility and charter is to the Company, not the founders we invest in,\u201d the board said in an email sent to all Bento employees, past and present.\n\nFurthermore, the board said that while Okubanjo is taking a back seat with immediate effect, an internal investigation into Bento\u2019s workplace culture has begun. It also announced that it would be reviewing Bento Africa\u2019s internal management practices and processes.\n\n\u201cWe are reviewing the HR and People practices and guidelines at Bento and will work with HR consultants and the company\u2019s in-house team to make sure that it is reflective of human values that drive sustainable performance,\u201d said the board in the email.\n\nThe board claimed to have \u201c\u2026ensured that the current team is safe and free to speak freely. We voided any NDA\u2019s that may have been in place and instructed Management to let the Team know they were free to speak to any journalist that contacted them.\u201d TechCabal reached out to current Bento Africa employees who confirmed that they had been granted permission to speak freely without worrying about consequences.\n\n\u201cI think not restricting us from talking to journalists and cancelling our NDAs is the right thing to do,\u201d said one of the 3 employees TechCabal reached out to for the expose.\u201d\n\nOkubanjo also published a personal apology to current and past employees of the company via his Medium page. In the post titled From ebun. With Love, Okubanjo admits to encouraging a work culture of \u201clong workdays and weeks\u201d and apologised for his abusive outbursts. He also confirmed the board\u2019s decision to appoint Chidozie to lead people operations at the company.\n\n\u201cI am sorry,\u201d Okubanjo writes. \u201cI have some work to do here and there is a lot of room for growth. It will [sic] be a lie if I say this is a switch I can make overnight, I would [sic] need to learn how to balance passion with empathy. I will step away from all people decisions in the company. Chidozie will take over along with our new Head of People \u2014 Her arrival could not have been more timely. The country leads will also be instrumental in helping shape a more humane people policy.\u201d\n\nIn a bid to repair broken bridges, the CEO also encouraged former and current employees who have \u201cfelt that fire that burns [sic] so hot when we are in the thick of it\u201d to reach out to him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in support of the way Ebun handled the situation, and we\u2019re currently running an internal investigation to quantify the scale of the damages his actions have brought to employees and the business,\u201d said board member and CEO at Zedcrest, Adedayo Hamza. \u201cWe\u2019re open to speaking to anyone about this process.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "\u201cBento took everything from me\u2014my sense of humanity, sanity, confidence, and trust,\u201d Pascal*, an ex-sales executive at Nigerian payroll startup Bento Africa, said about his time working there. \u201cWe worked around the clock. Ebun [CEO and co-founder of the company] would send you messages by 2 AM and expect a response asap. No rest. We went to bed every night praying our jobs would still be there when we woke up the next morning.\u201d\n\nOn March 18, 2021, Pascal\u2019s prayer, which had seemed to work for over a year, stopped working. He was abruptly fired from his job. He fell into a depressive state, and everything stopped making sense. He stopped going out, and his relationships with friends and family suffered. Even though he said working at Bento for over a year had been torture, it was all he had at the time.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng) is the brainchild of Ebun Okubanjo and Chidozie Okonkwo, his friend, business partner, and Bento\u2019s Chief Operating Officer (COO). Headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria, Bento provides payroll management software to 900 businesses, including Hygeia, Paystack, Kobo360, Branch, and LORI Systems.\n\nOkubanjo and Okonkwo built, and still run, multiple businesses together. While both co-founders flock together, they aren\u2019t quite of the same feather. All ex-employees who spoke to us described Okubanjo as fire and Okonkwo as neither water nor fire; Okonkwo simply remains in the background, silent and rarely engaged in the company\u2019s day-to-day operations. These ex-employees therefore believe that Okonkwo\u2019s attitude outsources all authority to Okubanjo and enables his toxicity.\n\nIn Okubanjo\u2019s termination email to Pascal, he was fired because of a \u201clack of cultural fit and poor performance\u201d. But Pascal wondered: \u201cHow could I have been culturally unfit and incompetent after working for you for over a year? Why did it take you that long to clock my incompetence?\u201d\n\nOkubanjo\u2019s email terminating Pascal\u2019s contract\n\nThe termination letter\n\nHe said, despite the daily verbal assaults he endured in the hands of Okubanjo, all he wanted to do was to be the best salesperson in the company and make his employer proud. He hadn\u2019t done much work in sales prior to Bento, so he put in the work. Within 5 months, according to him, he had the second-highest number of clients on their sheets at the time. He closed some of the biggest clients\u2014some of them with over 1,000 employees and a monthly payroll worth \u20a615\u2013\u20a620 million (~$47,000).\n\nDespite his achievements, however, Pascal did not succeed in making his boss proud. \u201cThere was no free day from Ebun\u2019s verbal abuse. If he wasn\u2019t calling me a useless person, he was threatening to beat me up,\u201d Pascal said. At some point, while recounting his experience to TechCabal, he paused to catch his breath.\n\nPascal described his time at Bento as the darkest period of his life.\n\nPascal narrated how employees would weep during the sales team\u2019s check-in call at 8 AM every weekday. Okubanjo harshly criticised their work and threatened to fire them all at these meetings.\n\nEzekiel*, who had worked with the company\u2019s growth marketing team, shared his experience with TechCabal. He had joined one of the sales calls and heard Okubanjo calling them \u201cpussies and deadweights\u201d. He also heard Okubanjo tell the team that they smelled. \u201cEven though he never attacked me personally,\u201d Ezekiel said, \u201cI always wondered how anybody could go through that every morning and remain sane.\u201d\n\nBento Africa\u2019s cofounders: Ebun Okubanjo (left) and Chidozie Okonkwo (right)\n\nEx-employees also revealed gaps in Bento\u2019s employment contract, specifically where leave days and time off were concerned. Okubanjo promised employees that they could take time off when they needed it, but Bola*, another ex-employee from the company\u2019s sales team, dispelled that promise as a myth.\n\n\u201cI can count on one hand how many people took leave during my stay there. Ebun said breaks are for pussies and fuckers, and whoever takes time out of the office for a whole week is a weak member of the team and not needed in the organisation,\u201d said Bola.\n\n\u201cEbun scarred me,\u201d she said. \u201cI have spent money on therapy, yet, I still suffer from anxiety.\u201d\n\nIn her early days at the startup, Bola asked a lot of people to come work with her at Bento. At that time, she was ignorant of Okubanjo\u2019s \u201cterrifying personality\u201d. \u201cHad I known about it, I wouldn\u2019t have asked anybody to join Bento. Now, when a prospective Bento employee reaches out to me, I just tell them to run!\u201d\n\nAccording to the sources we spoke to, Okubanjo rarely welcomed alternative opinions and monopolised making key business decisions; the punishment for criticising his ideas was immediate termination of employment. For a number of Bento ex-employees, termination simply entailed deactivated Slack accounts and emails.\n\nTinu*, who had been poached from another company to come join Bento, woke up one day and found out she\u2019d been fired and logged out of her Slack and work email. She\u2019d only been with the company as Communication Lead for less than 3 weeks.\n\n\u201cIt was a nerve-wracking experience and the worst 5 months of my adult life,\u201d said Amaka*, who was excited to join a tech startup in Nigeria after finishing her studies in the US. She was fired after enduring Okubanjo\u2019s insults and unwarranted comments about her body.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a plus-size woman and Okubanjo would always have opinions about my dressing. He once told me to stop wearing dresses, that I need to wear jackets, trouser and suit all the time (presumably to cover my breast) after his girlfriend Alice commented that she liked my breast. What did I wear? Regular dresses that even my mother approved of.\u201d\n\nAmaka likened the day she was fired to a scene out of a movie. \u201cWe were on a sales call, and Ebun kept saying I wasted company resources while bringing in zero value.\u201d Okubanjo accused her of charging her personal Bolt ride on the company\u2019s debit card, unaware that Amaka had stopped using the card entirely and even ran the company\u2019s errands with her own car.\n\nFollowing Okubanjo\u2019s accusation, Amaka asked that the card be audited to ascertain whether she had indeed been wasting the company\u2019s money. Okubanjo checked the card and discovered that she hadn\u2019t been using the card for personal expenses. Rather than apologise to her, he changed tack and started accusing her of not working.\n\n\u201cHe called me useless and told me to f*ck off from the call. Next thing I knew, my colleagues were texting to inform me that he\u2019d fired me after I dropped off the call.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, when Kunle*, a lead engineer who worked for the company for over 2 years, was fired last November, he only found out about it when he couldn\u2019t access his Slack and work email the next morning. \u201cEbun fired me because he felt like I was trying to wrest authority from him,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo announcing on the company\u2019s slack after firing Kunle\n\n\u201cLeave Ebun, that man can literally kill you and brag about it. He\u2019s that vindictive,\u201d Ezekiel had mentioned while speaking to TechCabal. Ada*, another ex-staff, had also specifically declined to speak to us because she was worried about her safety, fearing that her former employer, could hurt her.\n\nIn the images above, Okubanjo referred to himself as Marlo Stanfield on Bento\u2019s Slack. Who is that, you may ask?\n\nMarlo Stanfield is a fictional character on the HBO television drama The Wire. He is a young, ambitious, intelligent, and ruthless gangster. In the drama series, Stanfield demanded unconditional respect, which superseded all other concerns. He was murderously narcissistic, and frequently ordered the deaths of those who disrespected or undermined him. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked him number 2 on their list of \u201c40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time\u201d.\n\nThe day before Kunle was fired, the company\u2019s CTO Lede Adeniyi was on leave, so Kunle stepped up to lead the engineering team. Kunle recalled that one of the account executives had told him that a customer wanted a feature that was not in Bento\u2019s product roadmap for the year. Kunle said he explained to the executive that the company had prioritised other fixes and features for the year and would include the requested feature on their first sprint in 2022. He, however, suggested that if the customer wanted the feature added quickly, he could talk to Okubanjo.\n\n\u201cI referred the executive to Ebun because Ebun had already accused me, previously, of setting priorities behind him. But even that was a crime,\u201d said Kunle. The executive went to Okubanjo with their request, as Kunle had suggested, and all hell broke loose.\n\n\u201cI remember how Ebun came to shout at me: \u2018Hey motherfucker, what did you say to a customer about their ask?\u2019 He shut me up before I could even answer and called me names, which was normal. I was his usual point of reference whenever he wanted to benchmark weaknesses and redundancy in the team. Imagine being disrespected in front of your team members every day.\u201d\n\nNow, before the November firing, Okubanjo had fired Kunle once before. It happened on a trip to Ghana. Kunle had asked Okubanjo to stop calling him a monkey. Okubanjo responded to that by firing him on the spot. \u201cHe told me to find my way back to Nigeria, and that he didn\u2019t care how I did it.\u201d But then, he called Kunle after a few hours to give him his job back, knowing he needed him to sort out the business operations they had come for in Ghana.\n\nOn November 22, when Okunbanjo fired Kunle for the second and final time, he refused to pay his November salary and severance pay. Kunle reached out to Adeniyi, the CTO, to help him speak to Okubanjo about his owed payments, but Adeniyi couldn\u2019t do anything about it. \u201cYou know Ebun does what he wants,\u201d Kunle recalled Adeniyi saying to him.\n\nWhen TechCabal reached out to Adeniyi for comment on the incident, he confirmed Kunle\u2019s report: \u201cYes, Kunle asked me to follow up with Ebun, which I did, and Ebun promised to pay him.\u201d It\u2019s been 4 months now and Okubanjo still hasn\u2019t paid Kunle.\n\nBut after Kunle got fired, it seemed his former boss wasn\u2019t done with him.\n\n\u201cLast month, just when my mental health was getting back in shape, Ebun popped up on my LinkedIn, offering me my old job back,\u201d Kunle said. \u201cI declined. Such effrontery! No form of apology. I haven\u2019t found a new job yet because I\u2019m scared of working in another Nigerian startup.\u201d\n\n\n\nEbun Okubanjo reached out to Kunle* 4 months after to offer him his job back\n\nKunle claimed that Ebun sacked his friend John*, a former member of Bento\u2019s design team, because John was talking a lot about web3 on social media. Okubanjo accused John of finding Bento \u201cless interesting\u201d. TechCabal reached out to John through Kunle but he hasn\u2019t replied.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t give Okubanjo notice period when you\u2019re leaving the company. He\u2019d fire you and tell you off,\u201d Ezekiel said. \u201cWhen Ebun fires you, he tells you to watch how he\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t get a job anywhere else in the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nTare Johnson, Bento\u2019s ex-accountant and financial analyst, believes this was why he couldn\u2019t find a job for 6 months after leaving Bento in August 2020. When Johnson joined Bento in February 2020, his contract stated that he was coming in to lead the finance team. He would later find out that there was no team, and that he would be leading himself while reporting to a \u201cnarcissistic boss\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was basically the only one handling all the company\u2019s finances. I was also doing clerical jobs and running errands like a personal assistant, which was confusing and not even remotely close to my job description,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cMy initial thought was, \u2018It\u2019s a startup and things move around a lot.\u2019 But I was wrong. This place was designed to break employees. Ebun abused me verbally, which is standard behaviour for him with employees. He\u2019d call me a motherfucker, dullard, and every vulgar word in the dictionary. He even insulted my family.\u201d\n\nJohnson, running a one-man finance team, was stuck in a mess he hadn\u2019t bargained for. The pandemic lockdown hit barely a month after he got the job, locking him into the job at a time when companies were laying people off and not hiring. So he stuck around and took all the verbal abuse Okubanjo hurled at him. After 5 months, he figured he was coping, until an event on Monday, August 17, 2020 made him resign without notice.\n\nThe WhatsApp conversation between Johnson and Okubanjo\n\nThat Monday, Johnson\u2014like he had done every morning\u2014shared the company\u2019s daily bank statements to Okubanjo and Okonkwo on WhatsApp. Upon receiving them, Okubanjo replied with: \u201cBro, are you drunk???\u201d Johnson thought he must have made a mistake somewhere on the statements, so he quickly double-checked before re-sharing the statements with Bento\u2019s founding team. Okubanjo was still not satisfied with the statements. Apparently, some recent transaction hadn\u2019t reflected yet in the company\u2019s account at the time Johnson compiled the statement; there was no way Johnson could have included it in his report. But Okubanjo, \u201cin his usual fashion\u201d, asked Johnson to fix the spreadsheet or he\u2019d fire him. Finally fed up, Johnson resigned with a simple message: \u201cNo need, I quit\u201d and exited the WhatsApp group. An hour later, he sent in his resignation letter.\n\nFor Johnson, joining Bento Africa was \u201ca bad idea\u201d and leaving \u201cthe best thing he\u2019d ever done for himself\u201d.\n\nWhy were Okubanjo\u2019s red flags ignored?\n\nSome of the ex-employees said Okubanjo\u2019s ruthless leadership style was obvious from the first day they met him. \u201cThe day I met him for my interview, he told me he could read poverty all over my face,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cOn the first day we met,\u201d Johnson said, \u201cI witnessed an altercation that ended with Ebun threatening to punch a stranger in the face.\u201d\n\nAmaka, on her part, said she recognised Okubanjo from a video that had gone viral a year before, where he was in a heated argument with a female customer of Fitness Central, a gym he co-founded with Okonkwo. In the video, Okunbanjo\u2019s threatening personality was evident and on full-display.\n\nSo, why did these former Bento staff accept to work for the company after seeing these red flags from the CEO?\n\n\u201cI felt bad, but what could I do? I needed the job. I was just coming off the HNG Internship,\u201d said Kunle.\n\n\u201cThe money was good, for someone who hadn\u2019t even done the mandatory, one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC),\u201d said Amaka.\n\n\u201cI had already stayed about 7 months without a job, after NYSC, and was even planning to go back home [which is outside Lagos] when the job came. So, it was my best option at the time,\u201d said Adanma*, a former employee of the company.\n\nCulture shock after leaving Bento\n\nFormer employees who spoke to TechCabal confessed to experiencing culture shock at their subsequent jobs.\n\nAdanma \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe it when my current boss asked for my opinion on things. \u201cFor the first few months [at my current job], I was too scared to voice an opinion at meetings, for fear of being called stupid.\u201d\n\nBola \u201cwas surprised when my current boss said switching off Slack notifications is good to reduce anxiety, and that we should all try it.\u201d\n\nAccording to McKinsey, hundreds of experiments show that encounters with rude, insulting, and demeaning people undermine workers\u2019 performance, including their decision-making skills, productivity, creativity, and willingness to work harder and help coworkers.\n\nOkubanjo often claims that Bento is \u201ca mission and not a company\u201d hence his iron-fist leadership.\n\nBento is still toxic\n\nThree current Bento employees contacted by TechCabal were diplomatic about their responses, but they agreed that everything this publication has unearthed about Bento Africa\u2019s work culture \u201cis not false\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne minute it\u2019s silence; the next it\u2019s chaos. It\u2019s unstable here, and the pressure is too much,\u201d one of them said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not really bothered,\u201d the second employee said. \u201cMy former place of work was also toxic, so I\u2019m kinda used to it. At this point, I think all startups are the same.\u201d\n\nThe third employee wouldn\u2019t \u201cdeny that Bento can be toxic for some people but not in my personal experience. We work very hard, and we play harder. Most people on the team love their jobs. It\u2019s not for everyone, really.\u201d\n\nWhile several ex-Bento employees agree that the company has a great and important product, they believe both founders in charge of the startup are unfit for their roles. The company\u2019s Glassdoor reviews tell more stories of its unconducive work culture.\n\nIn December last year, Bento expanded into Ghana, Kenya, and Rwanda, with plans to set up operations in 6 other markets\u2014Egypt, South Africa, Uganda, Tanzania, Angola, and Ethiopia\u2014by the end of this year. The company also leveraged the influence of music veteran and record label boss Don Jazzy to push a campaign supporting the African entrepreneurship spirit\u2014a campaign that arguably boosted its pan-African brand equity. These strides mean that the company is growing to a stage where its apparent lack of structure, process, and attention to employee welfare can no longer be ignored.\n\nTechCabal reached out to Okubanjo and Okonkwo for comments. Okonkwo didn\u2019t respond, but Okubanjo did. In his response, he called our then-developing story \u201cfiction\u201d and posted our email request to Twitter, claiming our article was a \u201chit job\u201d. He has followed his tweets with a series of abusive personal messages to members of the TechCabal team.\n\nEbun Okubanjo posted our email request on Twitter, he has since deleted the tweet.\n\nWhile Johnson, Bola, Amaka, Kunle, Ezekiel, Adanma, and others still scared to speak up have licked their wounds and moved on, Pascal\u2019s family refuses to let the abuse he suffered at Bento slide. They have sued Okubanjo. \u201cI just want him to rescind the lies he told in the termination email to me, I have all the evidence to prove he lied,\u201d Pascal said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: * Besides Tare Johnson who specifically asked not to be anonymous, other names have been changed to protect the identities of those involved. Furthermore, two current members of Big Cabal Media\u2019s team were former employees at Bento Africa (formerly known as Verifi.ng).\n\nUpdate: Amaka\u2019s account on Okubanjo\u2019s comment about her dressing was updated at 12:30 AM on March 22, 2020.\n\nUpdate: Tangerine Africa was removed from the Bento\u2019s client lists because the company said they have only provided insurance to Bento clients in the past, but never been a client themselves. This update was done 1:20 PM on March 23, 2022.\n\nTechCabal is working on a follow-up story exploring hostile work culture in African startups.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are a 9-5er with great colleagues who own cars, you are probably already familiar with the concept of hitching a ride. Let\u2019s say your office is in Ikeja, you live in Surulere, and your colleague who also lives in Surulere has a car. So, you tend to get a ride with them, sometimes paying for fuel, saving you quite a bit of money that you\u2019d have spent on transport.\n\nBut what if you could hitch a ride with a stranger going in the same direction? Doesn\u2019t sound too safe, right? Especially if you\u2019ve been following the recent news on social media about insecurity on some ride-hailing and even government-owned transport systems.\n\nWell, Laolu Onifade thinks he might have found a sweet spot with his newly launched ride-sharing startup, Hytch.\n\nBut what does Hytch do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaolu Onifade, Hytch Founder\n\nAccording to Onifade, Hytch connects car owners and passengers going in the same direction. Using our earlier example, say you\u2019re trying to get to Berger from Surulere, all you have to do is launch the app, find drivers within a 2-3km radius going in that direction and, voila, you\u2019ve \u201chytched\u201d a ride.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilar to the defunct GoMyWay, the ride is shared with three other riders going in the same direction, making the fare cheaper\n\nModelled after popular ride-hailing companies like Bolt and Uber, Hytch doesn\u2019t own any of the cars on the platform and only onboards drivers, with certain safety restrictions \u2014 which we\u2019ll get into later \u2014 built in to prevent mishaps.\n\nHytch takes a 15% commission off every ride and operates a cashless payment method. All users \u2014 drivers and passengers \u2014 have a wallet, so passengers are automatically debited the amount for the trip when it ends.\n\nThe idea for Hytch was birthed between 2019 and 2020, following Onifade\u2019s frustrations with ride-hailing platforms.\n\n\u201cI have encountered this problem myself moving around and with Uber being so expensive; I\u2019ve had this problem with Uber since 2019/2020. I noticed that Uber and Bolt were getting so expensive and I used to wonder, how about I just hitch a ride?\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I just be in someone\u2019s car? Sometimes when I\u2019m in an Uber that\u2019s costing me say \u20a65,000, I don\u2019t mind sharing the ride with three other people in the back seat going in the same direction.\u201d\n\nRoping in his friends, Femi Omoniyi (CTO), Olawale Adeyeye (Chief Imagineer), and Kemdirim Akujobi (Product and Design Lead), they began building Hytch in 2021.\n\nAfter several months of beta testing, which saw them onboard 200 people, Hytch comes out of stealth mode today, with the app available on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnsuring user safety\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week Friday, March 18, 2022, this tweet by twitterer, @_kimaura set Nigeria\u2019s Twitter streets ablaze.\n\nso guys, i got robbed on wednesday night at ikoyi by my bolt driver, he took my phone, my cards, my ID, all my money and savings, lemme tell you how it happened. I ordered a bolt ride going to lekki, after i got into the ride which was a heavily tinted car and we started \u2026 \u2014 KIMBORO\ud83c\udf3a\ud83c\udf51 (@_kimaura) March 18, 2022\n\n@_kimaura described being robbed by the Bolt driver who took her phone, debit cards, and IDs, among other things. Barely a month after the tragic death of Oluwabamise Ayanwole on a BRT in Lagos, it was enough to cause an uproar, with many people narrating various incidents.\n\nAnother Twitter user, @ade_IDD, narrated how she was almost kidnapped by a Bolt driver whose appearance was different from the picture on the platform. He told her that he was using his brother\u2019s account because his had been blocked.\n\nSo @Boltapp_ng i have strength today. I ordered a ride from school to my house yesterday Friday 18th of march and i got a driver. He came and i confirmed car type and number plate and i put my stuff in the car and he started the ride. \u2014 AdaUgo.\ud83e\udd84\u2728Busiswadede. \ud83e\udd75 (@ade_IDD) March 19, 2022\n\nThankfully, she got to safety, before anything untoward happened.\n\nIn a since-deleted tweet, another user, @shugadupri reported encountering the same driver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, while Bolt\u2019s support team acknowledged some complaints on Twitter, it is yet to release an official statement on the matter.\n\nTechpoint Africa asked Onifade how Hytch hopes to ensure user safety.\n\nOnifade explained that user safety is provided for both drivers and riders.\n\n\u201cFor drivers, we verify driver\u2019s licence. For riders, you have to take a picture at the moment. So that means, the same picture you take at the time that you are signing up is what the driver is going to use to recognise you. So you have to make sure you\u2019re taking an actual picture or else the driver is not going to pick you up.\n\n\u201cYou also have to put in your legal first and last name while signing up.\u201d\n\nTo ensure that it is an actual picture, Hytch has partnered with Nigerian digital compliance and security company, IdentityPass, plugging in an API that determines whether it is a human face.\n\nFor added security, the driver and rider are sent a pin which both users must confirm on the app before a trip commences. This could also prevent issues of drivers starting trips before arriving.\n\nLike other ride-hailing/ride-sharing companies, Hytch provides a panic button that enables users to alert family and friends when they are in danger.\n\nWhere a rider receives a streak of three bad ratings, they are automatically blocked from using the app, although they can be reinstated. The driver would have to reach out to get the account unblocked after an investigation is carried out.\n\nOnifade said there are currently plans to include National Identification Number (NIN) verification as a security measure; however, he agrees this could be limiting for users with no NIN.\n\nThere\u2019s still much for the startup to do with plans to eventually include interstate travel and as Onifade laughingly told Techpoint Africa, the ability to book a seat on a private jet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuidax, Africa founded cryptocurrency exchange, unveiled its brand ambassador on Tuesday, March 22, 2022.\n\nAfter giving his opening remarks, Buchi Okoro, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and co-founder, Quidax, briefly talked about the brand, what they do, and what they have achieved over the years.\n\nHe said that Quidax makes it easy for users to buy, sell, store and transfer cryptocurrencies.\u201d There is a lot of exclusion that happens because we are Nigerians, Africans.\u201d Crypto is the solution. Quidax was built to solve issues affecting accessing funds and transferring them easily for Africans.\n\nQuidax On CoinMarketcap\n\nOver the years, Quidax has grown to be one of the largest crypto exchanges in Africa and the first African exchange listed on CoinMarketCap. By May 2021 they had processed over 3.2 billion dollars in transactions in less than three years and were awarded Business Day\u2019s 2021 digital assets company of the year.\n\nNew Year, New Quidax\n\nBuchi mentioned that improvements are constantly made to their platform through customer feedback, with the new price alert feature on the platform being a notable example. Quidax has also found a way to engage users to learn crypto on its platform and recently launched Quidax academy to train crypto beginners.\n\nAnswering how secure the platform is, Buchi said they have a custody solution that includes fund insurance; every fund in Quidax is insured. Also, there is a 13-man team constantly working on securing the platform from attacks and a three-factor authentification (3FA) feature that helps to confirm the user\u2019s identity.\n\nQuidax and Don Jazzy\n\nBuchi said that they started the #TheQuidaxCall recently, aiming to help put crypto in front of more people. \u201cThe point is to help preach the gospel of crypto,\u201d he said.\n\nBuchi introduced Michael Collins Ajereh, professionally known as Don Jazzy as a new member and brand ambassador of the Quidax family.\n\nWhen asked why crypto and why he feels it is important, Don Jazzy said he tries his best to stay ahead of the curve and know what is next to avoid being left behind in a fast-moving world. He added that he wants to get more people into crypto as he believes it is the future.\n\nDon Jazzy, who started his crypto journey during the Covid19 pandemic in 2020, said he finds crypto relatively easy to use and transfer money to various world parts.\n\nDon Jazzy also expressed his opinions on Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and their many use cases. He sees NFTs becoming a thing in the music industry, and he highlighted the other use cases like property ownership in the metaverse.\n\nBuchi said their choice in selecting Don Jazzy was because he is very easy to relate to and approach, and he is genuinely interested in crypto.\n\nCalling it a match made in heaven, Buchi said, \u201cAt Quidax, we believe that learning crypto should actually be fun. Learning crypto should be something you can relate to, and Don Jazzy exemplifies and shows what it means to be a Quidaxian.\n\nAlso in attendance at the unveiling event were Uzo Awili, Quidax Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and CO-Founder, Morris Ebieroma, Quidax\u2019s Chief Information Officer (CIO) and CO-Founder, members of the Quidax staff; Miss Techy, Money Africa, members of the media, among others.\n\nQuidax is an African-founded cryptocurrency exchange that makes it easy for anyone to buy, sell, store and transfer cryptocurrencies.

Humla Ventures, Nabuboto, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot, and Pulse Africa founder Leonard Stiegeler also participated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaunched in 2019 by Romain Poirot-Lellig, CEO and Founder, the company\u2019s goal is to \u201cbring the informal economy into the formal economy,\u201d focusing on last-mile delivery, eCommerce (warehousing and fulfilment), and financial services.\n\nThe company claims that it has made significant progress in providing merchants with last-mile delivery and eCommerce fulfilment services.\n\nBy the end of 2022, they plan to launch a B2B lending marketplace to help merchants obtain financing. Also, Kwik will use the funds to acquire customers and finance operations in Ibadan, Kano, Port Harcourt, and Kaduna.\n\nAccording to the CEO, Kwik intends to increase the number of merchants on its platform from over 100,000 to 800,000 by the end of 2022.\n\nThe big question: How does the company hope to accomplish this in the face of competition? I mean, the company claims to have over 100,000 merchants since launching in 2019. So, with less than 200,000 merchants in over two years, what magic will it perform in nine months?\n\nWell, I\u2019m looking to expand my platforms organically, and maybe, I could become one of those 800,000 merchants.

The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) stated that disclosing the source of funds ensures that lenders are not engaging in financial crimes like money laundering, cybercrime, fraud and terrorist financing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new regulation was published on Monday, March 21, 2022, and requires digital lenders to obtain a licence from the country\u2019s monetary authority or cease operations by September 2022.\n\nTo begin operations in the country, digital lenders were previously only required to register their businesses without showing proof of funds.\n\nNow, the new law requires digital lenders to disclose all loan terms and fees, including interest rates and the total amount owed. They will also be required to obtain permission from the Central Bank of Kenya before changing their pricing models.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, they are also prohibited from sharing customer data with third parties, using threatening language, accessing or contacting their customers\u2019 phone contacts, and engaging in \u201cunconscionable debt collection tactics.\u201d\n\nWhat happens when digital lenders don\u2019t comply? Those who violate the regulations \u2014 like sharing loan defaulters\u2019 personal information with third parties \u2014 could face sanctions or licence revocation.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nThe Willie Lynch Letter: History or Hoax?\n\nLet\u2019s talk about ADHD.

          "text": "Gbeminiyi Shoda is a seasoned Legal Practitioner with solid and progressive experience in all facets of Corporate and Commercial Law Practice. She began her career 10 years ago in a law firm in Lagos and is currently the managing director of Structure HQ, a company that is providing corporate and commercial solutions for individuals and innovative businesses. Before becoming the managing director of Structure HQ, Gbeminiyi Shoda joined VFD Group Plc in 2015 providing leadership and directions to the Legal, Compliance and Company secretariat department across diverse sectors. Gbeminiyi is a member of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Section of Business Law, Nigerian Bar Association (SBL, NBA), Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria (FRCN), Institute of Directors (IOD) and a sponsored individual of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). She is a graduate of Lagos State University and has a BL from the Nigeria Law School. This interview gives legal and financial to women and shares navigating her career and about the women in her life that inspire her.\n\n1)How have you broken the bias in your career?\n\nIn April 2021, I founded my own start-up, Structure HQ (SHQ). SHQ is a firm that provides corporate and commercial solutions to innovative individuals and existing businesses. And for all the general bias that exists in a field largely dominated by males, SHQ is female-led. What\u2019s more? Over time, I have come to realise that the notion of \u201cwomen not supporting women\u201d is a myth. Dubbed as the \u201cpower of the pack,\u201d female collaboration where properly harnessed, trumps female competition.\n\nAlso, as far as gender goes, the corporate world is an unbalanced terrain. It is a lopsided structure that easily favours men. Conversely, I became Company Secretary/ Legal Adviser at 25. At a company that, at the time, majorly had men on its board and its management team. I held the position for over 5 years \u2013 testament to how much I invested in hard work and ensured that I never compromised on excellence.\n\n2) Who inspires you?\n\nThe women in my family- my mother and sister. Amazons! Tough and dogged as they come. Growing up, I watched them set aside illogical biases and go on to be all they wanted to be. My mother would always impress on me the need to \u201cjust get up and get it done.\u201d My mother rose to the peak of her career, fighting and winning many corporate battles, before retiring as a Deputy Director.\n\nEven today, many decades on, my sister\u2019s take on life has not changed, and has instead been a consistently positive one. This outlook on life has placed me on my toes, on the lookout for how to make things work, no matter how broken they are.\n\n3)What has been the most difficult aspect of your career and how have you overcome it?\n\nIt is no child\u2019s play to convert a centuries\u2019 old dinosaur into a modern structure. The legal industry is fraught with stereotypes and outdated sentiments. It celebrates ageism. Being a young female professional with a robust, fast career has been challenging. Starting out, it always came up.\n\nTo overcome:\n\nI had to force respect by the quality of my work delivery, seamless execution, and the uncompromised standards of my practice.\n\nIn addition, I have had to be assertive whilst remaining respectful and firm in all dealings. I have converted underestimation to strength.\n\n4) As a lawyer what advice do you have for women as it pertains to legal documents such as wills?\n\nTo start with, I believe every woman should have a family office. I believe that this ensures a deliberate effort into wealth creation and security, ultimately. Be savvy, be deliberate about wealth, and securing it by catering to their loved ones (beneficiaries).\n\nLegal documents, such as wills, aren\u2019t the exclusive preserve of men, especially after the women have driven relentlessly towards acquiring their own wealth. Women must ensure to secure their assets and make deliberate efforts to mandate that they go to their intended heirs.\n\n5) What advice do you have for your women looking to work in legal services?\n\nWhatever age you decide to start working, you can do it. Your dreams are valid. Be consistent, irrespective of the naysayers. Stay the course and trust the process.\n\n6) If you could tell your 16-year-old self-something, what would you say?\n\nAt 16, I was fresh out of secondary school- worried and anxious about what the future held for me. Exactly 16 years after, I am glad for the conscious efforts I put in. Enjoy your life. Most of the things you\u2019re worried about won\u2019t matter many years from now. Enjoy the current season. It\u2019s a matter of time, before it yields something productive. Don\u2019t beat yourself up. Live a fun-filled, disciplined, positive life and shun all tendencies to overthink, worry or fall for stereotypes.",

          "title": "Putin And The Corruption Of Power \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n\u201c I sat at the back of a man\u201d, wrote the great Russian writer, Leo Tolstoy \u201cchoking him and making him to carry my weight; yet, I assured him and I assured myself that I wish I could lighten his burden\u201d.\n\nWhy not climb down the man\u2019s back if you are indeed concerned about mitigating the suffering you have inflicted.\n\nIn all of the modern history of human conflict, there has not been a war more unjust and more anchored on the power dynamics of tyranny as this nauseating invasion.\n\nYet, there are some persons who continue to see this tyranny-let-loosed as a fallout of NATO\u2019s alleged promise not to expand eastward.\n\nWe are all creatures of emotions, we are as regulated by primordial instincts and idiosyncratic biases as by reason. This is why some folks can, in all honesty, attempt to defend such immoral and barbaric invasion. Miguel de Unamuno , the Spanish existentialist philosopher was right when he argued that reason is not man\u2019s towering crown but emotion. The man who philosophizes is a man of flesh and blood who feels more than he thinks. Reason and logic can never cause him to stray a hair\u2019s breath from his biases no matter the soundness of the logic or the strength of the facts.\n\nThere are despots who would have us believe that the era of an open society with its democratic ethos is over. They insist, blindly, that the pace of modern states cannot allow for democratic debates and consensus choices in running a nation. That democracy is inherently weak, time consuming and structurally unsustainable. That is what the Xis and Putins of this world would have us believe.\n\nIt was the great Scottish psychiatrist, R.D. Laing that warned us that the \u201crange and extent of the things that we think and do is limited by what we fail to notice. That because we fail to notice that we are failing to notice, there is little we can do to change, until we notice how failing to notice shapes our thoughts and deeds.\u201d\n\nThe danger of liberal democracies today is that inhabitants of the West are failing to notice that the freedom they presently enjoy and the democracy that underpins it, is in grave danger. They fail to see that democracy is a fragile thing and that the condition upon which God has given liberty to men, is eternal vigilance.\n\nTrump assaulted democracy from within and Putin is now attacking it from without and yet , there are good-natured people who would make case for both men. The argument today is that democracy and freedom are out of sync with the realities of modern states. At least, that is the unspoken creed of Xi and Putin and it is sad that some otherwise reasonable folks would strenuously attempt to justify such a brazen bare-faced invasion by a brute on any grounds even when the groundlessness of Putin\u2019s invasion yearns deeper than Grand Canyon. The West may not be as saintly as they claim but I tell you a truth : should the light of democracy be extinguished by the likes of Putin, mankind would spiral back to the Hobbesian state of nature where life was solitary, nasty, brutish and short.\n\nIt is sad to notice that were Hitler alive today and undergoing his monstrous pogrom, some folks would still make case for him: blame international Jewry for their perceived greed or America for some perceived mischievous globalization or the Poles for not willingly genuflecting before the German war machines.\n\n\u201cRemove law and justice,\u201d warned St. Augustine, \u201cand what are states but gangs of criminals on a large scale\u201d. It is fidelity to a set of moral code and decency that largely defines a civilised society. President Biden was on point when he described Putin as a thug: is anything more thuggish than sending armed mob into your neighbour\u2019s house without any provocation?\n\nThe point here is that America, for its faults and failings, remains the beacon of freedom, justice and opportunity for the world. It is only a fool that throws the baby away with the bath water. Democracy may not be the elixir that transforms base metals into gold, but it is definitely the best platform that guarantees that the light of justice, freedom , opportunity is not extinguished from the midst of men.\n\nDoes it not portend universal danger that one man could rally a military power like Russia into war?\n\nDoes it not bother a sane man that there are no institutions inside Russia that can checkmate or even mildly regulate Putin?\n\nShould one man possess such powers?\n\nIs it not indicative of tyranny and a failed system that one man should wield such powers?\n\nIt is only the most naive amongst us that would readily equate the West with total moral rightness. Frantz Fanon may have his points when he said that anytime he searches for man in the technique of the West , he sees only a succession of the negations of man and a avalanche of murders. However, the institutional guardrails of Western democracies are the best indicators of the survival of the human species.\n\nAbsolute power, said Woodrow Wilson, is what precedes the destruction of human liberty. Putin is pure, unadulterated evil and trying to defend him amounts to demons in search of logic and trying cosmos out of chaos.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOsazuwa Osahon Daniels, Esq.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Nigeria has not witnessed this scale of oil palm cultivation since independence.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe placed the people at the center of our politics, which led to huge investment in human capital development, particularly across all tiers of the state\u2019s education system, starting with the Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (EdoBEST) programme, which has transformed the lives of over 400,000 pupils across the state and improved learning outcomes.\n\n\u201cThere has been a deliberate emphasis on strengthening partnership with the private sector, from which we have reaped the immense benefit.

          "text": "A Russian airstrike last week that blasted open a theater being used as a shelter in the suffering city of Mariupol killed about 300 people, Ukrainian authorities said, marking what could be the war\u2019s deadliest known attack on civilians yet.\n\nThe death toll announced Friday fueled allegations that Moscow is committing war crimes by killing civilians, whether deliberately or with indiscriminate fire.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, seemed to signal an important shift in its war objectives with an announcement that it plans to focus its forces on eastern Ukraine. U.S. officials said Russian troops appeared to have halted for now their ground offensive aimed at capturing the capital, Kyiv, and were concentrating more on gaining control of the Donbas region in the country\u2019s southeast.\n\nHowever, British defense officials reported Saturday that the Russian military continues to besiege a number of other major Ukrainian cities, including Kharkiv and Chernihiv in the north.\n\n\u201cIt is likely Russia will continue to use its heavy firepower on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties,\u201d the U.K. Ministry of Defense said in its latest intelligence briefing on the war.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy again appealed to Russia to negotiate an end to the war, but pointedly said he would not give up any Ukrainian territory for the sake of peace.\n\n\u201cThe territorial integrity of Ukraine should be guaranteed,\u201d he said in a nightly video address to the nation. \u201cThat is, the conditions must be fair, for the Ukrainian people will not accept them otherwise.\u201d\n\nMariupol, a strategically located port city in southeast Ukraine, has been under attack for almost the entire war. For days, the Mariupol government was unable to give a casualty count for the March 16 bombardment of the grand, columned Mariupol Drama Theater.\n\nIn an attempt to ward off an attack on the theater, where hundreds of people were sheltering, the word \u201cCHILDREN\u201d was printed in Russian in huge white letters on the ground outside.\n\nThe city government cited eyewitnesses when it announced the death toll on its Telegram channel. But it was not immediately clear how witnesses arrived at the figure or whether emergency workers had finished excavating the ruins.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said the theater bombing was an \u201cabsolute shock, particularly given the fact that it was so clearly a civilian target.\u201d He said it showed \u201ca brazen disregard for the lives of innocent people\u201d in the besieged port city.\n\nThe Ukrainian Parliament\u2019s human rights commissioner said soon after the attack that more than 1,300 people had taken shelter in the theater, many of them because their homes were destroyed. The building had a basement bomb shelter, and some survivors did emerge from the rubble after the attack.\n\n\u201cThis is a barbaric war, and according to international conventions, deliberate attacks on civilians are war crimes,\u201d said Mircea Geoana, NATO\u2019s deputy-secretary general.\n\nHe said Putin\u2019s efforts to break Ukraine\u2019s will to resist are having the opposite effect: \u201cWhat he\u2019s getting in response is an even more determined Ukrainian army and an ever more united West in supporting Ukraine.\u201d\n\nUkrainian officials continued to push for more military support. Zelenskyy\u2019s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, on Friday called for a lend-lease program, referring to U.S. policy of heavily supplying its World War II allies.\n\nUkraine needs real-time military intelligence and heavy weapons, Yermak said in an address.\n\nWhile the Russians continue to pound the capital from the air, they appear to have gone into a \u201cdefensive crouch\u201d outside Kyiv and are focused more on the Donbas, a senior U.S. defense official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the Pentagon\u2019s assessment.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t show any signs of being willing to move on Kyiv from the ground,\u201d the official said.\n\nIn comments that seemed to corroborate a change in Moscow\u2019s military goals, Col.-Gen Sergei Rudskoi, deputy chief of the Russian general staff, said the main objective of the first stage of the operation \u2014 reducing Ukraine\u2019s fighting capacity \u2014 has \u201cgenerally been accomplished,\u201d allowing Russian forces to focus on \u201cthe main goal, the liberation of Donbas.\u201d\n\nThe Donbas is the largely Russian-speaking eastern part of the country where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014 and where many residents desire close ties to Moscow.\n\nIts coal-mining and industrial Donetsk and Luhansk regions are recognized by Russia as independent. Mariupol is also in the Donbas, although outside of the territories controlled by separatists since 2014.\n\nBritain\u2019s Ministry of Defense said Ukrainian forces have been counterattacking and have been able to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 35 kilometers (22 miles) east of Kyiv as Russian troops fall back on their overextended supply lines. In the south, logistical problems and Ukrainian resistance are slowing the Russians as they look to drive west toward the port of Odesa, the ministry said.\n\nIn fact, the Russians are no longer in full control of Kherson, the first major city to fall to Moscow\u2019s forces, the senior U.S. defense official said. The official said the southern city is being contested by the Ukrainians in heavy fighting. The Kremlin denied it had lost full control.\n\nThe Russian military said 1,351 of its soldiers have died in Ukraine and 3,825 have been wounded, though it was not immediately clear if that included the separatists in the east or others not part of the Defense Ministry, such as the National Guard. Earlier this week, NATO estimated that 7,000 to 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in four weeks of fighting.\n\nFor civilians, the misery is growing more severe in Ukrainian towns and cities, which increasingly resemble the ruins that Russian forces left behind in their campaigns in Syria and Chechnya.\n\nIn the village of Yasnohorodka, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Kyiv, Russian troops who occupied it earlier in the week appeared to have been pushed out as part of a counteroffensive by Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe village church\u2019s tower was damaged by a blast, and houses on the main crossroads lay in ruins.\n\n\u201cYou can see for yourself what happened here. People were killed here. Our soldiers were killed here,\u201d said Yasnohorodka resident Valeriy Puzakov.\n\nIn Kyiv, ashes of the dead are piling up at the main crematorium because so many relatives have left, leaving urns unclaimed. And the northern city of Chernihiv is all but cut off after Russian forces destroyed bridges, leaving people without power, water and heat, authorities said.\n\nFor the vulnerable \u2014 the elderly, children and others unable to join millions fleeing westward \u2014 food shortages are mounting in a country once known as the breadbasket for the world.\n\nIn relentlessly shelled Kharkiv, hundreds of panicked people took shelter in the subway. A hospital emergency room filled with wounded soldiers and civilians",

          "title": "Nigeria: Rivers Governor Wike Changes Positions Randomly and Unpredictably, THISDAY Says in Court",
          "text": "The cross-examination of the first defence witness, Jude Igbanoi, in the libel case filed by Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State against THISDAY Newspapers and three others, continued on Friday at the Rivers State High Court, Port Harcourt, with the claimant\u2019s lead counsel, Emmanuel Ukala (SAN), questioning Igbanoi on the interview Wike granted ARISE News last year.\n\nThe governor had filed a N7 billion libel suit claiming that the newspaper\u2019s publication of June 23, 2020, with caption: \u201cWith a Friend Like Wike, Obaseki Meets His PDP\u2019s Waterloo; Almost,\u201d was intended to damage his character.\n\nOn Friday, Ukala said that in the ARISE video clips on the Edo election campaign, Wike was very passionate in his speech for the victory of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and then asked Igbanoi if in the interview, the governor displayed any sign of betrayal in his responses.\n\nThe witness said he was not in the position to say so; but that the claimant had shown by his character and antecedents that he could not be taken seriously for whatever he says \u201cas he has a tendency to change positions randomly and unpredictably.\u201d\n\nUkala further asked the witness if the said report in THISDAY insinuated that Wike influenced the case in the Federal High Court on who was to be the flag bearer of the PDP in the 2020 Edo gubernatorial election.\n\nIn response, the witness said: \u201cSince it concerns the party, the court, if within his domain, although a federal high court, the governor would not have a passing interest but committed to the victory of the party. Since the cases concerned his party, and in the heat of the governorship election campaign, he (Wike) would be expected to have more than a passing interest in the cases.\u201d\n\nUkala further tendered a letter to the court, where he said the governor had asked THISDAY to retract the said report and publish an apology.\n\nThe cross examination of the defense witness was later adjourned by the presiding Judge, Justice Adolphus Enebeli to April 25 and 27.\n\nSpeaking with journalists outside the courtroom, counsel to THISDAY, Tuduru Edeh (SAN), explained: \u201cThe matter is continuing, the witness has adopted his position in respect of which he has made several comments or at least sustained his defense; all that is before the Honourable presiding justice.\n\n\u201cWe are not here to prejudge what both parties have said until when the court comes to a conclusion. That is the minimum of respect we need to the court.\n\n\u201cToday, the witness was cross examined again by the counsel to the claimant. There were two videos that couldn\u2019t play yesterday but the transcripts are available. So, we have taken a date to bring them forward, play them again so the counsel can continue and conclude the cross-examination.\n\n\u201cWe are returning to the court on April 25 and 27 for them to conclude.\u201d\n\nIn the video clips presented last Thursday by the defense witness, as evidence to the said report, Igbanoi in a heated argument informed the court that Wike\u2019s various public statements open his character and integrity to public scrutiny and fair comments.\n\nHe further stressed that Wike\u2019s character since coming into public office had shown him to be such that he would say certain things about someone one day and turn 360 degrees a few months or years later to say the contrary.\n\nIn the video clips, Wike was sighted in a campaign speaking about Obaseki as televised on Channels and TVC News.\n\nThe court also watched a video clip during an interview with the Governor, televised by Arise News titled, \u201cThe politics and issues in PDP.\u201d\n\nA video clip of Wike praising Amaechi over his performance in Rivers State, when he was the Director of Amaechi Campaign Organisation was also played.\n\nHowever, during cross examination, Ukala told the defendant witness (Igbanoi) that the publication was intended to smear the integrity of the governor.\n\nBut in defense, the witness stated that the story was gathered from speeches made by Wike from different occasions of campaign and interviews.\n\nIgbanoi also told the court that the publication had no intention to damage the image of the governor but was only being professional.\n\nHe stressed that the newspaper was only fulfilling its constitutional duty of informing the public and making a fair comment on the situation during the Edo State governorship election in the said publication.\n\nWhile responding to some of the questions during the cross-examination, he further pointed out to the court that Wike has been a public servant in the past two decades.\n\nThat his life, therefore, was an open book that was open to members of the public and therefore the media was free to comment on his utterances and actions, whether positive or perceived negative. He cited examples of his televised statements as the Director General of the Rotimi Amaechi Campaign Organisation where he praised Amaechi to high heavens and turned round a few years after to lampoon, castigate and lambast him at every given occasion.\n\nHe also pointed out that Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki, whose campaign organisation he chaired, was now his number one enemy to the dismay of the public.\n\nHe stated that Wike has since been apologising to the former Edo State Governor and former APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole openly in the media.\n\nThe governor claimed during his appearance in court that the publication portrayed him as a deceitful, untrustworthy person.\n\nWike also claimed that THISDAY accused him of undemocratically exerting influence on the primaries\u2019 process of PDP in Edo State in aid of his ally, Omoregie Ogbeide-Ihama, who was the beneficiary of the court order restraining Obaseki from participating in the PDP primaries.\n\nWike had also told the court that the defendants denigrated him before the entire world as a fake democrat, who engages in meddling in the internal affairs of All Progressives Congress, in order to get at his political enemy, the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi.\n\nBlessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt",

          "title": "Nigeria: After Months of Rancour, APC Convenes to Endorse Abdullahi Adamu as Chairman",
          "text": "After several months of intense fighting, over 5,000 delegates from across Nigeria will on Saturday gather at the Eagle Square, Abuja, to endorse former Nasarawa State Governor, Senator Abdullahi Adamu as the National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe Abdullahi Adamu deal was concluded last Wednesday after President Muhammadu Buhari summoned the 22 governors of the party to a meeting and decreed the adoption of consensus candidates for all the offices of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party. Thereafter, he nominated Adamu for National Chairman.\n\nAs at Friday night, all the chairmanship aspirants had withdrawn from the race in line with Buhari\u2019s directives.\n\nThe Unity List for other NWC positions of the party was not decided during the governors\u2019 meeting with Buhari. The President told the governors to meet and agree on this; that refunds of money spent on purchasing forms be made to all the aspirants unable to make the Unity List.\n\nUnfortunately, as at last night, just a few hours before voting began, the governors could still not agree on the Unity List. So, no list had been sent out.\n\nOne of the positions still in dispute is that of the party\u2019s National Secretary. Some governors want Iyiola Omisore, former deputy governor of Osun State, while some others want Ifeoluwa Oyedele, a 2020 governorship aspirant of the party in Ondo State.\n\nThe choice of Waziri Bulama (Borno State) as National Organsing Secretary by the governors is also in dispute. Some top party members, including Governor Babagana Zulum prefer Senator Abu Kyari for the job.\n\nThose looking good to make the Unity List are Ken Nnamani (Enugu State) as Deputy National Chairman, South and Adamu Farouk (Jigawa State)) as Deputy National Chairman, North.\n\nHowever, if the governors are able to resolve the Unity List and send it out this morning as indicated by another source, it means the election today would be a mere academic exercise.\n\nIt would also mean that any aspirant still bent on contesting is free to do so, but once outside the Unity List, it is surely going to be a losing game, as the governors control the delegates who will vote at the convention.\n\nGovernor of Nasarawa State Abdullahi Sule, who is Chairman Media and Publicity sub-committee for the National Convention, refused to comment on the delay in the release of the Unity List at a press briefing on Friday, but simply said the list would still be released and would be used on Saturday.\n\nOn the issue of political appointees voting at today\u2019s convention, Governor Sule said: \u201cOur delegates\u2019 list is actually statutory. So, if you have a former president as a political appointee, if you have a former Senator as a political appointee, these are already automatic delegates, you know. So, let us not confuse the two because being an appointee does not necessarily take you out of being a delegate, because our delegates are classified clearly.\n\n\u201cSo, most of the lists that we submitted, if you are talking of the ones who have submitted now, we don\u2019t have commissioners, we don\u2019t have advisors, we don\u2019t have all those unless if somebody particularly was a former this or former that, in that case, you know, just being an appointee doesn\u2019t completely exclude such a person from being a delegate.\u201d\n\nThe President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan on Thursday expressed optimism that most of the new NWC members of the APC today will emerge by consensus.\n\n\u201cThe next two days are so important to us that we must get everything spot on so that we don\u2019t allow anyone to cause any problem. Thank God we are reaching consensus all over the states and zones and by the time we go into the convention ground, I\u2019m sure there will be very few elective offices that will have to be voted for. Most would have been achieved through consensus,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nLawan adds: \u201cWe, as a party, feel that this is a moment that is so critical to the existence of APC in Nigeria. We need to get the convention right. We need to have a very successful, peaceful convention where we elect our leaders that will run the affairs of the party for the next four years. Therefore, every hand must be on deck and what we have done is to come and say our hands are available to be on deck as always.\n\nProgramme of Activities\n\nEagle Square, venue of Saturday\u2019s convention, was sparkling yesterday, while virtually all the delegates had arrived.\n\nAccording to the convention programme released by the APC, accredited delegates are expected to start arriving at the Eagle Square by 10 am. Members of the National Caretaker and Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) will arrive by 1:30p.m.\n\nAPC state governors, National Assembly members, ministers and other party leaders are expected by 2:p.m. The President of the Senate and the Speaker, House of Representatives, will arrive between 2:10p.m and 2:20p.m.\n\nVice-President Yemi Osinbajo will arrive by 2:45p.m while President Buhari will arrive by 3:15p.m. The convention will then kick off.\n\nThere will be goodwill messages by Youth Wing, Women Wing, People Living with Disability (PLwD) and Diaspora Wing between 3:40 and 4:50p.m.\n\nRemarks by the Chairman, Progressives Governors\u2019 Forum (PGF) and Representatives of Governors\u2019 from each of the six geo-political zones will take place between 4:50 and 5:20p.m.\n\nRemarks by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of the Senate will be between 5:25 and 5:35p.m.\n\nRemarks by the Vice-President follow between 5:35 and 5:40p.m, while Special Remarks by President Buhari will be between 5:40 and 5:55p.m\n\nAfter the welcome address by the CECPC Chairman, there will be a presentation of two motions.\n\nThese are the motion for the approval of Constitution as amended and the motion for the ratification of all activities carried out by CECPC.\n\nElections into Zonal and National Offices of the APC will then follow. Then, there will be the declaration of results and swearing in of the newly elected executives. The newly elected National Chairman is expected to make an acceptance speech.\n\nAltogether, 21 NWC positions and 33 non-NWC positions are expected to be filled today.\n\nAPC Governors, Ministers Present Scorecards\n\nGovernors and Ministers of the ruling APC on Friday in Abuja presented a seven years\u2019 scorecard to the party, to back their performance status over the former ruling PDP as they march towards 2023 campaigns.\n\nThe scorecard was presented at the party\u2019s Pre-Convention Conference with the theme: Consolidating Democratic Change: Scorecard, Impact and the Road Ahead at Shehu Musa Yar\u2019Adua Centre, Abuja.\n\nAt the event, governors and serving ministers on the platform of the APC took their time to chronicle the events leading to the formation of the party and the successes, challenges, and achievements made by the party, both at the state and national levels in the last seven years.\n\nPresent at the event were: Governors Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, Babagana Zulum of Borno, Fayemi Kayode of Ekiti, Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola\n\nMinister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, said the APC government social investment programme was yielding good results as Nigeria had emerged the nation with the fastest growing social investment programme in the world.\n\nZainab also disclosed that Nigeria\u2019s economy was now fully diversified due to different economic intervention strategies introduced by the Buhari-led APC government.",
