Their decision was expressed in very unambiguous and unmistaken terms. For this overwhelming victory in the APC primary election, I wholeheartedly congratulate and rejoice with Governor Oyetola.\n\n\u201cThis resounding victory across the 332 wards in the state is an affirmation of the widely-acknowledged sterling performance of the governor in his first term. It is also an expression of the confidence our teeming party members in Osun have in his ability and capacity to propel the state to an even greater height in the second term.\u201d\n\nTinubu also thanked the leadership and members of the APC in the state for ensuring the success of the election.\n\nHe added, \u201cWe thank the leadership of the Osun APC for ensuring the success of the primary election and for effectively mobilising their members to participate fully in the electoral process. The party members also deserve praise for they not only conducted themselves in an orderly manner, but they also ensured their choice was expressed freely, fairly and unreservedly.\n\n\u201cThis electoral victory is not only for him (Oyetola), but also for the APC and the APC members in Osun. They must all come together so that come July 16, the progressive ideals of the APC can continue to hold supreme in the state and Governor Oyetola can continue to deliver the dividends of democracy and good governance to our people.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Wisdom Ogbonna; Hon. Clement Onukwue; and read by the Chairman Ikwuano PDP stakeholders, Rear Admiral Ralph Osondu (retd.); the stakeholders urged members of the public to discountenance the said communique.\n\nIt read in part: \u201d The attention of Ikwuano PDP stakeholders has been drawn to the circulation of a fake communique arising from a well-attended meeting of the PDP political stakeholders of Ikwuano/Umuahia held on Tuesday, February 15, at the residence of Hon. Jerry Uzosike.\u201d\n\nIkwuano PDP stakeholders rather clarified that contrary to the claims of the purported communique, below was the resolution at the meeting:\n\n\u201cThat the good people of Ikwuano/Umuahia of Abia Central Senatorial Zone are eminently qualified and will contest for the governorship of Abia State, come 2023.\n\n\u201cThat our sons and daughters who want to contest are free to enter the race and will receive maximum support of our people.\n\n\u201d That it is the turn of Ngwa extraction (Umunne ato) to run for Abia Central Senatorial seat and should be left as such.\n\nTherefore, sons and daughters of Ikwuano/Umuahia extraction are not encouraged to run for the Senate.\u201d\n\nThe communique which further read: \u201cWe, the PDP Stakeholders of Ikwuano do hereby state as follows:\n\n\u201cThat at no point, during deliberations, was the issue of zoning of governorship position mentioned or discussed since this is the exclusive prerogative of the Party. It was not part of the motions moved, supported and adopted.\n\n\u201cThat, in respect of that meeting, no communique has, so far, been released officially by the Ikwuano/Umuahia Forum.\n\n\u201cThat any communique, being circulated and containing the support for zoning of governorship position to any zone does not have the endorsement of Ikwuano PDP Stakeholders.\n\n\u201d That Ikwuano PDP Stakeholders hereby STRONGLY DISSOCIATE _ itself from the obnoxious communique in circulation.\u201d\n\nThe stakeholders restated their loyalty to Gov.

The task at hand is serious and it is urgent. We can therefore no longer afford the luxury of incompetence, empty showmanship, ruinous partisanship, or suicidal indifference.\n\n\u201d This is the time for every citizen who has something to contribute to come forward. Our country desperately calls out to us.\u201d\n\nThe former minister said,\u201d is in the light of this, therefore, that I have decided to offer myself for service.\n\n\u201d And it is with great honour that I hereby humbly notify you of my intention to contest for the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as Senator representing Kwara Central Senatorial District in the 2023 general elections under the banner of our great party, the PDP. \u201c\n\nHe also said that\u201d In almost two decades of public service, both at the state and the national levels, I have demonstrated a great sense of responsibility; I have demonstrated courage and competence. And I have demonstrated loyalty and integrity. These are the qualifications of leadership that our country needs at this critical time.\n\n\u201cBy the grace of Almighty Allah and with your support, when I am elected Senator, I would be bringing to the legislative chamber of our country, a wide range of experience as a journalist, a civil society activist, a development specialist, a public servant and a party man. I will leverage on my extensive network of relationships across this country built over years of working with other committed citizens in different policy spaces.\n\nHe also said, \u201cand I will deploy all the talents and capacity that it has pleased Allah to bless me to work with other patriots to create a better Nigeria for us all and a great country for the coming generation.\u201d\n\n\u201d I ask for your support. I will not let you down. I am Omoluabi. I have made you proud before. In sha Allah, I will make you proud again. \u201c\n\nHe however noted that \u201cOur dear country Nigeria is at the moment faced with numerous challenges, some of them unprecedented in nature and in scale. Indeed, we can only point at a few other moments in our history, if any, that are as terrifying, as perplexing and as uncertain as now; when for the majority of the people, surviving one day onto another day feels like a major achievement.\n\nHe stressed among others that, \u201cinsecurity has its iron knees firmly planted on the throat of our nation. Banditry and sundry criminal acts beleaguer our country at a scale never witnessed before, and Nigerians are losing their lives in hundreds across our country every single day.\n\nResponding to the state Chairman of the party Alh Babatunde Mohammed who canvassed support for him, saying that if Nigeria has somebody like Bolaji Abdullahi in the Senate, the country would be better for it said the party would provide a level playing ground for all its aspirants.",

There are nations which has death penalty as punishment for corrupt people.\n\n\u201cIt is very disturbing when you consider how far corruption had destroyed the country in all aspect including the National Assembly, civil service and in the academia.\u201d\n\nVanguard News",

Abdullahi Ganduje, visited him in Abuja to discuss the rail and Inland Dry Port (IDP) in the state.\n\nThe minister said, \u201dWe have two major projects we want to do in Kano, the first being the standard gauge from Kano to Kaduna.\n\n\u201dWe are applying to the Kano State Government to give us land to build the biggest station in Nigeria. It is the biggest station because we are combining two rail lines.\n\n\u201dThe first is the Kano-Maradi, which will be empty in Kano and then the second one is Kano \u2013Kaduna, which will also be empty in Kano.\n\n\u201dDon\u2019t forget the station we are building in Kano will be the station that will take passengers from Lagos to Kano.\n\n\u201dIf you combine Kano-Maradi and Lagos-Kano, you will know that the volume of passengers you will get in a week will be about a million passengers,\u201d Amaechi said.\n\nAccording to the minister, there will be an expansion in the concept of the Kano Station, which is largely the same framework as the Lagos Station but has more space than the Lagos Station.\n\nHe noted that the visit of the Kano delegation was also an opportunity to deliberate on the Dala IDP, which was already at the advanced stage.\n\nHe said the ministry\u2019s delegation would on March 5, visit the site to ascertain the level of work and how further the ministry could support realisation of the project.\n\nEarlier, Ganduje said that the state government had contributed about N2.5billion to the dry port project to ensure its speedy completion and commercialisation.\n\n\u201cWe are investing about N2.5billion, we are providing access roads, we are also providing other social amenities just to contribute our own quota.\n\n\u201cThat project was conceived 20 years ago but never materialised until during our time.\n\n\u201cSo, I make sure that this project is a reality and in order to do that we have to provide an enabling environment to contribute our own quota.\n\n\u201cSo, we are happy with the developers because they have gone far and we are happy with the honourable minister of transportation because he has given maximum cooperation in assisting to see that the Kano State Dala IDP is a reality,\u201d Ganduje said.",

Nnolim Nnaji Aviation, warned FAAN against demolishing the affected offices and private hangars at Lagos Airport, because it would cost the country billions of naira.\n\nIt was learnt that the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), the Federal Road Service Corps (FRSC) and the towing firms close to the AIB-N regional headquarters in Lagos were affected by the order.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nThough FAAN confirmed the notice to the agencies with offices close to the airside, it said it did not attach a deadline to it.\n\nFAAN stated that the agency would not compensate the affected organisations but that it would provide them land.\n\nIf FAAN carries out its threat, properties worth billions of Naira belonging to these entities would be affected.\n\nFor instance, AIB-N, has its regional headquarters that was the agency\u2019s head office until the mid-2020 when the Aviation Minister, Hadi Sirika, gave it and other aviation agencies a marching order to move to Abuja office.\n\nThe facility houses its office complex, Command & Control Centre, office of investigators and Information Communication Technology (ICT) department.\n\nApart from the cost of the land, it was learnt that AIB-N\u2019s facilities in Lagos regional office are worth over N5 billion.\n\nMost of the facilities at the AIB-N\u2019s office in Lagos were installed less than four years ago by Mr. Akin Olateru-led management team.\n\nWhile FAAN has issued the eviction order, the affected organisations who are not comfortable that bitter about the development may be heading to court to challenge their eviction.\n\nA source close to one of the two towing firms affected confirmed the notice and that the letter conveying the message was signed by the Managing Director of FAAN, Capt. Rabiu Yadudu.\n\nThe reason for wanting to evict AIB-N and other organisations, it was learnt, was to allow the Chinese contractors building the terminal at the international wing of the Murtala Muhammed Airport to use the offices demolished as apron.\n\nIt would be recalled that FAAN had contended that the organisations doing businesses at that corridor were making it difficult for it to expand the new terminal still under construction.\n\nBut the organisations on their part had argued that they received valid and approved papers from the relevant authorities before constructing their offices at the present locations, wondering why FAAN is now asking them to vacate the same place they got approvals for.\n\nThey further argued that they were not the problem but that the challenge lied with the terminal that was not well-located.\n\nThe General Manager, Corporate Communications, FAAN, Mrs. Henrietta Yakubu, confirmed the development.\n\nShe explained that FAAN would give the affected organisations new land within the airport.\n\nShe added that the affected organisations were not given two weeks to relocate as being speculated.\n\n\u201cFAAN is relocating those offices that have been asked to move,\u201d she added.",

          "title": "Buhari May Sign Electoral Bill Today, Seeks Lawmakers\u2019 Assurances to Amend Clause 84",
          "text": "\u2022Ruling party\u2019s governors meet tonight in Abuja ahead of meeting with president tomorrow\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nAll things being equal, President Muhammadu Buhari, has agreed to sign the reworked Electoral Act Amendment Bill and may in fact sign the bill today but on the condition that the National Assembly would amend the contentious Clause 84, which infringes on the constitutional rights of certain category of people. The contentious aspect bars political appointees from contesting elections and voting as delegates, either at conventions or congresses, after assenting to it.\n\nThe president, who already met with the leadership of the two chambers of the National Assembly was awaiting assurances from the leadership of the National Assembly to amend the bill after signing it into law. \u201cThe President wants to put this behind us but simply wants assurances so as not not to allow this to continue to be a distraction on the country. He doesn\u2019t want other good aspects of the bill to continue to suffer.\u201d\n\nAlso, the president is expected to meet with governors elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) tomorrow at the State House, Abuja, to address concerns relating to the proposed February 26 national convention of the party.\n\nBut this is not going to be before a meeting of the APC governors tonight in Abuja, where they want to take a final look at the situation and issues relating to the convention before engaging the president tomorrow, and ultimately a decision.\n\nBuhari, last night, decided to lay the issues stalling the Electoral Act Amendment Bill to rest, when he seized the initiative and met with the leadership of the National Assembly with a view to finding a middle ground and closing the deal once and for all.\n\nThe president was said to have earlier met with the Deputy Speaker, House of Representatives, Hon. Ahmed Idris Wase, and the Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, who is the Chairman of the amendment committee, deputised by Wase, on how to resolve the controversial Clause 84 of the new amendment.\n\nAccording to sources, the president had only asked if they would be willing to expunge the contentious aspect after he signs the bill so that the political turf could be cleared of the electoral bill crisis. According to a source with knowledge of the ongoing conversation, the president is seeking comfort and assurances that the aspect that infringes on the constitutional rights of Nigerians would be brought in conformity to the constitution through an amendment after he has signed to avoid further delay to the take off of the bill.\u201d\n\nBut as at last night, THISDAY could not glean from the leadership of the National Assembly if they had agreed to the president\u2019s proposal, but feelers from the Villa, indicated that once the Buhari gets the assurance of the the legislative leadership to address the grey area, he would move swiftly to sign the bill, possibly today.\n\nThere had been misgivings about the new amendment, which had also fuelled speculations on whether or not the president would sign it into law.\n\nThe latest speculation was stoked by rumours that some governors, especially, those of the ruling APC, were not comfortable with the new amendment and had planned to prevail on the president to also veto it, as he did in the last one.\n\nThis is because the harmonised version of the Electoral Bill recently passed by the legislature and considered the final agreed version by both Senate and House of Representatives, had inserted a controversial Clause 84 into the amendment bill.\n\nThe implication of the Clause 84 was that all political appointees in President Buhari\u2019s government would no longer be eligible, either as voting delegates or aspirants during the conventions or congresses of their political parties.\n\nAlso, by the provision at issue, political appointees were further barred from voting as delegates in a convention or seeking nomination in the primaries of their political parties.\n\nUnlike what was obtainable in the past, when most APC ministers and commissioners took leave of absence to contest their party\u2019s primaries and later went back to their jobs after they lost, that grace was no longer available with the new proposal.\n\nAccording to Clause 84 of the recommitted bill, \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\n\n\u201cWhere a political party fails to comply with the provisions of this Act in the conduct of its primaries, its candidate for election shall not be included in the election for the particular position in issue.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of this Act or rules of a political party, an aspirant, who complains that any of the provisions of this Act and guidelines of a political party have not been complied with in the selection or nomination of a candidate of a political party for election, may apply to the Federal High Court for redress.\n\n\u201cNothing in this section shall empower the courts to stop the holding of primaries or general election under this Act, pending the determination of a suit.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, there was a lacuna in the new law, which encouraged infringements on the inalienable rights of citizens to vie for elective offices.\n\nThe Supreme Court had pronounced at different times that any law inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution is ultra vires and, to that extent, null and void.\n\nSources, however, believed that the clause was meant to clip the wings of the governors, who, through appointments, often controlled those who became automatic delegates and determined the outcome of congresses.\n\nSources further claimed that the idea was originally from the House of Representatives, pushed by a principal officer from Lagos as an agenda to serve some interests. The senate was said to have concurred, just to keep the \u201cone house\u201d impression by the National Assembly.\n\nBut the fear being expressed by many was that, with a clause that clearly breached the provision of the constitution, the president might be forced to veto the electoral act amendment bill again, and that if that happened, a new electoral law might not be ready for the 2023 elections, hence the new rapprochement by the president.\n\nBuhari had declined assent to the first amendment bill over the provision of direct primary as the only mode of choosing candidates by political parties.\n\nThe bill earlier passed by the National Assembly on November 18, 2021, provided: \u201cA political party seeking to nominate candidates for elections under this bill shall hold direct primaries for aspirants to all elective positions, which shall be monitored by the commission.\u201d\n\nBut Buhari, in declining assent, disclosed that he would only give assent to the bill if the lawmakers provided options for the conduct of primaries by political parties.\n\nThe president also cited several disadvantages of the provision to the system, including security and possible manipulation by incumbent officeholders, who might be seeking re-election, as well as political parties\u2019 inability to muster funds for it.\n\nBuhari Meets Governors Tomorrow\n\nHowever, the president\u2019s meeting with governors over the national convention tomorrow, was initially scheduled to hold last Tuesday but was called off shortly before the president proceeded on a four-day official visit to Brussels, Belgium, to attend the EU-AU Summit.\n\nSources told THISDAY at the weekend that the rescheduled meeting, which is at the instance of President Buhari, is to look at the national convention of the party fixed for Saturday, February 26, 2022.\n\nSome stakeholders have been pushing for a postponement of the convention citing logistical challenge and planning issues. They pointed out that the February 26 date was no longer feasible. Ultimately however it is the President\u2019s decision to make whether to go ahead or not. And as at this early morning he had not made that call.\n\nThe meeting with the President, which will be led by the Chairman of the Interim Committee of the party and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, with 20 other APC Governors in attendance, would now table another possible date and other logistics for approval by President Buhari.\n\nThe interim leadership of the party was said to be pushing for the convention to be moved by two weeks to mid March but it will have to seek the approval of President Buhari in his capacity as the National leader of the APC.\n\nThis was the same step Buni-led interim committee took last December, when it approached the President to approve the February 26 date, which President Buhari gladly did.\n\nThe same scenario may play out as the President might accede to the extension of the date for the convention being proposed by some of the party leaders.\n\nAPC Governors Meet Tonight\n\nWorried by the turn of events over the national convention of APC, governors elected on the platform of the party are billed to meet tonight in Abuja, to take a final stand on the matter as well as decide whether to go ahead or shift the date of the convention.\n\nSome of the governors, whom THISDAY gathered were unhappy with both the president and party leadership, hinted that the meeting tonight would be the final one on the convention and that the outcome may be unpleasant as a majority of them were ready to go all out.\n\nParty sources, who also hinted at some of the happenings in the APC, however, pointed at the Imo State Governor, Uzodinma and his Kogi State counterpart, Yahaya Bello, as the arrowheads of those pushing for a postponement of the convention.\n\nAccording to party sources, the duo of Uzodinma and Bello, were the ones orchestrating the postponement, because they were said to be comfortable with the current caretaker committee through whom they\u2019ve been able to push many agenda and were therefore striving hard to ensure they stall the convention.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it unfortunate that people, who had no idea how this party came about are the ones causing the current commotion in our party? Can you imagine Hope and Bello holding the party to ransom over completely self-serving reasons, which do not even align with collective interest.\n\n\u201cI hope the meeting of the governors tonight is not going to be where they would throw it all out through the window, because this is absolutely ridiculous. What is the sense in the postponement of the convention, when we can actually tidy up everything in two or three days?\n\n\u201cReally, what do we need to get this done? With a unity list, the convention would be over in no time, because we\u2019d be going only to ratify the list. So, why stalling the entire party and by extension the country?\n\n\u201cWhy is the chairman acting as if he is not in charge? The whole thing is just disappointing and honestly, I\u2019m ashamed how the governors allowed two people without a stake in the party to drive them to this shameful station,\u201d said the party source.\n\nStakeholders Insist Convention Must Go on as Planned\n\nAlready, many stakeholders of the APC had claimed that except the president said otherwise, the proposed national convention of the party was unlikely.\n\nTHISDAY further gathered at the weekend that although some members of the party, who were opposed to the convention holding as scheduled, had begun to shop for an injunction to stop the exercise, the caretaker committee leadership of the party was also ready to go ahead with convention plans nonetheless.\n\nThis is as the youths of the party, under the aegis of Progressive Youth Movement (PYM),had declared their readiness for the APC national convention on February 26, if the caretaker committee could not carry out the task.\n\nAt the same time, some stakeholders in party had listed a few of the factors believed should guide the choice of the new chairman of the party, citing particularly, a corruption-free individual without cases with any of the anti-corruption agencies.\n\nHowever, with the convention not likely to hold again, THISDAY gathered that the only person, who could have approved that the exercise goes on or be postponed at this stage was President Buhari, who unfortunately, has remained quiet about it until the Tuesday meeting was slated.\n\nWhile some members of the party had expressed concerns over the level of preparedness for an exercise that is scheduled to hold this weekend, including the zoning of offices and the sales of nomination form that have yet to take off, THISDAY gathered that all of those would be resolved in no time the moment Buhari gives a direction on the convention.\n\nBut whether or not the president agrees to go ahead with the convention as scheduled for this weekend after tomorrow\u2019s meeting, some members of the party were alleged to have started shopping for an injunction to stop the exercise from holding.\n\nAPC Youths Offer to Assist with Convention\n\nMeanwhile, leader of the Progressive Youth Movement, Mustapha Audu, in an open letter to Buhari, the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), lamented that overriding personal interest had made it impossible to conduct the national convention of the ruling APC.\n\nHe, however, maintained that, \u201cThe country is watching, and Mr. President has been promised a date of February 26th, 2022, for the APC National Convention. Any attempt to move this date shows that there is no regard for honesty or integrity, and this dents our image in the eyes of all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the convention date was decided over two months ago and the caretaker committee has had more than enough time to put its house in order.\n\n\u201cWe want to reassure Mr. President that we, as young stakeholders, stand ready to conduct the National Convention come February 26th 2022 if the current CECPC cannot carry out the task,\u201d the APC youth said, decrying that the schedule of activities released by the caretaker committee for planning towards the conduct of the convention had all been violated.\n\nHe said these included the February 14 sale of forms date, release of zoning arrangements, the return of completed forms, which was supposed to be the deadline date.\n\nHis words: \u201cHolding a convention is not a difficulty as we carried out the previous ward, local government, state congresses and national convention within 12 days in 2018 between May 2nd and May 14th, 2018.\n\n\u201cHowever, the overriding personal interest this time around has unfortunately made it nearly impossible to conduct the national convention in over 20 months since the establishment of the CECPC in June 2020.\u201d\n\nAlso, a document titled: \u201cOur Position On Consensus National Chairman\u201d by some concerned members of the National Executive Committee (NEC) and South-South Emerging Leaders\u2019 Forum (SELF), had stated that the party would converge for the national convention and that the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led committee would hand over the baton of leadership to a set of newly-elected executives.\n\nAccording to the document, members said that their views were no longer needed as executive committee members, notwithstanding the fact that top of the convention\u2019s checklist was the election of a new national chairman, after the controversial suspension of Adams Oshiomhole left a huge vacuum in 2021.\n\n\u201cIn fact, reports from some quarters have attributed to the plethora of internal conflicts and unending chaos at some state branches to the lack of an arrowhead, who will steer the activities of the party.\n\n\u201cTo them, the APC needs a leader, who will bridge the gaps across different ranks of the political group and maintain a cohesive force to retain power in the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cSo, for the sustenance of a zoning arrangement that is workable, the party stalwarts have decided to allow the North-Central zone to produce the next Chairman, thus eliminating Northeasterners and people from other geopolitical zones from the race.\n\n\u201cThis entails that contestants with an edge include Senator Mohammed Sani Musa (Niger State), Senator Umar Tanko Al-Makura (Nasarawa State), Mallam Saliu Mustapha (Kwara State), ex-Governor George Akume (Benue State), Mohammed Etsu (Niger State), Abdullahi Adamu (Nasarawa State) and former Chief Whip of the House of Representatives, Abu Bawa Bwari (Niger State).\n\n\u201cAs Nigeria\u2019s biggest political party shops for a new Chairman, we hereby examine some factors that may determine, who wears the crown from the North Central zone,\u201d the stakeholders said.\n\nAccording to the document under \u201cIntegrity test\u201d, the stakeholders said, \u201cSince the 2023 election is fast approaching, some have said the party may shoot itself in the leg by producing anyone, who has corruption cases hanging around his neck.\u201d\n\nThis, according to the proponents, was to avoid providing the opposition with an opportunity to rubbish the party\u2019s integrity.\n\nThey urged leaders of the party not to elect as chairman, some former governors and individuals, who have been indicted for financial crimes by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and other anti-graft agencies.\n\nThey said it would be out of place for the APC to elect as national chairman and head of the National Working Committee (NWC), a person, who is indicted by the EFCC and other like agencies.\n\nAnother criterion listed is the alleged intra-state rivalry, stating that political observers had contended that the failure of some states to produce a consensus candidate might thwart the chances of some candidates.\n\nThey equally cited the age factor, saying, \u201cIf the words of President Muhammadu Buhari are to be banked on, age might be a factor in the chairmanship race.\u201d\n\nThey argued that the president, while hosting members of the APC National Lobby Group, at the State House, said it was time to give younger elements in the party the benefit to aspire to leadership in the party.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "How Presidency\u2019s Intervention Speeded up Kyari\u2019s Arrest",
          "text": "Micheal Olugbode in Abuja\n\nFresh facts have emerged on the process leading to the arrest of \u201csuper cop\u201d Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Abba Kyari and his subsequent hand over to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) last week.\n\nIn a dramatic move on February 14, NDLEA at a world press conference declared wanted Kyari, who had been suspended from his duties months ago following his indictment by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for alleged involvement with Internet fraudster, Hushpuppi, in cyber-criminal activities.\n\nThe move became necessary following the reluctance by the police high command to accede to the request by the anti-drug agency to release Kyari for interrogation.\n\n\u201cBut for the direct intervention by the presidency after the press conference questioning the delay in arresting and handing over Kyari to the NDLEA, the police high command would probably have continued to dither on the request to hand him over for interrogation,\u201d a presidency source said.\n\nHaving assembled a watertight case, with graphic video evidence, photographs, audio recordings, WhatsApp chats, etc., against Kyari and his men, NDLEA, it was gathered, briefed the president and other persons that needed to know in the presidency of the depth of Kyari\u2019s involvement in the drug ring. After securing the nod of the presidency to move against Kyari, the drug agency approached the Inspector General of Police.\n\nThe source revealed, \u201cThe NDLEA chairman, Mohammed Buba Marwa (retd), went ahead to brief the IGP, who by this time was unaware that the president had been briefed. The IG was presented some of the damning evidence gathered against Kyari and his co-conspirators, urging him to release Kyari to the agency for interrogation.\n\n\u201cThe IGP promised the NDLEA that Kyari was going to be handed over to them on Thursday, February 10, but that did not happen. Friday also came and went, and nothing was done. The drug agency waited all through that weekend, but nothing happened. And Kyari who, apparently, had become aware of the request suddenly became unreachable to the agency.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, Kyari had started calling everyone in the presidency he thought could do something to put pressure on NDLEA to back off from arresting him.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY checks revealed that the press conference by NDLEA was a pre-emptive move following a tip-off to checkmate an alleged plot by the police high-ups to shield the wanted cop from arrest by the anti-drug agency, according sources briefed on the matter.\n\nPresidency sources told THISDAY, \u201cThe NDLEA got intelligence that the police were planning to change the narrative by parading some persons as suspects over the matter. It was when they (NDLEA) got wind of the move that they knew the police wanted to turn the case around. That was why they hurriedly addressed that world press conference last Monday.\n\n\u201cAnd immediately after the media briefing and reactions were pouring from across the world, the presidency called the IGP and directed him to ensure that Kyari was released to the NDLEA immediately. At this stage, the police high-ups who had been shielding Kyari all along knew the game was up and had to arrest him immediately.\u201d\n\nThe erstwhile Commander of Intelligence Response Team (IRT) at the Force Intelligence Bureau of the Nigeria Police was subsequently arrested and handed over to the drug law enforcement agency that Monday evening about 5 pm.\n\nKyari has been accused by the drug-fighting agency of being a member of a drug-dealing cartel that operates the Brazil-Ethiopia-Nigeria illicit drug pipeline.\n\nAlongside Kyari, four other suspects in the matter, namely, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Sunday Ubua; Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Bawa James; Inspector Simon Agirgba; and Inspector John Nuhu are presently being interrogated and further investigation being carried out on their alleged involvement in cocaine dealings, at the headquarters of NDLEA in Abuja.\n\nJohn Umoru, also a key member of the Abba Kyari gang, who goes by the nickname \u201cToo much money\u201d, is presently at large. The Police Service Commission had directed the IGP, Usman Baba, to ensure Umoru\u2019s arrest.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the drug-fighting agency has watertight case backed with solid evidence against Kyari and the others.\n\nKyari, despite being on suspension, was said to have still carried on with his despicable acts. The source disclosed that there were more than 10 audio evidences, five video evidences, and pictures, stressing that what the NDLEA did was a \u201cclean job.\u201d\n\nThe source stated, \u201cThe fact is that Kyari was being shielded from being extradited to the US by the police leadership, which was terrible enough case and worse for a senior police officer to be dealing in cocaine.\n\n\u201cThe modus operandi of Kyari and his men was that once they get information about banned drugs that were imported, such as tramadol, they would impound the items from the importer that brought them into the country and sell them to another cartel. That is, they take from one cartel and go and sell to another.\n\n\u201cHe is a billionaire and we learnt that in his confessional statement he revealed that he owns properties in choice locations in Lagos and Abuja. He owns an estate in Lekki, in Lagos, he has a house in Victoria Island, he has an estate in Asokoro in Abuja, and another estate at Guzape, Abuja, that is to let you know how corrupt this young man, who was on his way to becoming the IGP of the NPF, was.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY checks also revealed that the anti-drug agency last week filed an ex parte action in court to detain Kyari and his men for two weeks to allow it more time to conclude its investigation. He and his conspirators may be charged to court in the next two to three weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, more trouble appears imminent for Kyari, as NDLEA launches a probe into the seizure of a large consignment of Tramadol, an illegal drug, in Lagos.\n\nSources close to NDLEA said Kyari and other had been linked to the alleged seizure of a large consignment of Tramadol in a warehouse at the Amuwo-Odofin area of Lagos. It was gathered that someone who claimed to be a pharmacist imported the consignment worth N3 billion into Nigeria.\n\nIt was learnt that the Inspector General of Police Intelligence Response Team (IRT), allegedly, got information on the consignment and stormed the warehouse where the illegal drug was stocked, leading to the seizure.\n\nSources at NDLEA said the agency ought to have been told of the seizure, which allegedly took place last year, but the Kyari team kept the information from the agency.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that the IRT may have sold the consignment of Tramadol to a cartel after storming the Amuwo Odofin warehouse and seizing the Tramadol,\u201d a source said. \u201cWe have launched a probe into the case with a view to getting to the root of the matter,\u201d the source added.\n\nSpokesman of NDLEA, Mr. Femi Babafemi, said no stone would be left unturned in ensuring that all suspects already in custody and those that might still be indicted in the course of investigation faced the full weight of the law. Babafemi said the war by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari against drug was uncompromising, adding that the on-going case \u201cshowed a sordid connection between law enforcement agents and the drug underworld.\u201d\n\nThe spokesman said the NDLEA had a trove of intelligence, hard facts, from chats to photos and video, and a detailed transcript of the communication between Kyari and officers of the agency.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is disheartening to hear straight from the horse\u2019s mouth the kind of sleaze engaged in by this team of rogue law enforcement agents led by Kyari, the members of whom he described this way: \u2018the boys are very, very sharp, they are very loyal.\u2019\u201d\n\nKyari had solved many criminal cases and was until recently among the most celebrated police officers in the country. But he found himself in troubled waters when he was associated with Hushpuppi\u2019s cybercrime case. An American court ordered his deportation to the United States to be prosecuted along with Abbas Ramon, alias Hushpuppi, a request the Nigerian government was yet to respond to.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u202250,000 jobs created since creation of NOGICD Act, says Wabote\n\n\u2022Local oil firms now produce 60% of Nigeria\u2019s domestic gas\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nFrom a whopping $380 billion loss in capital flight due to the absence of an enabling law for retention of capital in the oil and gas industry, Nigeria currently has an annual in-country retention of $8 billion under the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development (NOGICD) Act. Executive Secretary of Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Mr. Simbi Wabote, stated this in Lagos during a meeting with editors.\n\nWabote revealed that about two million jobs were also lost during the 50 years that the country\u2019s oil and industry operated without a capital retention law. But he said at least 50,000 jobs had so far been created with the implementation of the NOGICD Act.\n\nOver the past 11 years, Wabote stated that the level of Nigerian content in the oil industry, which was about five per cent before the enactment of the act in 2010, had increased to 26 per cent in 2016 and 42 per cent as at December 2021.\n\nHe explained, \u201cBefore now, there was revenue focus with little emphasis on in-country value addition, with massive capital flight of over $380 billion and an estimated two million job loss over a 50-year period, while the local content in the oil and gas industry was less than five per cent.\u201d\n\nWabote explained that NCDMB launched a Nigerian content 10-year strategic roadmap in 2017, with the target to achieve 70 per cent Nigerian content by 2027. As part of this goal, the board, he noted, would catalyse the creation of 300, 000 direct jobs in the oil and gas industry and linkage sectors and enable the retention of $13 billion out of the estimated annual $20 billion spend in the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe NCDMB helmsman hinted that a pointer to the marked improvement in Nigerian content implementation was that the local economy used to retain little or nothing from the annual oil industry spend of $20 billion before the Act. The $8 billion in-country retention per year was possible, according to him, due to the development of critical capacities and assets by local oil and gas service companies and increased domiciliation and domestication of industry operations.\n\nWabote said Nigeria had also moved from near zero participation in the operations side of the oil and gas sector to the point where indigenous operators, such as Seplat, Aiteo, Eroton, and others, were now responsible for 15 per cent of the country\u2019s oil production and 60 per cent of domestic gas supply.\n\nOther major accomplishments of Nigerian content implementation included the establishment of two world-class pipe mills and five pipe coating yards, enabling Nigerian firms to fabricate more than 250,000 tonnes of steel per year, and ownership of more than 40 per cent of marine vessels used in the industry, he stated.\n\nWabote added that over 10 million training man-hours had been delivered via the board\u2019s human capacity development programme, thereby enabling the indigenous workforce to sustain oil production at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.\n\nProviding details of the board\u2019s credit facilities to the oil and gas industry, Wabote said NCDMB had inaugurated a $50 million Nigerian Content Research and Development Fund to drive basic research, commercialisation of research breakthroughs, establishment of research centres of excellence, and sponsorship of university endowments. He added that the board floated a $50 million special loan product for women in the oil and gas business to enable empowerment of the womenfolk in the industry, managed by Nexim (Nigerian Export-Import) Bank, and established another $30 million working capital fund to support oil and gas service companies.\n\nThe NCDMB executive secretary announced that the agency recently secured the approval of its Governing Council to set up a $50 million fund for a manufacturing product line, to be dedicated to companies that would operate in the Nigerian oil and gas parks. He said this was being constructed by the board in Bayelsa and Cross River states, explaining that the beneficiaries of the fund would have to be engaged in the manufacturing of equipment components used in the oil and gas industry and linkage sectors.\n\nWabote stated that NCDMB convened the breakfast meeting with the managements of the media organisations to enable senior members of the media understand the importance of Nigerian content to the economy.\n\nHe added that the COVID-19 pandemic made humanity realise that every economy needed to develop local capacities and capabilities in the core sectors, hence, all hands must now be on deck to push the local content narrative.\n\nHe charged media practitioners to uphold the ethics of the profession, noting that Nigerians depend on the media for many decisions.\n\nHowever, Wabote regretted that some online media platforms were undermining the federal government\u2019s intentions of bringing in technocrats and professionals to serve as appointees through targeted and unwarranted attacks.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Manager, Corporate Communications, NCDMB, Mr. Esueme Kikile, noted that media practitioners were key partners in the implementation of the NOGICD Act. Kikile solicited the support of the media to curb the incidence of fake news and libellous publications.\n\nHe assured the media of the board\u2019s continuous partnership and support.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Lasun Yusuff and a former Secretary to the State Government, Adeoti.\n\nAnnouncing the result in the early hours of today, at the state\u2019s APC secretariat in Osogbo, the Chairman of Osun APC Primary Election Committee and Kwara State Governor, Mr. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, said accredited voters were 247,207 while the total number of votes cast was 235,550.\n\nOyetola polled 222,169 votes to beat Aregbesola\u2019s candidate, Adeoti, who scored 12,921, while Lasun came a distant third with 460 votes.\n\nBefore the primary election, Aregbesola had attacked Oyetola\u2019s main backer and his estranged godfather, Tinubu, telling him that the same treatment meted out to a former Lagos State governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, which foreclosed his re-election bid in 2019, would be administered on his brother, Oyetola.\n\nHowever, Aregbesola was absent from the primary election and was said to have left Ilesa for Abuja yesterday morning for unspecified official duty.\n\nWhile the minister has threatened to explore legal means to obtain justice, alleging that the results of the primary election were \u201cfarcically counted in favour of the governor,\u201d Adeoti has vowed to seek Oyetola\u2019s disqualification in court.\n\nReacting to the election in a statement issued in Osogbo, the state capital yesterday, Adeoti vowed to head to court to challenge what he referred to as \u201cpyrrhic victory\u201d won by Oyetola.\n\nHe accused the governor of rigging the election with the apparent backing of the National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party.\n\nAdeoti said the ugly development in Osun APC has sent a wrong signal as to whether the APC has a future in the state.\n\nHe also accused Oyetola of using intimidation and violence to ensure that the primary election was not free and fair.\n\n\u201dThere was violence in Olorunda Local Government where the Ward 3 Chairman of the Rasaq Salinsile-led APC in Olorunda Local government, Mr. Sala Ademola and his secretary, Mr. Ajisefini were kidnapped. Our supporters were also disenfranchised in all the wards in Ife East by not being accredited and being intimidated with thugs wielding dangerous weapons.\u201d\n\nHe also accused a top chieftain of APC of taking over the electioneering process in Ife and halting the accreditation process, sending out his supporter using thugs, while allowing and counting party members from the governor\u2019s group.\n\nThe APC governorship aspirant also alleged that the Osun State government procured the services of armed policemen who aided the well-choreographed rigging of the election.\n\n\u201dThere was also a massive influx of unregistered members of the party who voted with the connivance of the heavily-compromised National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, of which Oyetola is a member. Overall, there was a massive disenfranchisement of registered APC members in all my strongholds during the so-called primary election.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that there was no way any primary election conducted in the state would be fair if Oyetola remains a member of the CECPC.\n\n\u201cGovernor Oyetola\u2019s membership of the NCECPC is against the democratic norms. We dare say that this is capable of causing disquiet, more than we are facing in Osun APC now, if allowed to pass us by.\n\n\u201cWe are reliably informed that Governor Oyetola is the one who hand-picked the Chairman and members of the primary election committee. It is within human reasonability not to trust such handpicked committee by an interested party member. Such committee would never be fair to other contenders.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, express absolute opposition to the outcome of the election because they were chosen by Governor Oyetola. There can only be point of convergence for us if Governor Oyetola could resign his membership and the process of conducting the primary begins afresh,\u201d Adeoti explained.\n\nAdeoti argued that Oyetola\u2019s participation in the election was a violation of the provision of Article 31(iii) of the APC Constitution (2014) as amended which says: \u201cAny party office holder interested in contesting for an elective office (whether party office or office in a general election) shall resign and leave office 30 days prior to the date of nomination or party primary for office he or she is seeking to contest\u201d.\n\nHe said the process had been orchestrated from the beginning to manipulate the outcome in favour of Oyetola, which was why the date of the primary was changed from March 5 to February 19.\n\n\u201cWe have it on good authority that the NCECPC was influenced by Oyetola to reverse the date to have the primary before the National Convention scheduled to hold on February 26, 2022. It is believed that Oyetola is afraid of contesting a free and fair primary election to be conducted by an objective committee after a neutral leadership of the party would have emerged,\u201d Adeoti alleged.\n\nHe however appealed to his supporters to be calm, vowing to seek a legal redress.\n\nAlso reacting in a statement by his media\u2019s aide, Mr. Sola Fasure, the interior minister and Adeoti\u2019s main backer alleged that the results of the governorship primary were \u201cfarcically counted in favour of the governor.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have received and continue to receive the reports of the shenanigans of the officials who conducted the sham of an election.\n\n\u201cWe have been inundated with reports state-wide of how your names were expunged from the party\u2019s voters\u2019 register, which was not made available until this morning, contrary to the convention of making the list available to the candidates before the election.\n\n\u201cWe have heard of how party registration cards were being hawked this morning to the supporters of the state governor.\n\n\u201cYou are urged not to take laws into your hands. Please leave the rest to the Almighty God and let us explore all peaceful and legal means for addressing the matter in order to obtain justice,\u201d Aregbesola explained.\n\nThe Publicity Secretary of the Aregbesola-backed faction of the party in the state, Mr. Abiodun Agboola, in a statement issued, said: \u201cWe strongly condemned the conduct of the primary election because it is nothing but a sham with a fraudulent process to favour Governor Adegboyega Oyetola\u201d.\n\nHe alleged that there were no records and result sheets in any of the 332 wards of the state.\n\nThe Chairman of the anti-Oyetola faction of the party in the state, Mr. Rasaq Salinsile, who is from Ward 04, Isale-Oba in Iwo Local Government Area also told THISDAY that the election was fraudulent.\n\nOyetola had expressed confidence that he would emerge victorious in the primary election.\n\nThe governor, who applauded the members of the party for turning out in large number said, \u201closing was not an option for a man commissioned by God for an assignment.\u201d\n\nOyetola spoke shortly after he cast his vote at Ward 1, Boripe Local Government Area, Iragbiji.\n\nHe lauded Osun people for conducting themselves peacefully, saying the peaceful conduct of the election has testified to the fact that Osun remains the most peaceful state in the country.\n\nThe governor noted that news of violence making the rounds were mere speculations.\n\n\u201cI just want to appeal to all our people across the state to maintain peace. Election process should not be a battlefield or a do-or-die affair. Let everyone exercise his/her right to choose in determining who represents them at the party level and ultimately at the general election,\u201d Oyetola added.\n\nAlso commenting on the election, the Chairman of Osun APC Governorship Primary and Kwara State Governor, AbdulRazak, also hailed the peaceful conduct of the exercise.\n\nHe applauded APC members for the huge turnout and their peaceful conduct.\n\nHe spoke with journalists after monitoring the election in Iragbiji, the hometown of Governor Oyetola.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf you open the pages of newspapers today, what was painted was a picture of the war in Osun. But the primaries election has been peaceful. I congratulate the people of Osun and all the aspirants. They have all done well.\u201d\n\nBuhari, APC Govs to Decide New Date for National Convention\n\nMeanwhile, President Buhari and the governors elected on the platform of the APC will decide a new date for the party\u2019s National Convention.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that this development followed the clash of the February 26 proposed date for the exercise with some off-season elections earlier scheduled by the INEC.\n\nA source close to the APC National Caretaker Committee told THISDAY at the weekend that the clash of the proposed convention with the national elections was brought to the attention of the party after it had written to notify INEC of its intention to hold the national convention.\n\n\u201cElections are national issues that cut across political parties and therefore, it is not expected that party affairs should overshadow national elections. The stakeholders will meet and come up with a new date not beyond two to three weeks,\u201d the source explained\n\nOn whether INEC has been notified, the source said that the electoral body would be notified after the proposed meeting between Buhari, the APC governors and the members of the caretaker committee.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

From our investigation, the hemp is worth N200m in the market. The suspects were traced with two of the 17 boats that were recently donated to us.\n\n\u201cThey were apprehended when they ran out of fuel and one of them strolled into the country to get fuel. It was then our officers descended on them.\n\n\u201cThough it was not in the jurisdiction of the agency to delve into drug matters, but the interwoven connectivity between drug addiction and government\u2019s critical infrastructures necessitated the arrest.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the agency also paraded three young men; vandals of armored cables in Ikeja.\n\nThe suspects, Rahman, Taiwo and Amon, residents of the area, were said to have been terrorising the state capital for over two years.",

And the answer wasn\u2019t far-fetched in the huge amounts that went into fuel subsidy for the period,\u201d SBM Intel said.\n\nIn a bid to keep fuel prices down, the federal government continues to cater for petrol subsidies which have continued to rise over the years.\n\n\u201cTo retain the pump fuel price at N145 in 2017, the NNPC had said that it spent N144.53 billion in subsidising petrol, whereas transport cost ranged from N122 to N138, an obvious rise. In fact, fuel price decreased by $0.06,\u201d it added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt said between 2017 and 2018, the cost of fuel subsidy had increased by a whopping 405% yet fuel price remained constant all through.\n\nBy 2019, the cost reduced by 25%, but the decrease is insignificant in comparison with the initial 405% increase.\n\nFurthermore, it noted that 2020 saw an alarming spike as the government incurred N1.192 trillion on subsidy, more than double the cost for 2019.\n\nBy 2021, subsidy had gulped N1.43 trillion, a stunning rise of 890%, over the five years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe NNPC had requested N3 trillion from the government to fund the subsidy this year, after the FG shelved plans to \u201cwithdraw subsidy by January 2022 as demanded by the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), which was signed into law in August 2021\u201d.\n\nOn the other hand, the price paid by Nigerians at the pump \u201conly rose from N145/litre to N165/litre between January 2017 and December 2021, an increase of 12.1%. In dollar terms, the price of petrol even dropped from $0.49 in January 2017 to $0.40 in December 2021\u201d.\n\nThe firm said even though the price of petrol has only risen slightly in that period, transportation costs across Nigeria have risen more significantly.\n\n\u201cBy November 2018, transport cost had risen to N192.46, a 12% increase over the price in December 2017, yet fuel price remained constant all through,\u201d it said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBetween December 2018 and December 2019, the cost of transport further increased by 36%, with no change in fuel price.\n\n\u201cBetween December 2019 and May 2020, cost of transport spiked by 208%, the highest increase within 2017 and 2020. This was at a time when the country was hit by COVID-19.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAround this time (April to June 2020), petrol price was reduced to N125, yet transport cost didn\u2019t reduce. Instead, it skyrocketed to N611.92 in May 2020.\u201d\n\nAccording to the research firm, this confirms that transport cost in Nigeria is not driven solely by fuel price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn July and August 2020, fuel price returned to the initial N145, and by September, it sold for N162 and remained constant for the rest of the year,\u201d SBM Intel said.\n\n\u201cBut interestingly, transport cost kept increasing monthly. It never remained constant. By the end of 2020, the cost of fuel subsidy amounted to N1.192 trillion, more than double the cost for 2019.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the cost of transport as of December 2020 had doubled what it was as at January 2019.

Instead, it skyrocketed to N611.92 in May 2020.\u201d\n\nAccording to the research firm, this confirms that transport cost in Nigeria is not driven solely by fuel price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn July and August 2020, fuel price returned to the initial N145, and by September, it sold for N162 and remained constant for the rest of the year,\u201d SBM Intel said.\n\n\u201cBut interestingly, transport cost kept increasing monthly. It never remained constant. By the end of 2020, the cost of fuel subsidy amounted to N1.192 trillion, more than double the cost for 2019.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the cost of transport as of December 2020 had doubled what it was as at January 2019. Between 2020 and 2021, fuel subsidy cost increased by almost 20%, transport cost increased by a corresponding 33% while fuel price increased at a meagre 1.8%.\u201d",
          "summary": "SBM Intelligence, a geopolitical research firm, says despite petrol subsidy payments, transport costs and petrol prices increased disproportionally from 2017 to 2021.\nSBM said this in a new report by the research firm titled \u2018Growing Fuel Subsidy and Transport Costs: Which Way Forward, Nigeria?\u2019It said over five years, petrol prices increased by 12.1%, petrol subsidy by 890% and transport cost by 283%.\nAnd the answer wasn\u2019t far-fetched in the huge amounts that went into fuel subsidy for the period,\u201d SBM Intel said.\nAdvertisement\u201cAround this time (April to June 2020), petrol price was reduced to N125, yet transport cost didn\u2019t reduce.\nBetween 2020 and 2021, fuel subsidy cost increased by almost 20%, transport cost increased by a corresponding 33% while fuel price increased at a meagre 1.8%.\u201d",

          "text": "Pan-African fintech firm Flutterwave on Friday announced a rebrand of its logo and dashboard as well as the addition of small business lending, fintech-as-a-service (FaaS), and more to its suite of offerings.\n\nThe announcement comes 2 days after Flutterwave confirmed it had raised $250 million in a Series D round that tripled the company\u2019s valuation to over $3 billion. Led by founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, the company facilitates cross-border payments transactions of small-to-large businesses in Africa via one API.\n\nIn a virtual event themed \u201cFlutterwave 3.0\u201d, Africa\u2019s most valuable startup and payments giant rolled out a series of products and services including FaaS services for embedded finance, SME loans for its users, card issuance for a wide array of clients while announcing the addition of Apple Pay and Google Pay to its payment options.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFlutterwave Capital, the new SME loans product, is offered in partnership with the company\u2019s lending partners\u2014CashConnect Microfinance Bank, MoneyWise Microfinance Bank, Wema Bank, Zenith Bank, Stanbic IBTC Bank, and Sterling Bank.\n\nThe new product will enable businesses \u201ceasily access loans without collateral, cumbersome documentation, and other stringent terms and conditions,\u201d a blog post on Flutterwave\u2019s website reads, adding that eligible applicants can access the funds they need in less than 2 business days.\n\n\u201cWith Flutterwave Capital, we\u2019re making it easier for business owners to access the funds they require to grow their businesses. Business owners can expand, increase inventory, hire more labour, pay bills, run marketing campaigns, and ultimately grow revenue with these funds,\u201d the company said.\n\nCurrently, only Flutterwave businesses in Nigeria can access loans but the company says it is working to make it available to its businesses in South Africa, Kenya, and other markets where it operates.\n\nAs regards the fintech-as-a-service solution, Flutterwave is opening up its infrastructure to allow other companies to use its APIs to embed financial capabilities into their existing applications, products, and services.\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s FaaS service provides a unified tech stack that includes KYC, account opening, debit card issuance, payments, and real-time transfers through a single endpoint, account servicing, and compliance.\n\nThe solution helps companies bypass the often gruelling work of building the infrastructure, integrating multiple, disparate financial systems, licensing, and compliance required in building and offering consumers digital financial services.\n\nFlutterwave also helps businesses outside Africa expand their operations on the continent with an international clientele that includes Booking.com, Flywire, and Uber.\n\nThe new set of offerings and features is in line with Flutterwave\u2019s ambitious product expansion drive. Last year, the company launched Flutterwave Market for merchants to sell their goods via an online marketplace and, most recently, Send, a remittance service that empowers customers to seamlessly send money to recipients to and from Africa.\n\nIn March 2021, the San Francisco-headquartered and Lagos-based startup raised $170 million in a Series C round at a valuation of $1 billion. The latest financing thus brings its total investments secured since launched in 2016 to $475 million (plus a $35 million Series B in 2020 and a $20 million Series A in 2018).\n\nThe $3 billion valuation sees Flutterwave surpass the $2 billion mark set by SoftBank-backed fintech OPay and FTX-backed cross-border payments platform Chipper Cash last year.\n\nCurrently, Flutterwave has an infrastructure reach across 34 countries on the continent and processes 200 million transactions worth more than $16 billion. More than 900,000 businesses globally use its solution to process payments in 150 currencies and across different payment modes: local and international cards, mobile wallets, bank transfers, and its consumer product Barter, which now allows for multicurrency wallets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Crypto crime grows to $14 billion as crypto popularity increases",
          "text": "In 2021, crypto criminals made a killing, as illicit crypto transactions hit $14 billion, a 79% jump from the $7.8 billion recorded in 2020, according to a report by US-based blockchain analytics company, Chainalysis.\n\nThe growth in illicit crypto transactions is attributed to a 567% jump in overall transaction volume in 2021. Given that overall crypto transactions grew to $15.8 trillion in 2021, it is not surprising that cybercriminals are increasingly using crypto. Despite the increase in the total volume of illicit transactions, illicit transactions represented just 0.15% of the total cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2021\u2014its lowest ever. What this means is that legitimate crypto transactions far outstrip illegal transactions.\n\nScams and theft ranked as the highest source of crypto crime and decentralised finance (DeFi) contributed most part of the funds stolen, the report shows. Scamming revenue jumped 82% to $7.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen from victims. Over $2.8 billion of this total were stolen through a new type of scam called \u201crug pull\u201d. A rug pull is a type of scam where developers disappear with the money invested in crypto projects or exchanges that appear legitimate.\n\nCryptocurrency theft also jumped 516% to roughly $3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen in 2021. With 72% or 2.2 billion of those funds stolen from DeFi protocols.\n\nDeFi is a term for a financial ecosystem of tools and applications running on any blockchain that allows an individual to pay, lend, borrow, or store funds without intermediaries such as traditional financial banks.\n\nDeFi saw the biggest year-on-year growth\u20141,964%\u2014for laundering activities, while mining comes second place at less than 500% growth. The Chainalysis report attributed this growth to the hype around the DeFi space: incredible returns on decentralised tokens like Shiba Inu, which encourages people to speculate on DeFi tokens, and the ease of creating DeFi tokens\u2014all of which caused its transaction volume to grow by 912% in 2021.\n\nWhile Chainalysis acknowledges the huge opportunities DeFi presents to crypto users and entrepreneurs, it believes widespread theft and scamming will not allow it to realise its full potential. It suggested that the public and private sectors should engage in communication to teach investors how to avoid dubious projects. Although it noted that, as a long term strategy, the industry may need to prevent \u201ctokens associated with potentially fraudulent or unsafe projects from being listed on major exchanges\u201d.\n\nApart from crypto-based transactions or revenue, the Chainalysis report also shows that the volume of cryptocurrency owned by addresses on the blockchain that it has traced to criminal actors has increased from $3 to $11 billion. This data is important, Chainalysis noted, because it represents how much can be theoretically retrieved by law enforcement agencies. Stolen funds accounted for 93% of such criminal balances, at $9.8 billion; followed by Darknet market funds at $448 million; scams at $192 million; fraud shops at $66 million; and ransomware at $30 million.\n\nIn a separate analysis by Chainalysis, in the same report, 4,068 criminal whales hold over $25 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Chainalysis describes a criminal crypto whale as any private wallet holding $1 million or more worth of cryptocurrency that has received more than 10% of its funds from illicit addresses. It is important to note that the above figure of criminal whale balance won\u2019t align with the overall criminal balance because it calculates all the holdings in the private wallet (both legal and illegal) while the overall criminal balance calculates only holdings of addresses tagged as illicit. Criminal whales represent just 3.7% of all cryptocurrency whales\u2014private wallets holding over $1 million worth of cryptocurrency.\n\nDespite the massive increase in crypto crime, a positive development is the growing ability of law enforcement agencies to seize illicit cryptocurrency from criminals. For example, America\u2019s Internal Revenue Service criminal investigation (IRS-CI) seized, over the course of 2021, over $3.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Also in the US, the Department of Justice (DOJ) also seized $2.3 million worth of cryptocurrency from the operators of DarkSide ransomware, responsible for the attack on Colonial Pipeline. London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) seized \u00a3180 million worth of cryptocurrency from a suspected money launderer.\n\nEarlier this month, the United States arrested and charged a couple, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, for allegedly conspiring to launder stolen cryptocurrency worth 119,754 bitcoin, which is now worth an estimated $4.5 billion. The couple had allegedly laundered the bitcoin stolen in the 2016 hack of cryptocurrency exchange, Bitfinex, but the stolen bitcoin were worth $74 million at the time, a tiny fraction of their current value. The US Justice Department was able to recover more than $3.6 billion of the laundered $4.5 billion worth of bitcoin, despite the couple\u2019s sophisticated laundering technique that saw them shuffle the funds using crypto tools and techniques like unhosted wallets, a darknet marketplace, chain hooping, peel chain, and privacy coin. The agency has labelled the operation its largest financial seizure ever.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day,\n\nIn the last few weeks, on every social media platform I use \u2014 mainly Twitter and WhatsApp \u2014 one of the first things I see is \u201cWordle 2/6\u201d or \u201cWordle 1/6\u201d, followed by some green, yellow, and white squares.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong; I\u2019m not hating or anything, but I\u2019m not a huge fan of Wordle or the other variants springing up like quordle, octordle, and semantle.\n\nAnd with new ownership comes some changes. In January 2022, The New York Times acquired Wordle from the creator, Josh Wardle, for an undisclosed sum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo far, there\u2019s been screening of \u201coffensive words\u201d and what appears to be significantly more ad-tracking. At least the game is still free, though.\n\nMeanwhile, on Friday, February 18, 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the first six countries to receive the technology needed to produce mRNA vaccines in Africa. Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, and Tunisia are the chosen ones.\n\nOn to today\u2019s Digest; we\u2019ll be discussing the WHO\u2019s announcement and:\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s wave of announcements\n\nGoogle\u2019s Privacy Sandbox getting extended to Android\n\nAn ambitious wave of products\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing its $250 million Series D announcement on Wednesday, February 16, 2022, African fintech startup Flutterwave has revealed several new products and features.\n\nOn Friday, February 18, 2022, it revealed this at its virtual event, Flutterwave 3.0. It also announced a rebrand of its logo and dashboard.\n\nOne of the products is its Fintech as a Service (FaaS) \u2014 enabling businesses to automatically embed financial services into their product. It also introduced Flutterwave Capital which would provide loans for its merchants.\n\nOther products and services include card issuance \u2014 physical for Nigerian residents and virtual for others \u2014 and Flutterwave Grow to help businesses incorporate across Africa.\n\nFlutterwave-acquired Disha was not left out, with creatives now able to receive payments via their links.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis seems quite ambitious, but it does spell some exciting times in the African fintech ecosystem.\n\nBalancing privacy and profit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit: Visual Content Flickr via Compfight cc\n\nLast year, in April, Apple introduced its App Tracking Transparency (ATT) privacy policy which meant app developers had to explicitly seek the consent of users to use the company\u2019s Identifiers for Advertisers (IDFA). In other words, users permission must be sought before their data can be tracked.\n\nThere were mixed reactions to this. According to the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority\u2019s Mobile ecosystems market study interim report published in December 2021, Apple said organisations like Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and makers of Firefox, a free and open-source browser, Mozilla supported this decision.\n\nOther parties projected that it would cause a fall in revenue for companies reliant on IDFA to measure and attribute for iOS mobile advertising campaigns. Basically, companies like Meta (formerly Facebook), Google, Snapchat, and Twitter that need advertising revenue were more likely to be affected.\n\nThere was also a likelihood that small businesses that rely on these platforms for advertising would be affected as well.\n\nIn February 2021, Meta took out full-page ads in the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal, claiming it was protesting for \u201csmall businesses everywhere.\u201d Financial Times revealed that Meta, Snapchat, Twitter, and YouTube lost $10 billion in revenue once Twitter implemented the ATT more than seven months later.\n\nOn Wednesday, February 16, 2022, Google announced that it would be toeing Apple\u2019s line and introducing privacy limitations to cover apps on its Android smartphones, extending its previous decision to do the same on its Chrome browser.\n\nIn its blog post, Google said, \u201cToday, we\u2019re announcing a multi-year initiative to build the Privacy Sandbox on Android, with the goal of introducing new, more private advertising solutions. Specifically, these solutions will limit sharing of user data with third parties and operate without cross-app identifiers, including advertising ID.\u201d\n\nWhile there is no clear-cut explanation of how this would work yet, the company said it would be working closely with the industry and regulators to \u201cimprove user privacy without putting access to free content and services at risk.\u201d\n\nIt would be interesting to see how this works considering the competing interests of privacy and profit-making. You can also watch out for a Privacy Roundtable explainer this Thursday.\n\nAfrica-produced mRNA vaccines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve all probably heard a lot more about vaccines in the last couple of years than we thought we would in our lifetime. But the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has broadened our knowledge. Currently, two of the world\u2019s most effective COVID-19 vaccines are messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo, but an mRNA is a single-stranded RNA molecule that is complementary to one of the DNA strands of a gene. mRNA vaccines use mRNA created in a laboratory to teach our cells how to make a protein \u2014 or even just a piece of a protein \u2014 that triggers an immune response inside our bodies.\n\nOn Friday, February 18, 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the first six countries to receive the technology needed to produce mRNA vaccines in Africa. They are Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, and Tunisia.\n\nThis comes after the work being done by the WHO to establish a global technology transfer hub in South Africa to serve low and middle-income countries. Africa suffers from a shortage of biotech facilities, and while health tech is slowly gaining momentum, much of the focus still remains on access to primary healthcare and insurance.\n\nWhat you might have missed last week\n\nWhat I\u2019m listening to/reading/watching\n\nThis weekend, listening to early Linkin Park reminded me why heavy metal is not particularly my scene.

Please, leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nSolving critical bankend freight industry challenges\n\nEarnipay\u2019s plans to reach 200,000 employees\n\nSolving critical backend freight industry challenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all know Africa lags in terms of modern technology adoption. For example, some freight companies in Africa still manage their shipments using outdated methods like spreadsheets, phone calls, and emails.\n\nFor most of them, multiple software platforms are used to complete various tasks. However, some platforms combine these software to make their work easier, faster, and more effective.\n\nOne of such companies is Freterium, a Moroccan startup that offers a single software that serves multiple functions. And this company has announced $4 million in seed funding to expand across the country and into neighbouring regions.\n\nPartech, a San Francisco-based investor, led the round. CDG Invest, Y Combinator, Flexport, Swiss Founders Fund, Outlierz Ventures, and a few angel investors from the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa were among those who took part.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Mehdi Cherif Alami (CEO) and Omar El Kouhene (CPO), the company creates a comprehensive approach to addressing critical backend challenges in the freight industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Alami, Freterium onboarded more than 20 enterprise customers in its first full year of operation, growing 35% month over month. Over 3,000 people also use its software.\n\nHe also said that the funds would be used to invest in the company\u2019s research & development activities, hire more talent to double the current size of its team within the next 12 months, market its software, and expand across Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.\n\nEarnipay\u2019s plans to reach 200,000 employees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarnipay, a fintech solution startup that provides income-earners with flexible and on-demand salary access, has raised $4 million in a seed round to provide on-demand salaries to African employees.\n\nThe round was led by VC, Canaan. It also saw participation from XYZ Ventures, Village Global, Musha Ventures, Ventures Platform, Voltron Capital, and Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade.\n\nNonso Onwuzulike officially launched the company in January 2022 to improve employees\u2019 financial well-being. It accomplishes this by utilising technology to allow employees to deposit their paychecks into their accounts in a flexible, real-time, and interest-free manner.\n\nEarnipay collaborates with employers and integrates seamlessly with their payroll systems to provide its services to employees, who can then track and withdraw their accrued salaries via the app.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the company will use the seed funding to speed up the development of its platform to serve large enterprise employers. It will also provide employees with the tools to make better financial decisions and improve their quality of life.\n\nBy the end of 2022, the company plans to offer its on-demand salary solution to 200,000 employees.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nMost people with EUPD/BPD aren\u2019t manipulative \u2013 but often those around us can be.

But Meta says it has to process data across continents because it is crucial for ad targeting.\n\nAd targeting or not, the European leaders are very adamant about the new rule. Germany\u2019s new economy minister Robert Habeck said, \u201cAfter I was hacked, I have lived without Facebook and Twitter for four years, and life has been fantastic.\u201d\n\nMeta could be on the receiving end of its threat to the EU as it closed with a market cap below $600 billion on February 8, 2022, losing daily active users for the first time in its 18 year existence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, we\u2019re discussing:\n\nWhy female founders should learn the venture capital game\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s $3bn valuation\n\nCrowdForce\u2019s $3.6m pre-Series A\n\nWomen should play the VC game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, women got less than 1% of startup funding. Sadly, the statistics have been quite similar in previous years.\n\nWhy is it this way? \u201cGetting funded is a bit of a game.\u201d \u2014 the words of Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures.\n\nAccording to her, women need to learn the rules of the VC game and know what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nEnygma Ventures has spent two years teaching women what venture funding requires. Dusek started the firm when she realised how difficult it was for women to access capital.\n\nIn her chat with Chimgozirim, she detailed the rules and tactics that could mean better odds for women in winning the venture capital game. Read all about it here: Female founders need to learn how to play the venture capital game\u2013 Sarah Dusek\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s $3bn valuation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlutterwave has come a long way since it was founded in 2016. The San Francisco-headquartered fintech startup broke into unicorn status last year after a $170 million raise led by New York-based private investment firm Avenir Growth Capital and US hedge fund and investment firm Tiger Global.\n\nIn just 12 months, Flutterwave has tripled that valuation after a $250 million Series D raise announced yesterday, February 16, 2022. The raise was led by global investment firm, B Capital. Leader of its $170 million Series C. Avenir Growth also participated in the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTripling its valuation isn\u2019t the only thing the fintech company has achieved since attaining unicorn status 12 months ago. Businesses using its platform have increased by 610,000 \u2014 290,000 to 900,000.\n\nIts total transaction, valued at $9 billion last year, has grown to $16 billion with 200 million transactions processed.\n\nAlthough Flutterwave started out as an enterprise payment fintech startup, it has detoured into creating fintech products for small and medium businesses and remittance products over the years.\n\nIn 2020 we saw the launch of Flutterwave Store revamped to Flutterwave Market in 2021. The platform now boasts 30,000 merchants according to TechCrunch. Flutterwave\u2019s remittance service, Send, also launched recently to help customers send money within and outside Africa.\n\nAway from fintech: Flutterwave also displayed interest in the creator economy with the acquisition of Disha, a platform that allows creators to curate content and receive payment. However, the payments feature still falls within Flutterwave\u2019s court.\n\nIPO insight? If you\u2019re planning on investing in Flutterwave via stocks the CEO and Co-Founder, Olugbenga Agboola, told TechCrunch that the startup has no plan to IPO anytime soon. The funding will be geared towards its ambitious expansion plans and rapid customer acquisition.\n\nIf you want to go down memory lane before Flutterwave became a mammoth in the African tech space, you can start with the story of Agboola\u2019s first day as CEO.\n\nPlease read here: In conversation with Olugbenga Agboola on his first day as Flutterwave CEO\n\nCrowdForce\u2019s $3.6m pre-Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions to financial inclusion most times comes in two ways online or offline. However, some people, like Twitter user, Mudia, are of the opinion that the former isn\u2019t true financial inclusion. Mudia sums up his opinion up in a tweet that reads,\n\n\u201cBanking the un-banked, but your solution na app wey dey work from Android 11 upwards.\u201d\n\nMost people with a similar stance believe a solution to financial inclusion that requires a smartphone isn\u2019t practical as most smartphone users are already banked. According to Dataphyte, a media research and data analytics organisation, 38 million Nigerians were financially excluded in 2020.\n\nFintech startups like OPay and TeamApt are tackling the problem with agent banking, taking physical banking services to hard-to-reach locations.\n\nHowever, these agents still need banks to get cash, and that\u2019s where CrowdForce, which announced its $3.6 million pre-Series A yesterday comes in.\n\nThe startup offers agency banking services like OPay and TeamApt, but agents do not need to visit banks to get cash. It solves this problem by partnering with cash-heavy small businesses like fuel stations, converts them to mobile bank branches and stores their cash on PayForce digital wallet, its flagship product.\n\nCrowdForce has partnered with 19,000 fuel stations to broaden its network.

          "title": "Unceasing import substitution policy worsens Nigeria\u2019s economic woes",
          "text": "Faced with spiraling inflation, a weak currency due to a high import bill incurred by Nigerians and low non-oil export, the Nigerian government for decades has resorted to an import substitution policy geared primarily towards curtailing a dependency on foreign products using a host of restrictive policy tools like tariffs, bans and quotas \u2013 still \u2013 the manufacturing sector that should lead Nigeria\u2019s industrialization strategy remains handicapped and largely unable to take up this role in a renewed drive for self-sufficiency and foreign exchange revenue generation that is desperately required to enable the country rub shoulders with emerging economies like China and South Korea.\n\nThe protection of the infant industry, foreign competition, and the containment of the menace of dumping were other arguments advanced by successive Nigerian governments for the adoption of an import substitution policy whose history dates back to the 1970s with the promulgation of the Indigenization Decree that spurred industrialization leading to the establishments of white elephant projects \u2013 petrochemical plants, iron and steel industries, textile, breweries, agriculture and automobile industries to mention amongst others.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), Foreign Trade Statistics report, the import spend of the country has been on the rise for the past 6 years despite the host of protectionist policies and trade barriers that have been mounted by the government in a bid to reduce the dependence of foreign goods. Also, trade with ECOWAS nations and other African nations has not risen as much as trade with other African nations has.\n\nThe value of total imports into the country in 2016 was N8.81 trillion. In 2017, this value rose to N9.96 trillion and then to N13 trillion, N16 trillion, and N19 trillion in years 2018, 2019, and 2020 respectively.\n\nThe Financial Derivatives Company (FDC) says that in 2015, Nigeria spent approximately N1.6 trillion on importing \u201cboiler, machinery, appliances\u201d, N1.3 trillion on \u201cmineral products\u201d and over N600 billion on \u201cvehicles, aircraft and associated parts\u201d. Spending such huge amounts to import has led to a dearth in local manufacturing and a steep decline in the foreign exchange earnings conserved.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, economic and policy experts have often argued that a restrictive policy like import substitution that is protectionist is only inward and not outward-looking and thus does little to advance the long-term goals of export promotion that is adjudged the solution to the economic woes that have befallen the nation.\n\nRenowned trade lawyer, political economist, and policy expert \u2013 Olu Fasan says that the concurrent adoption of import substitution and export promotion policies is contradictory and in fact impossible and has advised the Nigerian Government to expunge its practice.\n\n\u201cImport-substitution industrialization is a tried, tested, and failed policy. We should stop hankering after it. Hardly any country has ever industrialized and achieved sustained economic growth on the back of such a highly protectionist economy. The industrial revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries was accompanied by Britain\u2019s unilateral free trade policy. In recent times, closed economies had to open up to become competitive. For instance, China joined the WTO, and, following its accession in 2001, its simple average tariff fell from about 40 percent in 1985 to under 10 percent in 2014.\u201d\n\nThe African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AFCFTA) came into force with the commencement of trading on January 6th 2021. Touted today as the greatest promise to intra African and bilateral trade with a promise to double the size of Africa\u2019s manufacturing sector to an annual output of $1 trillion by 2025 and create over 14 million jobs, Nigeria nevertheless faces a huge challenge in tapping into its prospects due to a tight trade restriction with her neighbors.\n\nThe United Nations (UN) says that irrespective of the fact that \u201c45 African countries have signed the AFCFTApact, and 36 African Union member states deposited their instrument of ratification, only 3 African countries \u2013 Ghana, South Africa, and Egypt have met the custom requirements on infrastructure for trading.\u201d. This means that Nigeria as of now is yet to commence trading under the AFCFTA.\n\nMore worrisome is a debilitating and incessant border closure policy that has stifled trade with fellow African nations for years thus promoting the menace of smuggling.\n\nThe President of the ADB \u2013 Akinwunmi Adesina also says that \u201cThe Africa Continental Free Trade Area presents a huge opportunity for Nigeria to drive an export-driven industrial manufacturing pathway. The in-ward looking import-substitution plans that have been pursued over time, ensured that local industries were unprepared when the continental free trade area was established.\n\nSome of the concerns were legitimate, especially the challenge of dumping illegal imports into Nigeria, which has a direct effect on the profitability of local industries. However, illegal imports cannot happen if there is respect for the rule of law. Illegal imports happen because of the porosity of the borders, and ingrained rent seeking and corruption at the borders.\u201d\n\nHistory of border closure\n\nIn 2004, Nigeria restricted rice imports from Benin Republic in 2004 and added a 70% duty on other foreign rice. More countries were also added to the restriction list subsequently.\n\n\u201cIn 2012, the Jonathan Administration introduced the Nigeria Industrial Revolution Plan (NIRP) in order to enhance local production of goods that were imported as well as chart a comprehensive course for turning Nigeria from a country that only exports raw materials (crude oil) to one that has a solid manufacturing base.\u201d\n\nIn August 2019, under the current administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, the Federal government announced a partial border closure and in October 2019, a full closure of land borders thus impeding trade with neighbors- Benin, Cameroun, Chad, and Niger). In doing so, the Nigerian government breached the AFCFTA agreement for free movement between the 15 ECOWAS members and that with the AU countries committing to cutting tariffs by 90% while harmonizing trade rules.\n\nAmongst the various condemnation that trailed this action, the World Bank says that the \u201cdecision is unilateralist and parochial, with only short-term advantages to it. One cannot argue that the indefinite border closure will only reduce the import rate into the country and further increase illegal routes of smuggling goods into the country.\u201d\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria in July 2015 restricted about 41 items, from the foreign exchange in a bid to advance their local production. These products ranged from Rice, Cement, Margarine, Palm Kernel/Palm oil Products/vegetable oils, Meat and processes meat products, Vegetables and processed vegetable products, Poultry \u2013 chicken, eggs, turkey, Tinned Fish in sauce (geisha) sardines, Furniture, Toothpicks, Textiles, Kitchen utensils, and Glass and glassware.\n\nIn December 2020, four land borders were re-opened after more than a year after closing them.\n\nToday, more than 26 goods are still on the prohibitive list with many more denied foreign exchange. Thus the quest for free trade on the AFCFTA is still a farce with a more restrictive policy by the government.\n\nThe International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) says that \u201cNigeria\u2019s border crisis continues to disrupt African trade relationships and ongoing negotiations. Nigeria has apparently not formally notified its regional partners of its recent restrictions as required by Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) trade rules. Thus the border closures contravene an agreement that guarantees free movement between the 15 ECOWAS members. They clearly go against both the letter and the spirit of AfCFTA.\n\n\u201cNigeria is isolated; a majority of African countries are today attracted by trade liberalization and the promise of AfCFTA, particularly continental champions like Morocco and South Africa. Nigeria\u2019s actions suggest that while it has formally endorsed a continental free trade zone, it is not committed to that goal\u2014and may choose to remain behind at a critical moment for the continent.\u201d\n\nThe World Trade Organization (WTO) says that \u201cas of 1986, approximately 40% of agricultural and industrial products were covered by import prohibitions\u201d and that the ease of its monitoring is perhaps the reason it had stuck with the policy over the years.\n\n\u201cThe pervasive use of import prohibition in Nigeria has another, perhaps equally important, reason: it is administratively easier. In Nigeria\u2019s responses to the questions raised on this matter during discussions at various GATT and WTO fora, it has been argued that import prohibitions are easier to monitor than price-based measures, since the presence of the banned products on local markets is, in principle, sufficient for enforcement.\u201d\n\nIronically, even with the decreased rate of imports due to the depreciating naira, domestic production is still not being encouraged. This could be due to the high cost of doing business and the unfavorable government policies in Nigeria.\n\nWhereas Nigeria is not amongst the African countries ranked among the top 100 most competitive countries in the world, based on the 2018 Global Competitiveness Index \u2013 she has continued a protectionist and unilateral policy that has only placed her in the comity of less industrialized nations. Mauritius, South Africa, Seychelles, Morocco, Tunisia, Botswana, Algeria, Kenya, Egypt, and Namibia represent Africa on the 100 most competitive countries table. This is not unexpected given the high cost of doing business and a government policy that have in fact continually limited the private sector from benefiting from the opportunities that abound in the country.\n\nAccording to the African development bank President \u2013 Akinwunmi Adesina, \u201cTake for example that 86% of small and medium sized enterprises in Nigeria spend $14 billion annually on diesel for generators. Nigeria\u2019s companies lose on average 10% of sales because they do not have access to reliable and affordable electricity.\n\nGovernments, over time, have simply transferred their responsibility to citizens. When governments or institutions fail to provide basic services, the people bear the burden \u2014 a heavy implicit tax on the population.\u201d\n\nSmuggling\n\nWith border closure has come the menace of smuggling. The porous border between Benin Republic and Nigeria have been used by smugglers to import commodities especially food in view of the high prices that have been occasioned by the Nigerian government\u2019s border closure. According to Benin\u2019s National Institute of Statistics and Economic Analysis (INSAE) survey of 171 border points without customs officers, \u201c17,749 individual illegal transactions took place over 10 days, with a total value of $15.2 million. Illegal trade between Benin and Nigeria represented 2.3-3.8 times the trade officially recorded by customs officials.\u201d\n\nOvertime, the restrictive import substitution policy of the Nigerian government has spurred inflationary pressures and has in-fact made-in-Nigeria goods less attractive to other parts of the world. On a norm, restricting imports to certain essential goods and at the same time devaluing the currency makes imports more expensive and exports attractive. However with import substitution industrialization policy, the government promotes budget deficits with increased spending on industrial investments which eventually overshoots revenue thereby stoking inflation and eventually reducing exports due to more expensive domestic goods.\n\nA negative impact can from a similar policy advanced by India in the 1950s and 1980s. The Financial Derivatives Company (FDC) says that \u201cIt led to a \u201cdecline of India\u2019s share of world export markets from 2% in the early 1950s to 0.53% 40 years later due to loss of export opportunities. India also faced balance of payment problems due to the growth of its import substituting industries, which required large quantities of imported raw materials, machinery and capital goods.\u201d\n\nHowever, the case with Sri Lanka was a success story. \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s agricultural sector recorded increased production due to import substitution policies. Protectionist policies led to the increase in production of rice and several food crops.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) released a document delving on the impact of the CBN\u2019s tightened foreign exchange policy on businesses and the economy. For Financial services the LCCI noted \u201clower transaction volumes and restrictions on foreign credit lines. For Manufacturing there was a reduced manufacturing due to lack of raw materials, lower profits and slower consumer demand Tire and Rubber, default on repayment agreement with foreign suppliers and banks Pharmaceuticals, unavailability of key raw materials not locally produced, increased production cost Oil & gas, difficulty in settling outstanding financial obligations and banking charges and shut down of factories\u201d amongst others.\n\nThus, in all, the LCCI noted that there was a negative impact of CBN\u2019s restrictive foreign policy.\n\n\u201cThe current import substitution strategy in Nigeria seems to be borne out of fear and capricious thinking rather than clear economic rationalization. For instance, the CBN\u2019s shutting official access to forex for the importation of selected items uses import substitution as a smokescreen for the real exchange rate issue of currency misalignment and forex scarcity facing the country.\n\nIn addition, rather than have a blanket policy towards import substitution and trade controls, a case-by-case approach that limits the importation of goods based on a comparative advantage analysis should be used. In essence, a temporary import substitution for select commodities in which Nigeria has potential comparative advantage should be pursued.\u201d The FDC Says.\n\nRead also: Analysis: Why Tin-Can Port has become importers nightmare\n\nAs a solution to Nigeria\u2019s negative import substitution policy, the FDC says that \u201cThere could also be incentives to attract foreign investors as they respond positively to favorable trade and forex policies. It is critical to make the business environment attractive to foreign investors so that they can bring their capital, technology, managerial and technical experience to the country.\u201d\n\nBrookings decries that currently, \u201cintra-African trade is notoriously low, amounting to only around 15 percent of the continent\u2019s total goods trade as of 2016.\u201d Nevertheless, some countries in Africa are already making substantial progress to industrialization.\n\nProfessor Landry Sign\u00e9 of the Stanford University says, \u201cKenya is a good example of an African country, whose relatively strong industrial manufacturing sector accounts for nearly 20 percent of the country\u2019s economic activity and 12.5 percent of all formal jobs, and which has become the primary supplier of motor vehicles for East African markets.\u201d\n\nNigeria has been presented a choice to either industrialize using an export promotion policy or continue with an import substituting one that gives no result and assures failure.",

          "text": "The choice of who becomes the National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) is becoming clearer with leaders of the party endorsing the candidature of three aspirants.\n\nSo far, 12 persons are jostling for the position among who are former governors, a serving minister, as well as serving and former members of the National Assembly.\n\nAt a well-attended meeting of key stakeholders of the APC held in the Abuja residence of one of the North-West governors at the weekend, the leaders, it was learnt that the slot was zoned to the North Central. They also narrowed the choice of preferred candidates to three aspirants, namely, Tanko Al\u2019Makura (Nasarawa State), George Akume (Benue State) and Abubakar Bawa Bwari (Niger State) in that order. This is however subject to the approval of the party at the February 25 National Convention.\n\nThe meeting also agreed to zone the office of National Secretary to the South-South; Deputy National Chairman (South) to the South West; Deputy National Chairman (North) North-West; National Treasurer (South East) and National Financial Secretary (North East).\n\nA source at the meeting told BusinessDay that the choice of the three aspirants was done after careful study of their character, qualifications, pedigree, service to the nation and loyalty to the party.\n\n\u201cTop on our priority in the choice of a national chairman that is loyalty to the party, with pedigree and patriotic to the country. We don\u2019t want to repeat the mistakes of the past in our choice of our leaders, and I can tell you that these three aspirants met the criteria,\u201d the source said.\n\nHe said the party leaders took the pre-emptive action to avoid anybody or group hijacking the party leadership, a situation he said could lead to \u201ccrisis\u201d and \u201cdivision\u201d among the various groups that make up the party structure.\n\nAPC is divided into six power blocks. Notable among them are; the legacy parties that coalesced to form APC in 2013, the APC Governor\u2019s Forum, the National Assembly Caucus of the party, former Governors, former federal lawmakers and the regional groups.\n\nMeanwhile, all the groups are involved in the game of suspense, intrigues and horse-trading on a convention that promises to be the most intricate in the party\u2019s history\n\nThe party is currently being administered by a 13-man Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) led by Governor Mai Bala Buni of Yobe State, which was inaugurated in June 2021, following the removal of former National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, about two years to the end of his tenure.\n\nAlthough February 26, 2022, has been fixed for the elective National Convention, there are still doubts about it holding on that day with calls from some quarters for the convention to be postponed.\n\nAside from the three aspirants mentioned, the remaining nine national chairmanship aspirants are; former deputy national chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Saliu Mustapha; a former governor of Borno State, Ali Modu Sheriff, and senator representing Niger East District, Mohammed Sani-Musa.\n\nOthers are former governors of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari; Bauchi State, Isa Yuguda; Borno State, Kashim Shettima; Gombe State, Danjuma Goje; Sunny Moniedafe and Mohammed Saidu-Etsu\n\nRead also: Convention: APC wants BoT replaced with advisory council\n\nProfile of the 3 key aspirants\n\nUmaru Tanko Al-Makura:\n\nHe was born November 15, 1952, in Lafia, Nasarawa State, as a member of the Gwandara ethnic group. He attended Dunama Primary School, Lafia (1959\u20131966), Keffi Teacher\u2019s College (1967\u20131971) and then Government Teachers College of Education, Uyo (1972\u201375). For a short period in 1975, he was an Assistant Producer at the Broadcasting Corporation of Northern Nigeria.\n\nHe then went to Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria (1975\u20131978), graduating with a Bachelor of Education Degree. For his National Youth Service, he was a teacher at the Government College, Makurdi.\n\nIn 1978, he formed Almakura Nigeria Limited, importing and servicing agricultural and industrial machinery. Later he ventured into real estate and property development as owner and chairman of Ta\u2019al Nigeria Limited, with properties in Abuja, Lagos, Kano and Washington DC, United States.

Onyukwu in a paper titled, \u201cThe Role of the Media/CSOs In The Fight Against Corruption\u201d, where he espoused on the essence of the workshop which according to him was to draw attention to the risk of corruption becoming a normal culture in view of declining public criticisms of manifestation of acts corruption.\n\nProf Onyukwu said critical stakeholders like the Media and CSOs were needed to create the needed synergy with the public with the aim of moderating their psyche against glorifying corrupt practices as currently being observed among some segments of our society.\n\n\u201cCorruption is gradually being considered as a necessary evil in the sharing of the proverbial national cake.

          "title": "Young entrepreneurs laud Osun Food Support Scheme",
          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nThe monthly Food Support Scheme initiated by the Administration of Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola aimed at cushioning the socio-economic effects of COVID-19 pandemic has once again been commended by young entrepreneurs who are into local production of stable foods in the State.\n\nThe highly-excited young entrepreneurs also extolled government for providing an enabling environment and sustainable template for their businesses to thrive, saying the gesture has rekindled their hope for a better tomorrow.\n\nThey said the hands of patronage extended to them by government towards the actualisation and sustainability of its monthly food support scheme would go a long way to further encourage youths to put in their best and boost the local production of goods in the State and beyond.\n\nOsun government had reiterated its readiness to support youths who are interested to go into agriculture, saying, \u201cthere is wealth in farming\u201d, as it flagged off the distribution of the 11th edition of the food support scheme.\n\nThe young entrepreneurs had been contracted to make the supply specialised in the production of food commodities such as garri, cassava/yam flours, banana flours, pando-yam among other stable foods.\n\nAddressing journalists during the 11th flag-off of the scheme at the open field of the Local Government Service Commission at Government Secretariat, Abere, Osogbo, one of the local entrepreneurs who supplied a significant amount of gari to government for distribution, Mr. Raji Ahmed Adekunle, hailed Governor Oyetola for providing quality leadership and demonstrating capacity and high sense of seriousness to harness and explore the potential embedded in the youths for the growth and development of the State.\n\nAdekunle said the inclusion of his venture in the list of those that supplied gari to the government has helped to expand the scope of his business for maximum capacity.\n\nHe said: \u201cRecently, I was invited by the state government to be part of those that would supply gari in large quantity. We have done this and as you can see, we were able to meet up with government expectations in this regard.\n\n\u201cTo me, this is highly unprecedented and commendable as it will go a long way to encourage us to continue to do our business, expand our production capacity and extension and create employment opportunity for others.\n\n\u201cSo, this initiative is well appreciated, as far as I am concerned. When I was contacted and later contracted for this, it first came as a surprise because I was surprised that someone like me that resides in Ode-Omu could be found worthy to supply gari to government.\n\n\u201cI find it very surprising that the State government will be so magnanimous to recognise my little efforts in far away Ode-Omu. With this alone, I have been elevated by the project as this would go a long way to project \u2018Garri- Ode-Omu\u2019 to the world and beyond.\n\n\u201cIt is also worthy of letting the people know how magnaniomous the government has been to us to have approved a take-off grant to execute the production. Indeed, this is very unprecedented because it is a plus to us as a people.\n\n\u201cI will advise the government to continue with this project because the impact is being felt across the nooks and crannies of the state. Take for instance, I have more than 12 local women working directly and indirectly for me and the implication is that these women have as well benefitted from this project.\n\n\u201cThe dividends of democracy have been extended to them and they are very happy. In fact, they passed a positive remark on the present Administration.\n\nSo, if they could do that, then imagine how the government has impacted my project and my personal life. I will advise that the government continue to do things like this to enhance society.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Azeez Tajudeen Olayemi; Alhaja Bola Alabi and Mr. Wale Afolabi who are among the young entrepreneurs that supplied the commodity to government, expressed gratitude to Governor Oyetola for his keen interest in advancing local productions.\n\nWhile flagging off the 11th edition of the Scheme, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola called on youths in the State to create interest in farming as his government is poised to revive the sector to actualise its economic diversification.\n\nGovernor Oyetola who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Prince Wole Oyebamiji, said the distribution of garri has helped to complement the economy value chain projected by the government.\n\n\u201cOur Administration is a government of the people, by the people and for the people. As such, the Governor has great interest in the growth of the economy of the State.\n\n\u201cIf we are encouraging young men and women to go into farming, we as a government has a responsibility to ensure that they have patronage and to ensure that they have support so that going back to farm will be meaningful because it is not easy to encourage youths to go back to farm without necessary support.\n\n\u201cThe production of gari being produced locally by our people is an attestation to the fact that there is wealth in farming. This will be an encouragement to boost farming, grow our economy and provide employment opportunity for our people.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to do it, and we are not regretting it. This will not in any way relegate other staple foods that we have adopted for distribution. We believe we should encourage local productions too.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, the Commissioner for Special Duties and Regional Integration, Engr. Olalekan Badmus said the Administration of Governor Oyetola would continue to sustain the scheme.\n\nBadmus who assured that the Administration was committed to reactivate local productions called on the young ones to take maximum advantage of the opportunity provided to develop themselves individually and collectively.\n\n\u201cYou will agree with me that this is a noble step to ensuring that local content is actually achieved. This has been able to allow the garri farmers, that is, the cassava growers and gari processors, to benefit in one way or the other.\n\n\u201cTo arrive at this noble gesture, we are able to identify young entrepreneurs who are into various staple foods productionsm. In the course of meeting one of the entrepreneurs, it was actually discovered that he deliberately went to his town to look for what he could be doing to contribute to the development of his community where he later came up with the production of \u2018Garri Ode-Omu.\u2019 This is worthy of emulation.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on how the government was able to assemble the entrepreneurs within the State to match up with the quantity of gari required, Badmus said \u201cI went to about ten towns in Osun and I was very impressed with the quantity of gari that I saw.\n\n\u201cThe cassava farmers, gari processors and others who are involved in the production were very happy and have a sense of belonging.\n\n\u201cI can assure our people that we have enough quantity to distribute for this edition. We are not resting on our oars. We will still need to go back to see how we can incorporate other sustainable commodities into the scheme. We will continue to be innovative.\n\n\u201cWe are not rigid, we will continue to see the possibility of bringing other products. If we can see the possibility of bringing vegetables that can be well packed and have the volume of what we want with the required lifespan, we will not hesitate to go for it. We will continue to do our research. We will continue to bring new products into it.\u201d",

We, as youth groups of the PDP will not sit idly by where ideas are compromised for lesser values. What we need as a country is competent leadership. There could be other wants, but we believe that what we need should trump what we want!\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe can see the way people are talking about mismanagement of fund, whereby we can\u2019t even trust ourselves. The way we youths are mismanaging fund is getting out of hands. We need someone that has the experience, as an elder person to take the step so that we youths can learn from them.\n\n\u201cIf Atiku does not declare, there\u2019s a petition that is coming from our own side.

          "text": "Anti-corruption group, Act for Positive Transformation Initiative (APTI), and a renowned TV analyst, Babajide Kolade-Otitoju, have joined the ranks of stakeholders to decry the delay by President Muhammadu Buhari in inaugurating the substantive Board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\n\nAccording to them, the ongoing illegality of administering NDDC with interim management/sole administrator contraptions was in breach of the NDDC Act establishing the Commission, and thereby deprives the nine constituent states of the Niger Delta region fair and equitable representation in the running of the interventionist agency.\n\nSpeaking on TVC News magazine programme, \u2018Journalists\u2019 Hangout\u2019 monitored in Abuja, the panelists wondered why Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), North-East Development Commission (NEDC), which is modelled after NDDC, and other Federal Government agencies and commissions are operating with governing boards while NDDC is being administered in the breach of the law, the NDDC Act.\n\nAccording to Kolade-Otitoju, a journalist, polemicist, and historian, who was awarded Political Analyst of 2019, the delay in inaugurating the NDDC board shows that the government was not prepared to do anything about the reported ongoing corruption in NDDC.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIf we were prepared, by now we would have put a board in place just as the President (Buhari) had promised. By now a board would be in place. Why are we allowing Senator Akpabio to literally be running that place as if it belongs to him? He came up with the idea of Interim Management Committee (IMC) that is not known to the Act setting up the NDDC. He came up with it and he got away with it. Later on he came up with the idea of a sole administrator. The sole administrator is from his state \u2013 Akwa Ibom, he as Minister (Niger Delta affairs) is from the same Akwa Ibom state and the Presidential aide (Senior Special Assistant to President Buhari) on Niger Delta, Senator Ita Enang is also from Akwa Ibom. So other Niger Delta states are effectively shut out of the running of the place (NDDC),\u201d he said.\n\nThe analyst recalled that, \u201cPresident Buhari promised to get a board inaugurated. That promise has not been kept. So why are you surprised that we are hearing this kind of stories from NDDC?.\u201d\n\nRecall that on June 24, 2021, while receiving the leadership of the Ijaw National Congress (INC) in Aso Rock, Abuja, President Buhari promised that the NDDC Board will be inaugurated once the forensic audit report was submitted.\n\nThe President had said, \u2018\u2018Based on the mismanagement that had previously bedeviled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July, 2021. I want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board will be inaugurated.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe journalist cum analyst noted that the report in question has been submitted to the President since six months ago, on September 2, 2021, yet the President is yet to fulfil his promise to inaugurate the NDDC Board.\n\nOn the ongoing probe of the NDDC by the Senate Public Accounts Committee (SPAC), Kolade-Otitoju, further stated that the legislative arm should rather be pushing President Buhari to implement the recommendations of its (Senate) probe of NDDC in June/July 2020, which indicted the then illegal Interim Management Committee (IMC), and recommended the inauguration of a substantive Board for the Commission.\n\nThe Senate probe of NDDC Interim Management Committee (IMC) in June/July of 2020 revealed how the IMC blew N81.5 billion in just a couple of months on fictitious contracts, frivolities, and in breach of extant financial and public procurement laws. The Senate therefore recommended that the IMC should refund the sum of N4.923 Billion to the Federation Account, and that the IMC should be disbanded, while the substantive board should be inaugurated to manage the Commission in accordance with the law.\n\nKolade-Otitoju, therefore, urged President Buhari to implement the recommendations of the Senate in the June/July 2020 probe of NDDC.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI looked at the recommendations and I found those recommendations good enough to be implemented.\u201d\n\nHe recalled the scandals in the National assembly probe of IMC in June/July 2020, adding that, \u201cAkpabio, knowing that particular interim management committee (IMC) has been blotted, has been disgraced, has been discredited before Nigerians, he then did the fast thing to go again to get Presidential approval to have a Sole Administrator. Again they (President Buhari) pandered to him and allowed him to have a sole administrator, and he has refused to inaugurate the Board. So whatever happened to the fight against corruption?\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn his part, Head, Directorate of research and strategy, of Act for Positive Transformation Initiative (APTI), Mr. Kolawole Johnson, stated that, \u201cYou have the North-East Development Commission (NEDC) today functioning with a Board in place; NNPC has been accused of corruption, yet today functioning with a proper board in place. So you ask, what exactly has made the case of NDDC different that they have refused to inaugurate a substantive board despite the fact that is what the law states.\u201d\n\nAPTI leader also noted that, \u201cwhen you have a board in place, there are benefits. The entire nine states of the Niger Delta region are supposed to be represented, one per state, and then you have the oil companies themselves who are supposed to have one representative on the board, being the ones providing the largest funds to run this Commission. Today none of them is there. You just have one man, a sole administrator, controlled by the Minister of Niger Delta, and whatsoever they sign goes. There is no check, nobody is checking,(there is no executive director of projects, no executive director of finance), only one person (sole administrator) is the one currently approving, he is the one supervising, he is the one monitoring, he is the one procuring, and he is the one paying. This is the height of fraud. Why is it that the President is refusing to inaugurate the board and yet allow few persons to feast on the resources of the Niger delta people?\u201d\n\nKolade-Otitoju and Johnson, therefore, enjoined President Buhari to inaugurate the NDDC Board in accordance with the law \u2013 the NDDC Act, and in fulfilment of his own promise, and so ensure equitable representation of the nine constituent states, and thereby guarantee proper corporate governance, accountability, probity, checks and balances in administering the Commission.",
          "summary": "Anti-corruption group, Act for Positive Transformation Initiative (APTI), and a renowned TV analyst, Babajide Kolade-Otitoju, have joined the ranks of stakeholders to decry the delay by President Muhammadu Buhari in inaugurating the substantive Board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\nAccording to Kolade-Otitoju, a journalist, polemicist, and historian, who was awarded Political Analyst of 2019, the delay in inaugurating the NDDC board shows that the government was not prepared to do anything about the reported ongoing corruption in NDDC.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cIf we were prepared, by now we would have put a board in place just as the President (Buhari) had promised.\nSo other Niger Delta states are effectively shut out of the running of the place (NDDC),\u201d he said.\nKolade-Otitoju, therefore, urged President Buhari to implement the recommendations of the Senate in the June/July 2020 probe of NDDC.",

          "text": "Parents of the abducted Dapchi schoolgirl in Yobe State, Leah Sharibu, have called for her immediately release from captivity four years after she was kidnapped alongside with others.\n\nRecall that in February 2018, Boko Haram terrorists abducted 110 schoolgirls from a secondary school in Dapchi, Yobe State, North-East Nigeria.\n\nWhile others were released, one girl, Leah Sharibu, remains in captivity. Her parents remain hopeful that she will be released but said the government was doing nothing to ensure her release.\n\nSpeaking to LEADERSHIP, the mother of the remaining abducted Dapchi schoolgirl, Mrs. Rebecca Sharibu, lamented that government has failed to secure Leah\u2019s release for the past four years, coupled with the increase in cases of kidnapping and armed banditry across the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to her, Leah Sharibu, a Christian, was among 110 female students of Government Science Secondary School, Dapchi, in Bursari local government area of Yobe State, abducted by Boko Haram on February 19, 2018 and her case, in particular, attracted unprecedented local and global attention, owing to the fact that others were released, while she was kept for refusing to renounce her Christian faith.\n\nLeah\u2019s mother insisted that government owed her family, and indeed, all Nigerians the duty to not only secure her release and other abducted students across Nigeria, but also to put an end to all forms of insecurity in the country.\n\nShe added that, \u201cIt is sad to note that four years have passed by since my daughter, Leah Sharibu, was abducted from her school along with other girls and has since been in captivity.\u201d\n\nShe, therefore, called on the Federal Government to, as a matter of priority, ensure her release.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlso, speaking to LEADERSHIP on telephone, Leah\u2019s father, Mr. Nathan Sharibu, called on President Muhammadu Buhari and Yobe State government as well as security agencies to ensure Leah\u2019s safe return.\n\nMr. Sharibu lamented that the President has promised several times to the family, the nation and the whole world that, his administration will do its possible best to ensure his daughter return home safely.\n\n\u201d Let me tell you the truth, I am a police officer. We don\u2019t have money to give to release our daughter. It is only my daughter that has not been released. Why did Buhari not adopt the same means he used in gaining the release of others to free my daughter?,\u201d he queried.\n\nHe also appealed to President Buhari, Governor Mai Mala Buni and Nigeria security agencies to do all within their powers to secure Leah\u2019s release and other abducted students.",

          "text": "A Federal High Court in Abuja, on Monday, struck out a suit seeking the disqualification of former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, from contesting the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThe suit, marked FHC/ABJ/CS/177, challenged Atiku\u2019s eligibility on the premise that he is not a Nigerian by birth.\n\nRecall that the subject of Atiku\u2019s citizenship came shortly after the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, claimed that the former VP was \u2018Cameroonian\u2019 in the build-up to the 2019 elections.\n\nSubsequently, a group under the aegis of the Incorporated Trustees of Egalitarian Mission for Africa (EMN) in the suit, urged the court to determine; \u201cWhether section 25 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), is the sole authority that spells out ways by which a person can become a Nigerian citizen by birth?\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhether by the provisions of section 131(a) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), only a Nigeria citizen by birth can contest for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria?\u201d\n\nThe group also joined the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Attorney-general of the Federation as respondents in the case.\n\nThe Adamawa State government, through its Attorney-General (AG), had on July 27, 2021, sought an order of the court to be joined in the suit. The state government told the court that Atiku was eligible to vie for the office of the president.\n\nDelivering judgement on the case, Justice Inyang Ekwo struck out the suit for want of merit.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJustice Ekwo held that since the plaintiff lacked the locus standi, the court, therefore, did not have the jurisdiction to entertain the case.",

Ogamba and the Secretary, Chinedu Agu, paid the judge a visit at 5pm today, the Secretariat gathered that the kidnappers double-crossed His Lordship\u2019s vehicle at a speed break, disembarking her and ordering her to lie prostrate on the road, while pointing guns menacingly on her head.\n\nIt explained that Justice Pemu, who by happenstance was rather in her Hiace Bus instead of her SUV and was dressed in a simple, spartan and free-flowing gown was mistaken by the kidnappers as one of \u201coga\u2019s stewards,\u201d as they kept demanding to know in which car their \u201coga\u201d was.\n\nThe statement explained further that while she was matched into a thick forest, one of the kidnappers, the Secretariat gathered, was boasting that he would have wasted their oga if he were there.\n\nIt said as his Lordship was matched into the bush-like a death-destined Sheep to the slaughter, gunshots and concomitant cries of anguish pervaded the bush, which heightened her apprehension.\n\nAccording to the statement, as the kidnappers backed out for his Lordship to continue the Golgotha walk into the depth of the bush, where perhaps she would face the doomed fate of others, she detoured and took safety elsewhere, and was hurried back to Orlu town in disguise from where she found her way into Owerri.\n\nThe statement added that as of the time of this report, His Lordship\u2019s official cars, her driver, her personal property inside the car were yet to be found.",

It also informed the commission that the earlier Convention slated for February 26, 2022, will no longer hold.\n\nIn the letter signed by the Chairman, APC Caretaker Committee, Mai Mala Buni, and the Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe, the party informed the commission that this new congress would supersede the earlier letter.\n\nIn the letter dated February 21, 2022, marked APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/22/21, the party said it had to hold a zonal congress first in compliance with its constitution.\n\nThe letter titled \u2018Notice for the Conduct of Zonal Congress\u2019 read in part, \u201cThis notice supersedes our earlier notice for a national convention referenced APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/22/14. This is predicated on the evaluation of our party constitution.\u201d\n\nOn Monday evening, however, the National Secretary of the Party, Dr John Akpanudoedehe, who announced the new development to Correspondents after the closed-door meeting, said the preparation for the National Convention would commence on March 24, 2022, while the zonal congresses will hold before the National Convention slated for March 26, 2022.\n\nHe said the Committee had been in a closed-door meeting since 11:00 am on Monday.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAfter deliberation and agreement with the CECPC, we have agreed and approved that the activities of the national Convention commence from March 24 and terminate on March 26.\n\n\u201cThe convention activities commence on March 24, and it will terminate at Eagles Square on March 26. In between the Convention, we have agreed to have zonal congresses.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the APC has updated its schedule of activities ahead of the new date of March 26 for the National Convention.\n\nAccording to the new timetable, the Publication of National Convention Sub-Committees now holds on February 28, 2022. The sale of forms would run from Wednesday, March 9, to Friday, March 11.\n\nApplicants will be screened from March 15 \u2013 17, while screening appeals will be held on March 19, 2022.\n\nMarch 21 has been slated for the adoption of the appeal report as the accreditation of participants to the Convention holds from March 24 \u2013 25.,\n\nThe Convention, which is now scheduled for Saturday, March 26, 2022, will be followed by a convention appeal three days later on March 29.\n\nThe appeal report will be adopted on March 30, after which new party leaders will be inaugurated the next day.\n\nZonal congresses earlier scheduled for March 26 will now hold on March 12.",

          "text": "Those who claim that all of this occurred before Mr Mohammed Bello-Koko became a government employee are stretching the truth. They\u2019re also oblivious to the point.\n\nThe first charge leveled against Mr Bello-Koko is that he failed to declare his interest in four London properties acquired through offshore companies/accounts to the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) prior to his appointment as executive director (Finance and Administration) of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA).\n\nThe second charge leveled against Mr Bello-Koko is that after being hired as the executive director of Finance and Administration, he purchased a fifth London home.\n\nThird, has Mr Bello-involvement Koko\u2019s in offshore companies/accounts ceased since he became a public servant, which is the important point of his being referenced in the Pandora Papers?\n\nThe fourth charge leveled against Mr Bello-Koko is that he was involved in offshore deals prior to joining the government.\n\nThe following are the questions we must address:\n\n(1) Why appoint a man who is experienced in secret offshore companies/accounts as a public servant in the first place?\n\n(2) Why retain him as a public servant after it came to light that he acquired at least one foreign property and maintained foreign bank accounts after becoming a public servant, and had not himself declared his interest in the foreign assets?\n\nMr Bello-Koko became and remained acting managing director of NPA with these allegations on his head, and has now been confirmed as managing director/CEO of that critical maritime-economy agency. Mr Bello-Koko, was an unknown maritime person before his appointment as ED F&A. And our suspicion is somewhat confirmed by the way and manner that he has now become confirmed as substantive MD/CEO of NPA.\n\nMr Bello-Koko was made acting MD with the suspension of erstwhile MD/CEO, Mrs Hadiza Bala-Usman, over allegation of NPA failing to remit its operating surplus, remember, with Mr Bello-Koko as ED F&A. An administrative panel was set up to look into the allegation against Mrs Bala-Usman. After months of their investigation, the panel cleared Mrs Bala-Usman of the allegation against her. Almost immediately after she was cleared, instead of returning her to the office she had been suspended from pending the outcome of investigation into the allegation against her, Mr Bello-Koko was confirmed as MD/CEO, meaning the sacking of Mrs Bala-Usman. That is highly curious.\n\nWe feel that it is highly odd to confirm Mr Bello-Koko as MD/CEO of NPA after an administrative panel had cleared Mrs Bala-Usman of the only allegation against her, that is, not remitting the agency\u2019s operating surplus to the federation account; not even that she had diverted or stolen any money belonging to NPA.\n\nAlso, confirming Mr Bello-Koko as MD/CEO immediately after clearing Mrs Bala-Usman leads us to believe that Mrs Bala-Usman had been suspended not because of that allegation but on a witch-hunt.\n\nHaving been cleared by the administrative panel, Mrs Bala-Usman should have returned to the office as MD/CEO of NPA while Mr Bello-Koko, on account of the allegations against him, released to return to his offshore business as a private person, and clearing his own name at CCT and other anti-corruption agencies.\n\nMaking Mr Bello-Koko MD/CEO of NPA in such controversial circumstances amounts to an indictment on President Buhari\u2019s anti-corruption crusade.\n\nWe think that if President Buhari had any unstated and unclear reason(s) to sack Mrs Bala-Usman other than the allegation over which she was investigated and cleared (and it is Mr President\u2019s prerogative to hire and fire his aides), Mr Bello-Koko should not be the one to step into her shoes.\n\nMr Bello-Koko clearly lacks the requisite credibility and integrity for that exalted and sensitive office to the Nigerian economy.",

The order by the president is clear. He said it should be investigated and that has put all security agencies on their toes.\n\n\u201cThe agencies are on top of the matter and investigation has been up and all involved parties, individuals and corporate companies were invited and they made useful revelations. They have answered questions and provided information on what may have gone wrong.\n\n\u201cThe major players have been told they can be invited over and over as fresh facts emerge in the course of the investigation. Not too long from now, Nigerians will see decisive action on this embarrassing situation.\u201d\n\nOn which agencies are involved in the investigation and which was leading the investigation, the source said: \u201cThe investigation falls directly within the mandate, role and functions of the Department of State Services (DSS).\n\n\u201cThey are saddled with the responsibility of, among others, prevention, detection of economic crimes of national security dimension; as well as provision of timely advice on all matters of national security interest.\u201d\n\nHowever, a source in the NNPC disclosed to Blueprint that the management of the corporation, which actually raised the alarm of the contaminated PMS, was in support of the investigation as their own findings uncovered the involvement of third parties.\n\nAccording to the official, who asked not to be named, the probe was getting complicated and technical, especially with the establishment of third party involvement in the supply of the bad products.\n\nAccording to the source, a particular company (name withheld) that has been trying to absolve itself of blame was found to have got its supply from BP, which was discovered to have got its supply from other sources as well.\n\nThis, the source said, had created room for blame trading.\n\nIn a bid to forestall any legal complications from the outcome of the probe, the source said technical assistance had been provided for the investigating agencies.\n\nThe source further disclosed that invitation and interrogation of some companies with DCDP was being delayed to avoid disruption of supply of products as the NNPC was committed to ensuring complete disappearance of fuel queues.\n\nCSOs express angst\n\nMeanwhile, the Northern Coalition Forum (NCF) has called for the resignation of NNPC Group Managing Director Mele Kyari and CEO Nigeria Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, Engr. Farouk Ahmed over importation of methanol adulterated fuel into Nigeria.\n\nThe forum, a coalition of 26 civil society organisations in Northern Nigeria under the aegis of Coalition of Concerned Northern Forum(CCNF), also urged the immediate sack of all NNPC management staff, punitive measure against the importers of the adulterated fuel, and adequate compensations for owners of vehicles, generators and machines damaged by the fuel, which has caused extended fuel scarcity across the country.\n\nIn a statement jointly signed by leaders of the groups, Malam Ibrahim Bature and Comrade Abdulsalam Moh\u2019d Kazeem, they said: \u201cWe condemn in totality the current persistent scarcity of petroleum products across the nation, the scarcity is aimed at embarrassing the current administration by its enemies and unpatriotic elements from within.\n\n\u201cSince 2015 till date, we have over two GMD\u2019s, to our greatest surprise as progressives all the past GMDs of NNPC including Mr Ibe Kachikwu have helped the current administration greatly, in ensuring that all petroleum products meet our nation\u2019s required standard and also ensured no scarcity and fuel queues in our filling stations even during festive periods.\n\n\u201cThe current administration has spent over six years without fuel scarcity and queues in our filling stations, the same administration has less than two years to go, but strangely, fuel scarcity has surfaced due to importation of an adulterated PMS, which has never happened in the history of our country, pointing towards discrediting the record of Mr President and minister of petroleum.\n\n\u201cNNPC\u2019s quality inspection unit which comprises of GMO, SGS, Geochem and G&G did not conduct any test before the said products were discharged, the above units are saddled with the responsibilities of ensuring that the products are not above our required standard, yet the same unit has up till date equipment at her disposal with adequate funding for such tasks.\n\n\u201cNNPC management should make public genuine and comprehensive names of those involved in this national scandal and embarrassment. If our demands are not met in the next three working days, we shall occupy all NNPC zonal offices and its subsidiaries across our region and the FCT. We will follow up with full action after the expiration of our ultimatum and this will serve as litmus test for government\u2019s fight against corruption and indiscipline,\u201d the statement further said.",
          "summary": "There is palpable fear and tension in the oil and gas sector as security agencies commenced investigation into the importation of adulterated Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), also known as petrol into the country.\nThis is not unconnected with the findings of the investigation by security agencies, a source conversant with the probe told Blueprint in Abuja weekend.\nAccording to a source in one of the security agencies who asked not to be named as he was not permitted to speak, \u201cfindings of the probe indicate that heads would roll.\nHe said it should be investigated and that has put all security agencies on their toes.\nAccording to the official, who asked not to be named, the probe was getting complicated and technical, especially with the establishment of third party involvement in the supply of the bad products.",

John Akpanudoedehe and Caretaker Chairman, Governor Mai Mala Buni.\n\n\u201cThis notice supersedes our earlier notice for National Convention referenced APC/NHDQ/INEC/019/22/14 this is predicated on the evaluation of our Party Constitution,\u201d the letter partly read.\n\nThe party\u2019s National Convention had been a subject of debate for weeks as usual pre-convention activities failed to hold.\n\nDelay in conducting its convention may not be unrelated to internal party wrangling and factions in several states.\n\nThe APC party leadership has been quiet about the processes leading up to the convention and reasons why such processes have failed to happen.\n\nDates of purchase and submission of forms by aspirants and their screening have also elapsed without any formal communication by the party\n\nLast week, some governors of the APC were slated to meet President Muhammadu Buhari over some party issues, but the meeting couldn\u2019t hold as the president had to travel to Belgium on an official assignment.\n\nDelayed Convention\n\nThe National Executive Council of the APC had appointed the committee led by Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State to take over the affairs of the party pending when a national convention would be conducted.\n\nThis followed the dissolution of the Adams Oshiomhole led National Working Committee (NWC) of the party in June 2020 amid an internal crisis and a series of litigations.\n\nMonths after it assumed the leadership of the party, the tenure of the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) was extended to better plan a national convention.\n\nBut this did not go well with some party faithful who called for the removal of members of the CECPC. Some of them went further to test the legality of a serving governor to act as the national chairman of a political party.\n\nLast year, APC Governors proposed that the national convention be conducted in February to elect a new set of NWC members.\n\nThe proposal of the governors was later approved by the President, which led to the emergence of the initial February 26 date.\n\nBarely a week to the scheduled date, the caretaker committee informed INEC that it had fixed March 26 to conduct its zonal congresses, but kept mum on the national convention.\n\nAmid reports over the uncertainty of conducting the national convention on Saturday, the party affirmed that it had postponed the exercise by one month.",

However, the sanctions herald a new phase in what could soon become the most dangerous East-West confrontation since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken slammed Russia\u2019s recognition of the separatist regions as a sign President Vladimir Putin had no interest in diplomacy.\n\nBlinken said in a statement that recognizing the territories\u2019 independence \u201cdirectly contradicts Russia\u2019s claimed commitment to diplomacy, and is a clear attack on Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s decision is yet another example of President Putin\u2019s flagrant disrespect for international law and norms,\u201d he said, adding in a separate tweet that the United States \u201cwill take appropriate steps in coordination with partners.\u201d\n\nBiden has led a coalition of European and other US allies to craft a package of what they say will be crippling economic sanctions on Russia should troops massing on Ukraine\u2019s borders start an attack.\n\nWhile the Kremlin has for weeks denied invasion plans, it has at the same time built up an enormous force of troops and heavy weaponry on three sides of Ukraine.\n\nShortly after recognizing their independence, Putin ordered troops into the two breakwaway regions as part of a \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d operation.\n\nMoscow provided no details or date for any deployment, with the order saying only that it \u201ccomes into force from the day it was signed\u201d.\n\nOn Friday, the deputy US national security advisor for international economics, Daleep Singh, warned that sanctions would turn Russia into an international \u201cpariah.\u201d\n\nMoscow has for years been giving the separatist rebels covert financial, political and military backing.\n\nThe White House said that after Putin recognized the regions as independent, Biden talked by phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for 35 minutes to \u201creaffirm\u201d the US commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty. He also detailed the plan for sanctions on Russia.\n\nBiden later spoke for half an hour with two key European allies \u2014 French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, an official said. The three leaders \u201cstrongly condemned\u201d Putin\u2019s decision and discussed how to coordinate their response.\n\nThe White House did not respond immediately to questions about whether there was still any consideration being given to a suggested summit between Biden and Putin.",

What I need from our highly referred traditional rulers is their prayers and cooperation.\n\n\u201cToday, by the special grace of God, in Yorubaland, unlike before, we have Vice President, Minister of Works, Interior and Sports but we still need more,\u201d he said.\n\nOba Adeyemi, in his remarks, while invoking the spirits of his fore-bearers, said his request has been granted, assuring Tinubu that all the ancestors of Yorubaland would work in his favour and answer his prayers.\n\nHe then asked the 10 Oke-Ogun traditional rulers in attendance at the meeting whether they were in support of his decision, and their response was: \u201cWe are fully in support.\u201d\n\nAt the event, the retired Arch Bishop of Methodist Church Nigeria, Ayo Ladigbolu, also prayed for the fulfilment of his ambition.\n\nAt the residence of Olubadan designate, the monarch said, \u201cWe have known you and we know your antecedents. We know your antecedents as a progressive. You laid a foundation of Today Lagos. You are the leading light of Nigeria.
