          "title": "I was into haulage business, not kidnapping, Evans tells court",
          "text": "Alleged kidnap kingpin, Chukwudimeme Onwuamadike, alias Evans, said on Friday that he was innocent of the charges slammed against him before the Lagos State Special Offences Court sitting in Ikeja.\n\nEvans, who is facing four counts of kidnapping and unlawful possession of firearms, claimed that he was not a criminal but was into the legitimate business of haulage and had about 30 workers on his payroll.\n\nHe claimed that he was made to confess to the crime under duress.\n\nEvans, who is being tried alongside an ex-soldier, Victor Aduba, stated this during the continuation of his trial on Friday.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria reports that Evans denied kidnapping a businessman, Sylvanus Ahamonu, and collecting $420,000 ransom from his family.\n\nWhile being cross-examined by the state prosecutor, Mr Yusuf Sule, he vehemently denied knowing Ahamonu prior to seeing him after his arrest.\n\nWhen Sule noted that Ahamonu had identified him when he testified virtually (via the Zoom app) in court, Evans said he was easily identifiable.\n\n\u201cAhamonu and Idowu Haruna (the Investigating Police Officer) could have conspired with the police.\n\n\u201cMy pictures are everywhere, all over the world. Before my picture was everywhere, people knew who I was.\n\n\u201cI had a haulage and logistics business with over 30 staff (members) and drivers in Amuwo-Odofin.\u201d\n\nThe alleged kidnap kingpin said he had made no mention of his haulage and logistics business in his statement because it was written by the police.\n\nResponding to questions, Evans said he also did not provide medical documents proving his alleged torture by the police to the court.\n\nHe, however, noted that while he was incarcerated, he had filed a fundamental human rights suit against the police at the Federal High Court, Lagos, over the alleged torture.\n\nExplaining why he was seen in a jovial mood in the confessional video played in the court when prosecution presented its case, Evans said he was forced to act in that manner by the police.\n\n\u201cThe police told me to be laughing and smiling in the video. You do not know what I encountered in the hands of Abba Kyari and his boys. My eyes saw hell.\n\n\u201cIt was what they told me to be doing that I was doing,\u201d Evans said.\n\nEarlier, while being led in evidence by his lawyer, Ms O.N. Sonuga, Evans said, \u201cI do not know Slyvanus Ahamonu, I only met him at the IG Guest House in Falomo.\n\n\u201cOne day at the IG Guest House, the police brought some documents and asked me to sign. I asked what the documents were for, they didn\u2019t answer me. They said that if I didn\u2019t cooperate with them they would kill me.\n\n\u201cWhen I refused, Inspector Philip asked them to take me to the back of the guest house. When I got there, they were pressing cigarette butts on my body.\u201d\n\nHe said he saw the people he was paraded with in Ikeja, \u201cand they said l will see what will happen to those people; that it is better I sign those documents.\n\n\u201cThey killed about six persons in my presence and I signed the document, I was not allowed to read it. I think it is the document that was used to bring me to court.\n\n\u201cI do not know anything about the allegations before this court. I don\u2019t know who Ahamonu is. I only met him at the IG Guest House; I had no prior contact with him.\u201d\n\nJustice Oluwatoyin Taiwo adjourned till March 11 for continuation of trial.",

          "text": "THE Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, on Friday declared that there would be no going back on the actualisation of the Ondo Deep Seaport Project embarked upon by his administration.\n\nThe governor, however, noted that though arrangements had been concluded on the project, the approval and declaration from Federal Government was causing the delay in the take off of the project.\n\nAkeredolu said this while speaking at a two-day retreat programme for political office holders and accounting officers in Owo, the headquarters of the Owo Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe governor, who disclosed that many investors had shown interest in the project, said the seaport, when completed, would not only serve Nigeria, but the whole of West Africa sub-region.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere is contradiction in our federalism. We have a system where there must be a port declaration by the federal executive council before you proceed.\n\n\u201cI have always wonder about the port is in my state, and I have people who are prepared to invest. But the Federal Government is holding on to the port declaration. I believe that states should be left to determine their deep seaport and the investors.\n\n\u201cFor us as a state, we have been at this since our first day in government. We found out that we have the deepest draft in Ondo State. Our port, we will go ahead. Nothing will stop it, it is a matter of time. It is a port, not only for Nigeria, but for the West Africa because of its deepest draft.\n\n\u201cHow do we finance it? I travelled; I spoke to Dubai port. I spoke to China harbour. Dubai port has even written that they are interested. Our dream for this port in Ondo State is to serve as a conduit for our goods, agricultural produce and very soon, our bitumen.\n\n\u201dIt is the goal of this administration to ensure that the potential of Ondo State is maximised and that all necessary infrastructure required to make this a reality is put in place to achieve this.\u201d\n\nIn his remark, the former Group Managing Director of Access Bank and founder of Africa Initiative for Governance, Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, commended the leadership style of Akeredolu, saying the governor had demonstrated enlightened leadership with the manner he continued with some projects and programmes of the past administration.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "2023: My development plan for Delta South \u2014 Onoyona, Senatorial aspirant",
          "text": ".\n\nDr Sylvester Onoyona, a real estate practitioner, who is a PhD holder in Organisational Leadership from the North Central University, United States of America, is vying for the Delta South Senatorial District, in the National Assembly.\n\nIn this interview with Tunde Oso, the chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC unveils his plans for quality and purposeful representation by way of economic empowerment, poverty alleviation of his constituents. Excerpts:\n\nDo you believe in the Nigerian project?\n\nI believe in the Nigeria project with the view that there is a need for a new generation of political leaders to take the country to a state of Eldorado where the people are provided with the basic things of life in shelter, clothing and food.\n\nThe old political class have failed to embrace modern economic policies and thus slowed development and this factor has been militating against our national growth and development.\n\nThe youths with visionary leadership mindsets should be the change agents. I believe in one equitable Nigeria where justice and fairness is a common denominator. Our commonwealth should be managed properly for the benefit of all.\n\nWhat motivated you to join politics?\n\nI am motivated to join politics by the poor leadership of the political class who have failed our people in their poor representation. I have the zeal to take my constituents out of the woods of human and mental poverty occasioned by the dearth of leadership. The challenges of our people in all areas of life, with a special interest in economic development and security. I am a progressive.\n\nRate your chances in the political terrain you are jumping into\n\nI have an NGO called Delta Youths of Today Association that I have used effectively to reach out to the people in the areas of youth empowerment, community development and education. I am a philanthropist with no boundaries. I am the new face of Isoko and Delta politics. I have major strengths in the areas of humility, courage and likability. Isoko and Delta South are looking forward to new leadership.\n\nThe Delta South Senatorial seat has been dominated by one man for close to 20 years now with nothing to show for it. My project is the people\u2019s project and the Isoko Development Union (IDU) has made a statement that Delta South Senate is a must for Isoko come 2023. Additionally, Isoko people have supported an Ijaw candidate throughout his sojourn in the Upper Chamber and the time has come to pay back their solidarity and support given to that man who has achieved nothing since being in the Senate.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nTension in \u2018Buhari House\u2019 as APC inaugurates State Chairmen\n\nThe narratives must change this time around. The people want new visionary leadership with proper representation at the red chamber that is what I stand for. I have the overwhelming support of the leaders, women and youths.\n\nWhat are those things in Delta State socio-political and economic development that you think would bring total change?\n\nBad and inept leadership and mismanagement of government resources if corrected would trigger change. The good people of Delta state deserve good governance that will provide economic development, attract investors to the state, create jobs and provide basic amenities and security.\n\nHow do you see Senatorial representation in the state?\n\nThe duo of Deputy Senate President Ovie Omo-Agege and Senator Peter Nwaoboshi, have taken Senatorial representation to a new height. They have made the people know that quality representation is possible with enormous value-added. Senator whom I prefer to describe as a weird personality has dwarfed his predecessor in the hallowed chamber. Through him, the people of Delta North are more united than ever before, he has pioneered development in Anioma just like the DSP is doing with clinical efficiency in the central and beyond. He\u2019s a big value added to representation at that level.\n\nAs a realtor, what\u2019s your view and disposition on mass housing projects?\n\nIt is a good idea but management of such housing projects is always a problem. I prefer low income and affordable housing for all.\n\nDo you think your party is strong enough in the state to earn you victory?\n\nAPC is getting stronger in Delta State with Senator Omo Agege as Deputy Senate president and his all-inclusive leadership role in the state. He has taken representation beyond his primary constituency for the time in the political socio-economic life of Delta state. APC has dominated Delta Central by having the senator, members of House of Representatives, minister and other appointments, which is a good thing.\n\nDelta North now has an APC senator which is a big added value. He has changed the political firmament and temperature in the state. Delta south is the least developed in the state and the people are ready to boot PDP for APC. We are in the season of political transfer and more good people are looking forward to joining forces with the APC to rescue the state and exit it from the woods.\n\nThat APC strength is spreading and taking root strongly in other parts of the state is no ruse. In this contest, we shall take no prisoner, we are seriously desirous of uprooting that failed party from our state at the polls. The people of Delta state are tired of PDP leadership of underdevelopment and are ready for APC leadership. This is about good and bad choices.\n\nWhat\u2019s your relationship with the leadership of your party and how do you think you can bring more members into the APC fold?\n\nI have a good relationship with the leaders of the party. I believe in leadership and loyalty, we must follow leadership to succeed. Men and women of integrity, transparency and trust, l will bring personalities into my party and surely victory is ours. More like minds are joining the party, while those who don\u2019t believe or are impatient of working for the party\u2019s success are leaving. That\u2019s what happens in the transfer season. We allow those whose desire is to kill the party from the embryonic stage to go out of our party, the exit doors are open for them.\n\nIf elected Senator of the Federal Republic, which of the committees would you want to belong to be able to hearken to the aspirations of your constituents?\n\nI am a team player and will function well in any committee. There are four groups and three major ethnic groups, lsoko, ljaw, ltsekiri and Urhobo in Delta South. I believe in an inclusive political approach and all four ethnic groups will benefit from my leadership. I will establish constituency offices in all the LGAs where we interface with the communities, know their needs for us to represent them accordingly.\n\nIn human development, do you think you can bring the desired change to your people?\n\nYes, I am armed with my zeal for economic empowerment, human capital development, youth employment and security.\n\nThere are four distinctive tribes in your would-be constituency, how do you intend to relate with them?\n\nWith humility, courage to serve and being sensitive to the peoples\u2019 demands for economic and social development. Like I stated earlier, I will establish constituency offices in all the LGAs, employ service-oriented individuals from within the communities to man those offices for an accurate feedback system. With that style in place, the people can bear their minds in regular interactions with their Senator.\n\nDo you believe in power rotation?\n\nYes because it encourages inclusiveness and a sense of belonging.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "By Ikechukwu Odu\n\nOne of the University of Nigeria host communities, Obukpa, in Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State, on Thursday, filed locus in quo interlocutory application, which would compel an Enugu State High Court sitting in Nsukka to visit the scene of alleged environmental degradation by the university on the community.\n\nThe Counsel to the plaintiff, C.I Odo, while briefing newsmen on the outcome of the court sitting, said that the application has equally asked the court to stop the defendants, UNN and Viagem Property and Investment Limited from further construction work on the 11,900-room hostel allegedly degrading the host\u2019s environment.\n\nOdo argued that visiting the scene of the alleged environmental degradation would validate the claims made by the plaintiff against the defendants.\n\n\u201cToday was the continuation of the suit no N/86/2020, filed by Hon. Nnaemeka Aleke, on behalf of Obukpa community against the University of Nigeria, challenging the nuisance created by the University of Nigeria in the community. Prior to now, the activities of the university in the indiscriminate building of structures is threatening the existence of Obukpa community. The new structure that has just been awarded is being sited into an erosion direction thereby blocking free flow of erosion in the community.\n\n\u201cPart of the locus in quo interlocutory application we filed is to enable the court visit the the scene of incident to see what is actually happening there. It would look illusory if we are just talking. By the time the court visits the place, it would see the threatening or pulling down of structures, destruction of the access road of the community, the level of mosquito infestation in that community as a result of terrible flooding.\n\n\u201cWe are not against the University of Nigeria, instead we are saying that anything that would benefit the entire community should not suffocate us. Even if the community does not complain, it is part of the Corporate Social Responsibility of the University to create proper erosion channel without being prompted, \u201d the Counsel explained.\n\nHe also said that the matter has been adjourned to April 7, 2022 for ruling on the interlocutory application.\n\nIn his reaction, the Eze Ideke 1 of Opi Ancient Kingdom, HRM, Eze Willy Ezeugwu, while condemning the activities of the University of Nigeria on Obukpa community said it was against the natural law of justice for the university to punish its host.\n\nThe monarch explained that the community is not against development but that the university should not cause humanitarian crises through its construction works in any of the host communities.\n\nThe plaintiff, Hon. Aleke, said that the filing of the suit was necessitated by the long term neglect of the University in providing Corporate Social Responsibility to its hosts.\n\nHe said that victory is assured for his community given the avalanche of evidence against the University at their disposal.\n\nIn his reaction, the second Counsel to the defendants, O.J Uchenna, while talking with newsmen, said the matter has made substantial progress.\n\n\u201cThe plaintiff argued his position why an injunction should be granted, we argued our position why the court should not grant an injunction. The court has adjourned to rule on the point. So, substantial progress was made today,\u201d he said.\n\nJustice Matthew C. O Eluke, who presided over the suit adjourned ruling to April 7, 2022.",

Abike \u2013 Fadipe frowned at the prosecution and the defence counsel for wasting the time of the court as the trial could not commence.\n\nAbike-Fadipe enquired from the EFCC counsel, Mrs Bilikisu Buhari about the amended charge the anti-graft agency had sought to file against the former minister.\n\nBuhari, in her response, said that the EFCC had not taken any action on the amended charge.\n\nDefence counsel, Mr Wale Balogun, also told the judge he had not filed an application to get a copy of the proof of evidence from the EFCC because the EFCC had not amended it charge.\n\nThe judge said the parties in the suit had wasted precious judicial time of the court, noting that Balogun ought to have applied for the proof of evidence without waiting for the EFCC\u2019s amended charge.\n\nThe judge adjourned the case until Feb. 23 for commencement of trial.

          "text": "The House of Representatives has started moves to transfer assets of the defunct Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to NNPC Limited.\n\nSection 54 (1) of the Act states: \u201cThe Minister of Petroleum and Minister of Finance shall within 18 months of the effective date determine the assets, interests, and liabilities of NNPC to be transferred to NNPC Limited or its subsidiaries and upon identification, the Minister shall cause such assets, interests, and liabilities to be transferred to NNPC Limited.\u201d\n\nThe House Ad-hoc Committee, set up to ascertain the total inventory, assets, interests, and liabilities of the Corporation, said to this effect, it will meet with the Chief Executive Officer of NNPC Limited in the coming days.\n\nThe Ad-hoc Committee Chairman, Hon Kingsley Uju Chima, who disclosed this after their meeting, said they were also going to interface with the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning.\n\nChima said the Ad-hoc Committee had resolved to request for detailed information on NNPC assets, interests, liabilities and up-to-date audited reports from the CEO of NNPC Limited.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHe said they have also resolved to request for yearly audited reports of NNPC from Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) with a view to juxtaposing the NNPC audited reports with that of NEITI.\n\nHon. Chima observed that despite the abundant natural endowment, the oil and gas industry has been plagued with corruption, mismanagement, crisis, environmental degradation, lack of refining capacity, among others.\n\n\u201cThe decision of the House is in sync with the provisions of Sections 88 and 89 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended). It is also hinged on the provisions of Section 54 of the recently signed Petroleum Industry Act 2021.\n\n\u201cThe legislative intervention is in alliance with section A 1.03 of the introduction part of the Legislative Agenda of the 9th Assembly (2019 \u2013 2023) which states that, \u2018the 9th House will seek to undertake reforms of critical sectors of the Nigerian society and economy with a view to improving the conditions that allow for investment, innovation, and economic growth.\u2019\n\n\u201cCrude oil dominates Nigeria\u2019s economy and accounts for about 86% of export earnings in our country. We have the largest oil and gas reserves in Sub-Saharan Africa with an estimated 37 billion barrels of oil and 188 trillion cubic feet of gas as of July 2021.\n\n\u201cIt is depressing that, despite the abundant natural endowment, the oil and gas industry has been plagued with corruption, mismanagement, crisis, environmental degradation, lack of refining capacity, etc.\n\n\u201cSection 54(2) of the Act also stated that any assets, interests, or liabilities not transferred shall remain that of NNPC until extinguished or transferred to the government six months after the determination in section 54(1).\n\n\u201cThe Minister of Finance and Attorney General of the Federation shall develop a framework for payment of liabilities not transferred to the NNPC Limited. If the determination and transfer is not done within the stipulated 18 months, the assets, interests, and liabilities are deemed transferred to NNPC Limited,\u201d the chairman stated.\n\nHe continued,\u201d The Petroleum Industry Act, 2021 was enacted to cure the maladies of the oil and gas industry and provide legal governance, the regulatory and fiscal framework of the Industry. It came at a time when fossil fuel-reliant frontier markets are contending with the implications of the global transition to cleaner and renewable energy sources.\n\n\u201cIn the last 20 years, multiple governments have attempted to pass an all-encompassing petroleum industry bill which has been successfully done by the 9th Assembly. The PIA is categorized into five chapters, 319 Sections, and eight schedules.\n\n\u201cChapter 1 provides for the governance and institutions of the industry.

          "text": "Old age hath yet his honour and his toil; Death closes all: but something ere the end, Some work of noble note, may yet be done, Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.\u201d- Alfred Tennyson, Ulysses\n\nI was at a wedding of the sister to an associate of mine, angry at the non-presence of palm wine, I was obviously bitter as I had earlier served notice on this associate of mine that one would care for the drink of the gods as I wasn\u2019t agreeable with the green bottles he lavishly supplied to my table even when we were on the cusp of seeing the Old year off and welcoming 2022 when I received a call informing me of the demise of a one time Member of the Old Anambra State House of Assembly, commissioner for information and present Chairman of the board of the Federal Polytechnic Nekede, a father and a man who was like a friend, Chief Charles Amilo. Udobodo Enugwu Ukwu.\n\nI was immediately jolted by such news as I had earlier planned to go and pay him a visit in the new year, he had been sick and after seeing him in October last year where he had gifted me another big box of Coffee, we discussed a number of issues including his health and how he was pulling through, little did I know that such a day would be my last to see him.\n\nI pay homage to one of Anambra\u2019s finest politicians, scholar, encyclopedia of knowledge and image maker. I like Mark Anthony over the pyre of burning wood, much akin to the sorrows of losing such a man, yet but seek to extol the man, Chief Charles Amilo, sorry he was not a mere man, he was one of the Titans, the last of them, a model even in the cold ground.\n\nAmilo was born in 1945 and like every young lad had his primary and secondary education in the Eastern Nigeria region.As a brilliant mind, Amilo was to attend the University of Nigeria, Nsukka from 1967 to 1974 where he obtained a degree in Microbiology. Seeking further the golden fleece,Amilo went on to obtain a Masters Degree in Rutgers University from 1976 to 1978.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nWith the first stanza of the retirement of soldiers to the barracks, Amilo was elected as a Member of the Old Anambra State House of Assembly during the 2nd Republic under the platform of the National Party of Nigeria., NPN. One of the shining lights of that House, Amilo was to distinguish himself across party and legislative lines that he was gifted with another term. Using the gift of garb, oratory and a rich knowledge of the nation\u2019s history, Amilo, effusively weighed in on several debates and helped the House pass numerous motions and bills.\n\nAgain, in the botched Third Republic, Udobodo participated in the politics of that era, ensuring that the likes of Chukwuemeka Ezeife emerged as Governor of Anambra State. By 2005, with the heightened battle royale between Governor Chris Ngige and his estranged godfather , Chris Uba, there was the general consensus that the gains of the then Ngige administration was not been marketed positively to the public. A quick search of capable hands were sought and within days the name Amilo was all over the place, his nomination was to follow suit and Ndi Anambra began to feel the difference.\n\nI will always remember my first meeting with Chief Amilo in Awka,circa 2009. Amilo candidly listened to my request to join the Chris Ngige Media Machinery that was been set up for the 2010 polls, that was after he had read some of my articles then in the dailies. Amilo not only\n\nensured that I was appointed into the media committee, he also sought to give me the neccesary encouragement then as a young man,\n\nToday, I am a voice heard because of the opportunity he gave me, I recall how I would reach out to Amilo and he would bellow \u201d Ah, I just read your column in the Nation, well done Arinze\u201d I can only say that it was his words of encouragement over the years that landed me such an opportunity and many more because he, Amilo believed much in me.\n\nAmilo was an encyclopedia of knowledge; history and politics are at his beck and call, I still remember the numerous times he would regale us with stories of the 1st Republic\u2019s politics, the alliance between the NCNC and the Action Group to form the United Progressives Grand Alliance, UPGA and the Civil War. I recall the day, he and ECJ Nwosu had a fierce but yet friendly and enlightening argument on who won the 1983 guber elections in old Anambra. Amilo against all voices present that day and entitled to comment vehemently insisted that it was C.C Onoh\u2019s NPN, his party that had won; much to Kpakpando\u2019s angst who countered that it was Jim\u2019s NPP that actually won.\n\nOne key trait of Amilo was his loyalty to causes he believed in. Amilo\u2019s loyalty was not only to those who occupied offices as is the present trend, nope, Udobodo would always stick with his principles as well as his friends, both young and old. A clear example was his relationship with Chris Ngige, who after leaving office saw a huge majority of his lieutenants seeking new camps, Udobodo stuck with Ngige, despite the latter\u2019s notoriety for clannish politics and even when it was not favourable to him (Amilo). This makes him a shining example to our youth,for in an era where many switch parties at the speed faster than light, Udobodo in his Herculean manner remained steadfast to his principles.\n\nAs I write this piece, I mull over our last meeting, where I had frank discussions with him, I shudder that he is no more, that sonorous voice and gentle soul that would always seek peace even with his identified enemies. I yet again recall the numerous times he would call me to admonish me on some of my exuberances, particularly that quick temper or righteous anger as I would style it and he would simply say, \u201cI did not teach you this way\u201d. Indeed, he was like a father figure to many and a man of many parts, Amilo was an enigma and it is my hope that he will find peace with his creator.",

          "text": "From Adetutu Folasade-Koyi, Abuja\n\nThe Federal Government has identified 96 financiers of terrorism, involving about 123 companies, including 33 bureaux de change.\n\nGovernment has also identified 26 bandits and seven co-conspirators linked to financing of terrorism in Nigeria.\n\nAlso, 424 associates of the terrorism were identified, with 45 suspects arrested and to be prosecuted.\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, disclosed these at a press conference on government\u2019s anti-corruption war, in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nThese discoveries were made by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) between 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe NFIU, the minister added, identified N7.647trillion VAT, WHT hidden from govt.\n\nHowever, Mohammed neither revealed the names of the terrorism financiers nor those holding onto the N7.674 trillion owed the Federal Government.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor its part, the analysis by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU), in 2020-2021, the minister said, revealed 96 financiers of terrorism in Nigeria, 424 associates/supporters of the financiers, involvement of about 123 companies and 33 bureaux de change, in addition to identifying 26 suspected bandits/kidnappers and 7 co-conspirators.\n\n\u201cThe analysis has resulted in the arrest of 45 suspects who will soon face prosecution and seizure of assets. Also, from its analysis of tax evasion and tax avoidance linked to corruption. NFIU has identified N3,909,707,678,112.in VAT and N3,737,918,335,785.in Withholding Tax due to the government.\n\n\u201cNFIU has also sent 1,165 intelligence reports on cases of corruption, money laundering and other serious offences to 27 domestic agencies for investigation, prosecution and asset recovery\u2026\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nLast September, Attorney General of the Federation and Justice Minister, Abubakar Shehu Malami tsaid in New York, the US that, in addition to identifying and detaining high profile individuals with links to terrorism in the country, the Federal Government had succeeded in blocking the sources of funding.\n\nFour months earlier, the Justice minister had said that government would prosecute about 400 suspected Boko Haram financiers and was profiling some high-profile Nigerians strongly suspected to be financing terrorism for prosecution.\n\nNevertheless, at the media parley, yesterday, the Information Minister added that government has, so far, recovered N700 billion through its whistleblower policy.\n\nThe minister also disclosed that through deployment of the Bank Verification Number (BVN) to verify the federal government\u2019s payroll on the IPPIS platform, so far led to the detection of 54,000 fraudulent payroll entries.\n\nHe said:\u201dIt is common knowledge that one of the most difficult tasks for any government is to fight corruption, because when you fight corruption, corruption will fight you back! This explains why naysayers have continued to belittle or dismiss the Administration\u2019s anti-corruption efforts.\n\n\u201cLet me say here that fighting corruption is a marathon, and never a sprint. Also, investigations, arrests, prosecutions and asset forfeiture \u2013 which are the immediate, visible indices by which many measure success in tackling corruption, constitute \u2013 as important as they are \u2013 just a part of the strategies to combat corruption\u2026\n\n\u201cAlso, against stiff opposition, the Buhari Administration has expanded the coverage of IPPIS. TSA and IPPIS remain an unfolding revolution in public finance in Nigeria that have incorporated transparency and accountability into the system. The use of BVN to verify the Federal Government\u2019s payroll on the IPPIS platform has, so far, led to the detection of 54,000 fraudulent payroll entries\u2026The Whistle-blower Policy, an initiative of the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning\u2026 is meant to encourage the voluntary disclosure of information about fraud, bribery and looted government funds, including financial misconduct and any other form of corruption or theft.\n\n\u201cThe Whistle Blower whose information leads to recovery is entitled to 2.5 to 5 percent from the recovered funds. Information and tips received are usually referred to the EFCC, ICPC, and NFIU for further painstaking investigation. The policy has helped in the cleansing of IPPIS, led to compliance on TSA and enhanced the Procurement Act 2007. As at 2020, a total of N700 billion has been recovered through the Whistle-Blower Policy.\u201d\n\nMohammed also explained that, contrary to public perception, it is not in all cases that the whistle blower gets a reward.\n\n\u201cTips or information are forwarded to ICPC, police, EFCC. They are to confirm if truly the person is a whistleblower or not. It\u2019s only when your whistle blowing leads to recovery that he/she is paid. Not before,\u201d he added.",

We will try to reach everybody on the need for the South East to produce the next president,\u201d he said.\n\nHe described the president of South East origin as an idea whose time has come, and reminded Nigerians that at 62, the country needed introspective and retrospective thinking to reassess its journey so far as a nation or as a country.\n\nHe restated that the Igbo were not secessionists or separatists, adding that they were prepared, and deserved the presidency because it was politically defensible and morally justifiable.\n\n\u201cIf the truth must be told, the nation has made two consistent mistakes that have worsened the country\u2019s other problems leading the nation to near breaking points.\n\n\u201cThese two devils in Nigerian politics are power sharing and social injustice. In all, we drifted into these two problems with nonchalance or with ease, and sometimes, oblivious of their consequences until what we think is a simple or easy problem develops into a national disaster or catastrophe. For those who can remember, how did we get into the Western Region crisis in the 1960s? How did we get to the civil war (1967-1970)? How did we get to NADECO (Abiola crisis) and even South South Avengers?\n\n\u201cToday, the situation of the country is not totally different but even more complicated. Today, indeed, the way things are, with communication and modern technology, our country is set not only at the usual breaking points which were more easily controlled and contained in the past to preserve Nigerian unity, but a point of synchronised national crisis which will be more difficult to be controlled or contained today.\n\n\u201cNigeria was a country negotiated and amalgamated under some agreements that balanced sensitive issues of power-sharing and balancing of power regardless of any other conditions.

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nBorno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, has urged the Federal Government to take necessary steps to stop the spread of Islamic State\u2019s West Africa Province (ISWAP), the militant group and administrative division of Islamic State (IS), a Salafi jihadist group or else Boko Haram attacks will be a child\u2019s play in Nigeria.\n\nWhile urging the Nigerian Army to re-strategise and defeat ISWAP, Zulum said there was nothing wrong if the Federal Government requested external help in fighting insurgency as some of the advanced countries, including the United States and United Kingdom often ask for external help.\n\nThe governor also raised the alarm that two local government areas in the state were not occupied by human population owing to the inability of the military to effectively protect residents against terrorists.\n\nHe stated this at the 28th briefing by the Presidential Communication Team at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, decrying the recruitment process into the armed forces and other security agencies, saying unless the trend was addressed the country\u2019s insecurity challenge would continue to deteriorate.\n\nThe Borno governor said while early preparation is key towards the 2023 elections, it should not be done at the expense of losing focus on insecurity.\n\nHe lauded President Muhammadu Buhari for always granting him audience whenever he sought one saying \u201cone of the major reason why we have been succeeding in the North East, particularly in Borno State, is because of one major fundamental thing. There was never a time I requested to see Mr. President and I was denied access.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut notwithstanding all the contributions of the Federal Government, we still have some challenges. One, I said it before, a growing number of ISWAP in some parts of the state is a matter of great concern to everybody. Why? They are in the shores of the Lake Chad, again in southern Borno State. Luckily enough, I was told there was military deployment yesterday (Wednesday) to southern Borno State to fight insurgents in the Tudun Katarangwa.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

And we shall do everything possible to defeat ISWAP. Otherwise, what Boko Haram did will be a child\u2019s play.\n\n\u201cThis is an early warning system Nigerian Army has to re-strategise and defeat ISWAP. ISWAP will be a threat to the entire nation. Because of the proximity of the Sub-Saharan Africa, they are coming from Libya and others resettling here.\n\n\u201cAnd then whether we like it or not a few days ago, I\u2019 have said something about two local governments still not occupied by human population. I think that there is some certain level of misunderstanding. Some say that two local governments are under the control of Boko Haram, no. Two local governments are not occupied by human population. But whether we like it or not, if two local governments are not occupied, what does it mean? It means the capacity is not there to protect this human population to go to this local government areas.\n\n\u201cWhile Nigeria is providing a lot of things, the Federal Government is buying equipment, there is the need for us to seek support from external agencies to defeat this insurgents once and for all before the matter will reach other parts of the nation. This is very important, whether we like it or not, we have existing gaps that we needs to be to filled and this gap by now cannot be filled without external support.\u201d\n\nHe tasked the military to ensure immediate resettlement of people to Malam Fatori, which is the headquarters of Abadam LGA and Ogunbaden which is the headquarters of Mainari LGA.\n\nThe governor who listed various successes recorded by his administration, said the insurgency had triggered acute humanitarian and post-displacement crisis with devastating social and economic impact on the population, further deepening fragility and poverty in the North East region before the APC government came to the rescue.",

          "text": "*Says it\u2019s time to consider hiring mercenaries\n\n*Canvasses change in security agencies\u2019 recruitment process\n\n*Govt tracks, identifies 96 financiers, 123 companies, 33 Bureau-de-change, others involved in terrorism\n\nIyobosa Uwugiaren, Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha in Abuja and Francis Sardauna in Katsina\n\nBorno State Governor, Professor Babagana Zulum, yesterday, expressed concern about the increasing sophistication and spread of the terrorist group, Islamic State\u2019s West Africa Province (ISWAP), in the state. Zulum said the federal government must do everything in its power to defeat ISWAP now, or else the menace constituted by the Boko Haram terrorist sect would be nothing compared to what the group would do when they gain stability.\n\nHe advised the government to seek external help in the fight against insurgency, including hiring mercenaries, saying there is nothing wrong with such. He cited the fact that advanced countries, like United States and United Kingdom, sometimes sought external help.\n\nThe governor took a swipe at the current recruitment process into the armed forces and other security agencies, saying unless it is addressed, the security situation may just get worse.\n\nIn a related development, the federal government, yesterday, said an analysis by the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) between 2020 and 2021 had revealed some 96 financiers of terrorism in the country, 424 associates of the financiers, and involvement of about 123 companies and 33 bureaux de change. It said the inquiry also identified 26 suspected bandits/kidnappers and seven co-conspirators.\n\nZulum, who spoke yesterday at the State House, Abuja, during a media briefing, however, attributed the successes so far recorded against insurgency in his state to the free access he had to President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nAccording to the governor, \u201cNotwithstanding all the contributions of the federal government, we still have some challenges. One, I said it before, a growing number of ISWAP in some parts of the state is a matter of great concern to everybody. Why? They are in the shores of the Lake Chad, again in southern Borno State. Luckily enough, I was told there was military deployment yesterday (Wednesday) to southern Borno State to fight the insurgents in the Tudun Katarangwa.\n\n\u201cBut I think this is the early warning system. We shouldn\u2019t allow ISWAP to grow. ISWAP are more sophisticated, more funded and they\u2019re more educated. And we should do everything possible to defeat ISWAP; otherwise, what Boko Haram did will be a child\u2019s play.\n\n\u201cThis is an early warning system. Nigerian Army has to re-strategise and defeat ISWAP. ISWAP will be a threat to the entire nation, because of the proximity of Sub-Saharan Africa. They are coming from Libya and others resettling here.\u201d\n\nZulum listed various successes recorded by his administration. He said before the advent of the All Progressive Congress (APC), the insurgency had triggered acute humanitarian and post-displacement crisis, with devastating social and economic consequences on the population, which further deepened fragility and poverty in the North-east region.\n\nZulum said the outcome of the recovery and peace-building assessment by the World Bank, European Union (EU), and the United Nations (UN) revealed that the total sum of $6.9 billion was lost as a result of the insurgency in the entire North-east states, with Borno incurring over two-thirds of the losses.\n\nHe said the insurgents had destroyed about 5,000 classrooms in the state, and 800 municipal buildings, comprising local government ssecretariats, prisons, and traditional rulers\u2019 buildings, among others. He added that the terrorists also destroyed about 713 energy distribution lines and about 1,600 water sources, and produced an estimated 49,311 widows and about 49,974 orphans.\n\nWhile describing the above as \u201cofficial figures\u201d, he contended, \u201cThe unofficial figures are more than this\u201d. He said before now, out of 27 local governments in Borno State, at a time, about 22 of them were under the control of Boko Haram insurgents.\n\nZulum recalled that there was a time the state had only one access to road to Maiduguri, which was from Kano to Maiduguri.\n\n\u201cThe magnitude of the destruction was scary,\u201d he said, adding that, today, the situation is better.\n\nZulum stressed, \u201cI want to say something categorically. One of the major reasons why we have been succeeding in the North-east, in particular in Borno State, is because of one major fundamental thing: there was never a time I requested to see Mr. President and I was denied access.\n\n\u201cAnd then whether we like it or not, a few days ago, I\u2019ve said something about two local governments still not occupied by human population. I think that there is some misunderstanding. Some say that two local governments are under the control of Boko Haram, no. Two local governments are not occupied by human population. But whether we like it or not, it\u2019s right because if two local governments are not occupied, what does it mean?\n\n\u201cIt means the capacity is not there to protect this human population to go to this local government areas. But we\u2019re working with the Nigerian Army to ensure immediate resettlement of people to Malam Fatori, which is the headquarters of Abadam local government. And again, Ogunbaden, headquarters of Mainari local government.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying that these two local government are under their control, but these two local governments are not under human occupation. We need support from the federal government to support the relocation of these people to these local government areas. This committee that has been constituted by the federal government will look into these matters, among others.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the second challenge was Lake Chad. He explained, \u201cWe want clearance of the shores of the Lake Chad. Again, in conclusion, while the challenge of insecurity is being solved gradually, it is not yet over.\n\n\u201cI have said it times without number that in addition to what we are doing, there is a need for government to rethink and look into the possibility of hiring mercenaries. I have said it times without number, there\u2019s nothing wrong. America, Britain, and many more countries that are stronger than Nigeria, who used to seek support outside, there\u2019s nothing wrong, because this problem has been compounded. And it\u2019s not easy for us to solve the security challenges that we\u2019re having now.\n\n\u201cWhile Nigeria is providing a lot of things, the federal government is buying equipment, there is the need for us to seek support from external agencies to defeat these insurgents once and for all before the matter will reach other parts of the nation. This is very important, whether we like it or not, we have existing gaps that we need to fill and this gap by now cannot be filled without external support, while we continue to build our own institutions, training and retraining.\n\n\u201cOne very serious challenge that we have, our recruitment process has to be looked into. Yes, you can just say recruitment for army, collecting notes from governors, ministers and others and the people are queuing in. As long as we are not willing to sanitise our recruitment procedures into the armed forces, police, SSS and others, we will not get the right people. This is something that needs to be done. The truth is bitter.\n\n\u201cAnd then funding is critical. Yes, funding to our military. Let us investigate how much has trickled down. The commanding officers are important; procurement processes are also very important. Then stronger solidarity among the security forces and sustained campaigns are needed to finish off the remnants of the insurgents in the fringes of the North-east. It is very important.\n\n\u201cThe resettlement needs to go hand-in-hand with livelihood support and more resources are needed to do more for the people. Greater understanding is required of the security forces to support protection, action in places of resettlement, and all over Borno.\n\n\u201cThe last, but not the least, we must not allow the 2023 general election to shift our attention completely away from the focus and restoration of peace in North-east and, indeed, other parts of the nation.\u201d\n\nMinister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who also spoke in Abuja while detailing Buhari\u2019s fight against corruption and terrorism, stated that an analysis by the NFIU had resulted in the arrest of 45 suspects, who will soon face prosecution and seizure of assets.\n\nMohammed said, \u201cAlso, from its analysis of tax evasion and tax avoidance linked to corruption, NFIU has identified N3.90 trillion VAT and N3.7 trillion in Withholding Tax due to the government. NFIU has also sent 1,165 intelligence reports on cases of corruption, money laundering, and other serious offences to 27 domestic agencies for investigation, prosecution and asset recovery.\n\n\u201cOn terrorism financing, NFIU had intelligence exchanges on Boko Haram, ISWAP, banditry, kidnapping and others with 19 countries. During the same period, 2020-2021, the organisation returned fraudulently-obtained funds totalling US$103,722,102.83, 3,000 Pound Sterling; 7,695 Singapore Dollar and 1,091 Euros to 11 countries of victims, who came into the country.\u201d\n\nTo check terrorism financing in Nigeria, the minister explained that the federal government had deployed a plethora of tools, including Money Laundering Act, 2004; EFCC Act, 2004; ICPC Act, 2000; Department of State Services (DSS); and NFIU to deal with the issue of corruption, money laundering and terror-financing.\n\nHe said the on-going harmonisation of Bank Verification Numbers (BVN) with National Identification Numbers (NIN) was also a means of tracking the flow of funds within Nigeria and, by extension, tackling terror financing.\n\nMohammed said one of the three major policy planks of the Buhari administration was the fight against corruption, with the others being to tackle insecurity and also to revamp the economy.\n\nThe minister said, \u201cIt is common knowledge that one of the most difficult tasks for any government is to fight corruption, because when you fight corruption, corruption will fight you back! This explains why naysayers have continued to belittle or dismiss the administration\u2019s anti-corruption efforts.\n\n\u201cLet me say here that fighting corruption is a marathon, and never a sprint. Also, investigations, arrests, prosecutions and asset forfeiture, which are the immediate, visible indices by which many measure successes in tackling corruption, constitute as important as they are just a part of the strategies to combat corruption.\u201d\n\nMohammed said the federal government had taken bold steps to streamline cumbersome bureaucratic processes in the implementation of government policies, checking corrupt practices, and ensuring accountability in the implementation, as well as delivery of the policies.\n\nThe areas of reform, according to him, included the Treasury Single Account (TSA), Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS), Petroleum Industry Act, Financial Autonomy for State Legislature and Judiciary (2020), Whistle-Blower Policy, Assets Recovery, Justice and Law reforms, and Nigeria\u2019s membership of the Open Government Partnership.\n\nOn TSA, the minister said the system had been implemented in more than 90 per cent of the federal ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) and it had resulted in the consolidation of more than 17,000 bank accounts previously spread across Deposit Money Banks in the country, and monthly savings of an average of N4 billion in bank charges.\n\nOn Monetary recoveries, Mohammed revealed that in 2021 alone, EFCC recovered a total of N152,088,698,751.64; 1,182,519.75 Pounds Sterling; 50 Emirati Dirham; 1,723,310 Saudi Riyal; 1,900 South African Rand; US$386,220,202.85; 156,246.76 Euros; 1,400 Canadian Dollars; 5.36957319 Bitcoin; and 0.09012 Ethereum.\n\nHe explained ICPC\u2019s pivotal role in bringing about structural changes in the operations of the government, especially, regarding improvements in MDAs budget utilisation, better value for money, improved project completion, service delivery and higher level of anti-corruption awareness.\n\nAccording to the minister, \u201cBetween 2019 and 2021, ICPC traced 2,000 projects worth over N300 billion. During the same period, 326 contractors of abandoned projects across the six geo-political zones were forced by the commission to return to site to complete projects worth N32.183 billion.\n\n\u201cThe ICPC\u2019s Assets Tracing, Recovery and Management (ATRM) project led to the recovery of cash totalling N34.346 billion and US$1.62 million between 2019 and 2021. Also, the commission\u2019s System Study and Review of personnel and capital votes of MDAs resulted in savings of N261 billion to the government between 2019 and 2021. ICPC has also secured 66 convictions from the 243 cases.\n\nMeanwhile, terrorists, in the early hours of yesterday, attacked Daddaran-Liman community in Jibia Local Government Area of Katsina State and killed the Village Head of Yan-Gayya, Alhaji Jafaru Rabiu, and five other villagers.\n\nA resident of the area, Abdulmalik Usman, who confirmed the incident to THISDAY on telephone, said the hoodlums also injured six persons and kidnapped scores, including children and elderly women.\n\nUsman said, \u201cThe terrorists attacked Daddaran-Liman in the early hours of today (Thursday) and killed Magaji Yan-Gayya, his house help, Mansir Danye, and four people. They also kidnapped many people, including children.\u201d\n\nHe explained that an armoured personnel carrier belonging to the Nigeria Police, which was deployed to the community to repel the terrorists\u2019 invasion \u201cdeveloped technical problem and couldn\u2019t serve the purpose.\u201d\n\nBut the state Police Public Relations Officer, Gambo Isah, while confirming the incident to THISDAY, said the hoodlums, armed with sophisticated weapons, killed five people. Isah added that the criminals kidnapped almost everybody in the community but police operatives engaged them in a gun duel and rescued \u201call the abductees on the spot\u201d.\n\nIsah, a superintendent of police, said, \u201cYesterday (Wednesday) around 2300hrs, terrorists in large number with AK-47 rifles attacked Daddara village. They were shooting sporadically. In fact, according to the DPO, they gathered almost everybody in that village.\n\n\u201cBut our men engaged the terrorists in a gun duel and they were able to rescue all the people. When they scanned the area, they discovered that five people were killed and six persons were taken to the hospital injured. Those killed include the Magaji Yan-Gayya.\u201d\n\nHe noted that terrorists, under the camp of Dan-Karami and other criminal gangs, had migrated to the state as a result of the on-going military operations in Sokoto, Zamfara and Kebbi.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhat is happening presently in Katsina is as a result of on-going operations in Sokoto, Zamfara and Kebbi states. These terrorists have been down to Katsina because that place is too hot for them.\n\n\u201cLike the camp of Dan-Karami, some groups of Bello Turji are presently in Jibia. So, that is the issue we are having now. I believe a combined operation of military and other security organisations is in the pipeline with a view to tackling the hoodlums.\u201d\n\nPDP Shades APC over Claim, Says It\u2019s Even Struggling to Lie\n\nThe leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, described the claims by the Minister of Information and Orientation, Alhaji Lai Mohammed that the federal government had discovered sponsors of terrorism in the country as part of President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) administration as shameless lies from barefaced thieves, who had pawned their souls to the devil.\n\nThe PDP, which shaded the APC, had reacted to the claims by the minister that the APC government had uncovered 96 sponsors of terrorism and arrested 45 persons confirmed to be terrorists adding that the government was even struggling to lie.\n\nAccording to a late night statement by the National Publicity Secretary of the opposition party, Debo Oligunagba, the PD position was predicated on what it described as desperate attempt by the Buhari administration to whitewash itself by sending Mohammed, whose stock-in-trade was well known to assault the sensibilities of Nigerians with litany of fake claims on anti-corruption and anti-terrorism fight, when in reality the administration was sinking deeper into the abyss of failure on such planks.\n\nThe PDP said the APC administration was unsettled by the Transparency International (TI) Report, which ranked Nigeria under Buhari as the second most corrupt country in West Africa and 154 out of 180 in Global Corruption Index, given APC\u2019s humongous corruption,including the exposed looting of over N16 trillion public funds by APC leaders and their cronies in government.\n\n\u201cIn its ludicrous anti-corruption scorecard, the APC government has no response to the reported looting of $25 billion under its watch as detailed in the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) leaked memo under its watch.\n\n\u201cThe APC government should give answers to the reported stealing of N165 billion in the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA), the N1.5 trillion and $9.5 million reportedly stolen from Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), the $65 million frittered from the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) as well as the N90 billion reportedly looted from the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS).\n\n\u201cThis is in addition to the reported looting of N33 billion from the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), the reported stealing of over N18 billion from the rehabilitation of IDPs in the North East, the over N25 billion from the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) as well as the looting of N500 billon Social Investment Programme Fund as revealed by the First Lady, Aisha Buhari, among others,\u201d the main opposition party said.\n\nFurthermore, the PDP said in the very pathetic attempt to conceal the apparent complicity of the APC in the advent and continuing insecurity in the country, the minister laboured strenuously and claimed that the APC government had uncovered 96 sponsors of terrorism and arrested 45 persons confirmed to be terrorists.\n\n\u201cThis is laughable, because Nigerians know that the APC administration habours within its rank a self-confessed terrorism apologist, Dr. Isa Pantami, who superintend over the very critical Ministry of Communication and its agencies, which are very vital in any meaningful fight against terrorism\n\n\u201cNigerians ask: if the APC cannot purge itself of a self-confessed terrorism apologist, how can it claim to have effectively confronted terrorism in the country? The PDP restates its demand to the APC to publish the names and details of those it claims to be sponsors of terrorism and those it claims to have been arrested,\u201d the party stated.\n\nOlogunagba, however, said Nigerians had decoded the lying propensity of the APC and could no longer be hoodwinked, adding: \u201cLike everything in life, the lies and propaganda of the APC at every election cycle has expiry date and as such, the APC should expect the inevitable crushing verdict of the people in the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Osinbajo: Democratic election only way to government change\n\nDeji Elumoye and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has reiterated its commitment to democracy, saying it has decided to move in military force to stabilise countries under the threat of military take-over. The regional bloc disclosed this after an Extraordinary Summit in Accra, yesterday, chaired by Ghana\u2019s President and Chairperson of ECOWAS, Nana Akufo-Addo.\n\nA communiqu\u00e9 at the end of the meeting strongly condemned the attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Guinea Bissau and expressed solidarity with President Umaro Sissoco Embalo and the people of Guinea Bissau. ECOWAS decided to deploy a force with view to stabilising the country.\n\nThe sub-regional body also decided to maintain the military and police components of the ECOWAS Mission in The Gambia (ECOMIG) to consolidate stability in the country.\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 said, \u201cThe Authority was briefed by H.E. Suzi Carla BARBOSA, Senior Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Cooperation and the Diaspora of Guinea Bissau, on the circumstances surrounding the attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Guinea Bissau on 1st February 2022.\n\n\u201cThe Authority firmly condemned the attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Guinea Bissau and expressed solidarity with President Umaro Sissoco Embalo and the people of Guinea Bissau.\n\n\u201cIn view of these recent developments, the Authority decides to deploy a force with a view to supporting the stabilisation of the country.\n\n\u201cThe Authority further decides to maintain the military and police components of the ECOWAS Mission in The Gambia (ECOMIG) to consolidate stability in the country.\n\n\u201cThe Authority affirms its commitment to stand firm for the protection of democracy and freedom in the region and reiterates its resolute stance to upholding the principle of zero tolerance for ascension to power through unconstitutional means, as enshrined in the 2001 ECOWAS Supplementary Protocol on Democracy and Good governance.\u201d\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 also stated that the West African leaders decided to uphold the suspension of Burkina Faso from all ECOWAS institutions until the restoration of constitutional order. It called on the military authorities in Guinea Bissau to establish the transition institutions, adopt a transition calendar, and facilitate the return to constitutional order within the shortest time possible.\n\nThe West African leaders instructed the commission to ensure continuous engagement with the new authorities through the establishment of a monitoring mechanism, including African Union and United Nations, with a view to helping the transition process.\n\nOn the political situation in the Republic of Mali, ECOWAS took note of the recent establishment of the National Transition Council (CNT), as the legislative body, but expressed concern over the unavailability of the required transition calendar five months after the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, as requested by the Extraordinary Session of the ECOWAS Authority of Heads of States and Government held on 16th September 2021.\n\nIt stated, \u201cThe Authority welcomes the conclusions of the 1057th meeting of the Peace and Security Council (PSC) of the African Union held on 14th January 2022 endorsing all the ECOWAS decisions and sanctions on Mali.\n\n\u201cThe Authority regrets the unavailability of a new timetable in line with the decisions of the Authority. Consequently, the Authority decides to: Uphold all the sanctions imposed on Mali in line with its decision of 9 January 2022.\n\n\u201cUrge the Malian authorities to urgently propose an acceptable electoral timetable to ECOWAS with a view to enabling the progressive lifting of the sanctions. Remain seized of the situation in Mali.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, ECOWAS reaffirms its readiness to work in conjunction with the African Union and the United Nations to provide the necessary technical support to the authorities in Burkina Faso, Guinea and Mali in implementing the approved timetables.\u201d\n\nThe resurgence of military coups on the continent had forced some analysts to call for the establishment of ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), a military force to protect democracy in the sub-region.\n\nECOMOG was a formal arrangement for separate armies to work together. It was largely supported by personnel and resources of the Nigerian Armed Forces, with sub-battalion strength units contributed by other ECOWAS members, which included Ghana, Guinea, Sierra Leone, The Gambia, Liberia, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger.\n\nWhile the protocol on Mutual Defence Assistance was signed in Freetown, on May 29, 1981, Anglophone ECOWAS members were said to have established ECOMOG in 1990 to intervene in the civil war in Liberia (1989 to 1996).\n\nECOMOG had been described as the first credible attempt at a regional security initiative in Africa.\n\nMeanwhile, the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, stressed that as far as ECOWAS was concerned, there was only one way of changing government in the region, which was through democratic election. Osinbajo disclosed this after attending the ECOWAS Extraordinary Summit in Accra.\n\nThe vice president, according to a statement by his media assistant, Laolu Akande, was responding to reporters\u2019 questions about how the summit of the leaders fared.\n\nOsinbajo was quoted as saying, \u201cI think it has been fruitful, the Heads of State, again, reiterated the firm position that had been taken earlier that there is absolutely no excuse for a change of government by coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\n\n\u201cSo, what happened in Burkina Faso was considered and has been condemned by all of the heads of state and we do not think there is any excuse for it whatsoever.\n\n\u201cBut at the moment, of course, engagement is going on with the military junta and also we condemned the attempted coup in Guinea-Bissau and congratulated President Embalo and the people of Guinea-Bissau for resisting that unconstitutional attempt to change the government.\n\n\u201cAll in all, it has been fruitful and we are very hopeful that lessons had been learnt and we will not see a repeat of this.\u201d\n\nAsked about the situation in Mali, the vice president said, \u201cWe are expecting that the Malian authorities would respond to ECOWAS imposed sanctions, as you know, and we expect that at some point, the Malian authorities themselves would begin to speed up the process of transition. We expect that they would do so. We are looking forward to that engagement.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Udora Orizu in Abuja\n\nThe House of Representatives has begun moves to transfer assets belonging to the defunct Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to the newly established Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited, in line with the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA). The lawmakers had for this purpose set up an ad-hoc committee to ascertain the total inventory, assets, interests and liabilities of the NNPC before transferring it to NNPC Limited, to ensure a glossary accounting system.\n\nSection 53(2-5) of the PIA stipulates that government of the federation shall hold full ownership of the NNPC Limited with the share held by the duo of Federal Ministry of Finance Incorporated and Ministry of Petroleum Incorporated on behalf of the government of the federation.\n\nSection 53(5-8) of the PIB Act stipulates government\u2019s intention to set in motion the process of immediate commercialisation and privatisation of the operation and future private ownership of NNPC Limited.\n\nSimilarly, Section 54 of the Act provides that \u201call assets and liabilities of the NNPC will be transferred to NNPC Limited.\u201d The ministers of Petroleum and Finance are saddled with the responsibility of determining the assets, interests and liabilities of NNPC, which are to be transferred within 18 months of the PIA coming into effect.\n\nChairman of the committee, Hon. Kingsley Uju Chima, who presided over a meeting of the panel, said there were plans to meet with Chief Executive Officer of NNPC Limited, Mele Kyari, soon. Chima said there would be an interface with Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva; Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele; and Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zanaib Ahmed on the matter.\n\nThe committee by its mandate would also request yearly audited reports of NNPC from the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) to compare with the NNPC audited reports with that of the agency.\n\nAddressing the meeting, Chima said the oil and gas industry was still faced with corruption, mismanagement, crisis, and environmental degradation, lack of refining capacity.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe decision of the House is in sync with the provisions of Sections 88and 89 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended). It is also hinged on the provisions of Section 54 of the recently signed Petroleum Industry Act. 2021.\n\n\u201cThe legislative intervention is in alliance with Section A 1.03 of the introduction part of the Legislative Agenda of the 9th Assembly (2019 \u2013 2023), which states, \u2018The 9th House will seek to undertake reforms of critical sectors of the Nigerian society and economy with a view to improving the conditions that allow for investment, innovation and economic growth.\u2019\n\n\u201cCrude oil dominates Nigeria\u2019s economy and account for about 86 per cent of export earnings in our country.

          "text": "An Abuja multi-billion-naira International Cancer Centre (ICC) is yet to take off 12 years after the project was established.\n\n\n\nMrs Turai Yar\u2019Adua, the wife of the late former president, Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, was the brains behind the establishment of the centre that is located on Nnamdi Azikiwe Airport Road in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nIt was said that her aim was to build a cancer centre in the nation\u2019s capital that would cater for people, especially the poor.\n\n\n\nThe project was designed to be fully private driven and meant to provide comprehensive cancer diagnosis, management, treatment and care, as well as promote excellence in cancer education, training and research.\n\n\n\nHowever, funds were raised for the project on July 18, 2009, in Abuja, where financial pledges were made by the rich and powerful to actualise her dream amounting to N6.8 billion, hence the ICC was born.\n\n\n\nTwelve years after, the centre has been abandoned, with the multi-billion-naira equipment and mini-buses already procured for the project rusting away, The Guardian reports.\n\n\n\nIt was learnt that no fewer than 200 mini-buses parked at the open space in the middle of the compound were moved to a hidden side of the premises.\n\n\n\nThe Guardian reports that there was no sign of activity there except one white utility vehicle, Hilux, seen driving into the facility when the location was visited.\n\n\n\nThe entrance gate was said to be locked, noting that it took several knocks before a policeman guarding the place opened to find out who the visitor was and what their mission was.\n\n\n\nAfter exchanging greetings, the correspondent told the officer that she was there to find out whether the centre was already accepting patients and would like to see any of the staff who could provide information on procedures for booking an appointment, to which the policeman replied: \u201cOh, they have not started, but I believe they will start soon.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Guardian gathered that the centre\u2019s inability to take off is a concern, not only to Nigerians but also to the government.\n\n\n\nThe report also revealed that the Federal Ministry of Health had reached out to the former First Lady through the Director-General that would be in charge of the facility to have a meeting with her but the plan never worked out.\n\n\n\nA reliable source close to the health ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cWe were made to understand that the centre belongs to her NGO. At a point, the government tried to get across to her but it didn\u2019t work out. Even now, the legal department has been directed to find out how she acquired the land and whom the land was allocated to, let\u2019s start from the basis.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWe raised a memo, we want to know about the land allocation but it seems they are having problems sorting it out. Even the Abuja Geographic Information Systems (AGIS) couldn\u2019t verify the land too. The concern has been coming from the public on why the centre has not become fully functional. Most Nigerians think it belongs to the Federal Government.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn September 2017, the former First Lady had told Nigerian students in Uganda, led by their president, Mubarak Yahaya Adamu, who presented her with a merit award, that the cancer centre had not commenced operations because those who made big financial pledges during its fundraising absconded after the death of her husband.\n\n\n\nShe said: \u201cBefore my husband died, I intended to have a hospital. We had a launching, some people made pledges but after my husband died, they just vanished. But we have finished the first phase of the hospital, it\u2019s a very big project.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to Turai Yar\u2019Adua, the first phase consists of about 200 rooms, four theatres and other administration offices.\n\n\n\nOne of the security guards at the ICC said there has been no activity to actualise the centre, as envisioned by Turai, adding that Turai came twice in 2016 to the site and had not been seen around the area since then.\n\n\n\nThe guard said some bandits invaded the ICC last year to dispossess them of their valuables, adding that a few items belonging to the centre were also stolen.\n\n\n\nHe said that after the incident, some policemen from the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) have since been deployed to secure the ICC against further attacks.\n\n\n\n\u201cSix of us were employed to secure this place and we do alternate shift, but because the bandits were fully armed, they overpowered us and beat the security guards,\" the guard said.",

          "text": "A former Director of Nigerian Navy Accounts, Rear Admiral Tahir Yusuf (retd.), on the wanted list of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), is planning to flee the country, sources close to the retired military officer told SaharaReporters.\n\nThe anti-graft agency had accused Yusuf of stealing N2 billion belonging to the Nigerian government while serving as Director of Nigerian Navy Accounts.\n\nIn 2020, Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of a Federal High Court in Abuja ordered the permanent forfeiture of about N500 million found to be fraudulently amassed by the military officer to the Nigerian government.\n\nThe total amount forfeited was N392, 695,857.87, including $91,955.38 and the sum of \u00a315,050 held in domiciliary accounts.\n\nYusuf, previously second-in-command to the Chief of Account and Budget, Naval Headquarters (NHQ), held the cash in seven accounts- both private and corporate in two banks. See Also Breaking News BREAKING: Retired Navy Rear-Admiral Wanted For N2billion Fraud, Connives With Policemen, Orders Thugs To Shoot At Kaduna Residents\n\nThe seven accounts were operated under the name of a company, Bitmas Enterprise, in Zenith Bank while two were held in Yusuf\u2019s name in the defunct Skye Bank, now Polaris Bank.\n\nFollowing the forfeiture, SaharaReporters gathered that Yusuf fled Nigeria to Dubai, United Arab Emirate.\n\nThe EFCC and National Intelligence Agency also asked the Nigeria Immigration Service and Interpol to place him on a watch list and have him arrested at the point of entry or exit.\n\nHowever, Yusuf sneaked back to the country in October 2021 after he illegally obtained an international passport with the help of some corrupt government officials through the Niger Republic, a source had told SaharaReporters.

So we are funding this project from the budget.\n\n\u201cThat is why I doubt the completion and said if funding is available. However, we are putting pressure on all the necessary institutions that need to give us money.\n\n\u201cBut currently, we fund it through the budget, we will approach the Ministry of Finance again to fund us within this period.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on the pace of work by the contractors, and with adequate funds, Amaechi expressed optimism that they would deliver the project for commercial activities before May 2023.\n\nHe commended the CCECC and the team on the quality of work delivered so far and urged them not to relent so they could deliver a good job to the country.\n\nAmaechi restated the importance of utilising local materials and manpower in the construction of the rail project.\n\nAccording to him, the government is encouraging not only the use of local materials but passing all those kinds of jobs to Nigerians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo that we are part of the process, we are part of the benefits of this, not just economic benefit but also part of the financial benefit,\u201d he added.\n\nOn equipment, he said it was agreed that the Chinese should bring in 2,000 pieces of equipment for the construction of the project.\n\nHe said this was to ensure the availability of equipment for the project at all times to prevent the reoccurrence of what was experienced during the construction of the Lagos-Ibadan rail project.\n\n\u201cThey brought about 472 equipment, 200 of them are in the seaport, but what we agreed is that they must bring in 2,000 equipment,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is because what we suffered in Lagos- Ibadan, was the fact that equipment were breaking down, was not enough and they couldn\u2019t place an order for new ones.\n\n\u201cSo for this one, buy all the equipment that you need so that as they break down you replace so that we will be able to complete the project in due time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the benefits, Amaechi reiterated that the essence of the project was for easy movement of passengers and cargoes.\n\nHe said Kano was the most important economic mass centre, and the project would ensure activities that took place in Kano be conveyed easily to Lagos.",

          "title": "Saudi Arabia: A new home for Nigerian startups?",
          "text": "For Nigerians who want to start or already run their businesses, there\u2019s a constant concern about access to supporting infrastructure, funding, and talent. These concerns are the primary causes of high failure among startups on the continent.\n\nThe startup failure rate in Nigeria reportedly stood at 61% in 2021, meaning only 39% survive. This is similar across Africa where startup failure rates range from 75% in Ethiopia and 74% in Ghana to 58.3% in Senegal and 58.7% in Kenya.\n\nIn a bid to increase the success rate and accelerate the transition to a digital economy, the Saudi Arabian government is partnering with Nigerian authorities to provide Nigerian entrepreneurs with expedited entry and support via Digital Cooperation Organization (DCO) Startup Passport.\n\nThe Startup Passport initiative, which will ultimately be between the 8-member DCO countries, rolled out initially in Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. This announcement implies that Nigerian startups building products that primarily serve the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region are invited to build their companies from Saudi Arabia with support from the government.\n\nThis initiative was launched at LEAP, a global event for future technologies being held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from February 1 to 3 and attended by leading technology corporations, global start-up pioneers, and venture capitalists.\n\nFaris AlSaqabi, Saudi Deputy Minister for Future Jobs and Capabilities, explained that the bond between Saudi Arabia and Nigeria is fueled by the country\u2019s movement to a digital economy.\n\n\u201cNigeria is one of the key players in the digital economy. We\u2019ve noticed you cannot do it alone, so we have to partner with other countries.\u201d\n\nAt LEAP, \u201cThe Garage\u201d, a world-class innovation hub to support emerging and disruptive technology-based startups was also announced. The name is inspired by the origin stories of many of the world\u2019s top tech companies that famously started from inside garages.\n\nAlongside other business leaders who were present at the event, Nigerian Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami; Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Communications Commission, Umar Danbatta, and other delegates were attendees.\n\nNigerian Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Ali Pantami in conversation with a representative of the Digital Cooperation Organization. Source: DCO\n\n\u201cOne lesson we can pick from Saudi Arabia\u2019s success is that we should take away the word impossible. We should be optimistic about any plans we have for transforming Nigeria,\u201d Pantami told TechCabal. \u201cWhoever comes to Saudi for the first time after some years and sees the changes will appreciate what\u2019s going on in the digital economy. Their institutions are no longer obsolete. They\u2019re not just advanced but proactive.\u201d\n\nHe further said that his presence at the conference is to connect with potential investors, government officials, tech giants, and even startups. \u201cWe\u2019ve been having a series of meetings with investors on how they can come to Nigeria and invest. Some of the global tech giants are willing to come to Nigeria and establish their manufacturing plants.\u201d\n\nPantami pointed out that Nigeria\u2019s large economy, youthful population, and its exit from the recent recession are some reasons why investors are excited about the country, despite there also being a few areas to improve on.\n\n\u201cThe first meeting I had, they were surprised that Nigeria has 6 successful unicorns and still many are coming. The fastest-growing economy is the digital sector, which played a pivotal role in exiting the country out of recession.\u201d\n\nAlongside the Nigerian delegation, Domineum, Tanadi, Rice Afrika and 7 other Nigerian startups were also present at the event.\n\nAll roads lead to Vision 2030\n\nSo far, investments worth about $10 billion in technology and startups were announced at LEAP.\n\nThe investments and initiatives include the launch of Aramco Venture\u2019s Prosperity7 fund with $1 billion, and a billion dollar investment from NEOM Tech & Digital Company with a focus on future technologies. The Saudi Telecom Company announced MENA HUB, a $1 billion investment in regional connectivity and infrastructure.\n\nIgnite, a $1.1 billion investment targeted at the creative industry, was also launched. This new program is expected to transform Saudi Arabia into a leading digital entertainment and media production hub.\n\nTo provide better internet service, WiFi 6E was launched, supported by the largest amount of spectrum available for WiFi of any country worldwide. This is accompanied by other connectivity-boosting initiatives, including the first regional trial of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite technology to extend reliable coverage to remote areas of the Kingdom.\n\nThese announcements are all connected to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030, a drive to reduce dependence on oil and diversify its economy.\n\nSince the drive to achieve the Vision 2030 began in 2016, there\u2019s been considerable changes in Saudi Arabia, notably the liberalisation of its entertainment sector, provision of tourism visas and relaxing its rules for tourists as well as lifting the ban for women to drive in 2018\u2014the last country in the world to do so.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about the emerging technologies and the future of jobs for our people because soon millions of current jobs will be replaced by technology,\u201d AlSaqabi said. \u201cThis means we\u2019ll lose millions of dollars if we don\u2019t adopt emerging technologies. There is no excuse to wait for the future to come, we have to go to it.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "TechCabal is surging ahead in 2022 and beyond \ud83d\ude80",
          "text": "Hello everyone, welcome to February.\n\nYou probably already know this \u2014 because we\u2019ve mentioned it a few times \u2014 but TechCabal started off in a small room in Lagos many years ago. 2013 to be specific. It is safe to say that, nearly 9 years later, TechCabal has grown to become much more than a predictable technology blog or website. We\u2019ve gone from reviewing gadgets to talking to Meta\u2019s VP MEA and Turkey about facebook\u2019s plans to transition into the metaverse. We are still optimistic about Nigerian founders and the Nigerian tech ecosystem. Still, we\u2019ve covered high-impact entrepreneurs from other regions like Sudan, Egypt, Morocco, Senegal, and The Gambia in the last two years.\n\nAnd we have no plans of slowing down. This year, we are hyper-focused on fine-tuning our editorial standards and establishing TechCabal as one of Africa\u2019s most reputable technology and media publication. We will lead compelling conversations on hot-button topics such as decentralized communities, digital nomads, remote work, talent migration, and the new internet. Furthermore, expect us to spotlight more African founders innovating around draconian policies, internet shutdowns, and social media bans. Our coverage will expand into lesser-known regions, cities, and startup hubs.\n\nFor us, 2022 is about executing our goals, delighting our readers, and putting Africa\u2019s technology ecosystem on the global stage. We hope we can count on you to support us along the way.\n\nWhat is new?\n\nAdegoke \u201cGoke\u201d Oyeniyi is no longer TechCabal\u2019s editor-in-chief and has moved on to pursue some personal goals and interests. Goke joined the newsroom in January 2021 and hit the ground running almost immediately. He provided high-level oversight of TechCabal\u2019s objectives, worked closely with our senior reporters, and drove editorial training weekly. He also contributed some well-researched articles to the newsroom; read his insight into rising Nigerian fintech startup, TeamApt.\n\nFollowing Goke\u2019s exit from the newsroom, I am stepping up to become TechCabal\u2019s acting editor-in-chief, reporting directly to Tomiwa Aladekomo, CEO, Big Cabal Media. My new role comes with many responsibilities, but I am motivated by my team and goals this year. I also know I have the full support of Big Cabal Media\u2019s leadership team and the entire organization.\n\nAbraham Augustine is the most recent addition to our newsroom. He resumed on January 17th as a senior reporter. Abraham is a growth marketing specialist and creator who operates at the intersection of growth, marketing & startup enablement in Africa. Abraham manages a Substack newsletter called Money Myths Africa.\n\nWhat has changed?\n\nLast year, we brought in our first East Africa correspondent. Alexandria Williams joined the newsroom as a remote contract reporter. She wrote about Uber\u2019s showdown against Kenya\u2019s high court and a Kenyan comedian\u2019s rise to digital fame during her time with us. Alexandria was accepted into one of DW\u2019s journalism traineeship programs in December, so she will not be continuing as our East Africa reporter this year.\n\nFor your information:\n\nKelechi Njoku joined the newsroom as senior editor in November 2021. He\u2019s an experienced editor with a literary and fine arts background. One of his most significant achievements was fine-tuning TechCabal\u2019s style guide.\n\nMuyiwa Olowogboyega joined Lemonade Finance as their content manager in October 2021. He was a senior staff writer at TechCabal for 1 year and 8 months. Muyiwa co-authored TC Daily with Daniel Adeyemi.\n\nAlexander Onukwue joined Quartz Africa as their West Africa correspondent. He was a staff writer at TechCabal for almost 2 years. He also wrote TechCabal\u2019s Next Wave newsletter for an extended period.\n\nStorytelling and coverage (TechCabal 3.0)\n\nOn storytelling and reporting, TechCabal is still committed to capturing the players, human impact and business of technology on the continent. We are even more dedicated to covering more regions, including North Africa, South Africa, and francophone Africa. TechCabal Insights team will continue to provide up-to-date content, reports, data, events, and context to help the world understand how technology is changing Africa. We will publish deep dives on cryptocurrency, the metaverse, DAOs, decentralization, policy, regulation, and big tech operators in Africa.\n\nWhat is coming soon?\n\nNewsletters\n\nTechCabal has plans to launch some new newsletter products. Sadly, we cannot reveal the details, but keep your eyes peeled for more information in TC Daily or Next Wave.\n\nFlagships\n\nKelechi Njoku will revive My Life in Tech (MLIT) in the coming weeks. MLIT is a flagship launched by Kay Uguwede, a former TechCabal staff writer. After Kay\u2019s exit from the newsroom, Edwin Madu took over MLIT during his time as senior editor in the newsroom. He is currently Zikoko\u2019s editor-in-chief.\n\nSultan Quadri and Timi Odueso will revive Digital Nomads by the end of February this year. Digital Nomads was launched and exclusively written by Olumuyiwa, a former senior staff writer at TechCabal.\n\nExtra hands\n\nIn 2022, we will recruit senior editors, reporters, and regional correspondents. In addition, we will report on more countries outside Nigeria, Ghana, and West Africa. Nigeria has quickly become the poster child for fast-growing startups and the top recipient of foreign investments. But Kenya, Egypt, and South Africa are following closely behind. Egypt is home to the most accelerated startups and founders on the continent. By bringing in analytical thinkers and on-the-ground reporters, we\u2019ll be able to tell more compelling stories about the impact of technology in these newer regions.\n\nThank you!\n\nWell, that\u2019s about it from the newsroom. As always, we are immensely grateful for supporting and betting on us through the years. Thank you for falling in love with our newsletters, reviews, flagships, columns, tweets, and contributions. We hope to delight you even more in 2022 and beyond.\n\nTechCabal is a pan-Africa media and technology publication. We cover the human impact of technology in Africa and how innovation is changing the business landscape on the continent. Our current coverage areas include West, East, and North Africa.\n\nFollow us on Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Say hello, and we\u2019ll share a fun article with you \ud83d\ude04\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Detty December: New data identifies Lekki Phase 1 as Lagos\u2019s COVID-19 hotspot",
          "text": "Adaobi* is a 24-year-old software engineer living with her 49-year-old mother Oge* at Lekki Phase 1, in Lagos, Nigeria. On the morning of January 1 this year, she complained of a sore throat and took some Strepsils for it. By the next morning, however, her sore throat got worse\u2014and her mother began to feel an itch in hers as well.\n\nBoth women went to the hospital and there tested positive for COVID-19. They were then placed on medication and advised to self-isolate. Now, their gateman Bosun*, who must have caught the virus from them, thought he had malaria and got on antimalarial medications. But, after a week, his symptoms persisted, so he decided to switch medicines to honey, ginger, and turmeric mixed in hot water, as advised by a friend.\n\nAccording to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Nigeria entered the 4th wave of COVID-19 in December, reporting 223,887 cases and 2,985 deaths in its 36 states and federal capital Abuja. This is an over-500% increase.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe surge in COVID-19 cases during the December festive period may be attributed to 2 major factors: the mass of unquarantined people that came into Nigeria from abroad, especially into Lagos; and the several crowded gatherings where social distancing practices were not observed.\n\nIn the case of Adaobi and her mother, Adaobi had attended several crowded outdoor activities in December and her mother had just returned from a business trip in Europe, so it\u2019s difficult to determine who infected who.\n\nLike Bosun, many Nigerians are ignorant of the symptoms of COVID-19. On top of that, many people do not see a doctor whenever they feel sick, preferring instead to self-medicate, with the belief that they have \u201cordinary malaria\u201d. This is what\u2019s currently happening in Lagos and, according to Remedial Health, a healthtech startup that improves access to original medicines by creating a direct supply chain between retailers and manufacturers or registered distributors, Lekki Phase 1\u2014one of the highbrow areas of Lagos\u2014is at the center of it all.\n\nRemedial Health founder and CEO, Samuel Okwuada, told TechCabal over a call that their company saw a 250% increase in orders for anti-malarial drugs in December last year from pharmacies and chemists in Lekki Phase 1.\n\n\u201cIt started around November but peaked in December. We noticed that customers in Lekki Phase 1 that would normally order 20 packs of antimalarial drugs for sale within 3\u20134 days were now ordering 60\u201370 packs every 1\u20132 days,\u201d said Okwuada. \u201cWhen we asked the manufacturers for more products and they told us they\u2019d reached their production limit, we realised this is more serious than we thought.\u201d\n\nDrugs like Artemether & Lumefantrine and Vitamin C saw about 250% and 130% increase, respectively, in demand. This continual spike in demand of antimalarial drugs\u2014which is still happening\u2014led Remedial Health to investigate the cause. Their conversations with pharmacists on the frontline suggests that some of the symptoms reported by customers are more consistent with COVID-19 than malaria.\n\n\n\n\n\nA sore throat is not indicative of malaria but it is one of the major symptoms of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe number of COVID-19 cases in Lekki is overwhelming. When these people come to the clinic, they always complain of malaria but test positive for COVID-19,\u201d said a lab scientist who works at a testing centre in Lekki and who spoke to TechCabal anonymously.\n\nAnother resident of Lekki Phase 1 jokingly said he suspects everybody in Lekki has the virus already. \u201cThat\u2019s an old story now. It\u2019s just another malaria symptom,\u201d he said.\n\nThe importance of data in combating the virus\n\nIt\u2019s no more news that healthcare institutions around the globe are using data to design better pandemic responses and train frontline staff. Without appropriate data, misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus will flood the media and undermine efforts to sensitise the public.\n\nThe World Health Organisation\u2019s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, once said, \u201cWe\u2019re not just fighting a pandemic; we\u2019re fighting an infodemic.\u201d\n\nGovernments across the world are using data to drive COVID-19 innovation to mend the economic stress, misinformation, and division the virus has unleashed on the world. In Nigeria, the Global Partnership UNECA worked with the country\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) to create a comprehensive data hub to show where cases of COVID-19 were occurring and what support might be needed.\n\nIn Togo, the government is using artificial intelligence, via GiveDirect-Novissi COVID-19 Aid, to collect and collate data of the poorest communities in order to provide them with contactless financial aid through mobile money.\n\nAccording to a Reuter data, COVID-19 infections are decreasing in Nigeria, with 94 new infections reported on average each day. That\u2019s 5% of the peak\u2014the highest daily average reported on December 27. Okwuada, the lab scientist and some Lekki residents that spoke to TechCabal believes that these numbers are underreported and that is evident from the case of people like Bosun. Where\u2019s their own number? However, even though data is not a direct antidote to the virus and not always correct, Okwuada believes it\u2019s a strong fighting instrument. He said data is essential to curbing the spread of the virus and, possibly, ending the disease altogether.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAfrobeats is the movement; it\u2019s the underdog, a mongrel that had no home and somehow, has managed to use global platforms to manoeuvre and invade the world with that melody that comes from our music.\u201d \u2014 Obi Asika.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObi Asika, Founder of Storm 360 Records and Co-founder of Social Media Week Lagos\n\nThere is no doubt that African music, especially Afrobeats \u2014 the melting pot of West African music styles blended with American Jazz \u2014 has gone global. It has become a norm to see non-Africans identifying with Afrobeats and enjoying the African rhythm.\n\nHowever, it didn\u2019t happen overnight. With the help of media companies focused on music and the Internet, Afrobeats has travelled across the globe as an internationally recognised sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoey Akan, Founder and CEO Afrobeat Intelligence. Moderator of the Afrobeats session\n\nTechnology has played an outstanding role in the popularity of Afrobeats. From tools that create the melody Obi Asika describes as the \u2018sweet spot\u2019 to the platforms that have pushed those melodies across hemispheres and into the hearts of people with no ties with Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe early days\n\nObi Asika has been in the Nigerian music industry for several decades; he has watched the industry mature from the homeless mongrel to the behemoth that it is now. He is the Founder of Storm 360 Records and Co-founder of Social Media Week Lagos, one of the most significant new media and technology conferences in Africa.\n\nSpeaking at Techpoint Build 2021, during the panel session themed: Afrobeats to the World: Nigerian Domination, Asika explained the journey of Afrobeats from the beginning to where it is now and the opportunities that artistes and everyone in the music business should be leveraging.\n\n\u201cI remember then when you tell people in the West, \u2018I\u2019ve got some guys in Lagos that can rap better than anyone in the world,\u2019 they\u2019ll look at you like you\u2019re mad and ask who is interested in whatever young Africans have to say or do?\u201d Asika said.\n\nAccording to him, people in the West imagined Afrobeats as traditional music. Still, the sound has evolved through the years, retaining its African origins while mixed with sounds from different parts of the world.\n\nAmerican online education platform, MasterClass, traces the history of Afrobeats to the early 20th Century when Ghanaian musicians merged West African regional music with Western Jazz and Calypso to create highlife music. This was then fused with Western influences to create Afrobeats.\n\nAfrobeats continued to evolve, but its power was still unknown, not just to the West but to the Africans wielding it. A problem, Asika said, was solved by Channel O, a South Africa-based music channel.\n\n\u201cIn the mid-90s, young Africans were seeing people that looked like them on Channel O, doing amazing things. That generated a spur of energy for the next decade.\u201d\n\nAfter Channel O opened the eyes of Africans and the world of what was possible with Afrobeats, MTV Base Africa, a 24-hour music channel, continued the spur of energy. Social media took on from there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMTV Base Africa changed the level in terms of quality. By the late 2000s, we had Myspace, then Facebook, followed by YouTube,\u201d Asika noted.\n\nMusic streaming platforms changed everything\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAddy Awofisayo, Head of Music, Sub-Saharan Africa at YouTube,\n\nAddy Awofisayo, Head of Music, Sub-Saharan Africa at YouTube, agreed with Asika on how these platforms have helped Afrobeats.\n\nShe said, \u201cWhen people ask me the reason why Afrobeats is going global, I say it\u2019s the platforms. Not just YouTube, but Spotify, Apple Music, and TikTok.\n\n\u201cBack in the days, if you didn\u2019t live in Nigeria and wanted to listen to 2Face, you\u2019d need someone from Nigeria to bring you a CD. But now, you just go on YouTube and search for it.\u201d\n\nAwofisayo also added that platforms such as hers \u2014 YouTube \u2014 try to create initiatives that can amplify the voices and talents created in Africa. An example is Foundry, a programme that helps artistes grow their presence on YouTube and \u201cbreak them outside of their market.\u201d\n\nHowever, artistes are not the only ones who need support. Awofisayo pointed out that \u201cfor an artiste to be successful, they need an army of people around them. A great producer, songwriter and manager.\u201d\n\nIn light of this, YouTube also created a programme to support songwriters and producers. It was through this program Awofisayo got to know P.Priime, the producer behind the hit song, Infinity.\n\nThe importance of music platforms can also be exemplified through the amount of money they generate. Streaming services, for example, generated about $300 million for African artistes in 2021. This number is estimated to reach $500 million by 2025.\n\nWhile Asika believes that several platforms played a significant role in making Afrobeats go global, the talents that create the music play the biggest part.\n\n\u201cThat melody from our music is what drives everything!\u201d\n\nThe future of Afrobeats\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Okpala. Spotify\u2019s West African Artist and Label Partnerships Manager\n\nSeeing music beyond art but as a product is what Victor Okpala, Spotify\u2019s West African Artist and Label Partnerships Manager, projects for African and Nigerian music.\n\n\u201cMusic is not just art; it\u2019s a product. It goes through a life-cycle as most products.\u201d\n\nThe reason Okpala wants music to be seen as a product is to see more investors coming into the space. Despite the growth that has been seen in the Nigerian music industry, there are still a lot of issues when it comes to funding.\n\nAccording to Okpala, the cost of producing high-quality videos is skyrocketing, and as Nigerian music goes global, it has to deliver world-class content. As it becomes increasingly challenging to create content that can compete internationally, we \u201cneed people to come into the space and fund the product called music.\u201d\n\nFor Henry Cocobassey, a Nigerian music executive and NFT collector, the future of Afrobeats is on the blockchain. Cocobassey told a story of how he collaborated with a Nigerian music artist, Challex D\u2019 Boss, to sell 10 thousand copies of minted non-fungible token (NFT) music in two weeks.\n\nHe said NFTs are like \u201ca new revolution where the artiste isn\u2019t the only one earning money off music but the fans too.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry Cocobassey is a Nigerian music executive, NFT collector, and CEO of Unique Sirius.\n\nThis is only the beginning\n\nWith a 51.44% Internet penetration rate in Nigeria, Awofisayo believes Afrobeats has barely begun to scratch the surface of what it is capable of.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot more people out there that are not able to access the Internet and able to consume music on platforms like YouTube and Spotify,\u201d Awofisayo submitted.\n\n\u201cOnce we see the Internet no longer becoming a barrier, we\u2019re truly going to see how African music will blow up. Though we\u2019re going global, there\u2019s still so much opportunity on the continent that is unrealised, and I think the Internet is the barrier and once that goes away, what we\u2019re going to see will completely blow our minds!\u201d She added.\n\nObi Asika\u2019s future for Afrobeats lies in the home of Afrobeats \u2014 Nigeria. To him, the conversation about Afrobeats in the future will be based on who did the most in the \u201chome market.\u201d which is the most important market.\n\n\u201cThere are global moments, but the biggest opportunity is Nigeria!\u201d He said emphatically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBolu Abiodun He\u2019s a geek, a sucker for Blockchain and an all-round tech lover.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA close look at the numbers from 2021 reveals something that even casual observers must have noticed \u2014 the fintech industry keeps on pulling in the most money ($2.3 billion) of all sectors in the African tech ecosystem. In addition to that, it has significantly more startups compared to the others. Nigeria alone has 144 fintech startups, per Statista. In contrast, there are only 22 commercial banks in Nigeria.\n\nAn underdeveloped financial system, difficulty accessing credit, and a growing number of smartphone users present a huge opportunity for new and existing fintech players in Africa. However, this also means that there will be several startups offering similar services.\n\nJust like it is common to see Nigerians open accounts with more than one bank, we now see customers doing the same with fintech startups.\n\nMarking this register is another fact: these startups compete among themselves for a fraction of the market as there are still barriers to using these services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPreparing for competition\n\nOluwatobi Boshoro, CEO of Infinitetiks, believes that fintech startups can expect to see competition from startups on the fringes of the financial services sector. This, she says, is because consumers are getting tired of having to use too many services for their financial needs.\n\n\u201cIn Africa, a lot of the digital natives are becoming fatigued with the proliferation of apps, particularly with the kind of services that we have seen on the apps in recent times. And so you\u2019re beginning to find more and more organisations who are service champions who are beginning to come into financial services such as OPay and Safeboda,\u201d she said while speaking at Techpoint Build 2021 on the topic, Business model innovation: the rise of ecosystems and platforms based on changing customer attitudes.\n\nWhat does this mean for fintech companies?\n\nWith this increased competition for customers, Boshoro believes that fintech startups need to start offering the whole gamut of financial services rather than focusing on core banking services.\n\nCurrently, most fintech startups in Africa are focused on one financial service. This could be payments, lending, insurance, or banking. However, the same cannot be said of some of their counterparts in other sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake Safeboda, for example; after launching its ride-hailing service in Ibadan, the startup has since added airtime payments to its suite of services. eCommerce giant, Jumia has done the same, launching Jumia Pay in 2016 to allow users to buy airtime, take loans, and pay for products on the platform.\n\nSo what does this mean for fintech startups?\n\nBoshoro believes that this would drive consolidation in the ecosystem as startups either get acquired by bigger players or merge to get access to a larger customer base. This is a view echoed by Abdul Hassan, CEO and Founder of Mono, in his predictions for fintech developments.\n\n\u201cI think there will be a lot of mergers and acquisitions coming up next year because I feel like there are a lot of companies doing similar things. And it doesn\u2019t really make sense to have about 20 companies doing the same thing when they can all put together the demand power, the resources, and the talent to build something that is really massive out of Africa.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to consolidation, Boshoro believes that partnerships will become critical for survival. Companies, she says, will have to \u201cpartner with strengths as the focus to lead the market.\u201d\n\nEven with the current players in the fintech space, there is still room for more companies capable of effectively serving previously excluded groups. However, in all this, the African customer looks set to win.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

The flagship crypto fell more than 12% on Friday, January 20, 2022, going below $36,000 for the first time since July 2021.\n\nSince its peak in November 2021, it has lost more than 45% of its value. Other digital currencies have suffered just as much, if not more, with Ethereum and meme coins seeing a similar dip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market\u2019s recovery, GIG Logistics (GIGL) seems to be taking a considerable risk integrating a crypto wallet into its proprietary delivery app, GIGGO.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means users can now perform basic crypto transactions like buying, selling, \u2018hodling\u2019, and transferring crypto right on the app.\n\nBefore the integration is made public, it will go through two beta phases. The crypto wallet will be available to 2,000 users in the first beta phase, and then 10,000 users will be onboarded in the second phase.\n\nThe wallet integration is made possible through a collaboration with XPAD, a platform that allows users to store, invest, and stake in real-world assets using cryptocurrency. XPAD users can import their wallets into the GIGGO crypto wallet. Those who do not have an XPAD wallet can create one on GIGGO.\n\nWith several crypto exchanges providing similar services as XPAD, GIGGO introduces an innovative way to onboard users to the platform.\n\nWhile the crypto space has been inundated with scams since Bitcoin\u2019s inception \u2014 making crypto users wary of the crypto platforms they use \u2014 linking XPAD, a new platform, with GIGL, a reputable company, creates a sense of trust.\n\nTo learn more about how GIGL is building a sense of trust to users, please read: Merging crypto with logistics: How GIGL is preparing for the future of payments\n\nLAMI acquires Bluewave to reach more Africans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLami Technology Team.\n\nDue to the traditional distribution of insurance policies by individual insurance agents, Africa has low insurance coverage. Add to this Africans relying on traditional channels for trade and policy implementation, and we\u2019ve seen customer satisfaction suffer, distribution costs rise, and the processing cycle lengthen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis then affects how premiums are paid. So, in 2018, Jihan Abass founded Lami Technologies to make insurance products available to all Kenyans.\n\nAlthough selling insurance directly can be challenging, they adopted a B2B2C strategy to capitalise on the trust that had already been established through channels that communicate with customers regularly.\n\nThrough an API, Lami enables businesses to provide digital insurance products to their users. Partner businesses can also use this to manage their insurance needs.\n\nTo make insurance coverage available to more people in Africa on a larger scale, the company has acquired Bluewave Insurance Agency for an undisclosed sum. Adelaide Odhiambo, who now works as the head of commercial partnerships at Lami, founded Bluewave Insurance, another Kenyan startup.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Bluewave has developed an online platform that enables clients to access micro-insurance products via various channels like USSD, SMS, WhatsApp chatbots, and web applications.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Lami will integrate Bluewave\u2019s technology into its core platform, enhancing its B2B2C capabilities.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this acquisition will allow Lami to enter new markets like Malawi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where Bluewave already has a presence. Consequently, the startup will reach more customers in these respective countries.\n\nLami, already present in Uganda and Tanzania through partnerships outside of Kenya, plans to expand into Nigeria and several North African countries in 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nWhat are mental health difficulties and when to seek help.

          "text": "The environmental legacy of Nigeria\u2019s oil industry is under threat due to growing concerns about the financial and technical capacity of local operators to handle oil assets in Africa\u2019s biggest oil-producing country.\n\nWithin the last two months, two major environmental incidences have dampened the image of Nigeria\u2019s Content Act of 2010, a law largely responsible for the emergence of a corps of local firms trying to rub shoulders with the \u2018big boys\u2019 in Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector by replicating tasks carried out by the International Oil Companies (IOCs).\n\nExperts say the latest Escravos explosion has raised doubts about the Nigerian Local Content Act, which requires all operators of oil field licences to submit a Nigerian content plan at the time of their bidding, showing how they will give first consideration to local companies and services as well as a training and employment plan.\n\n\u201cThese recent incidents will raise questions and scepticism about the technical know-how of the local operators going forward, a development that is bad for Nigeria\u2019s Local Content Act,\u201d an investor exposed to Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas sector says.\n\nHe notes, \u201cHealth, Safety, and Environment is one of the most delicate aspects of oil and gas business, which no serious investors will gamble with to satisfy local content.\u201d\n\nJoe Nwakwue, former chairman of, Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), states that the regulators must ensure local companies did not compromise on HSE standards in line with international safety requirements.\n\n\u201cNo operation in the energy sector must compromise on safety to accommodate local content,\u201d Nwakwue states.\n\nDavid Banjo, an environment, and energy expert with a major consulting firm in Nigeria note that the recent environmental incidents have exposed concerns that some operators in Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry engaged in unwholesome health, safety, and environmental practices resulting in widespread ecological disturbances, including pollution from pipeline leaks.\n\n\u201cThe implementation of the regulatory framework for environmental protection in the Nigerian oil and gas sector was still very weak despite the existence of a rich set of regulations contained in the Environmental Guidelines and Standards for the Petroleum Industry in Nigeria EGASPIN,\u201d Banjo says.\n\nFor instance, Nigeria recorded one of its worst oil spills in recent years at the Nembe oil spill at the Santa Barbara oil field operated by Aiteo Eastern Exploration and Production Company. The oil spill lasted 32 days and caused extensive environmental damage with more than a hundred thousand barrels of oil spilled into the environment.\n\nThree months later, fire engulfed a floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessel named \u2018Trinity Spirit\u2019 operated by Shebah Exploration and Production Company Limited (SEPCOL), while Houston-based Alliance Marine Services (AMS) is the beneficial owner.\n\nBusinessDay was unable to contact Shebah, while AMS had not responded to a request for a statement as of press time.\n\nOn Thursday, a note from Rystad Energy, independent energy research and business intelligence company, said the FPSO was not producing at the time of the explosion.\n\nAside from any fatalities, Rystad Energy said, \u201cThe primary concern is the potential environmental implications of the situation, which will be hard to quantify until after the dust settles and the aftermath is assessed.\u201d\n\nAccording to Rystad, the impact of an oil spill from Trinity Spirit yesterday is likely to be considerably lower than the most recent large offshore oil spill, the Deepwater Horizon crisis that leaked around 4.9 million barrels into the US Gulf of Mexico in 2010.\n\nRead also: Preventing gas explosions in 2022\n\nDespite the recent setbacks, Nigeria\u2019s local content under the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) has recorded giant strides, which has led to the rise of so many indigenous oil companies across the value chain with the capacity to replicate the tasks carried out by the IOCs.\n\nBefore the NOGICD Act, there were only 44 registered indigenous oil service companies in Nigeria but has now risen to over 93, rigs and marine vessels owned by Nigerians were less than 5 percent owned by Nigerians. This has risen to 40 percent.\n\nFor instance, a few years back, Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) sold its interests in four oil blocs to indigenous companies including Seplat, Neconde Consortium led by Nestoil plc, Shoreline Natural Resources, and 45 percent interest in OML 40 to Eland Oil & Gas Limited and Starcrest Nigeria Energy Limited.\n\nAlso, AITEO, Oando, Seplat, Eroton, First E&P, and a host of other indigenous companies are major players in the oil and gas business in the country, with the full backing of the Local Content Act implemented by the NCDMB.\n\nIn 2017, the NCDMB launched the $200 million NCI Fund, which is funded from the Nigerian Content Development Fund established by the Local Content Act, helping to fund asset acquisition and assisting in loan refinancing.\n\nIn fabrication, reports from NCDMB showed the number of fabrication yards across the country has increased, line pipes are now almost wholly produced in-country, pipe coating plants are springing up, which ultimately leads to capital retention, job creation, and skill enhancement for Nigerians.\n\nBy 2027, the NCDMB says it intends to increase local content to 70 percent, which will see the retention of as much as $14 billion within the country, annually. But the inability of local oil firms to rise up to recent oil spills and handle re-mediation works in case of emergency calls for concern, experts say.",

          "text": "The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has shown serious signs of going ahead with February 26, 2022, the date for the National Convention of the party, despite internal wrangling and negative permutations.\n\nThe party\u2019s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), headed by Governor Mai-Mala Buni of Yobe State, showed the readiness by notifying the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of the convention, which is the basis for the permutations that the exercise may not hold as scheduled.\n\nThe ruling party in a letter dated Wednesday, February 2, addressed to the INEC chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, and signed by the CECPC chairman and Governor Buni and secretary, John Akpanudoedehe, invited the Commission to monitor the convention.\n\nThe letter, received by INEC on Thursday, February 3, and sighted by BusinessDay, read: \u201cThis is to inform the Commission that our great Party has scheduled to hold its National Convention on Saturday, 26th February 2022.\n\n\u201cThis serves as a formal notification pursuant to the provisions of Section 85 of the Electoral Act (2010) as amended. Kindly arrange for your officials to monitor the exercise accordingly.\u201d\n\nWith this letter, APC has fulfilled the requirement of Section 85 of the Electoral Act (2010), which makes it mandatory for any political party planning to conduct congress, primary or convention to give the Commission 21 days notice.\n\nThe development may have saved the party credibility loss, which some members had feared would be a lot of the broom association if it postponed again the convention.\n\nBen Nwoye, former secretary/APC state chairmen forum, had alleged some subterranean moves by some individuals to achieve certain ulterior motives.\n\nIn an interview monitored on Channels TV on Thursday, Nwoye said it would be in the interest of the party that the convention was held as scheduled.\n\nAlthough he acknowledged the fact that there were internal wrangling that needed to be sorted out and other issues including some members that had either left the party or were about to, who needed to be reconciled, the former chairman of the Enugu State chapter of the party said there was no perfect situation to have a convention.\n\n\u201cThere must be issues in a political party. They will continue to exist. The situation was even worse in 2018 than what we have now. At that time, there were about 26 states with parallel structures after the 2018 congresses. We went ahead to re-elect President Buhari. What we have now is child\u2019s play. What we have now is some people trying to encourage sit-tight, and that may bring implosion,\u201d Nwoye said.\n\nSounding a note of warning to the leadership of the party, he suggested that the Abdullahi Adamu-led reconciliation committee can still continue with its assignment while the party goes for the convention to avoid loss of credibility.\n\n\u201cWe cannot sit down and say until all issues are settled before we can hold a convention. If APC fails to conduct the convention as already fixed, the party will lose credibility,\u201d he said.\n\nRecall that the party\u2019s ward, local and state congresses in some states bred rancour, and the party leadership is yet to calm the frayed nerves.\n\nAdamu Garba, a chieftain of the APC, who also featured at the interview session, said it would not cost the party anything to wait a little longer to allow the Adamu\u2019s committee to bring everyone on board.\n\n\u201cWe have a divided party right now. Those from the ACN, CPC, ANPP, the New PDP, and APGA that formed the APC are now pushing back because the administration of President Buhari is coming to an end. They are looking at what to get for themselves. What we are trying to avoid is an implosion. We want to give room for stability before we go to the convention. We do not want to go into the 2023 election a divided party,\u201d Garba said.\n\nA party member, who spoke with BusinessDay on condition of anonymity, had urged the APC leadership to go ahead with the convention since it was able to inaugurate the States\u2019 Executive Councils (EXCOs) that emerged from the controversial congresses.\n\n\u201cI do not see any sense in the argument that why the National Convention would not hold is because the Abdullahi Adamu-led committee is still busy with its reconciliation drive. The committee has visited some states and has yet to visit many. Why wouldn\u2019t they say, \u2018until the committee concludes its task, they would not inaugurate the states\u2019 EXCOs? So, if the internal crisis is not threatening enough to halt the inauguration of the state EXCOs, many of whom emerged from the acrimonious congresses, it should also not stop the convention after too many shifts in dates.\n\n\u201cFor me, there could be other reasons for the delay not necessarily the internal issues, which I see as a smokescreen,\u201d the party member said.\n\nThe Buni-led CECPC Thursday inaugurated the States\u2019 Executive Councils at the party\u2019s national headquarters in Abuja amid tight security.\n\nOur correspondent had reported that the tight security at the inauguration venue was occasioned by the fear that \u201cThe inauguration may be disrupted by states where there is parallel leadership during the last year\u2019s contentious congresses.\u201d\n\nRead also: Security tightens at APC headquarters as CECPC inaugurates states excos\n\nBut with the compliance of the Buni committee with the relevant section of the Electoral Act, the party appears set for the convention, nullifying all speculations to the contrary.\n\nSection 85 of the Electoral Act (2010) provides: \u201c(1) A registered political party shall give the Commission at least 21 days notice of any convention, congress, conference or meeting convened to elect members of its executive committees, other governing bodies or nominating candidates for any of the elective offices specified under this act.\n\n\u201c(2) The Commission may, with or without prior notice to the political party monitor and attend any convention, congress, conference or meeting which is convened by a political party for: (a) electing members of its executive committees or other governing bodies; (b) nominating candidates for an election at any level; and (c) approving a merger with any other registered political party.\u201d\n\nAnother indication that the convention may hold as planned is the commencement of the implementation of the schedule of activities for the convention by the Buni-led CECPC.\n\nThe CECPC had at its 19th regular meeting on January 19 considered and adopted the timetable/schedule of activities for the National Convention; first was the receipt of the Interim Report of the National Reconciliation Committee, which was done on Monday.\n\nThis was followed by the consideration and adoption of reports of State Congresses on Wednesday and inauguration of State Executives of the party on Thursday, which is under way with the next activity being the sales of forms to all aspirants on February 14.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nBarr. Olayiwola Afolabi is an indigene of Ekiti State. He grew up in Lagos State but now plies his trade as a lawyer as well as a notary public with positive bias for human rights activism in Benin City, capital of Edo State.\n\nHis name resonates not only in Edo State but across Nigeria because of a charitable heart that is a critical component of his legal practice and life in general. At the end of the day, he has ended up doing so much to uplift the legal profession and the judiciary. How?\n\nFor instance, he has an award scheme for honouring honest, disciplined and diligent junior staff of Edo State judiciary. Messrs Akpitoyim, Isibor and Johnson Aneto, among others, have won this award since 2010 till date. Each one of them went home with gifts of deep freezers and bags of rice.\n\nIcons of the bench and bar have equally been honoured by Olayiwola Afolabi in one way or the other. On September 10, 2016 the incumbent Chief Judge of Edo State, Justice Esohe Ikponmwen, was given the rare privilege of cutting the tape to officially open his house on Yoruba Street, Benin City.\n\nIn 2018, Olayiwola Afolabi hosted the new executive members of NBA, Edo State Chapter to a dinner. On the occasion, he made a profound declaration. He said: \u201dI want to tell lawyers to read\u2026\u2026. Lawyers should read their books and also read their bibles because it is God that will help you.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the chapter\u2019s NBA chairman \u2013 Barr Collins Ogiegbaen- thanked Olayiwola Afolabi for his immense support to the Edo NBA executive and his act of mentoring young lawyers in and out of his chambers.\n\nIn 2020, Olayiwola Afolabi officially institutionalized this mentoring process with the establishment of AFOLABI ANNUAL LEGAL CLINIC AND COACHING LECTURE SERIES. During the second edition of this initiative, Olayiwola Afolabi honoured Barr Austin Alegie, former NBA chairman of Edo State Branch for his dogged war to stamp out fake lawyers in the state. Also, he organised a reception for the Lion Bar of Edo NBA at the event.\n\nBesides mentoring young lawyers to hone their skills, Olayiwola Afolabi donates gifts to them that enhance their practice. Specifically, he has given out countless numbers of wigs and gowns to the best graduating students of the law faculties of UNIBEN and AAU, Ekpoma as at 2020.\n\nIn May 2021, during the outgone year, Olayiwola Afolabi again gifted wigs and gowns to three female AAU students in honour of and support for the Justice Esther Edigin Foundation set up by then Chief Judge of Edo State to empower female lawyers.\n\nOlayiwola Afolabi also gave each one of them half a bag of rice since in these hard times lawyers don\u2019t live on wigs and gowns alone. They also need some stomach infrastructure.\n\nFour months later in September 2021 at the event to mark the second edition of OLAYIWOLA AFOLABI ANNUAL LEGAL CLINIC AND COACHING LECTURE SERIES, Afolabi again donated wigs and gowns to several young lawyers.\n\nTo round up the year 2021, Olayiwola Afolabi was at the valedictory court session held in honour of retiring Justice Stephen Omonuwa at Edo High Court Complex on December 14, 2012. He spoke glowingly of the retiree: \u201cJustice Omonuwa is an asset to Edo State Judiciary. When people say Edo State judiciary is one of the best in Nigeria, it is because you have people like Justice Omonuwa in mind. Whether you are his brother or friend, he will always give fair judgement. He doesn\u2019t care. What he knows is justice\u201d.\n\nAlso in line with his tradition of honouring icons in the judiciary, Olayiwola Afolabi has instituted Stephen Omonuwa Transparency Award. It will go to the winner of an essay competition open only to young lawyers. The award has a prize tag of N100,000.\n\nBy locus, Afolabi is a member of Oredo LGA Branch of NBA in Edo State, In July 2016, he threw a party for its members to honour them for contributing to the development of the judiciary and Edo State.\n\nAll former chief judges and attorney-generals of the state attended the event. Indeed, charity should find resonance at home, also.\n\nMuch more, Olayiwola Afolabi is a human rights activist who is allergic to injustice whether in the bar, bench or judiciary. In 2013, he embarked on a solo campaign which resulted in official vehicles being given to magistrates, customary court judges and judges of high courts in Edo State to enhance their dignity, safety, security and performance.\n\n2016 was a busy year for his human rights/legal activism. During this year, Olayiwola Afolabi embarked on a one-man protest march at Edo High Court and Ministry of Justice premises. He called on Edo State Government to pay the over 8 months salary arrears of about 2000. JUSUN staff in the state seized because they embarked on strike demanding financial autonomy for Edo Judiciary as affirmed by a high court ruling. Also, in the same year, Olayiwola Afolabi queried Edo State Government for unexplained delay in paying the June salaries of magistrates in the state. His action brought their silent plight to the public domain resulting in the government quickly paying the wages. Similarly, Olayiwola Afolabi fought to ensure lawyers in Edo State judiciary were sponsored to the 2016 Annual General Meeting/ Conference of the NBA when the state government was not in the mood to do so.\n\nLest one forgets, but for Olayiwola Afolabi in 2016 one wonders if Edo State Government would have been stampeded into paying the terminal benefits of retired Justices Isibor and Aigboke neglected vindictively by government earlier on.\n\n2022 is still young. Nevertheless Olayiwola Afolabi has continued with his charitable gestures. At the 85th birthday of Dr. Kola Okeaya-Inneh in Benin, Olayiwola Afolabi donated two wigs and gowns in honour of the celebrant and Yakubu Maikyau (SAN) aspiring to be NBA next president. Ooops, Olayiwola Afolabi never tires in up lifting the bar, bench and judiciary. That is the gospel truth.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMichael A.

Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.\n\nThe grim milestone comes more than 13 months into a vaccination drive that has been beset by misinformation and political and legal strife.\n\nJust 64% of the population is fully vaccinated, or about 212 million Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\u201cWe got the medical science right. We failed on the social science. We failed on how to help people get vaccinated, to combat disinformation, to not politicize this,\u201d Jha said.\n\n\u201cThose are the places where we have failed as America.\u201d\n\nThe latest bleak milestone came as omicron is loosening its grip on the country.\n\nNew cases per day have plunged by almost a half-million since mid-January, when they hit a record-shattering peak of more than 800,000.\n\nCases have been declining in 49 states in the last two weeks, by Johns Hopkins\u2019 count.\n\nThe 50th state Maine, reported that confirmed infections are falling there, too, dropping sharply over the past week.\n\nAlso, the number of Americans in the hospital with COVID-19 has declined 15% since mid-January to about 124,000.\n\nDeaths are still running high at more than 2,400 per day on average, the most since last winter.\n\nAnd they are on the rise in at least 35 states, reflecting the lag between when victims become infected and when they succumb.\n\nStill, public health officials have expressed hope that the worst of omicron is coming to an end.\n\nWhile they caution that things could still go bad again and dangerous new variants could emerge, some places are already talking about easing precautions.\n\nBy comparison, United States leads the world in both confirmed COVID-19 cases and fatalities.\n\nSo far, the U.S. has recorded over 77 million cases and over 900,000 deaths.\n\nIndia is second with 42 million cases, but third in death toll of over 500,000.\n\nBrazil logged the second highest COVID-19 fatalities in the world, standing at over 630,000 as at Friday.\n\nBut the Latin American country has had 26,275,831 cases, according to worldometers.info.",

There is a weak administrative system in our school.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government has their own schools which they are taking care of.

As part of activities lined up for the State Funeral there would be a 21-Artillery Gun Salute to honour the late Elder Statesman.\u201d\n\nShonekan died at Evercare Hospital in Lekki, Eti-Osa Local Government Area, where he was getting treatment, at the age of 85.\n\nBefore being proclaimed dead by medical professionals in January, the deceased legal practitioner was the Abese of Egbaland.\n\nHe served as the interim President of Nigeria from August 26 to November 17, 1993, when he was deposed in a coup headed by General Sani Abacha.\n\nHe formed the Nigerian Economic Summit Organisation, an advocacy group and think-tank promoting private sector-led development of the Nigerian economy, after being deposed in a palace coup.\n\nBefore General Ibrahim Babangida named him as Interim President of Nigeria in 1993, Shonekan was a British-trained lawyer, industrialist, and former Chief Executive of the United African Company of Nigeria Plc (UAC).\n\nHe was born in Lagos on May 9, 1936, into the family of a public servant from Abeokuta. He went to CMS Grammar School and Igbobi College for his education.\n\nThe Lagos State Government had already announced that all bordering and feeder roads leading to Marina would be closed to facilitate easy access for guests attending the late Shonekan\u2019s funeral service.\n\nThe roadways would be closed for 13 hours, according to the statement, and traffic along the Inner Marina would be routed to the outside Marina near the Oando filling station axis, where they could connect to their destinations.\n\nAccording to the government, the roads will be closed starting at 5.00 a.m. on Friday, February 4, 2022, and will reopen to traffic around 6 p.m. the same day.\n\nMotorists have been directed to take other alternate routes to save travel time inside the axis, according to a statement made on Wednesday by the Commissioner for Transportation, Frederic Oladeinde.\n\nMotorists who are unable to avoid the axis should connect JK Randle Street to Force Road and then to Broad Street to continue their journey, since Inner Marina Road/Odunlami Street from Outer Marina Road would be restricted to vehicular traffic, according to Oladeinde.\n\nIn a similar vein, Oladeinde indicated that traffic descending CMS Bridge to Cathedral Church would be temporarily rerouted to the UBA roundabout and Apongbon axis for ease transit to other inner portions of Lagos Island.\n\nTo avoid any delays, the transportation commissioner told motorists that security and law enforcement services had been placed on standby for deployment to all critical junctions/intersections, as well as black spots.",

          "title": "Ritual killings: Horror as pupils now endangered species",
          "text": "\u2026Women, children treated like dying out species \u2013 NHRC \u2026Act horrific, inhumane, satanic \u2013 NAWOJ, NCWS, CSOs \u2026Situation unsustainable, needs urgent actions \u2013 NCWS \u2026Rape cases, killing school kids by proprietors disturbing \u2013 Ganduje\n\nAllegations of ritual killings have been with Nigerians from time immemorial with some wealthy citizens often accused of using their relatives, associates and/or parents for money rituals. PAUL OKAH in this report focuses on the recent murder of a five-year-old primary school pupil in Kano state; the killing of another pupil in Jigawa, the murder of a Dowen College Lagos student and other recent cases have brought to the fore the fact that pupils are now endangered species.\n\nIn Nigeria these days, the fear of kidnappers, rapists, paedophiles as well as ritualists is the beginning of wisdom as these groups of undesirable elements appear to have taken over different parts of the country.\n\nThe alarming situation has been further compounded by the abduction, raping and senseless murder of innocent and defenceless primary school pupils and secondary school students in different parts of the country.\n\nUnarguably, this category of school children has become an endangered species as they are abducted, raped and even murdered either in their homes or schools.\n\nMore worrisome is the fact that the victims are usually children as young as three or five-year-olds.\n\nCurrent cases\n\nOn January 20, in a statement by the Command\u2019s Public Relations Officer, SP Abdullahi Haruna-Kiyawa, the Police in Kano state disclosed that it had arrested a teacher, Abdulmalik Mohammed, 30, and one Hashim Isyaku, 37, for allegedly kidnapping and poisoning a five-year-old girl, Hanifa Abubakar, to death.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cIn December 4, 2021, at about 20:30 hours, a report was received from a resident of Dakata Quarters, Nassarawa, Kano state, that one Hanifa Abubakar, 5, was kidnapped and a ransom of N6 million was demanded. Sustained efforts and prolonged follow-up led to the arrest of Abdulmalik Mohammed-Tanko, 30, and Hashim Isyaku, 37, all of Tudun Murtala Quarters, by a detective team of the Department of State Services (DSS).\n\n\u201cDuring investigation, Mohammed-Tanko confessed that the victim, Hanifa, was his student at a private school in Kwanar Dakata, Nassarawa, Kano state. He kidnapped her and took her to his house where he contacted her relatives and demanded a ransom of N6 million. On December 18, 2021, having realised that the victim recognised him, he claimed to have poisoned her to death.\n\n\u201cHe conspired with Hashim Isyaku and buried her in a grave located at the private school premises at Kwanar \u2018Yan Gana, Tudun Murtala. Isyaku also confessed that in November 2021, the principal suspect and one Fatima Musa, 27, met and ordered him to kidnap the girl. They arranged for the kidnapping, but later rescinded the action. Fatima was also arrested in connection with the offence.\n\n\u201cThe suspects led a combined team of DSS operatives, police command\u2019s medical team and Operation Puff Adder to the grave. The body was exhumed and taken to Mohammed Abdullahi Wase Specialists Hospital Kano where it was examined and later released to the relatives for burial according to Islamic rites.\u201d\n\nThe confession\n\nOn January 22, the Kano state police command paraded killers of the five-year old pupil of Noble Kids Comprehensive College, Hanifa Abubakar, including the school teacher/proprietor, Abdulmalik Tanko, who callously narrated how he abducted her on December 4 and later killed her with a N100 rat poison on December 10 after collecting N100, 000, out of the N6 million ransom from her father.\n\nHe said: \u201cI picked Hanifa inside Keke NAPEP and I carried her to my house where I lied to my wife that the girl was a daughter to one of the women working in my school and that the mother travelled and pleaded for us to keep the girl for some days. My wife accepted and kept the girl for that reason. I realised that the girl\u2019s parents were informed that when picking her up, she made mention of \u2018uncle.\u2019 This gave me the impression that they might be suspecting me as the uncle.\n\n\u201cThen after some time, after some days, some of my teachers visited my house very early in the morning. When they came, I was also suspecting that they were sent over to the house to find out whether the girl was there with me. So, I decided that it was better I found a way before I would be caught. I first thought of sending this girl to another state but again, I thought the whole town was aware that she was missing. If the girl was going to be sent out through the main roads, we would be caught. So, that was when I conceived the idea of killing her.\n\n\u201cI picked her up at home; she was already sleeping, it was getting to 11pm. I picked her up. I used to always drink tea. I was drinking tea at that time, so I put the remaining tea in an empty container of Bobo yogurt and then I poured in this rat killer poison inside and gave it to the girl, not in my own house.\n\n\u201cWhen we went to the other school, when we were passing, I told her that I was taking her back to her uncle\u2019s house. So, as we were going I gave her the drink on the road and she drank it and then we entered one branch of the school; the branches are two. We entered the other branch with her and I told her I was going to pick something inside. She entered and that was where she finally died.\n\n\u201cI bought the poison N100. I buried her in the school. Let me clear this doubt. People are thinking that it has to do with ritual, this is not rituals. I buried her inside the school simply because I was not able to find any secure place to dig a hole.\u201d\n\nHisbah\u2019s demand\n\nThough the Kano state government has reacted to Hanifa\u2019s killing by closing down the school and revoking the licence of all private schools in the state, even with irate youth burning down the school on January 23, on January 24, in a statement by the Public Relations Officer of the Board, M.r Lawan Ibrahim-Fagge, the Kano state Hisbah Board tasked the police and relevant stakeholders to ensure the speedy prosecution of the Hanifa\u2019s killer, Abdulmalik Tanko.\n\nIbrahim-Fagge quoted the commander-general of the Board, Dr. Harun Ibn-Sina, as describing it as \u201cone of the worst terrible incidents that have happened in history of the state\u201d, urging relevant bodies to ensure a thorough investigation to ascertain the actual cause of the incident.\n\nNAWOJ seeks justice\n\nIn a statement by its national president, Ladi Bala, the Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ) condemned the killing of Hanifa, describing the act as \u201cone of the most horrific, barbaric, inhumane and evil acts of wickedness recorded in recent times,\u201d even as it called on NGOs and CSOs to speak out against evil acts and demand justice for victims of ritual killings and sexual abuse across the country.\n\nNAWOJ stated that the killing of the innocent Nigerian pupil by the proprietor of her school, smacked of gross betrayal of trust which the little girl and her parents reposed in the institution and the proprietor, noting that the increase in cases of killing for money and ritual purposes had assumed a frightening dimension; thus making life unsafe for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cKilling, kidnapping, sexual and gender-based violence are taking a severe tolls on women and girls who are the soft targets of evil perpetrators. There was a case of Aisha Umar, an IDP, who was lured and raped by a humanitarian provider, which led to her committing suicide in Maiduguri, Borno state, as she could not stand the trauma.\n\n\u201cThe brutal murder of the son of a gender activist, Ms. Ene Ede, in Abuja recently by yet-to-be identified murderers, to mention but a few, are all indicators that all is not well in our dear country. As mothers, we say with pains that this is no longer the Nigeria we grew up to know where the care for the younger generation was the responsibility of all adults and the community as a whole. As mothers, we appeal to Nigerians to be more vigilant, security-conscious as well as report suspicious characters to security agencies,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nNCWS\u2019 reaction\n\nLikewise, on January 24, in a statement in Abuja, signed by its national president, Mrs. Laraba Shoda, the National Council of Women Societies (NCWS) called for justice for Hanifa Abubakar, describing her murder as \u201ctragic\u201d and demanded that her killer be brought to book.\n\n\u201cThe kidnap and eventual murder of Hanifa by her teacher after collecting ransom of six million naira from her parent, is one of the most inhuman acts of wickedness. The killing of this innocent Nigerian child by the proprietor of her school is a gross betrayal of trust, which the little girl and her parents reposed in the institution.\n\n\u201cA situation where care-givers that should protect and care for children become predators is certainly unsustainable and needs urgent actions. We must secure justice for Hanifa and others. We need to lay an indicator that no family will be able to question the decision of enrolling their wards in a school that is not safe,\u201d the statement read in part.\n\nAnother case in Kaduna\n\nSimilarly, barely 48 hours after the discovery of Hanifa\u2019s murder in Kano, an eight-year-old girl, Asma\u2019u Shuaibu, who was abducted by one of her neighbours on December 9, 2021, was also killed in Zaria, Kaduna state, by her abductors even after her father, Shuaibu Wa\u2019Alamu, had paid N3 million ransom for her release.\n\n\u201cMy daughter was abducted on December 9; when she failed to return home, I lodged a formal complaint with the police. After some days, the abductors began to call my number and demanded N15 million, but we negotiated and I first gave them N2 million. They collected the money in the Rigasa area of Kaduna. Later, they called me again and demanded another N1.045 million as the only condition to release my daughter. I did not argue, but gave the money to them.\n\n\u201cHowever, after paying the ransom as demanded on January 19, they called me to tell me they had killed my daughter and they immediately switched off their phone. You see, from the initial stage, I was following her abductors and doing their bidding because of the fear of losing my daughter. Now, they have killed her. I know those who abducted her and killed her. In fact, the suspects have been arrested,\u201d he told newsmen.\n\nNHRC\u2019s calls\n\nOn January 24, in a statement in Abuja by its deputy director, public affairs, Fatimah Agwai Mohammed, the executive secretary of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Mr. Tony Ojukwu, called for the elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against gender-related killings, also known as femicides, saying \u201cwomen and children are being treated like endangered species by their abusers.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is disappointing to note the attitude of those who are entrusted with the safety of this vulnerable group of people, but turn around to betray their trust. I call on perpetrators of violence against women and children to desist from the dastardly act. Presently, we are making our interventions in several cases including the case of a man who allegedly murdered his three children in Enugu.\n\n\u201cAlso, the unfortunate incident of Hanifa, who was also allegedly murdered by her handlers in cold blood in Kano, is another incident of gruesome murder and the case of Oromoni and several others across the states. We will follow all these cases to logical conclusions and ensure that justice is served.\n\n\u201cIn January alone, the commission received so many complaints of heinous acts of human rights abuse meted on women and children across the country. We are just in the first month of the year, this is alarming. The commission has begun intense investigation into the case of alleged rape and subsequent death of one 16-year-old Aisha Umar in Borno. Women and children are being treated like endangered species by their abusers.\u201d\n\nBuhari\u2019s concerns, directives\n\nOn January 21, in a statement by his media aide, Malam Garba Shehu, President Muhammadu Buhari expressed the nation\u2019s condolences to the family of Hanifa, praising the work of the police and the secret service in unravelling the mystery behind the disappearance and murder of the child.\n\nHe particularly lauded them for the arrest of her teacher and his other accomplices suspected to have been involved in the child\u2019s kidnap and murder, saying the family and the whole nation, which followed up on Hanifa\u2019s travail every day since her disappearance in December last year, were hoping for the girl to have been rescued alive and well.\n\nHe, however, noted that the very thorough and painstaking detective operation by the law enforcement bodies, leading to the discovery of the corpse and the arrest of the suspects, who had already made confessions, were commendable, adding that this was an achievement that should instil more public confidence in the authorities.\n\n\u201cWhen breakthroughs like this happen, people will talk differently of law enforcement,\u201d the president said.\n\nPresident Buhari prayed for the repose of the soul of the little school girl and urged her parents to bear the sad loss with courage and fortitude in God, urging the police and the ministry of justice to uphold the integrity of the detective work that cracked the case by preparing well and presenting a good case that will earn the respect of the court.",

They also want the court to declare that the minister and his agents were biased in their assessment of the bidding in favour of the CCECC.\n\nPlaintiffs applied for order of injunction against the minister, his ministry and the CCECC from continuing with the award of the contract and execution of same on the basis of a flawed process.\n\nIn the alternative, they sought general damages to be quantified against the defendants on a compensatory basis and compound interest for loss of use of money.\n\nMeanwhile, a hearing in the matter has been fixed for February 17, 2022, by Justice Ahmed Ramat Mohammed.",

          "text": "Suspected kidnap kingpin, Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike, popularly known as Evans, has denied kidnapping a businessman, Sylvanus Ahamonu, and collecting a $420,000 ransom from his family.\n\nHe made the denial on Friday while answering questions under cross-examination by the Lagos State government\u2019s prosecutor, Mr Yusuf Sule.\n\nEvans is standing trial at the Lagos Special Offences Court sitting in Ikeja alongside an ex-soldier, Victor Aduba, on a four-count charge of kidnapping and unlawful possession of firearms.\n\nAt the proceedings on Friday, Evans, a native of Nnewi in Anambra State, told the court that he was born on April 22, 1980. He vehemently denied knowing Ahamonu before his arrest.\n\nREAD ALSO: Evans Loses N200m Suit Against Police In Appeal Court\n\nWhen the prosecutor noted that Ahamonu had identified him when he testified virtually (via the Zoom app) in court, Evans said he was easily identifiable.\n\n\u201cI do not know Slyvanus Ahamonu, I only met him in the IG\u2019s (Inspector-General of Police) Guest House at Falomo,\u201d the defendant stated. \u201cOne day at the IG Guest House, the police brought some documents and asked me to sign, I asked what the documents are for, but they didn\u2019t answer me.\n\n\u201cThey said that if I don\u2019t cooperate with them, they will kill me. When I refused, Inspector Philip asked them to take me to the back of the guest house. When I got there, they were pressing cigarette butts on my body.\n\n\u201cThey killed about six persons in my presence, and I eventually signed the document; I was not allowed to read it. I think it is the document that was used to bring me to court.\n\n\u201cI do not know anything about the allegations before this court. I don\u2019t know who Ahamonu is. I only met him at the IG\u2019s guest house, I had not had any prior contact with him. Ahamonu and Idowu Haruna (the Investigating Police Officer) could have conspired.\n\n\u201cMy pictures are everywhere, all over the world. Before my picture was everywhere, people knew who I was. I had a haulage and logistics business with over 30 staff and drivers in Amuwo-Odofin.\u201d\n\nThe suspected kidnap kingpin also testified that he was tortured by the police, although he could not provide medical documents in proof of his claim to the court.\n\nHe explained that while he was incarcerated, he had filed a fundamental human rights suit at the Federal High Court in Lagos against the police over the alleged torture.\n\nOn why he was seen in a jovial mood in the video detailing his confession of the crimes to the police, Evans said he was forced to act in that manner by the police.\n\n\u201cThe police told me to be laughing and smiling in the video,\u201d the defendant stated. \u201cYou do not know what I encountered in the hands of Abba Kyari and his boys. My eyes saw hell. It was what they told me to be doing that I was doing.\u201d\n\nEvans also told the court that no firearms were discovered in his home by the police.\n\nAfter listening to Evans\u2019 testimony, Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo adjourned the case till March 11 for the continuation of trial.\n\nSylvanus and his wife, Chimebere Ahamonu, had testified virtually In December last year about how Evans and his gang kidnapped him on June 23, 2014, on Kara Road off Osolo Way in the Ajao Estate area of Lagos.\n\nThe couple narrated how they sold properties, borrowed money, raised funds from family and well-wishers in an attempt to raise the initial $2 million ransom that was allegedly demanded by Evans.\n\nSylvanus who said his hands and legs were chained throughout his two months in captivity said he was only released when the family paid Evans the $420,000 ransom.\n\nHe added that by the time, he was at the point of death.",

          "text": "A former governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha, has dragged the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) before President Muhammadu Buhari, where he has gone to seek his intervention in his battle with the agency.\n\nEFCC had on Monday filed a 17-count charge against Okorocha and others, over an alleged N2.9 billion fraud case before a Federal High Court in Abuja, hours after he officially declared his interest in running for the office of the president in 2023.\n\nOkorocha was however at the State House, Abuja, on Thursday, to intimate the president withhis intention to contest the presidency in 2023, while also informing the President of his travails with the EFCC, insisting that the anti-graft agency was being used to harass him.\n\nSpeaking to newsmen after his meeting with Buhari, Okorocha said there was an existing court order restraining the EFCC from prosecuting him, hence, the president should caution the anti-graft agency against holding the court in contemptHe, however, explained that he had not requested President Buhari to stop him from being investigated, but to get the anti-graft agency to obey the law and to also order release of his international passport.His words: \u201cI used this opportunity to intimate Mr. President of what is going on between me and Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and the harassment and intimidation that I\u2019m getting from the EFCC, literally on daily basis, and to inform him that I have court judgment and two court orders for different judgments at different forums, which stop the EFCC from harassing and intimidating me. EFCC has refused to obey the law.\u201cSo, I have to inform Mr. President that EFCC should be made to obey the law that established it and without the law, there wouldn\u2019t be an EFCC. Also, the desperation with which they go about any affair that concerns me, should stop.\u201cAnd I reminded Mr. President that, sometime ago, the EFCC had claimed that they recovered the sum of N5.9 billion from my account, which the court found out to be untrue. In other words, they were biased and they prejudged me. On that basis, the court ruled and ordered that they should not further interrogate and harass me. This has also not been obeyed.\n\n\u201cThe court ordered the EFCC to release my international passport, the EFCC has refused to obey. The court gave damages to me for some N500million for EFCC to pay. EFCC has not paid that. Rather than doing that, on the day of my declaration, EFCC went on the press to announce that I\u2019m being prosecuted for some criminal charges of N2.9billion and no more than N5.9billion.\n\n\u201cSo, I said as the president of Federal Republic of Nigeria, and one that stands on the side of law, he should bring this to the attention of the EFCC. And despite the efforts by the Office of the Attorney General to make the EFCC see reasons and obey court judgment, to release my travel documents, and stop the harassment, they have refused.\n\n\u201cSo, I think that is some kind of desperation on the side of EFCC. And I don\u2019t know, who might be causing this, but it is appropriate that I do let them know of the injustice that is going on with me as regards the EFCC. One of the duties of a president is to protect the law of the land. And when an issue comes to an issue of judgment the duty is incumbent on the government of the day to ensure that justice is done.\n\n\u201cI came to demand for justice that you should prevail and as the custodian, as the leader of our nation, he should be made to know that such is going on. I didn\u2019t come here to say, I don\u2019t want to be investigated by the EFCC. That\u2019s not the issue; that there\u2019s judgment on the ground. There\u2019s judgment and there\u2019s order of court that I\u2019m asking Mr. President, who appointed the EFCC to recall that there was the law that established the EFCC.\n\n\u201cAnd if that law is good to make somebody EFCC, that law should be obeyed, too. So, I\u2019m not asking Mr. President, to speak on matter,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked what the president\u2019s response was, Okorocha claimed, \u201cThe President said he would take up the matter, especially, when he saw the judgment. He said, we\u2019ll take up the matter and find out what is actually happening. And I hope he will do so. And I believe he will do that.\u201d",

          "text": "In a big hindrance to Nigeria\u2019s hope of raising its poor daily oil production, Shell has said it would delay expansion work at its Nigerian offshore Bonga field by another two years.\n\nA report by S&P Global Platts, a financial indices provider, said the development was a major blow to Nigeria\u2019s quest to grow its crude production after a series of technical and operational setbacks, quoting sources close to the project.\n\nIn May 2021 Shell, along with its partners, signed a deal with the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC) in the deepwater oil block Oil Mining Lease 118, clearing the path for a major expansion of the country\u2019s Bonga oil and gas field. The development was previously shelved due to a long-standing tax dispute with Shell, the operator of the field, S&P recalled.\n\nAfter the resolution of the dispute, Shell once again invited bids for the construction of a new floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit for its Bonga Southwest deepwater oil field in Nigeria. However, the response to the tender had been underwhelming, a senior official at NNPC told S&P Global Platts.\n\n\u201cThere has been a delay in progressing with the tendering process for the Bonga Southwest field. The tenders have been put on hold till around 2024,\u201d the official was quoted as saying.\n\nA spokesman for the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), Nigeria, confirmed that the contract award for the construction of the 150,000 bpd Bonga Southwest FPSO had been put on hold.\n\n\u201cThe Bonga Southwest has been deferred,\u201d he said, declining to offer further details.\n\nHowever, sources at NNPC and Shell, the report noted, said delays could be related to a change in Shell\u2019s upstream strategy as part of its net zero ambitions.\n\nShell is Nigeria\u2019s biggest oil producer, but the oil giant in recent years has complained about some commercial and security issues.\n\nIn May 2021, Shell\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Ben van Beurden, told investors the company was focusing more on its Nigerian deepwater and gas assets after it deemed its onshore oil portfolio in Nigeria, \u201cno longer compatible\u201d with its strategic ambitions, which include a focus on climate change and net zero carbon strategy.\n\nThe energy major is currently in talks with the federal government to sell at its onshore oil assets.\n\nBonga, Nigeria\u2019s first deepwater oil field, currently has the capacity to produce 225,000 bpd of crude oil and 150 MMcf/d of gas which feeds the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) plant at Bonny.\n\nDeveloping Bonga South-west was set to add around one billion barrels to Nigeria\u2019s oil reserves, the report stated.\n\nShell had previously said it would develop the Bonga South-west project in three phases, with a total potential yield of 3.2 billion barrels.\n\nOutput from the field was one of the projects Nigeria was banking on to raise production to around three million bpd by 2023, NNPC officials said.\n\nNigeria, which produces high quality light sweet crude oil, has seen its production slump to multi-decade lows, due to alleged operational, technical and sabotage issues.\n\nThe country has the capacity to pump around 2.2 million bpd of crude and condensate, but in 2021 output languished near 1.55 million b/d, according to Platts estimates.\n\nDeveloping the Bonga Southwest would cost $10 billion, according to estimates by the NNPC, the concessionaire of the field.\n\nThe bulk of Bonga Southwest\u2019s resources are located in OML 118, but it also extends into OMLs 132 and 140, operated by US major Chevron, where it is called Aparo. Other partners in the project are France\u2019s TotalEnergies and Italy\u2019s Eni\n\nMeanwhile, Shell has joined the ranks of other big oil majors that had recently reported huge profits on higher oil and gas prices, announcing $6.4 billion in net income for the final quarter of 2021.\n\nIn addition, earnings for the full year soared to $19.29 billion, up from $4.8 billion for 2020, Shell said, plus a reduction in net debt by $23 billion to $52.6 billion during the period under review.\n\nBefore now, data from Shell released last month revealed that oil trading slowed down during the fourth quarter of 2021, but gas trading flourished amid the surge in demand and tight supply of the commodity in some parts of the world.\n\nChief executive Ben van Beurden said, \u201c2021 was a momentous year for Shell. We launched our Powering Progress strategy and simplified our share structure and organisation.\n\n\u201cProgress made in 2021 will enable us to be bolder and move faster. We have a compelling strategy, with customers at its core. We have ambitious plans to generate shareholder value, to decarbonise our products and to provide energy to our customers while respecting nature.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Shell said it would buy back another $8.5 billion worth of stocks during the first half of the year and raise dividends yet again, by four per cent for the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThe former Anglo-Dutch major, which last year dropped its Dutch headquarters to become a fully British-based company, benefited, like its peers, from higher oil prices. This is despite the fact that it shrunk its core operations after a Dutch court ordered it to sharply reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nIn response, Shell sold its assets in the Permian Basin, bringing in $5.5 billion, which it expects to deploy to buy back stock.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Thursday said Africa records about 1.1 million new cases of cancer every year resulting in 700,000 deaths.\n\nIn a message to commemorate this year\u2019s World Cancer Day, the world body said more than 400,000 children were diagnosed annually with cancer around the world, with about 90 per cent living in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nIn the message issued by the WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, it urged member states in the continent to make the necessary investment required to ensure that all our citizens, no matter their incomes or geographic location, have access to quality cancer care.\n\n\u201cEvery year, Africa records around 1.1 million new cases of cancer, resulting in up to 700 000 deaths. Breast cancer, along cervical, prostate, liver and colorectal cancers, account for almost half the new cases on the continent annually.\n\n\u201cChildren are also inequitably impacted. Of the more than 400, 000 children diagnosed annually with cancer around the world, about 90 per cent live in low- and middle-income countries. \u201cSurvival rates are at a very low 20 per cent or less in African countries, compared to more than 80 per cent in developed countries,\u201d it said.\n\nAccording to Moeti, this year\u2019s theme, \u201cClose the care gap,\u201d marked the start of a three-year campaign to raise global awareness around cancer and its impacts, especially among most vulnerable citizens.\n\n\n\nHe also said that common challenges across the African region included lack of awareness and education, limited access to primary prevention and early detection services, coupled with delays in diagnosis and treatment.\n\n\u201cThere is also limited access to palliative care and pain relief.\n\nShortages of specialists in medical and radiation oncology, pathology, medical physics and other essential areas compound the gaps.\n\n\u201cAfrica has only three per cent of the world\u2019s cancer treatment facilities, with radiotherapy available in just 22 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which contributes to poor survival rates,\u201d he added.\n\nTo \u201cclose the care gap,\u201d WHO Africa is driving a number of key initiatives. These have seen 45 per cent of our countries introduce national HPV vaccination programmes to address the cervical cancer threat. National screening programmes are now operational in 72 per cent countries, 11 of which offer high-performance screening.),\u201d he said. Moeti said renewed efforts to curb new cancer cases were urgent, adding that there are alarming projections that cancer death rates in Africa would rise exponentially over the next 20 years, outstripping the global average by 30 per cent.He also said that common challenges across the African region included lack of awareness and education, limited access to primary prevention and early detection services, coupled with delays in diagnosis and treatment.\u201cThere is also limited access to palliative care and pain relief.Shortages of specialists in medical and radiation oncology, pathology, medical physics and other essential areas compound the gaps.\u201cAfrica has only three per cent of the world\u2019s cancer treatment facilities, with radiotherapy available in just 22 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, which contributes to poor survival rates,\u201d he added.To \u201cclose the care gap,\u201d WHO Africa is driving a number of key initiatives.

Moeti further said that through the Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer (GICC), Zambia, Senegal and Ghana have developed country-specific treatment guidelines, established pediatric hospital-based registries, and improved access to chemotherapy.

As countries work towards universal health care, with the support of WHO, cancer risk factors need to be prioritized. Equitable access to life-saving vaccines, robust screening and early detection programmes, combined with a skilled workforce and adequate infrastructure and equipment, are also critical. \u201cAs individuals, governments, partners and civil society, we all have a role to play.
