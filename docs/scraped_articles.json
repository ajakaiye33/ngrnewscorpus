          "text": "Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to \u201cdirect the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN, and appropriate anti-corruption agencies to promptly and thoroughly investigate how over N11 trillion meant to provide regular electricity supply has been allegedly squandered by governments since 1999.\u201d\n\nSERAP said: \u201cAnyone suspected to be responsible should face prosecution as appropriate, if there is sufficient admissible evidence, and any missing public funds should be traced and fully recovered.\u201d\n\nSERAP also urges him to \u201crefer to the International Criminal Court all unimplemented reports of corruption in the electricity sector gathering dust on the shelves, and to arrest and surrender those named in the reports to the court for prosecution.\u201d\n\nSERAP\u2019s letter followed the collapse of the national grid, which has plunged the country into total darkness. Generation capacity has dropped to 2,000 megawatts with about 14 power plants shutting down.\n\nIn the letter dated 19 March, 2022 and signed by SERAP deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: \u201cNigerians have for far too long been denied justice and the opportunity to get to the bottom of why they continue to pay the price for corruption in the electricity sector\u2013staying in darkness, but still made to pay crazy electricity bills.\u201d\n\nSERAP said: \u201cThe staggering amounts of public funds alleged to have been stolen over the years in the electricity sector have had catastrophic effects on the lives of millions of Nigerians, akin to crimes against humanity against the Nigerian people.\u201d\n\nAccording to SERAP, \u201cInvestigating the allegations of missing N11 trillion electricity funds, prosecuting suspected perpetrators and recovering any missing public funds would end a culture of impunity. It would also address persistent collapse of the electricity grid, and improve access to and affordability of electricity in the country.\u201d\n\nThe letter, read in part: \u201cThe situation will not improve unless you fulfil your campaign promises to probe corruption in the electricity sector, prosecute perpetrators, and recover any missing public funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorruption in the electricity sector and the lack of transparency and accountability in the use of public funds to support the operations of DISCOS have resulted in regular blackouts, electricity grid collapse, and unlawful hike in electricity tariffs.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorruption in the electricity sector has also continued to disproportionately affect the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sectors of the population who cannot readily afford expensive generators in order to have a reliable power supply.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour government has constitutional and international obligations to ensure regular and uninterrupted supply of electricity, even in times of resource constraints.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP urges you to urgently implement documented reports of cases of corruption in the electricity sector, and ensure full accountability and restitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would be grateful if the recommended measures are taken within 7 days of the receipt and/or publication of this letter.

We will not allow this to go on.\u2019 The national grid collapse suggests that this promise remains unfulfilled.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights has adjudged the failure of the States to provide basic services such as electricity as violating the right to health.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrupt officials and corrupt contractors in the electricity sector know well that their conduct is criminal and injurious, and the denial of human dignity coupled with a radical breach of solemn trust, aggravate their alleged crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cCitizens are frustrated at persistent allegations of corruption in the sector, and the impacts on their human rights. Prosecuting perpetrators would address the grave travesty that has for many years occurred in the power sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpunity for corruption in the electricity sector has for many years forced ordinary Nigerians to stay in darkness, but still made to pay crazy electricity bills.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuccessive governments have failed to increase power generation and provide Nigerians with regular and uninterrupted electricity supply, with many electricity contracts shrouded in secrecy, and trillions of Naira going down the drain.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpunity for corruption in the electricity sector will continue as long as high-ranking public officials go largely unpunished for their alleged crimes. It is by pursuing these allegations and taking the evidence before the court that the truth will be revealed and justice best served.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe failure by successive governments to tell Nigerians the truth about allegations of corruption in the power sector amounts to a failure to ensure that electricity services are progressively made available, on the basis of equality and non-discrimination.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe details of the missing N11 trillion electricity funds are contained in a SERAP report titled: From Darkness to Darkness: How Nigerians are paying the Price for Corruption in the Electricity Sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the report, the total estimated financial loss to Nigeria from corruption in the electricity sector starting from the return to democracy in 1999 to date is over N11 trillion. This represents public funds, private equity and social investment (or divestments) in the power sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is estimated that the loss may reach over N20 trillion in the next decade given the rate of Government investment and funding in the power sector amidst dwindling fortune and recurrent revenue shortfalls.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP also urges you to immediately implement the judgment by Justice Chuka Austine Obiozor in suit number FHC/L/CS/105/19 which ordered your government to immediately publish the names of companies and the whereabouts of the contractors paid by governments since 1999 to carry out electricity projects across the country but disappeared with the money without executing any projects.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe enforcement of the judgment could potentially reveal individuals, contractors, and companies allegedly responsible for squandering over N11 trillion meant to provide regular electricity supply under successive governments, lead to the prosecution of suspected perpetrators, and recovery of any missing public funds.\u201d\n\nThe letter was copied to Mr Malami.",

          "text": ".\n\nMrs Patience Key, the immediate past Chairman of Nigerians in Diaspora Organisation Americas (NIDOA), USA, says the Russo-Ukraine conflict will affect Nigeria, being an oil-producing country.\n\nKey told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in New York on Sunday that the crisis would affect Africa\u2019s economy and also threaten the global economy.\n\nShe said Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine had led to a sharp rise in global oil prices amounting to almost 100 dollars per barrel and counting if the tension deepens.\n\n\u201cThis development without a doubt will pose high implications for the Nigerian economy as the largest oil-producing country in Africa. By extension, Africa will also feel the impact as its largest economy is affected.\n\n\u201cRussia happened to be among the first three largest oil-producing countries in the world and the 11th largest economy globally, and by that its impact is felt in the global market as one of the major actors who determines the global economy.\n\n\u201cIts recent and continuous onslaught on Ukraine has moved her contemporaries like the U.S, U.K, etc. to placing strict economic sanctions on the country and her citizen\u2019s investments outside the shores of Russia.\n\n\u201cThis has a ripple effect on the economies of Nigeria and Africa,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nAccording to her, an example is the ongoing bilateral discussions on the resuscitation of the Ajaokuta Steel Mill between the Federal Government and the Russian government.\n\nKey said there were indices that the discussions could be frustrated and strained as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine progresses.\n\nRussia to ensure safety, wellbeing of Nigerians \u2014 Official\n\n\u201cThough the global oil prices surged as a result of the sanctions placed on Russia; the second-largest oil-producing country in the world, it adversely had placed Nigeria at an advantage as the largest oil-producing country in Africa as demand for its crude oil rises.\n\n\u201cAmidst all that, economists are thrilled with mixed feelings over pointers showing that there are still strong indications that the inherent distortions in the Nigerian economy might eventually worsen and topple the already fragile economic condition,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nThe official said the conflict could be a blessing in disguise, noting that the conflict presently brings about an increase in global oil prices.\n\n\u201cI feel it is the right time for the Nigerian government to make some money as much as they consider and use the profit to pay-off, service some of our loans and grow the economy.\n\n\u201cOur already depleting foreign reserve can also be revisited and serviced for rainy days. If our foreign reserve is fatty, we wouldn\u2019t be running to countries seeking for loans,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nIn addition, she said the development would also lead to an increase in the amount payable as \u2018fuel subsidy\u2019 which might consequently result in inflation and impact other sectors such as the external sector accounts and domestic economy.\n\n\u201cIt might result in inflation and impact other sectors because while the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) may have enough supply to support the foreign exchange market over the short term, declining foreign inflows and weakening of the external reserves could force further currency depreciation.\n\n\u201cThe impact of Ukraine\u2019s invasion by Russia might also result in the absence of investment from investors within and outside the country.\n\n\u201cThis will slow the development of Africa, especially on the competition to cope with the 4th industrial revolution.\u201d\n\nKey, a 2023 presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP), called on the two countries to embrace dialogue.\n\n\u201cThe implications in case of another world war are unimaginable.\n\n\u201cWar shouldn\u2019t be a conceived or contemplated thought because, in all sense, it is an abominable act against every living creature of God,\u201d she emphasised.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "STATE OF THE NATION: Resign, hand over to Osinbajo, Ortom tells Buhari",
          "text": "By Peter Duru, Makurdi\n\nGovernor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has berated President Muhammadu Buhari for plunging Nigeria into unimaginable economic crisis as well as his inability to tackle the worrisome security challenges decimating the country, and called on him to resign and hand over to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.\n\n\n\nOrtom in an interview with Sunday Vanguard, also said supporting Buhari to become the president in 2015 was a mistake, even as he stressed that his criticism of All Progressive Congress, APC, led Federal Government was born out of patriotism, equity, fairness and justice.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Federal Government has completely failed, no doubt, and I want to call on President Buhari to accept the fact that he has failed this country and I want to advise him to honourably resign as President of Nigeria and hand over to his Vice to handle the affairs of this country. Otherwise, this country is going down.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really disappointed and that is why I am calling on President to resign because the capacity is not there to lead and address the hardship that Nigerians are going through. I call on him to resign. The President should accept this fact and call all of us irrespective of party affiliations and religion, to tell him the truth of what is happening. If he is willing to take our advice, things will get back on track. We are ready to team up and work with him.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn his role to the emergence of Buhari as President in 2015, and why their relationship has gone south, the former Minister said it was a mistake. \u201cYes, I was part of those who worked for the election of the President in 2015. We worked hard for him based on the promises that he gave us. He assured that he would be a President for everybody and for nobody but today, we have seen clearly that the President is a President for the Fulani people.\n\n\n\n\u201cSince the inception of Nigeria even before independence, we have never witnessed this kind of nepotism that is going on in our country. We have never witnessed this level of disunity and insecurity in the country. We have never seen this kind of economic downturn the way we have it today. The issue is about incompetence, non-performance, barefooted leadership, lame-duck, and about somebody without a vision and direction to lead our country. So, It is just that we made a mistake in 2015 but by the grace of God, the PDP is ready to rescue our country and rebuild it again, and take it from bottom to top\u201d.\n\nOn insecurity, Ortom explained that the basic responsibility of any government was the provision of security for lives and property. According to him, \u201cthe level of insecurity in the country today is worrisome. I have severally talked about security summits. I\u2019m not just criticising but I\u2019m also providing solutions to the problems that we have. If you call us to a security summit and you are sincere, we shall advise you and we shall put heads together and come out with solutions.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking further, the governor expressed worries over the increasing number of internally displaced persons, IDPs, in Benue, saying that over 1.5 million people have been chased away from their ancestral homes by terrorists who have taken over their communities. He noted the resolve of Benue people to defend themselves against armed herders.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is really unfortunate that I have over 1.5 million IDPs in Benue State out of the projected seven million population of the state. Moreso, more than 80 percent of the IDPs are farmers that earned us the appellation of the food basket of the nation. Today, they are in IDPs\u2019 camps suffering. It is unfortunate but we will take action in our own way. I have consulted with my people and they have told me what we are supposed to do and we are going to take decisive action because enough is enough. We have cried enough. We will take steps to stop the killings. We will complement the security agencies but we are not going to compromise our peace and security again\u201d, he opined.\n\n\n\nWhile stressing that restructuring of Nigeria was long overdue, the governor adviced the President Buhari to dust the recommendations of the former President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s National Conference and implement it or initiate his own by calling Nigerians together irrespective of their party affiliations to discuss ways to solve the problems bedeviling the country.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

And if you talk about someone like Abubakar Bukola Saraki, you can say \u2018okay this was what he did before going into office\u2019, you can say \u2018his father was a very wealthy man\u2019. His father was a multimillionaire in US dollars. He had such and such assets.\n\n\u201cBut if you talk about Bola Tinubu, who were his parents? How old is he really? We don\u2019t know. Okay now, How did he make his money and from what businesses? We don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cAll we know is that he worked in Mobile or even Chevron, so, where did all the money come from? On the day of the election in 2019, we saw Bullion vans coming out of Tinubu\u2019s House and this is against the money laundering act of 2011, which says that any amount above N5 million must be transacted through the bank.

          "text": "Indigenous people of Biafra (IPOB) has assured its full support to Southeast governors ready to work for the interest and liberty of the people of the region.\n\nIt warned those who make themselves willing tool to criminalise its agitation for freedom to have a rethink or be ready to pay dearly for it.\n\nThe group, in a statement by its Media and Publicity, Emma Powerful, particularly expressed its preparedness to work with Anambra State governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo to secure the State and make it envy of black race.\n\nSoludo had during his inauguration, sued for peace with the agitators, warning politicians playing politics with insecurity in the zone to desist forthwith.\n\nIPOB however warned the governor against repeating the mistakes of his predecessor who it said allowed himself to be used by its enemies to persecute its people.\n\nThe statement reads in part, \u201cOur attention has been drawn to an encouraging statement by the new Governor of Anambra State, Professor Chukwuma Soludo during his inauguration.\n\n\u201cWe commend him for reasoning the way he did, but at the same time, we admonish him to be wary of wicked, selfish and evil politicians who never mean well for our people so as not to deceive him.\n\n\u201cWe hope he will keep to his promises and serve our people selflessly and wholeheartedly which in turn will help to promote the peace and security of our ancestral land. Anambra being (Diokpara) the first Son must show leadership in the much awaited renaissance.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, assure him of the full cooperation of Biafran youths in his efforts to secure Anambra State. IPOB will give him every support he needs to make Anambra the envy of the black race.\n\n\u201cSoludo, in order to succeed, must not take seriously those or anyone whether part of his government or not that will advice him to arrest, imprison, and kill IPOB family members in Anambra State because if he listens to those criminal political harlots, that will be the beginning of his failure as a governor.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore, advise him to remain focused on his vision and mission and shun distractions and bad advice from evil politicians. He should not repeat the mistakes of his predecessor Willie Obiano, who allowed himself to be used by Fulani people to persecute our people.\n\n\u201cThey killed our people at Nkpor in 2016 during our annual remembrance of our fallen heroes and heroines who paid the ultimate price for our freedom between 1967 and 1970, yet the Governor never asked questions.\n\n\u201cSoludo is a seasoned technocrat and an accomplished Igbo who should use his wealth of knowledge to develop our land.\n\n\u201cWe are willing to support him as long as he will not turn to be a willing instrument in the hands of our oppressors to persecute our people, especially BIAFRA agitators. We wish him success in office.\n\nThe statement added, \u201cWe wish to assure South East and South-South governors that IPOB members are human beings with an unwavering interest of Biafrans at heart.\n\n\u201cOur work is geared towards pursuing the happiness, wellbeing and security of the Biafran people and of Biafraland. We\u2019re ready and open to cooperating with any of them seeking our support for the common good of our people.\n\n\u201cWe also state that any governor that makes himself a willing Fulani tool to either criminalise our just agitation for freedom will without a doubt be paid in the same coin.\n\n\u201cIPOB will fully support any Governor in Biafra land who shows he has the understanding of the times, and the precarious condition of our people in Nigeria. If any Governor does not conspire with our oppressors to perpetuate our woes, he/she will enjoy the full support of our people.\n\n\u201cIPOB is a peaceful movement working hard to restore Biafra independence. We will never give up on our agitation until we are given a date for referendum to decide our fate as a people.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to work with anyone in Government who works for the interest and liberty of our people.\u201d",

No AGU 460 ZW, at Obosi bridge heading to Aba, Abia state from Onitsha. Upon search, seven and half jumbo sacks of cannabis weighing 362kg were recovered while the driver, Ifeanyi Anyamele admitted to being the owner of the drug exhibits.\n\n\u201cThe previous day, Wednesday 16th March, narcotic officers in Ogun state recovered 865.2kg of cannabis sativa around Otapele- Obada road in Imeko-Afon LGA. The consignment was brought in from Benin Republic on motorbikes for onward transportation to Lagos and Abeokuta.\n\n\u201cSame day, operatives in the state arrested Bello Ibrahim, 38, with 312.4kg of cannabis Sativa at Ogere tollgate, Ikenne LGA.\n\n\u201cWhile commending officers and men of the NAIA, Kaduna, Anambra and Ogun state Commands of the Agency for their vigilance and diligence, Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig.

          "text": "The National Assembly is shocked by Friday\u2019s judgment from the Federal High Court, Umuahia, voiding Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act and ordering its deletion forthwith, The Nation gathered yesterday.\n\nConsequently, the legislative arm has started assembling a team of legal giants to study the judgment and advise it on the next line of action.\n\nNo less shocked by the court\u2019s pronouncement are several senior lawyers who, yesterday, questioned the premise on which the judgment was based and the circumstances that birthed it.\n\nBut that is not the only issue with the act. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday turned in its own assessment of the law, saying that some of its provisions are inimical to the electoral process.\n\nThe commission said it would seek practice direction on how to deal with the identified problems.\n\nInvestigation revealed that federal lawmakers were shocked that the Federal High Court voided and repealed Section 84(12) of the Act.\n\nTheir grouses include the following:\n\nThe ruling amounts to the erosion of the independence of the Legislature.\n\nNeither the two chambers of the National Assembly nor the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was joined as a party to the application.\n\nNo court can delete or repeal an Act but could void it.\n\n*Since the ruling is still justiceable at the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, it is hasty for the Federal Government to gazette it.\n\nA principal officer of the National Assembly, who spoke on the issue with our correspondent, said: \u201cWe were shocked by the decision of the court in a case we were not a party to. The National Assembly is already seeking legal advice on the next steps.\n\n\u201cNeither the two chambers of the National Assembly nor the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was joined in a fundamental suit like this.\n\n\u201cThe decision of the Federal High Court will no doubt undermine the legislative powers of the National Assembly. It may also set a bad precedent.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, no court has the power to repeal an Act of the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question, the principal officer added: \u201cThe lawmakers have the right to seek redress in the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nJudgment a great error, says Falana\n\nSenior Advocate of Nigeria and human rights advocate, Femi Falana, called the court order that Section 84(12) of the amended Electoral Act be deleted as a great error.\n\nThe contentious section stipulates that \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\u201d\n\nJustice Evelyn Anyadike, in her ruling, said the section ought to be struck down as it cannot stand when it is in violation of the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\nThe said Sections 66(1)(f), 107(1)(f), 137(1)(f) and 182(1)(f) of the 1999 Constitution already stipulate that people employed in the public service of the federal or state government seeking to contest elections should resign at least 30 days to the date of the election.\n\nBut Falana, in a statement yesterday, said the judge \u201cfell into a great error.\u201d\n\nHis words: \u201cSections 66 (1) (f), 107(1) (f), 137 (1) (f) and 182 (1) (f) of the Constitution relied upon by his lordship require persons employed in the public service of either the Federal Government or State Governments.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, each of the aforesaid sections provides that \u2018No person shall be qualified for election into the Senate or House of Reps if:\n\n(f) he is a person employed in the public service of the Federation or of any State and has not resigned, withdrawn or retired from such employment 30 days before the date of election.\u2019\n\n\u201cBy virtue of section 318 of the Constitution, political appointees are not included in the list of persons employed in the public service. To that extent, section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act was annulled on a very faulty ground.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, the Judge would have dismissed the case if his attention had been drawn to the cases of DADA v. ADEYEYE (2005) 6 NWLR (Pt. 920) 1 at 19 ASOGWA v. CHUKWU (2003) 4 NWLR (Pt. 811) 540 OJONYE V. ONU & ORS (2018) LPELR-44223) where the appellate Courts have held that political appointees or political office holders are not public servants as provided for under the Constitution.\u201d\n\nNASS should not leave it unchallenged \u2014Ukweni\n\nAnother senior advocate, Mba Ukweni, said the National Assembly should challenge the judgment at the Court of Appeal.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf one wants to contest an election, you resign from your position. For instance, if somebody is working in INEC, you cannot run in an election after sometime. The law has a reason for that.\n\n\u201cAn elective office is different from appointment. It has been there and it doesn\u2019t violate any person\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cRights are not absolute. I will want the National Assembly, if they are made a party to it, to challenge the decision.\n\n\u201cIf I were a party in the case, I would challenge it in the higher court to have a second look at that provision.\n\n\u201cI have read that provision and it doesn\u2019t appear to be in conflict with the constitution. Even the fundamental rights provided in the constitution are not absolute.\n\n\u201cIf anyone wants to contest in an election and is holding a certain public office, he should resign.\u201d\n\nAjulo: It\u2019s a booby trap for APC\n\nConstitutional and human rights lawyer, Dr. Kayode Ajulo, said the judgment could not stand in the face of the law.\n\nHe also predicted a higher risk for political office holders who may want to take advantage of it.\n\nHe raised three observations thus:\n\n*The Judgment of the Court is per incuriam\n\n*Political appointees are not public servants\n\n*The National Assembly is a necessary party and has a right to set same aside on Appeal\n\n*Compliance with the judgment of the trial court is a booby trap for the ruling APC.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhile the position of our laws is clear to the effect that judgments of courts are valid until set aside on appeal no matter how erroneous they might be, however, considering the ratio decidendi of the decision of the court viz-a-viz the expediency and imminent consequence of the decision of the court on our political administration and party politics, it is therefore imperative to pensively dissect the judgment of the court in the light of the spirit of the Constitution and position of the Apex Court.\n\n\u201cLet us get a point clear: it is undoubted that Courts of superior record by virtue of Section 6 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), have the power to declare an Act of the National Assembly unconstitutional, null and void to the extent of its inconsistency.\n\n\u201cMore so, plethora of authorities have established the principle that where a provision of an enactment by the legislature conflicts with the express provision of the Constitution, the said extant law shall be declared null and void.\n\n\u201cThat is the essence of Section 1(3) of the 1999 constitution as Amended. It provides that \u2018If any other law is inconsistent with the provision of this constitution, this constitution shall prevail, and that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt is however instructive to note that in cases where legislation is contested for being in conflict with provisions of the Constitution, the courts have only one duty: \u2018to lay the article of the Constitution which is invoked beside the statute which is challenged and to decide whether the latter squares with the former\u2026 See the cases of U.S. v. Butler et al (1936) 297 U.S 1 (and Marwa & Ors v. Nyako & Ors (1980) LPELR-2936 (SC).\n\n\u201cIn the case under review, the learned trial judge noted that the provision of Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act is inconsistent with the provision of Sections 66 (1) (f), 107(1) (f), 137 (1) (f) and 182 (1) (f) of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cSuffice to state that a pensive juxtaposing of the Sections of the Constitution relied upon by the learned trial judge require persons employed in the public service of either the federal government or state governments.\n\n\u201cWhat is more, the provision of Section 318 of the Constitution as to who qualifies as a public servant is unambiguous. Similarly, decisions of Court abound on this clear position. See Dada V. Adeyeye (2005) 6 NWLR (Pt. 920), Ojonye V. Onu & ORS (2018) LPELR-44223) where the appellate Courts have held that political appointees or political office holders are not public servants as provided for under the Constitution.\n\n\u201cIt therefore implies that the decision of court, with respect, is per incuriam and the ratio of court cannot find coverage under the Sections of the Constitution cited by the learned trial judge to arrive at the decision.\n\n\u201cBased on the doctrine of judicial precedents, it is quite apposite that the Appellate Court will set aside the decision of the trial court.\n\n\u201cFor those who have mind to think, the perdurable questions to ask include:\n\n*Why was the suit filed in far away Umuahia, Abia State?\n\n*Why were the National Assembly and Independent National Electoral Commission not joined as parties to the suit?\n\n\u201cTo answer these thought-provoking questions, attention must be readily drawn to the fact that the National Assembly who is the authority empowered by Section 4 and 228 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) and the Independent National Electoral Commission who is empowered to regulate the conduct of election in Nigeria by virtue of Section 153 of the Constitution respectively ought to have been joined by the Plaintiff as necessary parties to the action.\n\n\u201cWhile it is not the duty of a judge to force on a Plaintiff the party to be sued, however judicial authorities abound to the effect that where a judge considers that a necessary party has not been joined to an action, it can suo motu make an order for the joinder of such necessary party.\u201d\n\nAjulo said the swift reaction of the Federal Government and the office of the Attorney General of the Federation to the court ruling \u201cleaves too much to be desired of the ruling All Progressives Congress.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cIf the All Progressives Congress should rely on the ephemeral judgment of the Court and proceed to permit Political Appointees to vote and contest at its primaries and conventions, same is a disaster going somewhere to happen.\n\n\u201cWhat readily comes to mind is the decision of the Supreme Court in Zamfara State where the Apex Court held that there were no validly elected candidates in the various elective positions in the state from the APC.\n\n\u201cIn lending my two cents, it is not a triumph neither is it time for drunk fanfare for the All Progressives Congress.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the party must be very circumspect in preventing a repeat of what happened in Zamfara State.\n\nJudgment is in order \u2014Akintola\n\nOn his part, Chief Niyi Akintola (SAN) said the judgment was in order.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe constitution guarantees us the right to vote and be voted for. That aspect of Section 84 which they (NASS) ought to have removed was what the President pointed out.\n\n\u201cThey should have known that the section that says that a political appointee should not contest should have been retained as against to vote and be voted for.\n\n\u201cThere are millions of Nigerians who are already disenfranchised by the constitution which says that you must have certain qualifications before you can become one thing or the other.\n\n\u201cSome Nigerians are already disenfranchised by that provision. They should have limited it to that level. But to say that somebody cannot vote is where they shot themselves in the foot.\n\n\u201cThat is what is wrong with Section 84 that was struck down by the Abia division of Federal High Court, and I am in full agreement with that judgment. You cannot deprive a Nigerian the right to vote.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the National Assembly could challenge the decision, Chief Akintola said: \u201cLet them go ahead. I don\u2019t think there would be any changes. It is very clear. You have the right to vote.\n\n\u201cWhy should I say you should not vote because you are a political appointee? No act of the National Assembly should be in conflict with the position of the constitution. Section 84 of the Act is in conflict with the constitution. Every other law should come under the constitution.\n\n\u201cThere is no absolute right for anybody. No society in the world grants absolute right to anybody.\n\n\u201cThe right to vote is quite different from the right to contest. That is where they shot themselves in the foot. The right to vote is constitutionally guaranteed. The right to contest is a different kettle of fish.\n\n\u201cIf you want to contest, you must resign 30 days before. It is a constitutional provision and no act of the National Assembly can override that.\n\n\u201cIf they want a change, they should go and first of all amend that section of the constitution before they can enact the law. And not when that provision is still in force.\n\n\u201cThey maintain their rights to vote. People are missing the two. There is no absolute right anywhere, but the right to vote is a fundamental right.\u201c\n\nINEC raises poser over new law\n\nFor the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), it is some other provisions of the Electoral Act that are receiving its attention for now.\n\nIt said yesterday that the issues are capable of hampering the 2023 general elections if they are not dealt with immediately.\n\nINEC\u2019s National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education, Festus Okoye, cited the removal of pre-election matters from the High Courts and the High Court of the FCT and domiciling same with the Federal High Court.\n\nHe said: \u201cNow we need to get back to the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court relating to having a practice direction that makes it possible for issues and cases to be determined where the cause of action arose so that we do not have the same situation where a political party will conduct its party primary in Anambra and then issues around the party primaries will be determined by a Federal High Court in Borno State.\n\n\u201cWe need to have a practice direction that enables some level of order and sanity to be embedded in the operations of the several Courts as we continue towards this contentious period in our electoral process.\n\n\u201cThe Electoral Act has just come into force and there are many issues that have been embedded in the Act. We also need to begin a robust training of our staff in relation to some of the issues embedded in the new Act.\u201d\n\nHe added:\u201dOne fundamental issue that bothers the Commission is since the new Electoral Act has changed the trajectory of collation and transmission of election results, we have noticed that violence has left the collation centres back to the polling units and the Commission is really concerned about that.\n\n\u201cWe are going to have a high level of discussion on how to protect our Staff, especially at the level of the polling units, because the political parties know that results are now transmitted directly from the polling units to the first level of collation, and that those transmitted results are going to be used for the purpose of collation, and that if there are discrepancies between the electronically transmitted and manually transmitted results, that the BVAS will be called into question in terms of interrogating it to know how many people were accredited.\u201d",
          "summary": "The National Assembly is already seeking legal advice on the next steps.\n\u201cNeither the two chambers of the National Assembly nor the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was joined in a fundamental suit like this.\nTo that extent, section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act was annulled on a very faulty ground.\n*Why were the National Assembly and Independent National Electoral Commission not joined as parties to the suit?\n\u201cThe Electoral Act has just come into force and there are many issues that have been embedded in the Act.",

The party ought to have decided on zoning, before the sale of forms. Now, they want people to begin to buy forms. While the zoning committee will submit its report in two weeks. And by that time, the sale of forms would have closed.\n\n\u201cSo, what happens if the committee decides to zone the presidential ticket to a particular part of the country? Would the party refund people who are not from that part of the country, who may have bought the forms? The whole thing is just confusing.\u201d\n\nHowever, the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunabga, when contacted, told Sunday Sun that there is no cause for alarm.\n\nOlogunagba expressed optimism that the zoning committee, which may be inaugurated tomorrow, will address the issue in a manner that would be satisfactory to all the stakeholders.\n\nHe added that the PDP as a party is always guided by its rules and the constitution of the country in its activities.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done, because we are a family that discusses issues with honesty and taking into consideration the situation of the country and where we are, what we did was to set up a committee to ensure that all interests, all issues relating to zoning are discussed fully.\n\n\u201cAnd you will recall the membership of this committee is drawn from across the country, one member representing each state.

I crawled on my stomach to avoid being hit by the barrage of gunfire before scaling the fence at the back of the station and escaped.\n\n\u201cBut Ifeanyi who is also an indigene of Umuguma like me was not that lucky because he was macheted to death by the gunmen. Iyke who is from Avu community and one of the constabularies working at the station was shot while trying to escape from the gunmen and his body was found later this morning.\u201d\n\nAnother officer, who does not want to be mentioned, lamented that while the attack was going on that there was not reinforcement from the police headquarters in Owerri.\n\nHe disclosed that during the attack that the division had sent distress call to the headquarters for reinforcement, but that none came till the attackers left in their Hilux vehicles.\n\nMeanwhile, the Imo State government has condemned the razing of the home of the Ohanaeze President General, calling the perpetrators of the evil act political bandits.\n\nIn a statement he personally signed, Governor Hope Uzodimma regretted that desperate politicians who believe in violence were yet to sheathe their swords in spite of repeated appeal to them.\n\nUzodimma described the attack on the country home of Obiozor as cowardly and height of desperation.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nHe vowed that the government was already working in concert with security agencies to identify and punish the perpetrators.\n\nHe bemoaned the incessant resort to violence in settling political differences by some politicians in the state, and warned that the government would no longer condone such banditry.\n\nThe time of those who unleash this kind of mayhem in the state is over, he vowed, adding that \u201cwe shall hunt them down to face the full weight of the law\u201d.\n\nAlso, former Governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr Orji Kalu, condemned the attack on Prof Obiozor\u2019s home.\n\nDescribing the act as evil, cruel and wicked, Kalu called on appropriate authorities to investigate the ugly incident in a bid to bringing the perpetrators to book.\n\nThe former governor stressed that the statesman is a peace-loving Nigerian, who has consistently sustained his good character in view of his personal attributes and commitment to nation building.\n\nKalu faulted the attackers for what he described as uncivilized, adding that violence and social vices are detrimental to the growth and progress of the society.\n\nThe Senate Chief Whip in statement called on Ndigbo and Nigerians in general to embrace peace and unity for the sake of nation building.\n\nKalu, while urging the Ohanaeze President General to be calm, admonished security agencies to live up to expectations by exposing the perpetrators of the incident.\n\nAlso, elder statesman and legal luminary, Chief Mike Ahamba (SAN) condemned the burning down of the country home of Obiozor.\n\nHe said that the incident portends a very bad omen for Igbo land.\n\nChief Ahamba who spoke to our reporter yesterday condemned in its entirety the ugly incident, saying that Ndigbo should not allow their disagreement to be turned into unbridled hatred and quarrel.\n\nSimilarly, the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) has condemned the burning of the house of Ohanaeze Ndigbo President General by gunmen, describing it as an act of criminality against Ndigbo.\n\nMASSOB also described the action as primitive and barbaric act of criminality, adding that \u201cit is an act of sabotage and politically motivated in destruction of our own.\u201d\n\nLeader of MASSOB, Uchnna Madu while reacting to the incident expressed shock at what he called political sponsorship of the arson.\n\nHe, however, urged governors of the Southeast to take bold steps to interface and tackle the issue of insecurity.",

          "title": "Ahead of National Convention, APC Begins Screening of Aspirants Today",
          "text": "\n\n* Adamu, Akume, five other chairmanship aspirants to be screened Monday\n\n* We will provide adequate security, logistics for convention, says Lalong\n\nChuks Okocha, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Seriki Adinoyi in Jos\n\nThe ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) will today begin the screening of some aspirants for various positions in the National Working Committee (NWC), ahead of the March 26 National Convention. APC 2022 National Convention Screening Committee headed by the Kastina State Governor, Hon. Aminu Bello Masari had earlier scheduled to conduct the screening exercise in two batches yesterday and today.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY however gathered that the exercise did not start yesterday as scheduled apparently due to the late submission of forms by the aspirants. Though the party gave no reason for not commencing the exercise as scheduled, it was learnt that the aspirants were still returning their forms as of 7 p.m. last night.\n\nWith the delay in the commencement of the screening, the seven chairmanship aspirants are expected to be screened on Monday.\n\n\n\nThis is coming as the Chairman of Venue, Decoration, and Site Servicing Committee for the National Convention and Plateau State Governor, Mr. Simon Lalong has promised adequate security and logistics for the event.\n\nChairmanship aspirants who beat the deadline for the submission of nomination forms were two former governors of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, and Senator Umar Tanko Al-Makura; Mallam Saliu Mustapha; Senator Sani Mohammed Musa; former Governor of Benue State and Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs, Senator George Akume; former Governor of Zamfara State, Senator Abdulaziz Yari; and the youngest aspirant, Mr. Etsu Mohammed.\n\n\n\nYari, who is from the North-west, is the only aspirant that is not from the North-central, which is expected to produce the party\u2019s national chairmanship, according to the zoning arrangement.\n\nYari\n\nYari was a two-term Governor of Zamfara State and a one-time Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), a position that gave him a lot of influence and respect among his former colleagues and some serving governors. He has the resources and political experience.\n\n\n\nIf antecedents are anything to go by, then it would be difficult for Yari to realise his ambition. The way Yari managed the 2018 primaries before the 2019 elections caused all the APC candidates in the state to lose the elections to the PDP. Also, his inability to curtail bandits during his tenure as the governor of Zamfara State was a disaster. Today, bandits have almost crippled not only the state but the nation. The defection of the current Governor Bello Matawalle to the ruling APC is seen by political watchers as a threat to his aspirations. Matawalle is reportedly not on the same page with Yari. The zoning arrangement of APC is also not in his favour.\n\nSaliu Mustapha\n\nHe is the Turaki of Ilorin. Mallam Saliu Mustapha is the founder of Saliu Mustapha Foundation (SMF) which is involved in huge philanthropic services.\n\nA die-hard Buharist, Mustapha paid his dues in political party administration. He was once a national deputy chairman of the defunct CPC, one of the legacy parties that formed the APC. His membership of the defunct CPC gave him an edge as both ACN and ANPP blocs have had their slots; it is the turn of the CPC bloc to produce the next national chairman.\n\nHis weakness is that he lacks leadership experience as he has never held any other political appointment apart from the deputy chairman of the defunct CPC.\n\nGeorge Akume\n\nAkume was a two-term governor of Benue State, former senator, and a serving Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs. With these positions, he has acquired enough leadership experience to manage the diverse interests of the ruling party.\n\nAs a cabinet member, he can also galvanise the support of some of his colleagues to realise his ambition. He also has the intellectual and mental capacity required to battle for the national chairmanship seat. His major weak point was the loss of APC in the state to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nTanko Al-Makura\n\nAl-Makura is also a former Nasarawa State Governor. The 69-year-old businessman-turned-politician is also keen on becoming the next APC chairman. As a former governor and serving Senator, Al-Makura has the required resources, experience, and network to become the next national chairman. Al-Makura has running battles with the EFCC. Last year, he visited the EFCC headquarters a couple of times to answer questions on money laundering running into billions of naira. The former governor, however, said he was only invited by the EFCC but was never detained.\n\nAbdullahi Adamu\n\nAdamu was the pioneer Chairman of the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum and the current senator representing Nasarawa West senatorial district in the National Assembly.\n\nAdamu was governor of Nasarawa State from May 29, 1999, to May 29, 2007. He is believed to have been anointed as the consensus national chairman but the other contestants have refused to accept his nomination.\n\nAs a third-term senator and former governor, he has the enormous experience to pilot the affairs of the ruling party.\n\nAt 75, some party leaders believe Adamu is too old to be in the race, taking into cognisance the complex nature of the job.\n\nSani Mohammed Musa\n\nThe 54-year-old member of the upper chamber of the National Assembly represents Niger East senatorial district. He has a good relationship with party members. Two governors were said to have recommended him to President Muhammadu Buhari as a consensus candidate. However, he does not have the necessary experience as a party administrator.\n\nEtsu Mohammed\n\nAt just 37, Mohammed is the youngest of all the aspirants. He is an aide to Governor Abubakar Bello of Niger State and a former youth leader of the defunct ANPP. Not much is known about him politically.\n\nIyiola Omisore\n\nFor the position of the National Secretary of the party, zoned to the South-west, a former Deputy Governor of Osun State, Senator Iyiola Omisore has also submitted his nomination form. Omisore was a senator from 2003 to 2011. A former Minister for Communication, Alhaji Adebayo Shittu, and an Executive Director, Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), Mr. Ife Oyedele are also in the race but it was not clear if they had submitted their forms as of last night.\n\nAdebayo Shittu\n\nA former Minister for Communication, Alhaji Adebayo Shittu is the first person to indicate interest in the office of APC National Secretary. However, Shittu\u2019s aspiration did not garner the support of the APC governors in the South-west. That did not deter him from pursuing his aspiration, leveraging on his goodwill with Buhari\u2019s political allies.\n\nShittu, a member of the 2005 National Political Reform Conference, has been an ally of Buhari.\n\nIfe Oyedele\n\nExecutive Director, Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), Mr. Ife Oyedele, is another aspirant for the office of APC National Secretary. Before he was appointed NDPHC\u2019s executive director in charge of Engineering &Technical Services, little was known about Oyedele. Like Shittu, he has been close to the political family of the president since the time of the defunct CPC.\n\n\n\nHe was among the key persons that promoted Buhari\u2019s presidential aspiration in 2011. At its formation, Oyedele served on the CPC Constitution Drafting Committee and also represented the party during the alliance talk in 2011 and merger talks that produced the APC in 2013. He also contested the governorship election in Ondo State in 2016 and 2020.\n\n\n\nThe position of the Deputy National Chairman (North) is being contested by Mr. Sunny Monidafe, and Senator Abubakar Girei, while the National Vice Chairman (South-south) is being contested by Mr. Yekini Nabena, a former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of APC.\n\n\n\nMr. Ismaeel Ahmed and Abubakar Fakai are contesting for the post of National Organising Secretary, while Mr. Isaacs Kekemeke and Afeez Bolaji Repete, are jostling for the position of the National Vice Chairman (South-west)\n\nFor the position of the National Women Leader, Mary Eta and Hellen Effiong are in the race for the job.\n\n\n\nThe position of the Zonal Organising Secretary (South-west) is being contested by Mr. Femi Egbedeyi, while Mr. Olusegun Dada and Rinsola Abiola are in the race for the position of the National Youth Leader.\n\nThe Deputy National Youth Leader is being contested by Jamal Kabiru, while the Zonal Organising Secretary (North-West) is being contested by Salihu Uba.\n\n\n\nHalima Ibrahim is contesting for the position of the Deputy National Women Leader of the APC. This list is however not exhausting as more aspirants were still returning their forms last night.\n\nWe Will Provide Adequate Security, Logistics for Convention, Says Lalong\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman of Venue, Decoration and Site Servicing committee, and Plateau State Governor, Lalong has promised a hitch-free convention.\n\n\n\nA statement by Lalong\u2019s director of press, Simon Macham quoted the governor as saying, \u201cWe are working closely with the committees on security, protocol, and others to ensure that there is a synergy which will lead to the conduct of a hitch-free exercise.\u201d\n\n\n\nLalong had led members of the committee to Eagle Square Abuja, the venue of the proposed convention to inspect the facility and also interface with the management.\n\nHe said the Committee would have started making arrangements at the venue before now, but for the Science and Technology Expo which just ended at the same venue.\n\n\n\nLalong however said he had been meeting and engaging relevant stakeholders to ensure that the plans for the venue and associated services are put in place for the comfort of delegates and officials during the APC convention.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Northern group rallies support for CBN gov\u2019s presidency\n\nChiemelie Ezeobi, Uzoma Mba in Lagos and Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia\n\nA civil society organisation, Save Nigeria Project (SNP), has alleged that desperate politicians have approached it and other credible groups to launch a million-dollar smear campaign against President Muhammadu Buhari; his economic agenda, as well as the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr Godwin Emefiele and his monetary policies.\n\nThis is coming as the Unified Northern Nigeria Youth Forum (UNNYF) yesterday stormed Nasarawa State in continuation of its consultations with relevant stakeholders in the northern states to put pressure on Emefiele to contest for the President of Nigeria come 2023.\n\n\n\nSNP disclosed the alleged smear campaign plot yesterday at a World Press Conference on 2023 and the State of the Nation, held in Lagos, which had in attendance, representatives from Arewa Consultative Youth Movement, All Progressives Congress (APC) Young Professionals Movement, and Niger Delta Youth Vanguard.\n\n\n\nOthers include the Yoruba Council of Youths, Igbo Youth Movement, Middle Belt Youth Movement, South East Youth Assembly and Lawyers in Defence of Democracy.\n\nSNP Convener, Mr Peter Abang, said they alerted the public to disregard the smear campaigns once they kicked off.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Save Nigeria Project will also take advantage of this briefing to alert the world on the activities of desperate politicians ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cWe have been approached and we believe, many other credible groups have also been approached by some desperate politicians of questionable character with a pool of funds of up to one million Dollars to be allegedly shared by consenting groups for a massive smear campaign against the person of President Buhari, his economic agenda, the person and office of Mr Godwin Emefiele and his policies in the CBN.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have outrightly rejected the offer. Nigerians should note that once this condemnable project starts, they should disregard it and treat them with the disdain they deserve,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe said part of the plan by those behind the plot was to clone and impersonate credible groups to churn out lies and misrepresentation of facts.\n\n\n\nPassing a vote of confidence on President Buhari, SNP said the country has been on a steady march towards development since 2015, adding that more infrastructural growth has been recorded than at any other time.\n\n\u201cThe unprecedented revolution in the agricultural sector cannot be overemphasised in discussing the state of the nation today.\n\n\n\n\u201cUntil President Buhari came to power, no Nigerian had ever seen massive pyramids built with only rice paddy.\n\n\u201cNigeria was never rated as a global producer of rice before 2015 but now it is a super force in global rice production and no longer a dumping ground for spoilt unhealthy rice from Asia and other parts of the world.\n\n\u201cOn the economic front, we note that the latest figures from the National Bureau of Statistics show that inflation is going down. This shows a positive trajectory and recovery for the economy.\n\n\n\n\u201cThrough the various Social Intervention Programmes now domiciled in the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, the federal government has lifted millions out of penury and joblessness into economic productivity and prosperity.\n\n\u201cThe economy has also expanded and fortified against global shocks in record time, beating the projection of financial experts, the country has exited recession. Available data also show economic growth which is more than the projections.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is given this favourable assessment of our country\u2019s leadership and the state of the nation this first quarter of 2022 that we as a civil society organisation pass a vote of confidence on President Muhammadu Buhari, his economic agenda and the monetary policies of the Central Bank of Nigeria ably led by Mr Godwin Ifeanyichukwu Emefiele\u201d.\n\nThe group commended APC for \u201czoning power to the South in the interest of peace and inclusiveness,\u201d urging other political parties to do the same.\n\n\n\nIt said the country should have a president that would continue to consolidate and expand the vision, as well as the landmark legacy of Buhari, adding that a thorough professional of Igbo extraction should succeed the president next year.\n\n\n\nSNP also called on Buhari to support a candidate who embodies a winnable personality and ticks all the numerous boxes, adding that it should be someone he would be proud of.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is after a very rigorous search that we have come to the unequivocal and emphatic conclusion that only one man fits this description and we make bold to present to Mr President for his endorsement and to Nigerians for their massive support, Mr Godwin, Ifeanyichukwu Emefiele, the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria for President, 2023. Emefiele has shown unprecedented sagacity as Governor of the country\u2019s central bank.\n\n\n\n\u201cHis initiatives for small, medium and large scale enterprises have been unprecedented. In manufacturing, oil and gas, agriculture, trade and commerce, the signature of the CBN Governor has been very clear and precise.\n\n\u201cThe numerous interventions of the bank under high standard supervision is second to none. Rice farmers in our country have never had it so good in our entire history,\u201d the group added.\n\nNorthern Group Rallies Support for Emefiele\u2019s Presidency\n\nIn a related development, a northern group, UNNYF yesterday stormed Nasarawa State in continuation of its consultations with relevant stakeholders in the northern states to put pressure on Emefiele to contest for the President of Nigeria come 2023.\n\n\n\nAddressing stakeholders in Lafia, the Nasarawa State capital, the spokesperson of the youth group, Mr Aliyu Muhammad Sani, said the forum has been going around some states in the North for consultations with relevant stakeholders.\n\n\n\nSani explained that the youth group embarked on the consultation to produce a credible, competent, and economically-endowed leader that would consolidate on rapid economic growth that the CBN governor had already started in his current position.\n\n\n\n\u201cI stand to be corrected, but I dare boldly to say that, Mr Godwin Emefiele\u2019s achievements have reflected in all states of the country and are there for history and posterity to judge.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt never came easy; it was not done at his comfort zone, rather, it took a lot of courage, foresight, perseverance, determination, and hard work to overcome the numerous challenges scavenging on the fragile economy of our dear nation,\u201d Sani said.\n\n\n\nHe concluded that Emefiele had contained and dealt with a 60 per cent decline in the price of crude oil.\n\nIn a remark, the Nasarawa State Coordinator for UNNYF for Emefiele 2023, Mr Faruk Mohammed Ofoku, said the Lafia consultation became necessary considering the youthful inclusion of Nasarawa youth in the decision-making process in the state.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe good people of Nasarawa State benefited so much from the good stewardship of the current CBN Governor. Nasarawa is the home of solid minerals; Mr Emefiele\u2019s policies of diversification invested so much in solid mineral resources and agriculture.\n\n\n\n\u201cLooking at all these economic and life-saving interventions of the CBN Governor in Nasarawa State and all other northern states, we the progressive Northern Nigerian Youth of Nasarawa State joined the National leadership of our Coalition and strongly call on Mr Godwin Emefiele to please, as matter of urgency, declare to run for the President of Nigeria in 2023,\u201d Ofoku explained.\n\nOfoku said their call was timely because the Nasarawa youths wanted their economy, especially mining and agriculture, to be rejuvenated.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Buni, secretary at party\u2019s HQ, continue \u2018preparations along line of scheduled activities\u2019\n\nAlex Enumah in Abuja\n\nJustice Bello Kawu of a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), sitting at Kubwa, yesterday vacated an order of his court restraining the All Progressives Congress (APC), from going ahead with its planned National Convention, pending the hearing and determination of a suit against its conduct.\n\n\n\nAlso yesterday, the Chairman, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the APC, Mai Mala Buni, met with his supposedly sacked Secretary, John Akpanudoedehe, at the party\u2019s secretariat, thus dispelling the rumour that the latter had been removed.\n\nJustice Kawu vacated the order stalling APC\u2019s National Convention following an application by the party to that effect.\n\n\n\nAn aggrieved member of the APC, Salisu Umoru, had approached the court for an exparte order of injunction to temporarily restrain the defendants, which included the APC; Chairman of CECPC, Governor Mai Mala Buni; and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from conducting the planned convention slated for March 26, 2021.\n\n\n\nJustice Kawu, having found the application meritorious on November 18, 2021 granted the other.\n\nHowever, dissatisfied and desirous of working in accordance with the timetable of INEC, the APC early in March, this year, approached the court to set aside the said order so as to pave a way for the conduct of the scheduled convention.\n\n\n\nDelivering ruling in the application as moved by Shuaib Aruwan, SAN, Justice Bello Kawu, held that the Plaintiff lacked the locus to sustain the restraining order.\n\nAccording to the judge, the order of injunction issued against the APC on November 18, 2021, had been overtaken by a recent judgment the Supreme Court delivered on a similar matter.\n\n\n\nHe subsequently vacated the order and adjourned the Plaintiff\u2019s substantive suit till March 30 for hearing.\n\nJustice Kawu had on November 18, 2021, while ruling in an exparte application, halted the APC convention to enable him reach a decision in the originating summons by Honourable Salisu Umoru challenging the planned convention.\n\n\n\nIn the case with suit number FCT/HC/CV/2958/2021 and motion number FCT/HC/M/9655/21, the plaintiff prayed the court for an Order of interlocutory injunction restraining the 1st and 2nd defendants and their agents from organising, holding or conducting the National Convention of the All Progressives Congress in January and February or at any other date either before or after, pending the hearing and determination of the suit.\n\nThe Plaintiff had, among other things, prayed the court to direct the APC and its CECPC Chairman, to halt further action on the planned convention, pending the resolution of legal cases involving the party.\n\n\n\nHe equally sought an order directing Buni to begin the reconciliation process to resolve all the disputes that emanated from the local government congresses that were conducted by the party.\n\nIn granting the request last November, the judge warned that the subject matter of the case was now subjudice and must not be tampered with.\n\nAkpanudoedehe Remains Secretary\n\n\n\nBuni met with Akpanudoedehe yesterday at the party\u2019s secretariat, thus dispelling the rumour that the latter had been sacked.\n\nAides of Buni pushed out photographs from the meeting and unofficially confirmed that Akpanudoedehe had resumed as secretary and that the two men met \u201cto continue preparations along the line of scheduled activities.\u201d\n\n\n\nA source at the meeting added: \u201cContrary to reports claiming that CECPC had removed its secretary, the leadership of the party has declared that his office remains intact. In line with President Buhari\u2019s directive that things should go back to status quo, Akpanudoedehe remains the Secretary.\n\n\n\nIn an interview yesterday, Akpanudoedehe also confirmed that he remains the party\u2019s secretary, noting that President Buhari\u2019s directive that status quo ante be maintained, solidified that position.\n\nAkpanudoedehe said: \u201cOur Chairman (Buni) cannot go against the instruction of the President. In his last letter, the President has given the directive that the status quo ante should remain. The Chairman is a very brilliant man, he respects the President and will not go against that.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am the National Secretary of APC and the Constitution is very clear on that. The INEC has said for you to sack any of us, you need 21 days\u2019 notice. I want to also thank the APC for giving content to the media houses to sell their papers. We have promoted your economy in the last month.\n\n\n\n\u201cI should be celebrated for standing with the Chairman. We should celebrate loyalty, integrity. You can only celebrate good. Why would I be punished for standing with the chairman? It is a virtue. So, nothing has changed in APC. I remain the National Secretary and reconciliation efforts are ongoing. It is one party.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Buni-led APC caretaker committee has continued efforts at reconciling aggrieved members of the party ahead of the March 26 National Convention.\n\n\n\nReconciliatory efforts, it was gathered, were to ensure that the forthcoming Convention is seamless and that party stakeholders and members are united for a successful outing at the convention and at the general elections.\n\nBuni was said to have started meeting with aggrieved Chieftains of the party across board in this regard.\n\nFor months, there has been internal wrangling in the party over the National Convention.\n\nThere were allegations that Buni had perfected plans to scuttle the party\u2019s national convention in order to remain as Caretaker Chairman.\n\n\n\nBuni and John Akpanudoedehe, CECPC\u2019s Secretary, were alleged to have used a third party to obtain the court order temporarily restraining the ruling party from holding its convention until the substantive suit is heard and determined.\n\n\n\nNasir el-Rufai, Governor of Kaduna, on March 9, alleged that Buni\u2019s lawyers colluded with a petitioner to \u201cdestroy\u201d the National Convention.\n\nHe described the said court order as a \u201chidden nuclear weapon\u201d that would have hampered the party\u2019s chances in the 2023 general election.\n\nLast Thursday, Buni, who returned to Abuja, and back to his job as caretaker chair, after the failed coup to remove him, said the party was at the finishing line of its preparations for the March 26 National Convention.\n\n\n\nHe also thanked his Niger State counterpart, Abubakar Bello, for his efforts while he was away.\n\nBuni\u2019s comments came after his return from a medical trip to Dubai and meeting with President Buhari in London over the leadership crisis rocking the party.\n\nThe leaders, who met at the Yobe State Governors\u2019 Lodge in Asokoro, were flanked by members of the caretaker committee except for Akpanudoedehe.\n\n\n\nBuni stated, \u201cYou know that since I travelled, the party has not stopped. His Excellency (Bello) has done very well in managing the affairs of the party. We are here to discuss the issues going forward.\n\n\u201cWe are now at the finishing line in the preparations for our National Convention, which is at hand. We are putting heads together to achieve this task ahead. I want to emphasise that the March 26 National Convention is sacrosanct.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn Akpanudoedehe\u2019s absence from the meeting, Buni explained, \u201cYou know that this is not a formal meeting of the committee. These members of the CECPC just came to welcome me back to the country and wish me well after returning from a medical trip outside the country.\n\n\u201cSo, it is not a formal meeting that one will ask whether the secretary is here or not. However, he was in the house earlier today.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn a separate statement, Buni pledged not to reverse the decisions taken in his absence, especially with regards to the membership of the sub-committees set up to plan the convention.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the APC had released a new list of the sub-committees showing that there had been a minor shake-up.\n\nIn a statement shortly after, however, Buni said he would not be reversing the actions of Bello and asked members of the public to discountenance the new list.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n* Bianca \u2018stunned by the stench of whisky on Obiano\u2019s wife\u2019s breath\u2019\n\nBennett Oghifo in Lagos and David-Chyddy Eleke in Awka\n\nThe Obi of Awka Ancient Kingdom, Eze Uzu III of Awka, Austin Ndigwe yesterday declared that Ebelechukwu, wife of former governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano had desecrated Awka by fighting Bianca, widow of late Biafran leader, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu and that the Gods of the Kingdom must be appeased.\n\nAlso yesterday, Bianca issued a statement about the fight, alleging that Ebelechukwu was drunk when she attacked her.\n\n\n\nA fight that broke out last Thursday between the two women during the inauguration of Professor Charles Soludo as Governor resulted in Bianca slapping Ebelechukwu.\n\nEze Ndigwe also ordered Ebelechukwu to apologise to Bianca within seven days to avoid consequences.\n\nThe Obi of Awka, in his press release, said he had given Ebelechukwu seven days to publicly apologise to the entire Igbo people or face serious consequences.\n\n\n\nHe said the action of the wife of the former governor was sacrilegious, and that as the monarch of the town, he would have to appease the gods of Awka land to avoid calamities.\n\nThe monarch said: \u201cShe should also tender an unreserved apology to the new Governor of Anambra State, Professor Chukwuma Soludo for her disgraceful conduct during his inauguration. The same should go for the chief judge of the state who was conducting the swearing in when she descended.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis grave sin was committed in the land of Awka which is known for peace and unity. Therefore, as the traditional ruler of the people and chief custodian of our culture, I am under obligation to perform some sacrifices to cleanse our land of this filth and pollution and to appease the gods.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Obi of Awka said he had long spoken to Bianca who told him that what angered her was that Mrs. Obiano walked up to her and called her unprintable names, including querying her presence at the swearing in ceremony.\n\nHe added that a study of the scenario showed that Mrs. Obiano\u2019s action was deliberate, as she came very much prepared to disrupt the swearing in ceremony.\n\n\n\nNdigwe added that Mrs. Obiano\u2019s action was not only against Mrs. Ojukwu, but also against the late Ojukwu, who is the founder of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), whom his widow came to represent.\n\n\u201cIt must be pointed out that Bianca was not at that ceremony as Bianca, but as a direct representative of our late father and leader, Chief Odumegwu-Ojukwu, her late husband who pioneered APGA.\n\n\n\n\u201cTherefore, Ebele\u2019s action of casting aspersions on her is an affront on the entire Igbo people. It was indeed on Odumegwu-Ojukwu and not on Bianca as a person. This is an insult on Igbo and it must not go unpunished.\n\n\u201cIt is on record that I took Obiano and his wife, Ebere to Bianca Ojukwu where they knelt down while seeking the party\u2019s governorship ticket. Bianca endorsed Obiano and called on all APGA members, including then Governor Obi to support him. Mrs. Obiano has only seven days to apologise as demanded and directed or face serious consequences.\u201d\n\nBianca \u2018Stunned By the Stench of Whisky on Obiano\u2019s Wife\u2019s Breath\u2019\n\nBianca issued a statement yesterday, stating that all guests were seated when Ebelechukwu arrived some one-and-a-half hours later while the inauguration ceremony was on and that she didn\u2019t pay any particular attention to her.\n\n\n\nThe former Nigerian Ambassador to Spain and the Vatican continued: Surprisingly, she then walked towards me and I thought she was coming to greet me. Instead, when she got to where I was seated, she verbally attacked me with her voice raised, taunting me and asking me what I was there to do and using unprintable vile language. She asked if I had come to celebrate their last day in office. But I ignored her completely. Then, she kept aggressively putting her hands on my shoulders and shouting.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile I ignored her verbal onslaught, as advised by those sitting around me, I requested twice that she refrained from touching me with her hands. She proceeded to do so yet again and went further to grab at my head tie, which she attempted unsuccessfully to remove. This very act is considered a sacrilege to a titled matriarch such as myself in Igbo culture. It was at this point that I stood up to defend myself and gave her a dirty slap to stop her from attacking me. As she made towards me, I then pulled away her wig.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe held onto her wig with her two hands and tried to take the wig away from me.\n\n\u201cThe former APGA chairman, Chief Umeh, told her to leave me and told enraged APGA members that had gathered at the spot to lead her away, which they did and took her to the seat next to her husband Chief Willie Obiano who sat through the entire episode, completely speechless. What struck me through the whole episode was the fact that she was clearly intoxicated.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was stunned by the stench of whisky in her breath at such an early hour of the day. How could a first lady be so drunk and proceeded to turn up in that state at an Inauguration ceremony that began at 9am? It is unfortunate that she threw all caution to the wind and imported this kind of melodrama to a state ceremony.\n\n\u201cThis was highly embarrassing to the governor who left the venue almost immediately, taking her along with him. Luckily, this did not disrupt the proceedings and I stayed back to witness the ceremony to the end after which we were treated to a sumptuous reception at the Government House.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Malami Celebrates as Court Annuls Section of Electoral Act Barring Political Appointees",
          "text": "\n\n*Says federal government will immediately give effect to the judgment by gazetting it\n\nEmmanuel Ugwu-Nwogo in Umuahia and Alex Enumah in Abuja\n\nA Federal High Court in Umuahia, Abia State yesterday nullified the controversial Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 barring political appointees from contesting elections and ordered the Attorney General of the Federation \u201cto delete it forthwith,\u201d saying that it is unconstitutional, illegal, null and void.\n\n\n\nBarely few hours after the court\u2019s decision, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami issued a statement saying the federal government \u201cwill immediately give effect to the judgment by gazetting it.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had recently signed the electoral bill into law with a caveat that Section 84(12) be deleted in order to deepen democracy in the country.\n\n\n\nLast week, the Senate surprisingly threw the request of the president out.\n\nHowever, dissatisfied, the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, disclosed that the federal government would explore other means including the court to ensure the said portion of the law which he claimed offends other sections of the Constitution was expunged from the amended Act.\n\n\n\nDelivering judgment in the matter yesterday, Justice Evelyn Anyadike of the Federal High Court, Umuhia, Abia State, held that the section was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever and ought to be struck down as it cannot stand when it is in violation of the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\n\n\nThe judge, accordingly, ordered the AGF to forthwith delete Section 84(12) from the Electoral Act.\n\nMalami said his office \u201cwill, accordingly, give effect to the court\u2019s judgment in line with the dictates of the law and the spirit of the judgment.\u201d\n\nHe stated that the judgment of the Court would be recognised by the government printers in printing the Electoral Act 2022.\n\n\n\nIn a statement by his media aide, Umar Gwandu, the AGF said, \u201cThe Act will be gazetted factoring the effect of the judgment into consideration and deleting the constitutionally offensive provision accordingly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 is not part of our law and will be treated accordingly.\n\n\u201cThis is in line with the dictates of chapter 7, Part 4, Section 287 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) on enforcement of decisions that make it a point of duty and obligation on all authorities and persons to have the judgment of the Federal High Court, among others, to be enforced.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn striking down the suit marked FHC/UM/CS/26/2022, Justice Anyadike, held that Sections 66(1)(f), 107(1)(f), 137(1)(f) and 182(1)(f) of the 1999 Constitution already stipulated that appointees of government seeking to contest elections were only to resign at least 30 days to the date of the election and that any other law that mandated such appointees to resign or leave office at any time before that was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal null and void to the extent of its inconsistency to the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\n\n\nRecall that last week, a politician and legal practitioner, Nduka Edede, who is a member of Action Alliance (AA) filed a suit at the Federal High Court Umuahia seeking to nullify the Section 84(12) on the grounds that it was inconsistent with Sections 66,107,137 and 182 of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\n\nSpeaking with journalists after the court verdict, counsel to the plaintiff, Emeka Ozoani, SAN, said it had restored the rights of Nigerian citizens which vexatious subsection 12 of Section 84 of the Electoral Act sought to abridge.\n\nAccording to him, the court has now, with this judgment, created \u201ca congenial atmosphere for politicking and political space\u201d ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\n\n\nHe said there was no need again for the National Assembly to bother with amending Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act as requested by President Buhari as the Court has specifically asked the AGF to delete it since it was an illegal law ab initio.\n\n\n\nCounsel to the AGF, Chris Nevo said that the court judgment was in tandem with the position of the AGF, who has always held that it was wrong to use the Electoral Act to abridge the rights of political appointees to participate in the electoral process.\n\n\n\n\u201cOriginally, we believed that it was a big error on the part of the National Assembly to have inserted the controversial Section 84(12), adding that Nigerians should now heave a sigh of relief as the nation could now face operational issues begging for attention.\u201d\n\n\n\nFalana Punches Holes in Ruling\n\nLagos lawyer and human rights activists, Femi Falana has pointed holes in the judgement of Justice Anyadike, saying that political appointees are not included in the list of persons employed in the public service.\n\nFalana argues: With respect, the learned trial judge fell into a great error. Sections 66 (1) (f), 107(1) (f), 137 (1) (f) and 182 (1) (f) of the Constitution relied upon by his lordship require persons employed in the public service of either the federal government or state governments.\n\n\n\n\u201cSpecifically, each of the aforesaid sections provides that \u201cNo person shall be qualified for election into the Senate or House of Reps if: (f) he is a person employed in the public service of the Federation or of any State and has not resigned, withdrawn or retired from such employment 30 days before the date of election.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy virtue of section 318 of the Constitution, political appointees are not included in the list of persons employed in the public service. To that extent, section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act was annulled on a very faulty ground.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, the Judge would have dismissed the case if his attention had been drawn to the cases of Dada V. Adeyeye (2005) 6 NWLR (Pt. 920) 1 At 19 Asogwa V. Chukwu (2003) 4 NWLR (Pt. 811) 540 Ojonye V. Onu & ORS (2018) LPELR-44223) where the appellate Courts have held that political appointees or political office holders are not public servants as provided for under the Constitution.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

You should create a political wing among yourself so that it will further gear your participation in politics, it will be a good platform to support your brothers who are vying for political positions.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for us to act toward our prayers, the emergence of a good leader but we need to partake in political activities. Almighty Allah answers our prayer through our actions so while praying let us act towards it.\n\n\u201cThrough the president of the Supreme Council for Shari\u2019ah in Nigeria, I will visit all states of this nation. I can\u2019t be opportune to see all Muslims in Nigeria but through the Muslim leaders, we can make it happen.\u201d\n\nAddressing journalists, the Secretary-General of the council, Sheikh Nafiu Baba Ahmed, said the meeting was aimed at setting agenda for scholars\u2019 sermons in the month of Ramadan towards encouraging the masses to actively take part in the political process.\n\n\u201cWe can understand the reason for the disconnect between the people and the political class. The masses are reluctant to participate in the process because of the way the present administration disappointed their expectations. The political leadership promised a whole lot, they promised to reduce fuel prices, build new refineries but today, there is no fuel anywhere and the masses are suffering.\n\n\u201cHowever, despite the situation, we want the scholars to encourage people to take part in the process and they should understand the need to keep trying till Allah gives us leadership that would bring his mercy on the people. There is time to enjoy and time to suffer, but we must keep trying till we get the best out of the nation\u2019s leadership,\" he said.",

          "text": "Kayode Ajulo, a human rights lawyer, has faulted the court ruling that ordered the removal of section 84 (12) of the amended Electoral Act, 2022.\n\nAjulo stated this in a post released on Saturday on the nullification of section 84(12) of the electoral act.\n\nBACKSTORY\n\nOn February 25, President Muhammadu Buhari assented to the electoral act amendment bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe, however, asked the national assembly to delete section 84 (12) of the act, which reads: \u201cNo political appointee at any level shall be a voting delegate or be voted for at the convention or congress of any political party for the nomination of candidates for any election\u201d.\n\nOn March 9, the senate rejected the president\u2019s request to amend the clause in the electoral act.\n\nSubsequently, Abubakar Malami, attorney-general of the federation, said the federal government would consider all other options available before taking a position on the matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Friday, Evelyn Anyadike, a presiding judge at the federal high court in Umuahia, Abia state, ruled that the section was unconstitutional.\n\nAnyadike stated that sections 66(1)(f), 107(1)(f), 137(1)(f) and 182(1)(f) of the 1999 constitution already stipulated that government appointees seeking to contest elections are only to resign at least 30 days to the date of the election.\n\nReacting to the judgement, Malami said the federal government would enforce the judgement on the electoral act and remove section 84(12) from the electoral act 2022 that will be gazetted.\n\nThe nullification of section 84(12) of the electoral act elicited reactions among Nigerians, especially legal practitioners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018APC MUST AVOID A REPEAT OF ZAMFARA COURT JUDGEMENT\u2018\n\nJoining the fray of the legal debate, Ajulo warned the All Progressives Congress (APC) from organising its March 26 national convention based on an \u201cephemeral\u201d court verdict, adding that the verdict is a \u201cbooby trap\u201d.\n\nThe human rights lawyer added that it would amount to \u201cdisaster\u201d for the APC if it allowed political appointees to vote during its convention or contest primaries whenever a superior court nullifies the judgement.\n\n\u201cThe reaction of the federal government and the office of the attorney-general of the federation to the evanescent decision of the court leaves too much to be desired of the ruling All Progressives Congress,\u201d Ajulo said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to note that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), including other prominent political parties, has concluded its convention if the All Progressives Congress should rely on the ephemeral judgment of the Court and proceed to permit political appointees to vote and contest at its primaries and conventions, same is a disaster going somewhere to happen.\n\n\u201cWhat readily comes to mind is the decision of the Supreme Court in Zamfara State, where the Apex Court held that there was no validly elected candidates in the various elective positions in the state from the APC.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn lending my two cents, it is not a triumph, and neither is it a time for drunk fanfare for the All Progressive Congress. The leadership of the party must be very circumspect in preventing a repeat of what happened in Zamfara state.\u201d\n\nAjulo queried why the national assembly and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were not joined in the suit before the declaration of judgement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhy was the suit filed in faraway Umaiha, Abia State? Why were the national assembly and Independent National Electoral Commission not joined as parties to the suit?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cTo answer these thought-provoking questions, attention must be readily drawn to the fact that the National Assembly who is the authority empowered by Section 4 and 228 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) and the Independent National Electoral Commission who is empowered to regulate the conduct of election in Nigeria by virtue of Section 153 of the Constitution respectively ought to have been joined by the plaintiff as necessary parties to the action.\n\n\u201cWhile it is not the duty of a judge to force on a plaintiff the party to be sued, however, judicial authorities abound to the effect that where a judge considers that a necessary party has not been joined to the action, it can suo motu make an order for the joinder of such necessary party.\n\n\u201cWithout prejudice to the decision of the learned trial judge, we must reiterate that confidence in the judiciary must be upheld by all means and a reasonable man at all times must be able to retain his confidence in the same.\n\n\u201cWe must not allow political jiggery-pokery and desperacy to destroy the fabrics of the Nigerian Judiciary.\u201d",

          "title": "Digital Nomads: The Nigerians escaping Ukraine\u2019s war",
          "text": "Kemi\n\n\u201cAt first, we were laughing. Isn\u2019t that the Nigerian thing to do? Use humour to mask fear?\u201d\n\nWhen we speak to Kemi*, a fourth-year medical student from Nigeria, she is in an apartment in Hungary with her friends, all of whom had spent 5 days fleeing Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because, a few years ago, I was on the other side of the border.\u201d\n\nAs an international student, Kemi\u2019s journey to Europe started in 2015 when she landed in Russia to start medical school. Before Russia, she was one of the medical students at the Houdegbe North American University (HNAUB) in Benin Republic who spent years under the deceit of an unaccredited faculty.\n\n\u201cI was in my fourth year when we realised HNAUB was duping people. I was called back home and my mother had already handled the transition process to Russia.\u201d Although she had to start all over again in Russia, Kemi found the schooling environment better than what she\u2019d experienced in Benin. \u201cWe had cadavers to work on, and most of it was practical. In Benin, they just lectured us, and we never got any real experience, even when we got to higher classes.\u201d\n\nBy her third year, Kemi and other international students in Russia were told they would have to learn Russian because the remainder of their course would be taught entirely in Russian. \u201cIt was impossible,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were learning by speaking, by repeating what our lecturers said to us. To learn a new language, coupled with our course, was impossible. To make it worse, they said we couldn\u2019t transfer to another school abroad while in Russia.\u201d\n\nThe alternative given to them was to leave Russia and apply for new student visas from their home countries. Fortunately, someone was able to help them process admissions into a university in Kyiv, and that\u2019s how Kemi found herself in Ukraine in 2018.\n\n\u201cUkraine was different from Russia,\u201d Kemi says. \u201cThe schools weren\u2019t as hands-on as Russian schools were, but they were just as good. The environment also came with an added advantage: the opportunity to do business.\u201d\n\nUkraine is one of many countries where intakes with student visas aren\u2019t allowed to work formally without work permits. It\u2019s difficult to get employers to hire English-speaking students for everyday jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s not like America where you can get jobs flipping burgers at McDonald\u2019s; there are no jobs like that here,\u201d Kemi says. Students, all of whom are given temporary residence permits, can work unofficially or do small businesses by registering as private entrepreneurs.\n\nUkraine is home to 76,000 international students, and about 19,000 are of African descent. This number keeps growing by the year for a number of reasons. Life in Ukraine is quite cheap, with most students able to survive on less than $200 per month or $2,500 per year, a 300% difference from the US where most international students would require an average of $10,000 per year to live. University acceptance rates are also higher, and students find it easier to transfer from Ukraine to other western countries.\n\nAccording to Kemi, who owns a catering business, she used to make as much as $1,000 a month with a hectic schedule. It was enough for her to pay her off-campus rent, afford other necessities, and still have some change left for flexing.\n\nBut with the onset of the war, she lost everything.\n\nThey first heard the sirens at 3 AM on the 24th. When they went outside, Kemi and her friends found the streets of Kyiv full of people who were rushing in and out of department stores stocking up on supplies.\n\n\u201cWe bought whatever we could,\u201dKemi says. On the second night, they tried to stay in a bunker close to home but returned home when the bunker turned out to be chilly. \u201cOn the third morning, the tremors woke us up. Everything rattled and the whole building shook. We didn\u2019t even think twice, we packed our documents, a few other things, and left.\u201d\n\nWith her friends, Kemi went to the train station where they met hundreds of people waiting for the trains to come. Armed soldiers announced to the crowd that only women and children would be allowed in\u2014no men. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t know was that by \u2018women and children\u2019 they meant European women and children\u2019. We had to fight to get to the trains, and even when we got on, we were pushed off them.\u201d\n\nThat first day passed and Kemi and her friends couldn\u2019t get on any of the 2 trains that stopped in Kyiv. They tried to opt for road transport, but the cab drivers were charging $1,600 for trips that would normally cost $50. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford that, so we went back, and on the second day, we were finally able to get on a train leaving Kyiv.\u201d There was no space to sit or squat on the train, so they stood for 7 hours near the door, from where they were blasted with minus-0\u00b0 winds.\n\nImage source: Al Jazeera\n\n\u201cThe second train station at Lviv was no better. At least in Kyiv, we could see that the trains were full. At Lviv, there were spaces on the trains, and they only let Ukrainian women and men on. We had to fight again till we were able to get another train to Uzhhorod where we stayed for 2 nights before we left for Hungary.\u201d\n\nWhile they found Uzhhorod quiet and peaceful compared to Kyiv, their stay was cut short when Ukrainian soldiers burst into their hotel room on the second night, questioned them, and searched through their phones for photos of Ukrainian soldiers.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to stay there but it was obvious we weren\u2019t welcome,\u201d Kemi says.\n\nThey left for the Hungarian border where they were asked if they would apply for refugee status or for temporary residence permits. \u201cRefugees status means going back to Nigeria, and no one wants that. The authorities would take our passports, too, and the only pro is the free accommodation and feeding.\u201d\n\nThey opted for the 30-day residence permit instead and they\u2019ve been fending for themselves since then.\n\nAkam\n\nAkam, a Nigerian aerospace engineer living in Ukraine, was woken by bomb blasts around 5 AM and he felt his building vibrating. He looked out through the window to see what was happening and saw hundreds of people trying to escape the bombings that were occurring simultaneously.\n\nAkan recalls that he could only pack the belongings that he could carry and get to the next available shelter even though he didn\u2019t know which building could be hit next.\n\nWhen we speak with Akam, he\u2019s fled to Slovakia, leaving behind a flourishing life and career in Ukraine.\n\nDespite the difficulty he faced in moving away from the war by train\u2014a relatively safer means of transportation\u2014he was able to get to Bratislava, the capital city of Slovakia.\n\nThe train station was crowded with families trying to board a train from Kharkiv to Lviv, a Ukrainian city that is just 50 miles from the border of Poland\u2014the safest place, to be at the time\u2014as it allowed citizens to move to Poland, a NATO country; and attacks on it due to its proximity to the Polish border carries serious repercussions for Russia.\n\nSince the war started, Akam has been in constant communication via phone lines and WhatsApp with his family, but he shields them from any graphic or controversial information about the war to prevent them from being more worried than they already are. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell them that they\u2019re dropping bombs in front of you.\u201d I filter what I share with them.\u201d\n\nWhile Akam wasn\u2019t able to get to Lviv, he was fortunate enough to get a train to Uzhhorod, a city 2 kilometres away from Slovakia. But, due to the crowds on the roads, he had to walk for 30 minutes. Upon getting to Uzhhorod, it took him 12 hours to finally cross the border into Slovakia.\n\nAkam arrived in Ukraine as a student empty-handed, but with bags of dreams and heightened hopes for his future, and when he started acquiring properties in this foreign land, he felt fulfilled. Over the years, he got a good-paying job, attained job security and peace of mind that allowed him to comfortably take care of himself and support his family back in Nigeria.\n\nDigital Nomads: A Nigerian engineer\u2019s journey from Ukraine to Malaysia, and now to helping businesses scale in Thailand Digital Nomads: A Nigerian engineer\u2019s journey from Ukraine to Malaysia, and now to helping businesses scale in Thailand\n\nDevastated and filled with hurtful memories, Akam does not go into the details of how much he has lost. \u201cYou wake up one morning to find that all the things you have spent years acquiring are gone.\u201d\n\nFortune\n\nFor Fortune, Russia\u2019s invasion wasn\u2019t cause for alarm; he\u2019d had some experience with the Ukrainian crisis. In 2014, during Russia\u2019s first invasion to recover Crimea, Fortune\u2019s brother was living in Luhansk, the heart of the war in Donbas, which claimed over 13,000 lives, 3,000 civilians included.\n\n\u201cWhen my mom asked if he wanted to return home, my brother said yes,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cHe was able to buy a ticket and get on the next flight home as his city was being bombed.\u201d\n\nA year later, in 2015, Fortune packed up his bags and left Nigeria for Ukraine. Before the war, there were about 19,000 international students of African descent studying medicine in the east European country, and while some, like Kemi, think highly of Ukraine\u2019s educational system, Fortune\u2019s stethoscope hears something different.\n\n\u201cTo be fair, I haven\u2019t gone to any other universities, but the one in Ternopil isn\u2019t that great.\u201d According to Fortune, the lecturers are flaky, and if students really want to succeed, they can\u2019t depend solely on lecturers or their lectures. \u201cBut I\u2019m done now,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cI finished last year, and I was going to leave Ukraine this year. This war just speeds things up.\u201d\n\nWhile Fortune\u2019s brother was able to leave Luhansk easily, Fortune\u2019s own journey out of Ternopil took 2 weeks of careful planning and deliberation. \u201cThe situation is different from 2014. You can\u2019t get out that easily.\u201d\n\nA day after Russia\u2019s invasion, Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy instituted martial law and grounded commercial flights. The reason isn\u2019t so far-fetched. In 2014, a Russian missile shot into a commercial flight passing through Ukrainian airspace, killing 283 passengers on board. Ukraine doesn\u2019t want a repeat on its land, so people like Fortune who want to go home have to find other means.\n\n\u201cI waited,\u201d Fortune says. \u201cOn the first day, everything was a bit calm. People were running around in the streets buying provisions, and my friends, and I joined them. But when the warning sirens came the second day, and we started to feel tremors, people panicked and started to leave in droves.\u201d\n\nBut Fortune declined to join his friends when they left. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make sense at the time,\u201d he says. His patience paid off when some of his friends returned from the Polish border days after.\n\n\u201cI know people who were at the border for days, freezing their asses off trying to get out. I know some who were beaten and pushed,\u201d Fortune recalls. To him, it\u2019s not all racism though. \u201cYes, they didn\u2019t want black people to cross through first\u2014that\u2019s no surprise. But I also think there were too many people at those borders; everyone was on edge. They got the worst of it, the ones who tried to leave in that first week; they saw the worst of everything.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks after the invasion, almost all the black students had left Ternopil, and only Fortune and his friends were left. \u201cWhen we went out, people glared at us as if to say, \u2018Why are these ones still here?\u2019 That\u2019s when we knew it was time to leave.\u201d\n\nHe packed a suitcase, left most of his belongings behind, and hightailed it to the Hungarian border where French volunteers were helping African students fill out applications for refugee status and living permits.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Fortune is writing the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria (MBCN) qualifying exams in Nigeria, and then finding a way to get to the UK. \u201cBefore all this,\u201d he says. \u201cI was already applying for visas to leave Ukraine for the UK where my brother is.\u201d\n\nKemi\u2019s journey is not so certain. \u201cWe\u2019re still not sure of what\u2019s going to happen to all of us. They say we can transfer to Hungarian schools, but it\u2019s not certain yet. I\u2019d still prefer to finish in Ukraine, though.\u201d She hopes that the war will end before her 30-day permit is up so that she can return to her apartment in Ukraine where most of her belongings are.\n\nWhen we ask Akam about his next steps, no response comes.\n\n*Name has been changed to protect the owner\u2019s identity.\n\n\n\nDigital Nomads is a weekly column on TechCabal where we explore the everyday lives of Africans who leave their home countries to study or work elsewhere, and Africans who leave their conventional jobs for new professions in tech.

          "title": "Big Cabal Media raises $2.3m to expand its compelling line of digital products",
          "text": "Over decades, the news media landscape has changed dramatically. Checking for news online\u2014whether through Google, social network sites, major newspapers, or local media websites\u2014has become ubiquitous. The widespread use of smartphones also means the latest developments around the world are delivered to people instantaneously.\n\nWhile digital media has connected people in ways never before possible, enabling users to remain informed and maintain relationships across time and distance, companies in the space have attracted a paltry amount of funding. In 2021, venture capital invested $115 million in digital media globally, a tenth of the $1.1billion it funded in 2015, but not much came to Africa. Digital newsrooms in Africa are more likely to receive story grants than business funding, with a few exceptions.\n\nToday, one of such exceptions, Big Cabal Media (BCM), a leading African digital media company, has announced a $2.3 million Seed funding round, emphasising its commitment to keep building exciting and authoritative media products and brands. The new investment round saw participation from existing investors: Unicorn Capital Partners and Future Africa. New investors such as Mac Venture Capital and Luminate Capital Partners participated.\n\nPrior to this funding, with just over $600,000 raised in funding, BCM has grown to become one of the most exciting media and tech businesses in Africa. Its two major publications, TechCabal and Zikoko, reach over 30 million people monthly across platforms, with over 170,000 newsletter subscribers, and a 225% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2018 and 2021.\n\nFounded in 2013 by Bankole Oluwafemi, TechCabal started as a deliberate effort to cover the burgeoning Nigerian tech ecosystem. While the publication started out focusing just on the Nigerian startup space, it soon expanded its coverage to all of Africa. The publication covers startup fundraises, product launches, expansions, regulatory tussles, and stories of various players in the digital economy.\n\nA year after TechCabal launched Seyi Taylor joined the company as co-founder and CEO, while Oluwafemi continued in his role as Editor-in-Chief. They continued to expand TechCabal\u2019s coverage and scale up its operations. In 2016, the duo decided to try something different with the launch of Zikoko, a publication many likened to Buzzfeed at the time of its birth. Zikoko has grown from mostly publishing listicles and quizzes to sharing important stories on every aspect of Nigerians\u2019 lives, earning it \u201cNigeria\u2019s most viral publisher\u201d tagline.\n\nTwo years after the launch of Zikoko, Tomiwa Aladekomo joined the company, taking over as CEO. Aladekomo is an experienced media and marketing professional, who has worked in a range of businesses across different sectors in both North America and Africa.\n\nOver the next four years, Aladekomo focused on diversifying the company\u2019s revenue streams. BCM had derived its income mostly through native advertising, but Aladekomo oversaw the build-out of an extensive suite of advertising products across publications. The company built out a substantial events business; launched the Cabal Creative content studio, which has served multiple Fortune 500 clients ranging from Google to Coca-Cola; and launched TC Insights, a digital economy consultancy business.\n\nUnder Aladekomo\u2019s leadership, BCM has also embarked on ambitious projects like Jollof Road, an 80-day adventurous road trip across all mainland countries in West Africa; and Tech Women Lagos, a multi-sensory exhibition of 50 women in the Lagos technology ecosystem from different backgrounds.\n\n\u201cI joined BCM in 2018, brought on some really talented people, and we immediately kickstarted a period of experimentation,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cOur experiments encompassed editorial content and approaches, monetisation and even company culture.\u201d\n\nTomiwa Aladekomo, CEO of Big Cabal Media\n\nNine years after its launch, BCM which started as a tech blog has morphed into a media powerhouse. Its two publications, TechCabal and Zikoko are experts at creating content that hits the cultural nerve. They go beyond covering the scenes to creating agenda-setting editorial content, projects, and events. Cabal Creative and TC Insights are also supporting hundreds of companies within Africa.\n\nThe company also boasts of a laudable alumni network, which includes Odunayo Eweniyi, CEO and co-founder of Fintech startup Piggyvest and First Check, a female-led, female-focused, angel fund and investor community; Osarumen Osamuyi, Partner Manager at Meta; Jola Ayeye, scriptwriter and co-host of the I Said What I Said (ISWIS) podcast\u2014one of the most listened to podcasts in Africa\u2014and a host of others. An indication of its investment in its employees.\n\n\u201cFrom documented reports and experience, too, very few people who work for media organisations are offered a competitive salary and we\u2019d like to be the exception to the norm,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cThe BCM model has been tested and proven. In 2021, we quadrupled our 2020 revenue, and over the last 4 years our CAGR is 225%.\u201d\n\nWith this new funding, BCM plans to develop its product serving, staff, and audience. \u201cWe are expanding our video production by exploring docuseries and short films,\u201d Aladekomo said. \u201cWe will be transforming our studio into a community hub for creatives, and introducing 3 new tech products, including the Zikoko app and Zikoko Memes 2.0, which first launched in 2020. We will also be building out new audiences while offering competitive wages.\u201d\n\nIn the past 5 years, some notable fundraises by African digital media companies include Nigerian media company Stears Business\u2019 $600,000 seed round in 2020 and Ghana\u2019s OMG Digital $1.1m seed funding in 2017. BCM\u2019s progress over the years and recent fundraise is a noteworthy example of the possibilities and opportunities in Africa\u2019s digital media sector.\n\nOf the reported $4.3\u2013$5 billion raised by African startups in 2021 whereby fintech received 53\u201363% of the volume, digital media companies are one of many sectors that have traditionally been overlooked in the conversation of tangible ventures.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to enter this chapter with Big Cabal Media, as we fully believe in its massive potential for further success, scale and global impact,\u201d said Marlon Nichols, co-Founder and Managing General Partner at MaC Venture Capital. \u201cInvesting in Africa\u2019s booming digital media sector aligns perfectly with MaC\u2019s mission of supporting exceptional entrepreneurs building valuable technology companies that leverage shifts in cultural trends and behaviours. I have no doubt that BCM will seize this unique opportunity to continue leading conversations in culture and helping digital consumers access the information that matters most to them.\u201d\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

The streaming giant says it will begin testing ways to make users sharing an account pay for the additional members.\n\nThis means that sharing your Netflix password with someone else may soon become expensive, as account sharing will incur an additional fee.\n\nWhy? According to the company, improper account sharing outside the household has hampered Netflix\u2019s \u201cability to invest in great new TV and films for our members.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso, per the company\u2019s terms of service, an account \u201cmay not be shared with individuals outside your household.\u201d A rule that many subscribers break.\n\nConsequently, Netflix will roll out and test two new features \u2013 Add an Extra Member and Transfer Profile to a New Account \u2013 for members in Chile, Costa Rica, and Peru over the next few weeks.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nDream VC\u2019s pipeline plan\n\nBig Cabal Media\u2019s seed funding\n\nDream VC\u2019s pipeline plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNowadays, it appears that many people want to work in technology companies. However, only a small percentage are familiar with the Venture Capital (VC) industry.\n\nIn exchange for an equity stake, VCs invest in companies with high growth potential. This could include funding new ventures or assisting small businesses that want to grow but lack access to equity markets.\n\nBesides, venture capital fuels startups, but these VCs require talent. Interestingly, venture capital funding only became common in the last decade, leaving a considerable talent gap, which Dream VC was founded to fill.\n\nDream VC is an investor accelerator and community-driven educational platform that offers rigorous remote venture capital programs across Africa\u2019s startup ecosystems.\n\nThe company intends to demystify the VC space and build a pipeline for African VC talent. How?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can find out here: Inside Dream VC\u2019s plan to build a pipeline for African VC talent\n\nMovies Nigerians saw at the cinemas during the weekend of March 11 \u2013 13, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you go to see a movie at the cinemas last weekend?

Did you know that Zikoko and TechCabal are owned by the same parent company, Big Cabal Media (BCM)?\n\nI became aware of this last year, and I was impressed that the parent company is developing two fantastic products. I believe that BCM has a product for everyone because even if you\u2019re not interested in tech news, you should be interested in the content Zikoko covers because it focuses on African youth.\n\nSo, what happened? The Nigeria-based media company, BCM, announced yesterday that it had raised $2.3 million in seed funding to expand its audience and build new verticals.\n\nMaC Venture Capital led the round, and VC firms Luminate, Unicorn Group, Future Africa, and other angel investors participated.\n\nRecall that BCM previously raised $620,000 in angel and pre-seed funding between 2016 and 2020, bringing its total financing disclosed to more than $2.9 million.\n\nBCM was launched in 2013 by Seyi Taylor and Bankole Oluwafemi. And in 2018, Tomiwa Aladekomo, the company\u2019s CEO, took over from Taylor.\n\nTechCabal, a publication that covers technology news, was founded in 2014. The platform has newsletters such as The Next Wave and TC Events, an events arm that organises sought-after gatherings of operators and investors.\n\nMeanwhile, Zikoko\u2019s target audience is different. The publication, debuted in 2016, creates and curates content centred on African youth culture for Gen Zs and Millennials within and outside Africa.\n\nAccording to Aladekomo, the new fund will allow BCM to invest significantly in its technology and optimise the websites of its publications. It also intends to expand Zikoko Memes, a Giphy-like product focusing on African memes, gifs, and images that the company launched in 2020.\n\nFinally, the investment will be used to expand its audience, make new hires across the board, and solidify its position as one of Africa\u2019s most influential media and technology brands.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nAnimal vs. Plant Protein \u2014 What\u2019s the Difference?\n\nI See Dead People: Dreams and Visions of the Dying.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA few years ago, a discussion among prospective university graduates in Nigeria would have involved exchanging ideas on what companies they were applying to.\n\nTypically, this would have had them cycling between jobs in the banking sector, oil industry, and placements in hospitals for medical students. Very few would have considered a tech career.\n\nFast forward a few years, and tech is probably the first option for many job seekers. However, very few understand or are even aware of the venture capital space, but Mark Kleyner and Cindy Ai want to demystify the space with Dream VC.\n\nThe daughter of first-generation Chinese immigrants, Ai\u2019s experience in the startup space has come through roles in marketing, consulting, growth, community building, and building a business herself. Kleyner, on the other hand, has worked with startups and VCs across Africa, Europe, the United States, and South East Asia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2020, Kleyner teamed up with Ai to start MZZ Africa, providing pro-bono support services to African startups. Working with 18 startups, they helped them figure out their business models, create product and marketing strategies, and fundraise. According to Kleyner, 12 of these startups raised money from VCs in 2021.\n\nActivity picked up in the African startup space, and Andela was founded in 2014 to provide a pipeline of technical talent for startups. Other startups also sprung up to fill the need, including Decagon and Gebeya.\n\nVenture capital provides the fuel for startups to run; however, these VCs need talent. Interestingly, VC funding only became common in the past decade, and so there is a gaping talent hole, which Dream VC was launched to fill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDream VC founders Cindy Ai and Mark Kleyner.\n\nExplaining the decision to start Dream VC, Ai said, \u201cOne of the reasons why Dream VC became a focal point for me was because I was someone who could never have broken into venture capital without a sort of fellowship programme or someone reaching out and democratising access for me.\n\n\u201cNone of my family understands what VC is; I don\u2019t have high-net-worth individuals in my family or direct network, so I resonate with people who want to create impact but don\u2019t have the resources.\u201d\n\nKleyner added, \u201cDream VC is a realisation that the problems we see are not the problems that most people are solving. You might hear in the investment space that there is limited funding for African startups, that funding is going to limited ecosystems or that there is gender disparity in the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t talk about the structural reasons these things happen. For instance, most people who have the means to invest don\u2019t know how to start doing that. If you look at angel groups, most of them are using US vehicles or Singapore vehicles, so many of them are forcing rules from the US on someone that wants to invest in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBuilding a pipeline for VC talent\n\nIn June 2021, Dream VC launched its flagship programme with 30 fellows from a pool of 1,000 applicants. The fellows went through a remote programme covering various subjects, including deal sourcing, due diligence, portfolio management, and adding value to portfolio companies. There were also meetups and sessions with active VCs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe had a programme that ran for upwards of 300 hours of content and over 160 hours of direct contact between each fellow and our teams. They were taken through the venture capital space and various skills they will need in VC roles. The goal was to help them break into the VC space,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDream VC Co-founder Cindy Ai with some of the fellows.\n\nAfter the programme, some of the fellows got jobs with VCs, including Ajim Capital, LoftyInc Capital, Oui Capital, Lateral Capital, with some launching their syndicates. Having tested their hypothesis, Dream VC would be launching two programmes: the Launch into VC Program and the Investor Accelerator Program.\n\nLaunch into VC is a fully remote 13-week programme targeted at early-stage professionals looking to break into the VC space.\n\nAi revealed that \u201cthe concept of Launch into VC is similar to a lot of fellowship programmes that already exist in the US and Europe, and the reason these programmes came about was that these VCs realised that they needed to train people in the skills they needed for entry-level roles.\n\n\u201cThe reason many consider it inaccessible is that it is very network-driven, and it\u2019s one where they don\u2019t have any sort of training for when you join.\u201d\n\nFor Dream VC, the idea is to build a pipeline for local VCs who need to hire local talent. On the other hand, they provide a comprehensive resource list and network for people looking to break into VC. While it may seem that there is only a handful of VCs on the continent, Kleyner argues that many foreign VCs cannot launch African offices due to their inability to hire local talent.\n\nAdmission into the programme costs $1,000, which covers the cost of access to databases that VCs use in their jobs. However, the co-founders admit that the fee is still out of reach for most Africans and plan to subsidise it.\n\nInvestor Accelerator targets experienced professionals and entrepreneurs with at least five years of professional experience. For 20 weeks, the fellows will be taken through courses covering deal sourcing, angel investing, and fundraising, among others. Admission into the programme also requires a $5,000 fee. Scholarships are available for exceptional applicants who cannot foot the bills.\n\nWhile both programmes are intensive, fellows can combine the fellowship with their full-time roles. Ai adds that the Investor Accelerator Program is not a fund accelerator and does not connect fellows to limited partners (LPs) or help them build out a fund structure.\n\nApplications are open to both programmes, which will launch in June 2022 and will be reviewed on a rolling basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Even after improved earnings in Q4 2021, its stocks didn\u2019t perform well.\n\nHowever, when we look at players like TradeDepot and Omnibiz, we see a different story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Wasoko, previously Sokowatch, an African eCommerce platform, is also changing the eCommerce story with its $125 million Series B, one of the largest funding rounds by a non-fintech startup. The round was led by Tiger Global and Avenir Growth, with participation from VNV Global, 4DX Ventures, and JAM Fund.\n\nWith the $125 million fundraise comes an expansion beyond East Africa to West African countries \u2014 C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Senegal. The eCommerce startup also got a makeover, changing its name from Sokowatch to Wasoko, meaning people of the market.\n\nSince its launch in 2016, Wasokso has fulfilled 2.5 million orders to over 50,000 informal retailers across Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, and other African countries where it is present.\n\nThe B2B model: Like TradeDepot, Alerzo and other eCommerce startups that have raised funds from 2021, B2B is the dominant model. Wasoko delivers goods directly to retailers who sell to the final consumer.\n\nWhile B2B looks like a working model for eCommerce in Africa, most retailers are informal and unregistered. This, along with a 26% Internet penetration rate, is still crucial to the survival of eCommerce in Africa.\n\nTo tackle this problem, Wasoko has created an offline solution for its retailers through SMS. As B2B continues to be the go-to model for eCommerce in Africa, only time will tell how sustainable it is.\n\nInside gist: We had an exciting conversation about eCommerce on the Techpoint Africa podcast. Get ready for an insightful listen today.\n\n4G Capital\u2019s $18m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKenyan fintech startup, 4G Capital, has raised $18 million in a Series C round led by Lightrock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does 4G Capital do? Per TechCrunch, the startup provides credit to small businesses.\n\nFounded in 2013 by British Army veteran, Wayne Hennessy-Barrett, 4G Capital provides credit to informal businesses that do not have access to formal credit facilities.\n\nHowever, the startup wants to begin lending to bigger businesses with this new funding. It will also increase its credit limit beyond $1,000 and extend its repayment period.\n\nA touch of eCommerce: 4G Capital plans to roll out new products, including an app, later this year. It will enable their clients to sell on digital marketplaces and create access to other digital providers like delivery services.\n\nOffline mode: While 4G Capital is accessible online, it has physical branches that help it connect better with its customers.\n\nAccording to Hennessy-Barrett, \u201cI always felt it was important, particularly dealing with people who can be quite vulnerable, to have a personal interaction touch point, which is then augmented by technology.\u201d\n\nThe startup plans to build new loan products and lend to businesses in the agri-value chain.\n\nOnyeka Akumah\u2019s Farmcrowdy exit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnyeka Akumah (Founder & former CEO, Farmcrowdy\n\nOnyeka Akumah, CEO and Founder of Nigerian mobility startup, Treepz, has stepped down as the Chairman of his previous startup Farmcrowdy.\n\nAkumah founded Farmcrowdy with Akindele Phillips, Temitope Omotolani, Christopher Abiodun, and Ifeanyi Anazodo in 2016 to finance small scale farmers across Nigeria.\n\nSo why\u2019s he exiting? According to a statement by the company, Akumah\u2019s five-year tenure as Chairman had come to an end.\n\nDuring Akumah\u2019s time as CEO, the startup raised a combined $2.4 million in grants, pre-seed, and seed investments and raised $15 million for 25,000 farmers.\n\nFor a refresher on Farmcrowdy\u2019s early days with Akumah, please read this: Inside the agritech conglomerate Farmcrowdy is building\n\nIn June 2021, Akumah announced his exit as the startup\u2019s CEO to focus on Treepz, formerly Plentywaka.

The show equally acts as a reminder of the original sitcom that could compete with today\u2019s entertainment and appeals to the audience that would be interested in watching the series.\n\nWith a stellar cast of Jabari Banks who plays Will and Adrian Holmes who plays Uncle Phill, Olly Sholotan a Nigerian-American actor, and Jimmy Akingbola an award-winning Hollywood actor whose parents were British emigrants from Nigerian take the roles of Carlton and Geoffrey respectfully.\n\nGeoffrey had a change in his character from the bottler to the house manager while Carlton had gone from a nerdy preppy student who viewed his father as his biggest role model and is turned into a drug-dealing egomaniac whose only resemblance to the original character is him fitting in with the rich kids at school.\n\nBusinessDay takes a look into the life and career of Akingbola and Sholotan the Bel-Air actors with Nigerian roots.\n\nJimmy Akingbola\n\nJimmy Akingbola who plays Geoffrey on the reboot was born on April 7, 1978, in London, the United Kingdom to Nigerian parents.His parents split while he was a little boy, and his mother, who was Jimmy\u2019s primary caregiver, became severely ill when he was only two years old.\n\nAkingbola\u2019s mother was forced to place her little son in foster care because she had no family to care for him. Akingbola was raised by his white foster family in the London district of Plaistow for the rest of his childhood.\n\nAfter introducing him to the arts and encouraging him to pursue a career in acting, Akingbola later praised his foster family as \u201camazing.\u201d He went on to the Academy of Live and Recorded Arts, where he studied acting for three years before graduating with a bachelor\u2019s degree in the field.\n\nRead also: Ego Boyo: Creating magic with filmmaking\n\nFollowing graduation, Akingbola began acting in productions at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. The young actor learnt to hone his craft while becoming comfortable performing in front of a live audience on the stage.\n\nBy the mid-2000s Akingbola started branching out to television and nabbed recurring roles on the British TV shows \u201cStupid\u201d which aired on BBC from 2004-2006, \u201cThe Crouches\u201d, 2003-05, and \u201cHolbyBlue\u201d from 2007-08.\n\nAkingbola had a recurring role on the comedy series \u201cBallot Monkeys\u201d in 2015, and he continues to obtain TV gigs long into the 2010s. Akingbola, on the other hand, yearned to create a name for himself in the United States after a decade on British television. So, in early 2015, he traveled to the United States for Hollywood\u2019s pilot season with that mindset.\n\nAs luck would have it, Akingbola raked a recurring role on the superhero action series \u201cArrow.\u201d He appeared as Baron Reiter on the fourth season of the show, marking his American TV debut.\n\nThe British-Nigerian actor has won a good number of awards for works on British series like Blue/Orange, Rev, and Holby City.\n\nSome of his awards are TMA Awards Best Supporting Actor 2005, BEFFTA Awards best TV actor, and best Film actor in 2010, Nigerian Entertainment & Lifestyle Awards Best TV actor, and Movie, Video & Screen Awards Best Comedy Performance in TV both in 2012, and many others.\n\nOlly Sholotan\n\nOlamide Olly Sholotan is a Nigerian-American actor and a musician, He was born on April 5, 1998, in Atlanta, Georgia, to well educated parent Bosun Osos and Yemi Sholotan. he spent his childhood in Houston Texas\n\nHe went to Kinder High School in Texas, where he studied visual arts.

          "text": "As concern mounts over the lingering insecurity across the country, epileptic power supply, general infrastructure deficit and logistics problems as the 2023 general election approaches, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has assured Nigerians that it was on top of its game and that there was no cause for alarm.\n\nAlthough the Commission is not in denial of these obstacles, it has firmly expressed its determination to tackle them headlong.\n\nFestus Okoye, INEC National Commissioner and Chairman of Voter Education Committee, said: \u201cThe 2023 general election will come with challenges and the Commission is determined to surmount these challenges and conduct free, fair, credible and inclusive election.\n\n\u201cGrowing insecurity in several parts of the country and the increasing number of IDPs will pose the biggest challenge to the conduct of the 2023 general election. So many of the IDPs are in the houses of friends and relatives and have lost their PVCs and it is next to impossibility to recreate their polling units.\u201d\n\nOkoye assured that the Commission was doing its best to address all the challenges ahead of the election, including technology, logistics and people living with disabilities.\n\nFor the operational challenges of technology, Okoye said: \u201cThe Commission will continue to learn from issues and challenges that arise from the deployment of technology and will continue to innovate and improve on them.\n\n\u201cThe Commission will not travel backwards but will continue to improve on its technological base and innovations. The Commission will continue to work with security agencies to protect our equipment and personnel.\n\n\u201cWith the BVAS (Bimodal Voter Accreditation System) and the uploading of polling unit level results, violence has left the Collation Centres and reverted back to the polling units. The Commission will expand the base of the training of its ad-hoc staff to acquaint them more with the workings of the BVAS and other technological innovations of the Commission.\u201d\n\nGiving assurance on logistics, he said: \u201cThe Commission is designing a new template on the issue of logistics. The Commission will engage the various transport unions and the security agencies on the issue of movement of personnel and materials to the various centers on Election Day.\n\nThe Commission is determined to reverse the challenge of logistics and open the polls on time to enable Nigerians have a good voting experience.\u201d\n\nTo address the security challenges, the INEC Spokesperson said: \u201cThe Commission is addressing these issues under the auspices of the Inter Agency Consultative Committee on election security. The Commission is also addressing the huge issue of transporting a large cache of security personnel on Election Day.\n\n\u201cVisually impaired and incapacitated Voters; the Commission has through its Gender and Inclusivity Desk been relating to the various associations of persons with disability to collect data for purposes of deploying assistive materials appropriately and strategically to the polling units.\u201d\n\nOn the infrastructural deficit, he said that INEC deploys generators to its Registration Area Centres; deploys GP tanks, buckets, mats and toiletries to these places because of infrastructural deficit.\n\n\u201cSome of the schools and public places used as polling units and Registration Area Collation Centres are in a very terrible state. The Commission will supply a comprehensive list of these schools and public places to the Local and State Governments for remedial action,\u201d he said.\n\nRotimi Oyekanmi, chief press secretary to INEC chairman, who spoke with Sunday BusinessDay, said that the Commission has never relied on electricity generated by the various discos to conduct a general election.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThere is always a provision for alternatives, just in case. One alternative is a generating set. Another is a power bank.\u201d\n\nHe also explained that at the polling unit level, electricity may not be needed during the voting period from 8.30am to 2.30pm since the devices to be used for voter accreditation/authentication would have been fully charged, backed up by power banks.\n\n\u201cBut at the collation level, generating sets may be needed and there will be provision for this,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the assurances, doubt persists\n\nDespite the assurances of the Commission, there is growing apprehension among stakeholders on INEC\u2019s preparedness for the conduct of a free and fair poll next year.\n\nThey fear that multifaceted challenges which Nigeria is currently entangled in such as epileptic power supply and high level of insecurity could pose serious threat to INEC efficiency and cripple the commission\u2019s efforts to deliver a credible poll if urgent steps are not taken.\n\nIn recent decades, the commission has come under increased scrutiny and criticism over its handling of elections in the country. Apart from low turnout, elections across Nigeria have been plagued by violence, manipulation of results and inducement of eligible voters.\n\nFor instance, in its report on the conduct of the 2019 general election in Nigeria, the European Union observer team specifically described the elections as marred by severe operational and transparency shortcomings. The group bemoaned the inability of INEC to release results on time due to logistic challenges.\n\nSimilarly, the Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room equally expressed disappointment at what it described as poor showing by INEC and the various security agencies during the 2019 general elections.\n\nThe group said that despite expectations that the 2019 presidential poll would be better organised after the initial postponement, the exercise was marred by serious lapses on the part of the electoral umpire and security agents.\n\n\u201cSituation Room is, however, disappointed by the serious lapses observed with the conduct of the presidential and National Assembly elections held on Saturday 23 February 2019.\n\n\u201cDespite the elections being conducted against a background of an earlier postponement on February 16, 2019, on grounds of logistics challenges, it still suffered from major logistic lapses.\n\nAdditionally, the election was marred by violence, security lapses and instances of overreach. Other challenges include compromised INEC officials as well as partisan security operatives,\u201d Clement Nwankwo, executive director, Policy & Legal Advocacy Centre and Convener, Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room, had said.\n\nIn its review of the conduct of 2021 gubernatorial election in Anambra, election observer group, Yiaga Africa, lamented that the election was marred by delays in the deployment of materials to polling units and general logistic challenge, and called for concerted efforts to avoid a repeat of such lapses in future election.\n\nAlthough observers have expressed mixed reactions to the situation, some are of the view that these are not new threats to the effectiveness of INEC in conducting free, fair and credible elections.\n\nBut pundits say that in most cases the challenges are man-created, stating that the elite in collaboration with some elements in the electoral body always want to subvert and circumvent the process, to ensure these challenges remain.\n\n\u201cThese issues are man-made sometimes to sabotage the system. All that is important presently is for the leadership of the electoral body to fashion put ways and strategies to prevent the effect of these challenges on their entire responsibilities and the electoral process.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that, it is sad that at this level of our democratic experience, issues of power outage, logistics and insecurity continue to hinder the efficiency of INEC. It is a shame to the Nigeria political elite,\u201d Kunle Okunola, political analyst, said.\n\nMeanwhile, INEC has in the past expressed its readiness to conduct a free and fair poll next year.\n\nDavid Sentonji, Lagos State lawmaker who is the chairman of the House Committee on Information, said though the commission may have shortcomings in past elections, he was optimistic that it would improve with the new Electoral Act. He expressed confidence that the Commission would overcome electricity and security challenges plaguing the country during next year\u2019s general election.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI know we had these issues in the past, but despite that INEC has not done badly, look at the Anambra election. I think with the amendment of the Electoral Act INEC would be stronger to perform well and conduct a credible election next year. I have that optimism in me.\u201d\n\nSpeaking recently, INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu said that the Commission was committed to raising the bar of the standard set in previous elections. He said the commission had last June begun the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) in which millions of eligible voters have been registered nationwide.\n\nRead also: 2023: INEC lists multiple registration, increased IDPs as challenges\n\n\u2018It\u2019s difficult to go to bed on INEC\u2019s promises\u2019\n\nPainting a scenario of how huge these challenges are and how they can mar the success of the election if not tackled now, Chijioke Umelahi, a lawyer and former Abia State lawmaker, said: \u201cIf political thugs or government-sponsored security personnel prevail on the electorates, the polling booths will be empty, if there is peace and the electorates are ready to vote, but the machines are down, voting will be disrupted, and if the voting materials fail to reach the voting booths on time or even hijacked by thugs, the election will not hold.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Umelahi, who is aspiring to contest for the House of Representative ticket in his Ohafia/Arochukwu Federal Constituency, noted that the INEC really has huge challenges to surmount in order to deliver on the 2023 election.\n\n\u201cThe INEC always complains of paucity of funds even when double of what was used in conducting the last election is approved. No matter how prepared the INEC claims to be, the umpire always falters and the 2023 election will not be different,\u201d he disclosed.\n\n\u2018Many Nigerians are usually disenfranchised on location issues\u2019\n\nFor Sam Onikoyi, a Nigerian Diaspora and researcher based in Belgium, if you take the unimaginable rate of insecurity in the country, the INEC already has enough reason not to deliver on the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cI read about many people congratulating President Buhari for giving his ascent to the Amended Electoral Bill, which is now signed into law, but that will not work when many people will stay at home on the Election Day because of the fear of being intimidated, injured or killed for trying to exercise their civic duty. The government should by a matter of urgency address insecurity to ensure safe election in 2023; we cannot be talking about elections when bandits, kidnappers, and Boko Haram are planning otherwise,\u201d he alarmed.\n\nHenry Ibiwari-Tombo, a politician and former local government chairman in Bayelsa State, lamented that logistic has always been the major challenge in conducting successful elections in the riverine areas across the country and that the INEC has not been able to address that despite over two decades of conducting elections across the country.\n\n\u201cFrom local government chairmanship, gubernatorial, senatorial to the presidential elections, most people in the riverine areas do not vote because of the lapses by the INEC at ensuring electoral materials are available and on time. It is also regrettably that the INEC is funded well to ensure logistics needs are met, at every general election such lapses repeat, and sadly disenfranchise many from voting,\u201d the seafarer-turned politician lamented.\n\nApart from riverine areas, places with difficult terrains such as winding hills, challenging topography and inaccessible roads also hardly vote on Election Day because voting materials hardly get to them that day. The likes of Plateau, Taraba, Adamawa, Cross River states are affected, while states with high presence of bandits and Boko Haram are a risk for INEC staff and even electorates.\n\n\u201cI did my compulsory NYSC in Mambila in Taraba State, the winding roads; Plateau and long distance travel are challenges to accessing the town even on election day. INEC staff and materials cannot get there before election day because of security and compromise of the process,\u201d Merry Itam, a broadcast journalist, said.\n\n\u2018INEC must be proactive\u2019\n\nBut on the power outage, Umelahi noted that the situation will not change considering the poor investment in the power sector and heavy control by the Federal Government.\n\n\u201cThe outage of March 14, 2022 is the first time and will not be the last. The grid collapsed in February, May, July and August 2021. So, INEC should not use power outage as an excuse, it should look for alternatives because the government has always funded the elections well,\u201d Umelahi disclosed.",

          "text": "When you google \u2018top Afrobeats producers of 2021,\u2019 you\u2019ll almost certainly find \u2018P.Priime\u2019 at the top of the list or somewhere close to the peak of the listings depending on the website\u2019s author.\n\nIn a competitive and fickle industry, BusinessDay examines how a Sarz Academy graduate becomes the guy everyone wants on their team.\n\nP.Priime\u2019s early life\n\nPeace Emmanuel Oredope popularly known as P.Priime may be young but has made himself one of the most sorts after music producers in the realm of Afrobeats and with his works on top streamed songs on streaming chart listings 2021, he might as well be one of the major players in the Nigerian music industry taking Afrobeats to the world.\n\nGrowing up in a family that appreciates and immerse themselves in music, Oredope attended an Anglican church and with most of his siblings being choristers, he started playing the drums at the age of four and moved on to mastering the piano at eight years.\n\nAfter high school, while waiting to get admitted to the university, Oredope developed an interest in DJing and began experimenting with production software on his laptop, figuring he was making sounds not realizing it was the start of something big.\n\nRead also: Music meets tech at Future Insiders powered by YouTube Music, The Temple Company\n\nThe Sarz Academy\n\nAfter seeing a post on Instagram about a music production academy, by Osabuohien Osaretin, popularly known as Sarz one who Priime tells BusinessDay is like an \u2018industry Dad\u2019, he was reluctant to apply because at the time he felt there were so many producers that were more creative and would easily get picked before his mediocre\u2019 beats would be considered.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the case, as he was chosen to attend the academy for a month, which he described as a \u201cfun, informative, eye-opening\u201d activity that allowed him to connect with like-minded people who had helped him along his path.\n\nPriime described Sarz as a father figure who he looks to for help on anything related to the music industry in general when speaking with BusinessDay about his influence on his career.\n\nThe academy opened doors to connect with people like Zlatan Ibile creating beats for songs like \u2018Unripe pawpaw\u2019 and the viral \u2018Egungun Be Careful\u2019 before working on his \u2018Resan\u2019 album in 2021.\n\nCareer so far\n\nThe 20 years old over the past couple of years have put himself at the vanguard of current sounds brewing underground in Nigeria according to Pan African Music.\n\nHe has collaborated with artists such as Olamide in recent years, creating the majority of the tracks on his Carpe Diem album. Priime hailed the collaboration with Olamide, one of the biggest stars in Nigerian music, as a \u201cdream come true.\u201d\n\nP.Priime was able to send his beats to the Nigerian rapper through his manager, and the rest, as they say, is history as they collaborated on his eleventh studio album Carpe Diem in 2020, an album that surpassed 500 million streams in mid-2021 and was ranked among the top 10 albums that made commercial waves in 2021 by BusinessDay.\n\nPriime has produced songs for Teni\u2019s WONDALAND album, produced Anoti on Wizkid\u2019s Made in Lagos album, and produced the beats for one of the most popular songs of 2021, \u2018Ozumba Mbadiwe,\u2019 to which he attributes his success to the positive reception it received from fans.\n\nAsa\u2019s V album\n\nOn February 25, 2022, Asa released V, a cryptically titled album that marked a stylistic shift from her contemporary jazz genre to a more mainstream type of Afro-Pop music, an album that many critics regarded as an evident indication of a change in style, lyrics, and technical sound. Based on his prior work, this album is a testament to what P.Priime can do with an album.\n\nP. Priime told BusinessDay that working with Asa was easy as both of them bonded well as they both desired the same result which was to make good music while exploring new sounds.\n\n\u201cAsa is someone who enjoys experimenting with new sounds, and she not only allowed me the freedom to be myself, but she also showed me a path I didn\u2019t think I could take,\u201d\n\nHe claims that the vocalist elevates the music to a new level, bringing out the best in each other while having fun composing beats and creating a terrific record.\n\nBusiness of Music Production\n\nThe Nigerian music industry only recently started putting a closer look on the welfare of producers who have long been afflicted with The lack of proper credit, royalties, and poor compensation\n\nIn an interview, Sarz revealed that he founded the academy not only for music but also for producers to gain a holistic view of the business of the industry.\n\nRead also: Olamide, Motha on Glo-sponsored African Voices on CNN\n\n\u201cThe Academy isn\u2019t really just about music production, we also deal with the music business and the legal aspects as well, so any producer that comes out of the Academy is well rounded and you have like an attorney assigned to you moving forward so you don\u2019t sign slave contracts and anything you don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Osaretin.\n\nWhile there is a defined reward system for producers and songwriters in other places like the US and UK, this has not been the case for most Nigerian music producers. They may need to hire a manager or lawyer who is familiar with the music industry to keep an eye on the method by which they are compensated after collaborating with artists.\n\nP.Priime also told BusinessDay that his manager is in charge of all of his enterprises, which he trusts to get him adequately compensated in terms of streaming revenue, intellectual property, project collaborations, brand development, and marketing.\n\n\u201cI leave the business side of what I do to my manager; mine is to make sure the music is intact for the fans to enjoy, while hers is to make sure I\u2019m paid correctly in the business aspect and I\u2019m properly credited; I\u2019m not sure how she does it, but she does a great job of making sure I am well compensated and properly credited,\u201d said Oredope\n\nWhen asked about building a business around music production and how producers can get sponsorships compared to musicians, Oredope told BuisnessDay that artists and producers see each other as equals and should get the same recognition and opportunities to deals.\n\n\u201cI do not see myself as a music producer, I see myself as a musician, the same way an artist sees himself as a brand. I and the artists I\u2019ve worked with see ourselves as equals, we are all superstars,\u201d\n\nHe also pointed out that some producers are getting the same deals as some top artists and sometimes more.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not just a music producer; it\u2019s not like one person is better than the other. Whatever deals musicians get, you can bet I\u2019m getting double.\u201d\n\nFrom Sarz Academy to Zlatan, Olamide, Wizkid, Teni, Wizkid, Reekado Banks, ending the year with Portable\u2019s \u2018Zazoo Zehh\u2019 and Asa\u2019s \u2018V\u2019, P.Priime has made himself a brand everyone wants to work with, as we expect more sounds in 2022.\n\n\u201cMy favourite body of work at the moment has to be Asa\u2019s album, it\u2019s on a whole new level. Expect surprises from P.Priime in 2022,\u201d P. Priime said.",

The objective of the exercise is to capture all into the Edo State Master Plan as it\u2019s necessary for development.\n\n\u201cFrom now till 31st of March, those that will approach us and apply for their building approval will not be charged but after then, charges will apply. I appeal to all to take this window of opportunity.\n\n\u201cThe benefits of having your plans are huge as your property is recorded and identified as a legal property on Edo soil and the conveyance letter which is like a legal document is issued to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnsure your building is captured at this time as the Ministry is very cooperative and the exercise will continue every Thursday, Friday and Saturday,\u201d the commissioner added.\n\nOn his part, The Commissioner for Agriculture and Food Security, Stephen Idehenre said the state will flag off its farming season on Thursday, March 25, 2022.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe State Government will be flagging off the farming season on Thursday, 25th of March 2022. This year\u2019s farming season should be taken seriously as there will be an interface between farmers and off-takers. The government will provide motorbikes for extension workers to get feedback from extension officers.\u201d\n\nIdehenre further disclosed that since the outbreak of the Lassa fever in Edo, the state has recorded 160 cases and 20 deaths, representing a 13 percent death rate in the state.\n\n\u201cThe disease is a pandemic that is still ravaging some communities across local government areas in Edo State.

You should create a political wing among yourself so that it will further gear your participation in politics, it will be a good platform to support your brothers who are vying for political positions.\n\n\u201cThere is a need for us to act toward our prayers, the emergence of a good leader but we need to partake in political activities. Almighty Allah answers our prayer through our actions so while praying let us act towards it.\n\n\u201cTinubu disclosed that he would visit the council across the state to solicit support to make his presidential ambtion a reality.\n\n\u201cThrough the president of the Supreme Council for Shari\u2019ah in Nigeria, I will visit all states of this nation. I can\u2019t be opportune to see all Muslims in Nigeria but through the Muslim leaders, we can make it happen.\u201d\n\nAddressing journalists, the Secretary General of the council, Sheikh Nafiu Baba Ahmed, said the meeting was aimed at setting agenda for scholars\u2019 sermon in the month of Ramadan towards encouraging the masses to actively take part in the political process.\n\n\u201cWe can understand the reason for the disconnect between the people and the political class. The masses are reluctant to participate in the process because of the way the present administration disappointed their expectations. The political leadership promised a whole lot, the promised to reduce fuel price, build new refineries buy today, there is no fuel anywhere and the masses are suffering.\n\n\u201cHowever, despite the situation, we want the scholars to encourage people to take part in the process and they should understand the need to keep trying till Allah gives us a leadership that would bring his mercy on the people. There is time to enjoy and time to suffer, but we must keep trying till we get the best out of the nation\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cThe aim this year is to make everyone to retrospect and bring about change from within so the society can change and expect God\u2019s grace\u201d, he said.\n\nEarlier in his remark, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola said his action in government has always been tailored towards being a good ambassador of Islam, especially being the only Muslim Governor in the southern part of the country.\n\nHe also called Muslim adherents to use the period of Ramadan to pray for the country to surmount its various challenges.",

However, I want you to always know that our God is able and merciful.

He was an outstanding journalist who made his mark in the profession,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBeyond journalism, Emeka also made his mark in public issues management. The Public Policy Research and Analysis Center (PPRAC), organizers of the annual Zik Prize in Leadership Awards, which he founded and managed very successfully over the years, remains one of the most credible platforms that has promoted leadership, patriotism and good governance in Nigeria. Emeka would be sorely missed for his invaluable contributions to the development of our dear country.\n\n\u201cI pray that the good Lord will grant his soul eternal rest in His bosom. May the Lord keep, uphold and comfort you, his dear wife, children, and the rest of the family. Amen.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU! You need to login to view and post FB Comments!",

          "text": "A pro-democracy group on the aegis of Support Group Atiku U.S.A, has asked former Vice President Atiku Abubakar to formally declare his presidential ambition in order to save Nigerian democracy and unity from further threats.\n\nIn a letter dated March 17, 2022, copy of which was sent to journalists Saturday in Abuja, and jointly signed by the chairman of the organisation, Timothy. A. Sule and director PR, Prince Anozie Ugenyi, among others, said Atiku has the most impressive and formidable credentials than anyone else seeking to take over from incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.\n\nThe statement said Atiku has an excellent track record of assembling a brilliant team of the best and brightest to generate ideas for how to move Nigeria forward, adding that \u201cthe presidency is a serious business that requires the experience and competence of a man like Atiku Abubakar.\n\n\u201cWe are supporting Atiku Abubakar because of his formidable track record as a former Vice President of Nigeria with more name recognition and national appeal than his political rivals.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cSuffice to say that we cannot afford to be indifferent to the affairs in Nigeria because our future cannot be isolated from the future of our country. We are worried about the heavy debts, especially Chinese loans that are hanging on Nigeria\u2019s neck like an albatross.\u201d\n\nWhile lamenting the alleged mismanagement of the country by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the statement said: \u201cIt is regrettable that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) administration has reversed the country\u2019s economic and political progress with policies that are crippling the country and making life more miserable for Nigerians, in addition to discouraging foreign investors.\n\n\u201cSince the coming of APC into power, things are getting rapidly worse day after day because the government has run out of ideas of how to grow the economy and attract foreign investors and much-needed jobs.\n\n\u201cSadly, on a daily basis hundreds of Nigerian professionals, including medical doctors, leave the country out of despair and not because they don\u2019t love their own country.\n\n\u201cWe in the Diaspora are watching with consternation how the country is going to the dogs as the economy plummets and unemployment and insecurity get worse. In fact even access to basic food products is almost impossible for the majority of Nigerians. If the happiness of the greatest number of the citizens is the purpose of the government, then can we say in all sincerity that this government has met the aspirations of Nigerians?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt is befuddling that waiting for good luck seems to be the mindset of the APC administration. But this cannot be a strategy. This mindset stems from the fact that this administration was not adequately prepared for the task of governance from the beginning.\n\n\u201cEven if we are not going to participate in the election following the failure of the constitution amendment that would have granted Diaspora Nigerians voting rights, we are stakeholders in the affairs of Nigeria because we want to see our country ranked among the best performing democracies in the developing world.\u201d",

          "text": "South-West governors in the All Progressives Congress (APC) and a former Lagos State governor, Senator Bola Tinubu are in a last-meeting rapprochement ahead of the national convention of the party fixed for Saturday, Sunday Tribune can authoritatively reveal.\n\nThe move, according to party sources, is to downplay the intrigues and power play among them which could deny them the prized slot of national secretary zoned to the zone. Investigation revealed that among the APC governors in the region, only two enjoy a warm relationship with the former Lagos State governor and presidential aspirant.\n\nSources told Sunday Tribune that the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) and by extension the Presidency is smarting to ensure that an anointed candidate of the power bloc emerges as the candidate for the office. The sources mentioned the Executive Director, Niger Delta Power Holding, Ife Oyedele, as the choice of the defunct CPC.\n\nOther contenders for the office are Senator Iyiola Omisore, former Minister of Communications and governorship candidate of the defunct CPC in Oyo State, Bayo Shittu and Professor Abideen Olaitan Olaiya. While Omisore is from Osun State, the duo of Bayo Shittu and Professor Olaiya are from Oyo State.\n\nOyedele is from Okitipupa in Ondo South Senatorial district and shares the same defunct CPC platform with Shittu.\n\nSources revealed that between Shittu and Oyedele, the CPC tendency in the APC has since settled for the latter. Oyedele\u2019s supporters see his endorsement as a reward, a pay-back period for his loyalty and support for President Muhammadu Buhari in his uncertain days of relentless pursuit for the presidency.\n\nThe aspirant was a member of the Board of Trustees of the CPC and Ondo State Coordinator of the Buhari Campaign Organisation when he emerged in 2014 as APC presidential candidate.\n\nThe former Ondo State governorship aspirant was the Head of Media and Publicity Committee of Buhari Campaign Council in the state in the run-up to the 2019 presidential election.\n\nThe South-West governors have since been informed of plot to ensure that Oyedele makes the Unity List of consensus candidates to be ratified at Eagle Square, venue of the convention.\n\nS/W governors\u2019 last minute move to stop Oyedele\n\nThe South-West governors are in frantic move to stop Oyedele, believed to have since enjoyed the blessings of northern governors for the position of the party\u2019s national secretary.\n\nThey have endorsed former chairman of the APC in Ondo State, Isaac Kekemeke for the office of national vice chairman, South-West and have agreed to defer to Tinubu\u2019s favoured candidate, Senator Omisore as consensus candidate for national secretary in order to stop the former CPC stalwart from clinching the strategic position. APC chieftains in the South-West are apprehensive of a situation in which President Buhari will produce both the national chairman and national secretary of the party ahead the presidential convention.\n\nInvestigation revealed that another strategic position, the national organising secretary, has been zoned to the North-West, the zone of President Buhari. Meanwhile, former Zamfara State governor, Abdulazeez Yari, at the weekend, insisted that he would run for the office of national chairman of the party.\n\nChecks revealed that by virtue of the zoning arrangement produced by the zoning committee led by the Kwara State governor, Abdulrahman AbdulRazak, Yari is precluded from the contest since he is from the North-West.\n\nThe exalted office has been zoned to the NorthCentral states of Kwara, Kogi, Benue, Plateau, Nasarawa and Niger states. Speaking with newsmen, Director General of Yari Campaign Organisation, Tijani Kaura, claimed the position was zoned to the North and not any particular zone in the region.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet me say again that we are all aware that the party has zoned national chairmanship to the North and presidency to the South. But we are not aware that there is specific zoning within the geopolitical zones of either the president or the national chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cNobody indicated whether it is South-West, SouthEast or South-South. The party acting chairman has not come out officially to tell us the chairmanship has been zoned to a particular geopolitical zone. So, that is why we are here.\u201d",

          "text": "Super Eagles star Victor Osimhen became the fourth African to score a double-figure in two consecutive Serie A seasons after his brace helped Napoli to a vital 2-1 victory against Udinese at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.\n\nNapoli continued their title challenge when they welcomed Udinese in Naples. The I Bianconeri have been a banana peel for the big boys in the Serie A, claiming victories against Juventus and securing draws against Roma and Lazio this season.\n\nNapoli started the game on top, seeing more of the ball, and trying to break down the Udinese defence. However, the I Bianconeri broke the deadlock against the run of play in the 22nd minute via Gerard Deulofeu, who struck a wicked finish past Ospina.\n\nAfter conceding, the Partenopei added some urgency to their play, but could not rattle the Udinese defence even with seven goal attempts.\n\nNapoli entered the second half like a house on fire. And just seven minutes after the restart, Osimhen came in handy for Luciano Spalletti\u2019s team. The Nigerian talisman climbed high to head in a cross from Mario Rui into the net to restore parity.\n\nEleven minutes later, Osimhen scored his eleventh Serie A goal of the season after latching on to a pass from Giovanni Di Lorenzo to make it 2-1 for Napoli.\n\nOsimhen\u2019s two goals put him among African greats including Samuel Etoo, Mohamed Salah, and George Weah, who have scored 10+ goals in two consecutive Serie A seasons.\n\nNapoli held out for the remaining 27 minutes to ensure a 2-1 victory, and were further aided after Pablo Mari was sent off in the 83rd minute.\n\nNapoli are now second, level on points with AC Milan, but have played a game more.\n\nOsimhen will not be able to add to his tally in Napoli\u2019s next league game, though, after picking up a fifth yellow card of the campaign.\n\nHowever, his attention will now turn to Nigeria\u2019s 2022 World Cup playoff tie against Ghana, having missed the Africa Cup of Nations campaign.",
          "summary": "Super Eagles star Victor Osimhen became the fourth African to score a double-figure in two consecutive Serie A seasons after his brace helped Napoli to a vital 2-1 victory against Udinese at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.\nNapoli started the game on top, seeing more of the ball, and trying to break down the Udinese defence.\nAnd just seven minutes after the restart, Osimhen came in handy for Luciano Spalletti\u2019s team.\nEleven minutes later, Osimhen scored his eleventh Serie A goal of the season after latching on to a pass from Giovanni Di Lorenzo to make it 2-1 for Napoli.\nNapoli held out for the remaining 27 minutes to ensure a 2-1 victory, and were further aided after Pablo Mari was sent off in the 83rd minute.",

We have worked with many leaders and assessed many across the length and breadth of Nigeria. Governor Yahaya Bello stands out.\n\n\u201cAll the lies they have peddled against him in the past have turned to strength for him and for us Nigerian youths. No retreat, no surrender, until we accomplish our aim, which is God\u2019s will by His grace,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chief of Staff to the Kogi State Governor, Abdulkareem Jamiu Asuku, who led other invited government officials to the rally, assured the youths that his principal would surely heed their call and address them very soon.\n\n\u201cYou have been consistent in your call for His Excellency, Alhaji Yahaya Bello to contest for President come 2023. He has heard you clearly and will not disappoint you. He has demonstrated in Kogi that it is Youths O Clock, and it is paying off with all the giant strides. We will repeat the same feat for Nigeria by the grace of God,\u201d Asuku said.\n\nHe, however, warned the youths against engaging in political thuggery that could smear the good image and integrity of his principal,\n\n\u201cOur President come 2023 insha Allah hates violence and thuggery, you should therefore abhor such acts,\u201d he said.\n\nHe appealed to all the supporters across political parties who had yet to get their voter cards to do so immediately, saying, \u201cThat is the only weapon we need to vote for Yahaya Bello as presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\u201d",

The liquid was discovered upon search of his two luggages stuffed with six smaller bags containing 32-makeup mascara, which tested positive to cocaine.\u201d\n\nAnayochukwu, according to Babafemi, claimed he was a businessman dealing in children wares before delving into the illicit drug business, and confessed he met the person who gave him the consignment to deliver in Nigeria for a fee of N2 million at a drinking joint in Brazil.\n\nBabafemi said in other operations across the country, different quantities of various drugs were recovered from suspects.\n\nHe said at least three persons: Tony Samson, Paul Adamu, and Reuben Waziri were arrested in Kaduna on Friday 18th March with 18,380 tablets of Tramadol, and 12,500 tablets of Diazepam and Exol-5 tablets.\n\nIn Anambra, NDLEA operatives on last Thursday intercepted a bus with registration number: AGU 460 ZW, at Obosi bridge heading to Aba, Abia state from Onitsha, and upon search, seven and half jumbo sacks of cannabis weighing 362 kilogrammes were recovered while the driver, Ifeanyi Anyamele admitted to be the owner of the drug exhibits.\n\nThe previous day, last Wednesday, narcotic officers in Ogun state recovered 865.2 kilogrammes of cannabis sativa around Otapele- Obada road in Imeko-Afon local government area. The consignment was brought in from Benin Republic on motorbikes for onward transportation to Lagos and Abeokuta. Same day, operatives in the state arrested Bello Ibrahim, 38, with 312.4 kilogrammes of cannabis sativa at Ogere tollgate, Ikenne local government area.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chairman/Chief Executive of NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (Retd)\n\nwhile commending officers and men of the NAIA, Kaduna, Anambra and Ogun state Commands of the agency for their vigilance and diligence, charged them and their counterparts across the country to always remain steps ahead of the tricks of drug traffickers and the barons.\n\nMichael Olugbode in Abuja",

          "title": "Ukraine Says Russia Bombs Another Shelter in Besieged Mariupol",
          "text": "Ukrainian authorities said Sunday that Russia\u2019s military bombed an art school sheltering some 400 people in the embattled port city of Mariupol, where Ukraine\u2019s president said an unrelenting Russian siege would be remembered for centuries to come.\n\nIt was the second time in less than a week that city officials reported a public building where residents had taken shelter coming under attack. A bomb hit a Mariupol theater with more than 1,300 believed to be inside on Wednesday, local officials said.\n\nThere was no immediate word on casualties from the reported strike on the art school, which The Associated Press could not independently verify. Ukrainian officials have not given an update on the search of the theater since Friday, when they said at least 130 had been rescued.\n\nMariupol, a strategic port on the Azov Sea, has been under bombardment for at least three weeks and has seen some of the worst horrors of the war in Ukraine. At least 2,300 people have died, some of whom had to be buried in mass graves, and food, water and electricity have run low.\n\n\u201cTo do this to a peaceful city, what the occupiers did, is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation. \u201cThe more Russia uses terror against Ukraine, the worse the consequences for it.\u201d\n\nIn recent days, Russian forces have battled their way into the city, cutting it off from the Azov Sea and devastating a massive steel plant. The fall of Mariupol would be an important but costly victory for the Russians, whose advance is largely stalled outside other major cities more than three weeks into the biggest land invasion in Europesince World War II.\n\nIn major cities across Ukraine, hundreds of men, women and children have been killed in Russian bombardments, while millions of civilians have raced to underground shelters or fled the country.\n\nIn the capital, Kyiv, at least 20 babies carried by Ukrainian surrogate mothers are stuck in a makeshift bomb shelter, waiting for parents to travel into the war zone to pick them up. The infants \u2014 some just days old \u2014 are being cared for by nurses who cannot leave the shelter because of constant shelling by Russian troops who are trying to encircle the city.\n\nIn the hard-hit northeastern city of Sumy, authorities evacuated 71 orphaned babies through a humanitarian corridor, regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytskyy said Sunday. He said the orphans, most of whom need constant medical attention, would be taken to an unspecified foreign country.\n\nRussian shelling killed at least five civilians, including a 9-year-old boy, in Kharkiv, an eastern city that is Ukraine\u2019s second-largest.\n\nThe British Defense Ministry said Russia\u2019s failure to gain control of the skies over Ukraine \u201chas significantly blunted their operational progress,\u201d forcing them to rely on stand-off weapons launched from the relative safety of Russian airspace.\n\nA rocket attack on the Black Sea port city of Mykolaiv early Friday killed as many as 40 marines, a Ukrainian military official told The New York Times, making it one of the deadliest single attacks on Ukrainian forces.\n\nIn a separate strike, the Russian Defense Ministry said a Kinzhal hypersonic missile hit a Ukrainian fuel depot in Kostiantynivka, a city near Mykolaiv. The Russian military said Saturday that it used a Kinzhal for the first time in combat to destroy an ammunition depot in the Carpathian Mountains in western Ukraine.\n\nRussia has said the Kinzhal, carried by MiG-31 fighter jets, has a range of up to 2,000 kilometers (about 1,250 miles) and flies at 10 times the speed of sound. Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Saturday that the U.S. couldn\u2019t confirm the use of a hypersonic missile in Ukraine.\n\nKonashenkov said Kalibr cruise missiles launched by Russian warships from the Caspian Sea were also involved in the strike on the fuel depot in Kostiantynivka and were used to destroy an armor repair plant in northern Ukraine.\n\nUnexpectedly strong Ukrainian resistance has dashed Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s hopes for a fast victory after he ordered his troops to invade Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nWhile the Kremlin has said Russia is conducting a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d aimed at legitimate targets, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Saturday that \u201cbrutal, savage techniques\u201d targeting civilians had allowed Moscow\u2019s troops to advance.\n\nU.N. bodies have confirmed more than 847 civilian deaths since the war began, though they concede the actual toll is likely much higher. The U.N. says nearly 3.4 million people have fled Ukraine as refugees.\n\nEstimates of Russian deaths vary widely, but even conservative figuresare in the low thousands. The reported battlefield deaths of four Russian generals \u2014 out of an estimated 20 deployed in Ukraine, suggest an impaired command of the fighting, said Dmitry Gorenburg, a researcher on Russia\u2019s security at the Virginia-based CNA think tank. Gorenburg said.\n\nRussia would need 800,000 troops \u2014 almost equal to its entire active-duty military \u2014 to control Ukraine in the face of prolonged armed opposition, according to Michael Clarke, former head of the British-based Royal United Services Institute, a defense think tank.\n\n\u201cUnless the Russians intend to be completely genocidal \u2014 they could flatten all the major cities, and Ukrainians will rise up against Russian occupation \u2014 there will be just constant guerrilla war,\u201d Clarke said.\n\nUkraine and Russia have held several rounds of negotiations aimed at ending the conflict, but the neighboring countries remain divided over several issues. Zelenskyy has said he is willing to drop Ukraine\u2019s bid to join NATO but wants certain security guarantees from Russia. Moscow is pressing for Ukraine\u2019s complete demilitarization.\n\nEvacuations from Mariupol and other besieged cities proceeded along eight of 10 humanitarian corridors that Ukraine and Russia agreed to on Saturday, Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said, and officials said a total of 6,623 people left Kyiv and other cities.\n\nVereshchuk said planned humanitarian aid for the southern city of Kherson, which Russia seized early in the war, could not be delivered because the trucks were stopped along the way by Russian troops.\n\nMariupol authorities said Sunday that nearly 40,000 people had left the city in the last week, the vast majority in their own vehicles, despite ongoing air and artillery strikes.\n\nThe Mariupol city council claimed Saturday that Russian soldiers had forcibly relocated several thousand city residents, mostly women and children, to Russia. It didn\u2019t say where, and AP could not immediately confirm the claim.\n\nSome Russians also have fled their country amid a widespread crackdown on dissent. Since the invasion of Ukraine started, police have arrested thousands of antiwar protesters, while government agencies have silenced independent media and cut off access to social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.\n\nIn Ukraine, Zelenskyy on Sunday ordered the activities of 11 political parties with links to Russia to be suspended during the period of martial law. The largest of those parties has 44 out of 450 seats in the country\u2019s parliament.\n\n\u201cActivities by politicians aimed at discord and collaboration will not succeed,\u201d he said in the address.",

          "text": "Two Senior Advocates of Nigeria (SANs), Mr. Femi Falana and Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, have faulted the decision of a Federal High Court sitting in Umuahia, the Abia State capital, ordering the deletion of Section 84 (12) of the amended Electoral Act.\n\nIn separate statements issued Saturday, the senior lawyers raised pertinent questions about the judgment, noting that the decision of the court was a great error.\n\nThe presiding judge, Justice Evelyn Anyadike had on Friday held that the section was unconstitutional, invalid, illegal, null, void and of no effect whatsoever and cannot stand, as it is in violation of the clear provisions of the Constitution.\n\nAnyadike had, consequently, ordered the Attorney General of the Federation, Mr. Abubakar Malami to immediately delete Section 84 (12) of the amended Electoral Act.\n\nResponding to the decision of the court on Saturday, Falana argued that the learned trial judge fell into a great error.\n\nFalana, a former President of West African Bar Association (WABA), pointed out that sections 66 (1) (f), 107(1) (f),137 (1) (f) and 182 (1) (f) of the Constitution relied upon by his lordship required persons employed in the public service of either the federal government or state governments.\n\nSpecifically, the senior advocate said: \u201cEach of the aforesaid sections provides that no person shall be qualified for election into the Senate or House of Reps if: (f) he is a person employed in the public service of the Federation or of any State and has not resigned, withdrawn or retired from such employment 30 days before the date of election.\u201d\n\nFalana argued that by virtue of Section 318 of the 1999 Constitution, political appointees \u201care not included in the list of persons employed in the public service. To that extent, Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act was annulled on a very faulty ground.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, the judge would have dismissed the case if his attention had been drawn to the cases of Dada v. Adeyeye (2005) 6 NWLR (Pt. 920) 1 at 19 ASOGWA v. Chukwu (2003) 4 NWLR (Pt. 811) 540 Ojonye V. Onu & ORS (2018) LPELR-44223) where the appellate courts have held that political appointees or political office holders are not public servants as provided for under the Constitution,\u201d Falana said.\n\nSupporting Falana\u2019s position, Adegboruwa argued that the Electoral Act \u201cis an Act of the National Assembly. How can you nullify an Act without joining the institution that made the Act, so that they can be heard concerning what they did?\n\n\u201cWhen a defendant (federal government) rejoices over a judgment delivered against it as a party, then you know there is a problem in\n\nNigeria. Let the National Assembly, the political parties and NGOs appeal against the judgment as interested parties,\u201d Adegboruwa said.\n\nHe rhetorically asked: \u201cWhy do you want to hold on to your office as a political appointee and at the same time be a candidate in an election? May Nigeria not happen to us in this way?\u201d\n\nGboyega Akinsanmi",

          "title": "Following Nationwide Outages, Nigeria Plans to Ramp up 2,150MW of Electricity",
          "text": "Following last week\u2019s collapse of the power grid twice within 24 hours, Nigeria\u2019s federal government said on Saturday that it had begun the restoration of a number of the country\u2019s power assets to recover 2,150 megawatts of electricity.\n\nThe Minister of Power, Mr. Abubakar Aliyu, in a statement he signed, stated that while the Okpai Power Plant had resumed electricity generation, contributing an average of 300 megawatts, other plants were being fixed to ameliorate to address the nationwide blackout.\n\nNigeria\u2019s national power grid experienced another downtime on Tuesday, barely 24 hours after it witnessed a similar system collapse, throwing the nation into darkness.\n\nThe grid generation dropped massively from 3,000 megawatts earlier to 1,758 megawatts, leaving just 12 Generation Companies (Gencos) in operation, according to the hourly data supplied by the System Operations (SO), an arm of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN).\n\nThe national power grid had earlier collapsed on Monday, causing a nationwide outage after the loss of 1,100 megawatts from a 3,700MW peak generation earlier recorded.\n\nFollowing the incident, Aliyu had summoned an emergency meeting to resolve all the outstanding issues with the stakeholders in the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) as a result of the worsening power supply situation.\n\nThe Gencos under the Association of Power Generation Companies (APGC) had stated that the power supply situation in the country worsened because the generation companies were being owed over N1.6 trillion since 2013.\n\nAPGC\u2019s Executive Secretary, Dr. Joy Ogaji, said the power generators were owed N1.644 trillion, adding that they had exhausted their borrowing capacities as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had allegedly asked Nigerian financial institutions to desist from lending money to them.\n\nHowever, in an update, Aliyu stated that the federal government had taken several initiatives to recover considerable megawatts of power lost in the last few weeks as a result of a dip in water levels at the hydropower plants, vandalism, simultaneous plant maintenance, among others.\n\nAliyu pointed out that the update had become necessary following the emergency meeting convened by him on March 14, 2022, towards the restoration of the normal supply of electricity nationwide.\n\nAccording to him, during the meeting, a framework for sustainable improvement of supply was developed.\n\nThe minister expressed pleasure that some challenges in the sector were being addressed.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian public may please recall that the national grid lost about 1,100MW generation capacity as a consequence of simultaneous disruptions in gas supply to the Okpai, Calabar and the Afam VI power plants.\n\n\u201cThe available generation capacity was exacerbated by the ongoing water management regime at the Kainji, Jebba, and Shiroro power plants. The progress so far made includes, amongst many other initiatives, the following.\n\n\u201cThe gas pipeline affected by acts of vandalism has been restored and the Okpai power plant has resumed power generation and currently contributing an average of 300mw.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading (NBET) Plc has been directed to enter into fast-tracked negotiation with Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC) on an interim energy sales agreement to bring the new Okpai II power plant on the grid, thereby contributing additional 400mw of generation capacity,\u201d he added.\n\nFurthermore, the minister stated that the \u2018pigging\u2019 of the gas pipeline supplying gas to the Odukpani Power Plant is scheduled for completion on March 21, 2022, thus ramping up generation by about 400mw.\n\nTo optimise the capacity utilisation of the power plants owned by the Niger Delta Power Holding Company Ltd. (NDPHC), Aliyu explained that the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has approved a special gas pricing for emergency contracting of gas from the Nigerian Gas Marketing Company Ltd (NGMC).\n\n\u201cWe expect an on-grid improvement of about 800mw generation capacity from the NDPHC plants,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, in the medium-term, he noted that the federal government has agreed with the Nigerian Gas and Power Investment Company (NGPIC), a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, on the framework for the overhaul of the Okoloma gas processing plant.\n\nAccording to him, this new development will restore the full capacity of the 650MW Afam VI combined cycle power plant.\n\nHe stated that while the recent spate of system collapses was regrettable, it was a direct consequence of a snap on a 330kV transmission line.\n\nAliyu maintained that the mitigation measures to avoid such incidence of blackouts were being implemented through several interventions, including the Presidential Power Initiative (PPI)\n\n\u201cWe wish to reassure all electricity consumers that all relevant agencies involved in the restoration of normality in power supply have been charged to act in the context of the emergency state of the industry.\n\n\u201cThe federal ministry of power shall continue to periodically update the nation on the progress,\u201d he stated.\n\nThe problematic power grid is a network of electrical transmission lines that connect several generating stations to loads spread across the country through generator stations, transmission lines, and towers.\n\nExperts have said that the procurement and deployment of a spinning reserve, which can respond within 10 minutes to compensate for generation or transmission outages, could significantly reduce Nigeria\u2019s power grid collapses.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
