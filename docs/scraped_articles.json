Nothing can change this position due to the fact that, all those that matter in the state politically are inseparably united in APC.\u201d\n\nIn his remark in Zamfara, Lukman also pledged to deliver all important messages to persons concerned with no hesitation immediately the zonal tour is concluded, assuring that, report on assessment documented from the interaction with party stakeholders across the zone will be taken to the National Chairman of the party as well as any relevant entity.\n\nLukman expressed satisfaction with the level of unity amongst party members in the state.

These developments threaten our already distressed democratic process.\n\n\u201cWhat is at stake is more than an election. It is the survival of our country. The prospects of safe conduct of electoral activities and a free and fair election are being threatened by the conduct of our politicians. We must find the resolve and the strength to step back and pull the nation away from its current precarious position.\n\n\u201cOur politics now operates outside safe and tolerable boundaries, and the nation will pay dearly for the desperation and limitations of those who ought to show leadership and responsibility among our politicians.\n\n\u201cIt is not responsible to resist the urge to caution politicians only on the ground that many matters that will impact on our lives and the quality of our national existence are purely internal affairs of political parties.\n\n\u201cThe search for a running mate for the APC\u2019s Presidential candidate with religious faith of two individuals as the sole issue at stake represents a sad reminder that our politicians will not allow our democratic system to grow beyond the narrowest of confinements.\n\n\u201cNigerians take their faith seriously, but we are also painfully aware that the faith of our leaders has never been a factor in the manner we are governed.\n\n\u201cThe political maneuvers in the APC now divert attention from serious issues around the quality of governance, and point to the danger that we are a multi religious country whose citizens will pay dearly if one politician is not a Christian or Muslim.\n\n\u201cThe melodrama around selection of the PDP\u2019s Presidential candidate\u2019s running mate, and the role of Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike will remain constant reminders that power and wealth, irrespective of how they are acquired, have made our political process its hostage. The ransom that will be paid to free our democratic process may be such that the nation cannot afford.\u201d",

Colonel Mohammed Abdulfatai.\n\nIn 2009, Suleiman led the arrest/killing of more than 370 insurgents and later helped to scuttle a Boko Haram plan to attack the Presidential Villa.\n\nIn 2014, Mohammed led the Konduga operation that eliminated over 200 terrorists. Both received official commendations for their feat.\n\nA lawyer of the retired personnel disclosed that they had received threat messages from Boko Haram and ISWAP.\n\n\u201cMy client\u2019s life and that of his colleagues are in serious danger. We don\u2019t know what the terrorists are planning.\n\n\u201cThe military and other relevant security agencies must act fast\u201d, he told PRNigeria on anonymity.\n\nThe counsel criticized the military hierarchy for failing to facilitate the reinstatement of retired officers despite favourable court rulings.\n\nExpressing hope that justice will be done, he said it was gratifying that the incumbent service chiefs have no objection to the verdicts.\n\n\u201cThey were not behind the travails of my client and others. But our concern is the Minister of Defence, he has refused to act.\n\n\u201cWe shall not relent in writing and exploring every avenue to get justice for the retired senior army officers\u201d, the legal practitioner added.\n\nDAILY POST gathered that the ex-commanders already declared their intention to rejoin the war against terrorists if the military effects the court orders and recall them.\n\nLast year, Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Leo Irabor urged the Federal Government to intervene in the 2016 forceful retirement of 38 officers.\n\nIn a letter (Ref. No. CDS/8/A) to Defence Minister, retired Major General Bashir Magashi, Irabor acknowledged the non-compliance with rulings.\n\n\u201cThe appeal is being made on the need to motivate both serving and retired personnel, sustain morale and sharpen the psyche of the future generation of officers.\n\n\u201cThe appeal, if upheld, will ensure the primacy of military organizational values are kept permanently high without dampening morale or breeding mistrust.\u201d\n\nIrabor told Magashi that reservists and retired officers are a \u201cvital workforce for advancing national interests and must be carefully managed to check inordinate activities by highly skilled but disgruntled personnel.\u201d",

We are therefore demanding that our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu be transferred immediately to a prison in the Eastern region for his safety because if anything untoward happens to him Nigeria will see and feel total and consuming madness even after the Biafran Nation\u2019s freedom is fully achieved they will never have peace.\n\n\u201cKuje prison attack was pre-planned with full knowledge of the decutity agencies. The question the world should ask Nigeria military is why bandits and terrorists did operation for more than 4 hours in the country\u2019s capital Nigeria Government and its security agencies did not show up until they finished their attack?\n\n\u201cWe are demanding for the unconditional release of our leader or for him to be transferred to a prison in the South-East. Our leader is not safe in Abuja. The impostor president is aware of what happened in katsina and Kuje prison . The next attack is DSS and their singular target as always will be Biafrans detained in the custody of the DSS and our leader Nnamdi Kanu is detained in the DSS custody.\n\n\u201cDetention of our great leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in DSS custody has assumed a very dangerous stage, this is in view of the ongoing secret meetings between the security Agencies especially DSS of which one of the outcomes was the mobilization of the bandits for a make-believe attack on DSS facility.\n\n\u201cWe call on the civilised countries in the world especially UK Government, US government, EU, AU, German Government, Israeli government, Russian government, Canadian Government, French government and other reputable human right institutions across the world to prevail on Nigeria Government and her compromised security agencies to release our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu from DSS custody unhurt because if anything happens to our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in DSS custody, the story would never remain the same and the consequences is better not imagined.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to let the world know that IPOB members were profiled and detained in Kuje prison yards for simply being persons indigenous to Biafra and of Igbo race. we have their details and want them alive because if anything untoward happens to our comrades who are detained in Kuje, IPOB will never take it easy with Nigeria Government and her security agencies.\n\n\u201cIt is high time to release these innocent folks who were detained illegally and unjustly, Nigeria cannot continue to detain them indefinitely while allowing terrorists and bandits to come and slaughter them under a disguised arrangements by the Buhari-Fulani administration.\n\n\u201cA very pertinent question to ask is: how can bandits and terrorists be rampaging the North, even supposedly attacking president\u2019s convoy and breaking into prison yards to release their colleagues while Buhari and Fulani government deployed and continue to deploy battalion of soldiers to occupy many peaceful communities in Biafraland?\u201d",

          "text": "(AP)\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed to resign Thursday after days of defections crippled the controversial leader and left him unable to govern.\n\nJohnson finally agreed to step down after one of his closest allies, Treasury Chief Nadhim Zahawi, told the prime minister to resign for the good of the country. It was not immediately clear whether Johnson will stay in office while the Conservative Party chooses a new leader, who will automatically become prime minister as well. A formal announcement is expected later Thursday.\n\n\u201cPrime Minister: this is not sustainable and it will only get worse: for you, for the Conservative Party and most importantly of all the country,\u201d Zahawi said in a letter to Johnson. \u201cYou must do the right thing and go now.\u201d\n\nZahawi\u2019s intervention came after two more members of Johnson\u2019s Cabinet resigned, along with three junior officials, pushing the number of those who have left the government this week past 50.\n\nJohnson on Wednesday rejected calls to resign, arguing that he had a mandate from the voters to remain in office. But by Thursday morning the man who has built a reputation for wriggling out of political controversies was forced to admit the reality of his situation.\n\nBernard Jenkin, a senior Conservative Party lawmaker, said he met with Johnson on Wednesday and advised him to stand down.\n\n\u201cI just said to him, \u2019Look, it\u2019s just when you go now, and it\u2019s how you go. You can go with some dignity or you can be forced out like Donald Trump, clinging to power and pretending he\u2019s won the election when he\u2019s lost,\u201d Jenkin told the BBC before Johnson agreed to resign.\n\nJohnson, 58, managed to remain in power for almost three years, despite allegations that he was too close to party donors, that he protected supporters from bullying and corruption allegations, and that he misled Parliament and was dishonest to the public about government office parties that broke pandemic lockdown rules.\n\nBut recent disclosures that Johnson knew about sexual misconduct allegations against Chris Pincher, a Conservative lawmaker, before he promoted Pincher to a senior position turned out to be the last straw.\n\nLast week, Pincher resigned as deputy chief whip after complaints he groped two men at a private club. That triggered a series of reports about past allegations leveled against Pincher \u2014 and shifting explanations from the government about what Johnson knew when he tapped him for a senior job enforcing party discipline.\n\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid and Treasury chief Rishi Sunak resigned within minutes of each other Wednesday over the scandal. The two Cabinet heavyweights were responsible for tackling two of the biggest issues facing Britain \u2014 the cost-of-living crisis and COVID-19.\n\nJavid captured the mood of many lawmakers when he said Johnson\u2019s actions threatened to undermine the integrity of the Conservative Party and the British government.\n\n\u201cAt some point we have to conclude that enough is enough,\u201d he told fellow lawmakers Wednesday. \u201cI believe that point is now.\u201d\n\nWelsh Secretary Simon Hart resigned on Wednesday, and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis followed suite early Thursday, telling Johnson in his resignation letter that \u201cwe are \u2026 past the point of no return. I cannot sacrifice my personal integrity to defend things as they stand now.\u201d He was later followed by Education Secretary Michelle Donelan, who was only appointed to her post on Tuesday to replace Zahawi.\n\nJohnson had attempted to defy the mathematics of parliamentary government and the traditions of British politics. It is rare for a prime minister to cling to power in the face of this much pressure from his Cabinet colleagues.\n\nThe closest parallel may be Margaret Thatcher, the long-time Conservative prime minister who in 1990 sought to remain in office after her authority was undermined by disagreements over Britain\u2019s relationship with what is now known as the European Union. But even she decided to resign after a number of Cabinet ministers told her it would be better for the party if she stepped aside.\n\nJohnson may try to remain in office until the Conservative Party chooses a new leader, a process likely to take place over the summer. But some Conservatives said he should leave 10 Downing St. immediately to end the chaos engulfing the government.\n\nGeorge Freeman, who quit as science minister on Thursday, tweeted that \u201cBoris Johnson needs to hand in the seals of office, apologise to Her Majesty (Queen Elizabeth II) and advise her to call for a caretaker prime minister. To take over today so that ministers can get back to work and we can choose a new Conservative leader to try and repair the damage and rebuild trust.\u201d",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Aidoghie Paulinus, Molly Kilete, Godwin Tsa, Jude Idu, Charity Nwakaudu, Abuja, Christopher Oji\n\nFears have gripped residents of Abuja and neighbouring states following revelation that no fewer than 64 inmates undergoing trial for terrorism and others numbering 879 inmates of Kuje Medium Correctional Service, Abuja, were among the escapees after the attack on the facility on Tuesday night.\n\nMinister of Defence, Bashir Salihi Magashi, who made the confirmation after visiting the site, yesterday, emphasised that the attackers, mainly Boko Haram members, specifically came to free their members in detention.\n\nResidents leaving close to the area said heavy gunshots which started at about 10.p.m. lasted close to an hour. They said it was not clear who the gunmen were but it was believed they were some criminal elements.\n\nThough the minister said only one Civil Defence personnel lost his life during the attack, prison officers displayed three corpses as additional casualties.\n\nA prison officer alleged conspiracy, claiming that despite the Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC), and submachine gun at the disposal of the security agents on guard, there was no attempt to deploy the weapon.\n\n\u201cThe terrorists that came for the operation did not touch the APC and the submachine guns, but burnt down the official and personal cars beside them. There was no single resistance from the security forces on ground to confront the attackers. As of Monday this week, they had beefed up security around the prison following an intelligence report of a possible attack. They increased the numbers of the army, police, Civil Defence and our own armed squad, yet none of them was courageous enough to attack the terrorists.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the Civil Defence personnel who lost his life was the only one who tried to display gallantry, but he paid with his life because he could not listen when the military, police and his colleague warned him to go into hiding. The response rate from the security guards was not encouraging at all.\n\n\u201cInside the prison was completely empty in the morning because virtually all inmates escaped. From what I gathered, one of the terrorists had broken into the office they keep files and destroyed or burnt them not to trace any record about them. I also gathered that they made an attempt to break into Abba Kyari\u2019s cell but it was difficult for him,\u201d he explained.\n\nAsked why the army responded too late and equally failed to act on the security report, the Defence Minister said: \u201cIf people give timely intelligence at the right time, I am sure we would have reacted promptly. But when it is not coming at the time you don\u2019t expect us to react. There is every likelihood that the situation is going to be interpreted on the basis of being quick or slow. From what we discussed now, I am sure that every security agent that came to Kuje Prison participated in every way possible to ensure that the prisoners did not escape. Our happiness is that many of them have been recaptured. There was reinforcement because the Brigade of Guards was fully in charge,\u201d he said.\n\nPermanent Secretary, Ministry of Interior, Shauib Belgore, explained that out of over 950 inmates in Kuje Correctional Centre, over 600 of them escaped adding that over 300 have been recaptured.\n\nNCoS\u2019 spokesman, Mr Abubakar Umar, in a statement, said the attackers broke into the facility using explosive devices through the main entrance and the fence of the facility respectively.\n\nHe confirmed that an NSCDC personnel was killed adding that three personnel of the NCoS were seriously injured. The slain officer identified as Inspector Ilyasu Abraham was deployed to the correctional facility three years ago.\n\nUmar said the service would deploy its Corrections Information Management System (CIMS) in synergy with National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) to track all fleeing inmates and return them to custody.\n\nHe also confirmed that DCP Abba Kyari and other VIPs held in the facility did not escape adding that they were presently in custody, hale and hearty.\n\nMeanwhile, residents of Kuje Area Council have recounted their experiences, revealing that they saw sporadic shooting and inmates escaping in droves.\n\nA resident whose house is a few metres away from the prison yard told Daily Sun that while some of the escaping inmates were shot on the legs to demobilise them, other stranded ones were picked.\n\nStill struggling to overcome the trauma of the incident, a prison staff who was on duty during the attack told Daily Sun that a terrorist inmate had offered to accommodate them in his cell, but he rejected the offer and resorted to prayers for rescue.\n\n\u201cWe prayed like never before and God answered our prayers because the attackers broke almost all the rooms except our own. How we survived is still a surprise to me,\u201d the officer narrated.\n\nSpeaking when he visited the Centre, FCT Minister, Mohammed Musa Bello, ordered the Gomo of Kuje, Haruna Tanko Jibrin, to immediately summon meeting of village heads in and around the Area Council to ensure that no foreigner infiltrated the community and to fish out such person if it happens.\n\nThe minister, who visited the Correctional Service and was shown round the damaged facilities by the Controller General said he visited to see for himself the extent of damage done by the terrorists.\n\n\u2022Security beefup\n\nSecurity has been tightened in most parts of Kuje communities. Correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) who went round the area, observed heavy security presence with fierce-looking armed personnel in areas considered as flash points.\n\nArmoured tanks have been positioned around Kuje Prison junction, while various teams of security personnel in siren-blaring vehicles patrol the area.\n\nThe Police, in conjunction with other security operatives, have cordoned off the roads leading to the prison area and movements have been restricted in the area.\n\n\u2022Police deploy special force\n\nThe Inspector of Police, Usman Alkali, has ordered deployment of the Explosives Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Unit, forensic experts and other special forces to speedily get to the root of the incident and ensure culprits were brought to book.\n\nPolice Spokesman, CSP Muyiwa Adejobi, said all relevant security agencies were working tirelessly to unravel circumstances surrounding it.\n\n\u2022US issues security alert to nationals\n\nRegardless, the United States Government has alerted its nationals has issued security advisory to its citizens.\n\nThe United States Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria, in a July 6 security notice on its website, said: \u201cOn the night of July 5, 2022, an attack on Kuje Prison freed a large portion of the estimated 1,000 prisoners. The prison lies approximately 27 miles southwest of the Central Business District.\u201d\n\nThe United States further said an increase in crime is expected in and around Abuja, while also saying that \u201cit is recommended that U.S. citizens should maintain a high state of personal security awareness for the next two weeks and avoid unnecessary travel on the airport road.\u201d\n\nAccording to the United States, \u201cCrime is endemic throughout Nigeria and tends to spike after dark. Avoiding locations and situations that increase the likelihood of being victimized is the best defense. Avoid displays of valuables and limit nighttime activity.\u201d\n\nThe United States added that terrorist groups and those inspired by such organisations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad.\n\n\u201cTerrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack \u2013including knives, firearms, and vehicles \u2013 to target crowds more effectively. Frequently, their aim is focused on unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as: high-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.); hotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists; places of worship, schools, parks, shopping malls and markets, public transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights),\u201d the United States said.\n\nAmongst other precautions, the United States cautioned its nationals to be aware of their surroundings, keep a low profile, carry proper identification, monitor local media for updates and review personal security plans.",

Some of these attacks have been on isolated roads and in remote locations, but there is a chance that they could occur in metropolitan areas. There is also a heightened risk of indiscriminate attacks on police and security infrastructure, which may inadvertently affect bystanders. A number of states have imposed curfews. Travellers to these regions are advised to exercise caution if travelling in remote areas at night and follow local news and information outlets for further information, including on local curfews,\u201d the UK said.\n\n\u2026Resign now, HURIWA, ADC tell Buhari\n\nWorried by the rising insecurity, civil rights advocacy group, Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) and presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Dumebi Kachikwu, have called on President Muhammadu Buhari to resign.\n\nHURIWA\u2019s National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, in a statement, claimed the Buhari administration and the military were cool with the spate of terrorist attacks in the country as they have failed to deploy the 12 Super Tucano fighter jets against terrorists turning the country into another Afghanistan.\n\nKachikwu in a statement, released to journalists in Abuja, yesterday, said the attack on the convoy of the President on its way to Daura, Katsina State and simultaneous attack on Kuje Correctional Centre, were clear signs that the country is now faced with a grave security threat.\n\nHe wondered who then is safe if the President\u2019s convoy can be attacked as well as the Kuje Prison, which is just a few kilometers to the seat of power.",

The gunshots were so rapid. Even in the house where I stay \u2014 the room shares a fence with the prison \u2014 we were just hearing bomb blasts and gunshots continuously.\n\n\u201cThe operation lasted like three hours. There was no intervention, we were so scared. We were wondering if some of those we heard running will jump into our compound.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThey were clearly terrorists. They kept chanting \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019, and saying: \u2018we have gained victory\u2019 in Hausa language.\n\n\u201cThey were bombing everywhere with explosives; it was shaking the room and the whole ground.

          "title": "The leading African tech moves from June 2022",
          "text": "We\u2019re halfway through the year, and quite a number of exciting things have happened in Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s $53.4 mobile money fraud lawsuit and Kune\u2019s shutdown in Kenya, to big acquisitions across North Africa, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves from June.\n\nIn June 2022, African startups made 36 fully disclosed* raises totalling $426,280,000 million. This amount is a 2.4% decrease from May 2022\u2019s $437,100,000.\n\nThis means that in the first half of 2022 (H1 2022), African startups raised a whopping $2,787,523,000, a 134.25% increase from the $1.19 billion raised in H1 2021.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors in June are fintech, energytech, and mobility/logistics. Fintech startups raised $305,430,000. (71.7%), energytech startups raised $35,700,000 (8.4%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $32,700,000 (7.7%).\n\nPer region, North Africa led with $173,300,000 of the funding, with fintech MNT-Halan\u2019s $150 million at the helm. South Africa came a close second with $127,500,000, while West and East Africa followed with $79,430,000 and $46,050,000 respectively.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals in June are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in June 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y Combinator.\n\nLess than 2 months after the launch of its mobile money payments service bank (MoMo PSB) in Nigeria, telco MTN in June reportedly took 18 Nigerian banks to court over a $53.7 million fraud allegation.\n\nAccording to the telco, the fraud was committed over a total of 700,000 transactions, over a one-month period, and the amount was transferred in error to 8,000 accounts.\n\nAfrica\u2019s biggest unicorn, Flutterwave, made some pretty important hires last month.\n\n\n\nFormer managing director at Goldman Sachs, Gurbhej Dhillon, joined the fintech startup as chief technical officer (CTO) while former vice president of American Express, Oneal Bhambani, also joined the company as chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nIt\u2019s no news that about 70% of startups fail at the pre-seed or seed stage, and Kenyan food delivery service Kune\u2019s shutdown came as little surprise to Kenyans.\n\nLess than a year after raising $1 million to solve a problem many Kenyans believe does not exist, Kune shut down in June after founder Robin Reecht announced on LinkedIn that they had run out of money.\n\nPiggyTech, parent company of Nigeria-based fintech PiggyVest, pocketed a mobile money (MOMO) license in June.\n\nPiggyTech also rebranded its payment app from Abeg to PocketApp. The licence will help the startup transition PocketApp from a payment app to a social commerce app that supports online merchants in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria may have lower mobile money usage compared to Kenya, Uganda or even Ghana, but that may soon change.\n\nIn more Nigerian mobile money news from June, telecom giant Airtel also launched its own payments service bank (PSB), SmartCash PSB. With its PSB license, Airtel can provide the 55% of Nigerians who don\u2019t have bank accounts access to SmartCash PSB.\n\nAbout 15,900 tech workers from startups across the globe were laid off in June 2022.\n\nIn Africa, Egypt- and Dubai-based healthtech startup, Vezeeta, laid off about 10% of its staff. Its LinkedIn profile says it has 500 staff, so about 50 workers must have been laid off.\n\nThis news comes a month after another Egypt- and Dubai-based startup, Swvl, laid off 32% of its workforce.\n\nIn big news about acquisitions, 3 happened in June 2022.\n\nFirst, MFS Africa announced plans to acquire US-based payments software company Global Technology Partners (GTP) in a $34 million deal.\n\nThen Apetito, a Cairo-based on-demand grocery retail business announced the acquisition of Lamma, a similar startup, to help its expansion to Morocco, Tunisia, and West Africa.\n\nFinally, Nigeria\u2019s Access Bank announced its second acquisition in Kenya. It\u2019s reportedly aiming to buy Sidian Bank for $36.7 million (Ksh 4.3 billion).\n\nIn June, Kenya\u2019s parliament passed the ICT Practitioners\u2019 Bill which requires all techies in Kenya to register and pay tax before they can work in the country.\n\nFortunately, President Uhuru Kenyatta rejected the bill stating that it was \u201cimpractical and counterproductive\u201d.\n\nIn more news about Kenyan legislations, the Kenyan government made another move to regulate its digital lending space.\n\nThe government announced plans to introduce a 20% excise tax on all fees charged by all digital lenders.\n\nOther than Flutterwave\u2019s, several other important hires were announced in June.\n\nMara, a pan\u2013African crypto exchange platform, appointed ex-Apple executive Susan Younis as its chief marketing officer (CMO).\n\nEloho Omame, co-founder and General Partner at FirstCheck Africa, joined TLcom Capital as a partner.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your network on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Facebook.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "In the past 2 years, stories of success and challenges e-commerce startups have often involved the impact of the pandemic on operations, and this story of 2 Rwandan co-founders does not break the formula.\n\nDuring the 2020 lockdown, Anselme Mucunguzi, 30, noticed a gap in the technology needed to service last mile delivery in Kigali, the Rwandan capital. To his mind, payment processing was robust\u2014people could use Paystack or Flutterwave when ordering stuff online; and for SMS marketing, they could use products like Africa\u2019s Talking. But there was no solution that delivered goods from sellers to the doorsteps of buyers. Sellers relied on random motorcyclists riding past to deliver packages to their customers. It was a risky measure. Not only could they not vouch for the professional and ethical conduct of such random riders, they also had no failsafe way to track the transportation of these packages. Even worse, these random riders were delivering the packages to locations that were described verbally, with landmarks as identifiers. It was an unreliable solution.\n\nSo, in January 2021, he founded Nisawa, a last-mile delivery service. The company was a subsidiary of Panavis, a legal research platform he\u2019d started working on in 2017 as part of his master\u2019s thesis at the University of Notre Dame, and incorporated in 2019. His co-founders were lawyer Mayday Karugarama, and software engineer Fran\u00e7ois Birori.\n\nNisawa would close operations a few months later, on October 14, due to disagreement over business direction with his then co-founder, Fran\u00e7ois Birori. Birori had wanted Nisawa to transition to an online marketplace while Mucunguzi insisted on remaining in the last-mile delivery line.\n\nOn October 15, the day after Nisawa closed, Vanoma began operations, maintaining all former staff and customers of Nisawa. Building off of the solution he activated at the predecessor startup, Vanoma is an integrated e-commerce solution centred around a last-mile delivery service to enable local businesses and independent sellers to sell online.\n\nVanoma\u2019s solution is designed to take the burden off the seller. All a seller needs to do to initiate a delivery is supply the receiver\u2019s phone number on the Vanoma website. Vanoma then sends the receiver an SMS with a custom link they refer to as a \u201cdelivery link\u201d. On clicking the link, the receiver is led to Vanoma\u2019s website where they can easily geolocate themselves thanks to their smartphone\u2019s built-in GPS capabilities. Once their exact location is established, a rider is sent out to pick up the package from the seller and deliver to the buyer. The seller never has to bother about the logistics beyond that initial action of supplying the receiver\u2019s phone number on the Vanoma website.\n\nIn July 2021, Mucunguzi invited his longtime friend Theophile Nsengimana, 30, to join him as co-founder; and in October, Nsengimana agreed.\n\nFriendship and partnership\n\nMucunguzi and Nsengimana\u2019s friendship is older than Vanoma. They met in 2011, as 2 of 32 high schoolers selected for the annual Rwandan Presidential Scholars programme. Mucunguzi would go on to study chemistry with a minor in mathematics at the Belhaven University, Jackson, Mississippi, while Nsengimana would move to Little Rock, Arkansas to study computer science and mathematics at the Philander Smith College.\n\nFour years later, the pair teamed up to work on a music streaming platform for Rwandan music in 2015. Mucunguzi lived in Indiana at the time and was about to begin his master\u2019s in physical chemistry. Nsengimana had just graduated from Philander Smith and worked in San Francisco.\n\nYeyote failed to gain traction because, Mucunguzi says, \u201cit is difficult to monetise media\u201d in Rwanda.\n\nThey rested the idea in 2017 and moved on to other projects. Mucunguzi was rounding off his master\u2019s degree at Notre Dame and Nsengimana was preparing to begin his, in computer science, at Tennessee State University.\n\nThe \u201cdead end\u201d\n\nI find Mucunguzi\u2019s decision to start Panavis curious, as he is no lawyer by training. (Law is a very technical discipline requiring dedicated training, I maintain.) He laughs at my question, and warns me that we\u2019re about to \u201cget into rabbit holes\u201d. He then tells me the reason he got into the legal business: Yeyote, the music streaming app he\u2019d worked on with Nsengimana.\n\nWhile building the app, he discovered that he had to constantly study laws around licensing, copyright, and incorporating a company, across several countries.\n\nThe legal research platform did not succeed as a business because its biggest could-be client, the Rwandan government\u2019s ministry of justice, had a stringent budget that planned expenses for 2\u20133 years at a time. What this means is, the ministry couldn\u2019t decide in April (or even January) of a given year that they\u2019d need Mucunguzi\u2019s service in July. Panavis would have to wait until the next budgetary allocation round to fit into the government\u2019s budget.\n\nOn top of that, the law firm market in Rwanda is small, he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have more than 15 legitimate law firms. Even if each one is paying a subscription fee of $100, or even more, that\u2019s not enough to pay 3, 4 people Unless you are about to get government clients. Even the law schools were not willing to pay substantial money. So, it was really a monetisation problem.\u201d\n\nThe business was a \u201cdead end,\u201d he concluded. He shuttered up Panavis in 2020 at the onset of the lockdown\u2014a year before founding Vanoma.\n\nA second try\n\nIn July 2021, when Nsengimana got the invitation from Mucunguzi to join him at Vanoma, he was working out of Seattle as a software engineer for Amazon. It was a great job, but he wanted more. He wanted to leave paid employment and return to entrepreneurship. He and Mucunguzi had stayed in touch after Yeyote folded up. In fact, 3 years before, Mucunguzi had asked him to co-found with him at Nisawa, but Nsengimana refused; he was busy balancing school and his work.\n\nStill, the years he\u2019d spent with Mucunguzi building the music streaming app were some of the most fulfilling of his life, he tells me. So, when Mucunguzi approached him to be his co-founder at Vanoma, given their history of working together and his yearning to do work that was \u201cmuch more rewarding\u201d, he agreed and relocated to Kigali to co-run the business.\n\nExpanding competition\n\nVanoma startup employs 12 full-time drivers who make deliveries all over Kigali, the city that is the extent of their coverage, as of today.\n\nI want to know what their expansion plans are. Mucunguzi tells me their approach is to avoid markets such as Nairobi, Kenya, that are \u201cextremely competitive\u201d. Nairobi, he explains, already has plenty of delivery products\u2014Uber and Bolt, for example\u2014so Vanoma will not be expanding there just yet. But they could expand into Uganda, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, or Cameroon any day now, once they feel ready, as their findings show these markets are ripe for an ecommerce boom.\n\nMy Life in Tech (MLIT) is a biweekly column that profiles innovators, leaders, and shapers in the African tech ecosystem, with the intention of putting a human face to the startups and innovations they build.

          "title": "How Nigerian startups can build healthier cultures",
          "text": "Earlier in May, TechCabal asked 5 employees at different startups what was important to them when considering a job offer. All, understandably, listed monetary compensation as high on their list. But they ranked something else even higher: company culture.\n\n\u201cEveryone likes money, including me. Salary is a major motivation, but I value other benefits as well. If I had to choose between a well-paying company with a bad culture that\u2019s also providing added benefits, and a healthy workplace culture with lower pay, I\u2019d definitely go for the company with the lower pay because that\u2019s what\u2019s important to my professional growth. And that\u2019s what I value,\u201d said Ibrahim Adeniyi, a full-stack engineer at Quick Lookup.\n\nThe number of employees TechCabal interviewed, while small, is reflective of a larger pool of employees who are quickly realising how important healthy workplace cultures are to them. In its 2022 Global Talent Trends report, LinkedIn shows that at least 40% of job seekers across the world consider company culture an important factor when job hunting.\n\nIn fact, healthy workplace cultures are so important that they can boost retention by at least 40%. This is especially important at a time when retention is at an all-time high. Studies now show that 65% of younger people are less likely to stay in a role for more than a year. Job hopping\u2014the act of moving from company to company within short periods\u2014is now rampant, and while there are other factors egging these rates up, workplace culture tops the list.\n\nHigh turnover rates are not strange at startups, but they can be obstructive to the growth and success of a startup, especially when you consider how much money startups lose in hiring and rehiring. Turnover costs startups up to 20% of an employee\u2019s annual salary, and for managerial roles, the costs will go up.\n\nSo, how can startups on the continent keep this number down? How can they use healthy cultures to boost employee retention and engagement?\n\nCulture is everything\n\nFor Olufunmilola Bucknor, an HR professional and talent advisor with 18 years of experience recruiting for top brands, the first step is understanding what culture is in the first place.\n\nOlufunmilola Bucknor\n\n\u201cCulture is the way we think, the way we talk, the way we give feedback. It\u2019s even the way we eat! Distinct and ingrained culture will make your employees stand out. People will be able to take a look at your employees, at the words they use, and instantly tell where they work,\u201d Bucknor says to TechCabal over a phone call.\n\n\u201cWhen you understand how and what culture is, you can then take steps to embed healthy ones in your startup. People spend more of their waking hours at work than anywhere else. If you want to get the best out of them, you have to make sure the environment is conducive. So essentially, culture is not just for the employees, but for the organisation too.\u201d\n\nLearning on the job\n\nTemitayo Samson-Grace, who is head of talent at Big Cabal Media (BCM), believes that having clear mission and vision statements also helps in building healthy cultures.\n\nTemitayo Samson-Grace\n\n\u201cIf the vision and mission of a startup aren\u2019t clear to the people, they start to act in ways that suit them. For a team to be productive, everyone needs to flow in the same direction, and if everyone\u2019s understanding of the mission is different, then the team will move at different paces,\u201d Samson-Grace says to TechCabal over a call.\n\n\u201cHave a clear mission and make sure you communicate it frequently to your team. Once people understand your mission, why your company exists, and the problems you\u2019re trying to solve, it\u2019ll help define behaviours that will support that mission.\u201d\n\nBucknor takes it a step further and emphasises the need for employees to understand where they fit in within the organisation. \u201cThere are companies where employees don\u2019t even know what their own goals are. They know they have jobs, but they don\u2019t know what their goals are. That leaves them feeling out of place, and that can be troublesome.\u201d\n\nTo solve this, Bucknor says that startups should help their employees understand what roles they play in the business. \u201cSet KPIs, give each and every employee goals and provide them with feedback and training that will help them achieve these goals.\u201d\n\nThe HR expert also explains that where most startups get it wrong is in how they set goals and give feedback. \u201cFeedback should be aimed at helping employees improve, and it shouldn\u2019t be something that\u2019s only given at performance appraisals. One of the reasons employees don\u2019t like appraisals is because managers wait too long to give feedback, and when they do, it\u2019s not constructive.\u201d\n\nAppraisals should not be punitive, Bucknor explains. They should be used for learning, and learning is what\u2019s most important for jobs.\n\nBucknor uses the 70\u201320\u201310 model to explain why it\u2019s important that startups learn how to give constructive feedback. \u201cWe learn on the job. There\u2019s only so much training and courses can teach you. Seventy per cent of learning is gained on the job, 20% from interactions with the team, and only 10% from training and courses. So if you don\u2019t give constructive feedback, and allow people learn on the job, you\u2019re doing them and your startup harm in the long run.\u201d\n\nCulture also includes benefits\n\nStartups can also improve company culture by offering appropriate benefits.\n\n\u201cThe needs of employees differ from startup to startup, and sometimes, from team to team,\u201d says Samson-Grace. \u201cThink of it the same way you think of how children have different needs. The way you address those needs impact your relationship with the children.\u201d\n\nThe right incentives, according to Samson-Grace, can boost a startup\u2019s culture. \u201cYou need to consider the economy, and ask your employees what difficulties they face at home and even at work. If you can reduce their burden, you free up more time for your employees to focus on work.\u201d\n\nOne Nigerian crypto startup, Helicarrier, does this by providing daily lunches and paying employees in a dollar-pegged stablecoin. \u201cFor our Nigerian-based staff, this helps keep them above water with the increasing inflation rate. It also helps the team understand our vision and value. We\u2019re a crypto company, paying our employees in crypto,\u201d Ire Aderinokun, chief operations officer at Helicarrier, says in a Live session with TechCabal.\n\nAnother startup, GetEquity, also recently gained recognition on social media after one of its employees shared photos of the period care packages the startup sent to its female employees.\n\nMy sweet office sends period care packages to all the women every month. Most thoughtful \u2764\ufe0f. @getequity pic.twitter.com/Nk4lu4jGVd \u2014 Honorable. (@Sisi_tomi) April 16, 2022\n\nWhile GetEquity\u2019s benefits sparked controversy on the cost and usefulness of company benefits, the employees and HR team believe that it works for their team.\n\nTomisin Akingboye, the head of operations at GetEquity, explains, \u201cBenefits should be curated to fit the startups. Some startups can\u2019t afford to do much while others can splurge. For us, the period care packages help our employees feel better. It\u2019s no different than maternity and paternity leaves or sick days. It works, and that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nUchenna Angel Kalu-Uduma, a product manager at GetEquity, explains to TechCabal that the company settled on this benefit upon interviewing several members of the GetEquity team. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot the team does that is exemplary of a great culture. Other than the period care packages, there are also tailored healthcare plans that cater to employees with chronic illnesses. All of this makes us feel valued as employees.\u201d\n\nHow to get it right\n\nFor some startups, the seed of unhealthy and toxic cultures is already ingrained. Current and past employees at Bento Africa, for example, recently revealed how the company\u2014via its founder\u2014had been perpetuating years of toxic culture through verbal abuse. Employees at another startup, Flutterwave, also recently exposed a culture of abuse and harassment.\n\nFor these startups, there\u2019s always an opportunity to change.\n\n\u201cAnd it all starts from the top down,\u201d says Bucknor.\n\nBucknor explains that a recurring trope with startups is how most founders and line managers are \u201caccidental people managers\u201d. She says that being good at one\u2019s job doesn\u2019t necessarily mean people are ready to help others be better at theirs. \u201cA lot of founders and managers have business acumen, but they lack people management skills. One mistake we often make is promoting high performers to managerial roles without any formal people management training. So if you want to change, make sure the change is top-down.\u201d\n\nAkingboye believes that it all stems from founders deprioritising the roles of human resources in startups. \u201cWhen building a startup, founders hire for everything first, and then keep HR for last. And when they do finally get HR professionals on the team, founders expect HR to follow in their footsteps. That can\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nTo stem this issue, Akingboye says founders should prioritise HR the same way they prioritise growth or compliance.\n\n\u201cA good human resources team will help you hire great people that can help you achieve your goals. So if you want to build a healthy startup, have HR personnel put structures in place that will help you achieve what you want.\u201d\n\nDisclaimer: Temitayo Samson-Grace is head of talent at Big Cabal Media (BCM), the parent company of TechCabal.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar.

          "text": "Following the recent takeover of Kano, Benin and Kaduna distribution companies (DisCos) by Fidelity Bank Plc, a look at industry data show the 11 DisCos owe the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trader (NBET) a combined debt of N485.7 billion in 16 months for the electricity sold to them.\n\nThe government-owned NBET buys electricity in bulk from generation companies through power purchase agreements, and sells through vesting contracts to the DisCos, which then supply it to the consumers.\n\nBusinessDay reported on Wednesday that Fidelity Bank and Afreximbank had activated the call on the collateralised shares of Kano, Benin and Kaduna DisCos in a bid to take over their boards.\n\nAvailable data showed that the 11 Discos failed to meet a Minimum Remittance Order (MRO) set out by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) in 2021 and the first four months of 2022.\n\nAnalysis of the market payment reports by NBET indicates that the DisCos got over N1 trillion energy invoice in the period and NERC expected them to pay N810 billion as 81 percent MRO but the DisCos could only raise N591 billion, which is 59 percent of the total sum.\n\nIbadan DisCo led the debtor\u2019s list with N72.3 billion debt, followed by Kaduna DisCo (N68.9 billion) and Benin DisCo (N50.3 billion), while the least debtor was Eko DisCo (N31.8 billion).\n\n\u201cEight years after privatisation, many of the DisCos have failed to pay for the power they get on account of poor collections and outright mismanagement,\u201d Niyi Awodeyi, CEO at Subterra Energy Resources Limited, said.\n\nOther debtors are Enugu (N44.87 billion), Kano (N37.82 billion), Jos (N37.1 billion), Ikeja (N37.08 billion), Port Harcourt (N36.61 billion), Abuja (N36.6 billion) and Yola (N31.59 billion).\n\nRead also: Uncertainty over financial health of DisCos as CBN forbearance runs out\n\n\u201cSeveral banks made loans to the power sector during the power sector privatisation in 2013. If power sector loans become impaired, this leads to an increase in the cost of risk for these banks. These loans include significant sums lent to purchase power generation and distribution assets.\u201d analysts at CSL Stockbrokers Limited said in a note.\n\nIn 2021, the DisCos got N810 billion energy invoice and were expected to pay N563 billion as 69 percent MRO but they only remitted N445.2 billion.\n\nOla Alokolaro, partner, energy and infrastructure at Advocaat Law Practice, said although there is a general consensus that the challenges in the nation\u2019s power sector run across the entire value chain, the industry believes the DisCos are the most troubled.\n\n\u201cMost investors in the sector did not project that the implementation of tariff order would remain a major concern alongside weak infrastructure to dispatch the generated electricity,\u201d Alokolaro told BusinessDay.\n\nIn the first four months of this year, the DisCos also got an energy invoice of N266.9 billion and were expected to pay N247.3 billion as 92 percent MRO but only paid N146 billion.\n\nExperts say most of the DisCos were being spoon-fed, while the performance agreements they signed with the government were never met, leading to inefficient distribution of power supply.\n\n\u201cThe metering gap has persisted with high aggregate technical and commercial loss while none of the DisCos, except Eko, has been able to meet their revenue remittance threshold,\u201d Luqman Agboola, head of energy and Infrastructure at Sofidam Capital, said.\n\nData obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria showed the debt owed to Nigerian banks by operators in the power sector stood at N835.73 billion as of May this year.\n\nBusinessDay reported exclusively that the erstwhile management of Kano, Kaduna, Port Harcourt Ibadan, and Benin DisCos are under the radar of security agencies and the assets of the organisations are under close observation.\n\nIn 2021, the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) took over the operations of Ibadan DisCo but in January, the DisCo said it had reached an agreement with AMCON for it to continue to run the firm.\n\nRead also: Security operatives move to secure assets of distressed DisCos\n\nIt is not clear how long this arrangement will last as the Bureau of Public Enterprises has obtained approval from NERC to appoint Kingsley Achife as the interim managing director of Ibadan DisCo.\n\nLast November, United Bank for Africa took over Abuja Disco from KANN Utility Company towards recovering its loan.\n\nAccording to a report by the National Bureau of Statistics in 2020, the non-performing loans (NPL) in the power sector was N33.22 billion out of N1.23 trillion NPLs banks recorded.",

History shows that the markets typically fall just before the peak in inflation, just as we have experienced in recent months. This will be bullish for stocks.\u201d",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nAsaba \u2013 Nigerians have been assured that the Alhaji Atiku Abubakar-Ifeanyi Okowa presidential ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 elections will truly rescue Nigeria with a pragmatic approach to the mission.\n\nDelta State Commissioner for Information, Mr Charles Aniagwu gave the assurance to journalists in Asaba, the state capital.\n\nHe said that PDP Federal Government would leverage on the acknowledged experience and capacity of its flag-bearer in redeeming the country, especially in addressing the dwindling economy, unabating insecurity, unemployment and poverty.\n\nHe said that Nigerians were eager for a change in governance in the country because they had gone through very frustrating experience, particularly in the key sectors that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) promised to deal with in the last seven years, but had failed abysmally.\n\nAccording to him, the issues of security, building the economy and the anti-corruption war has heightened the expectations of Nigerians and now the people expect that there will be changes because the APC failed to deliver on their campaign promises.\n\n\u201cBeyond members of our party, Nigerians believe that the PDP should get it right as the major option for the people ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cOur economy is at its lowest ebb, corruption and the need to curb it and the issue of hunger, poverty and unemployment as people are no longer sure of where their next meal will come from.\n\nThese are some of the issues that leaders must interrogate as we move closer to the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cIt will no longer be business as usual, it is not enough to identify these challenges, leaders must tell Nigerians how they intend to address them.\n\n\u201cI am confident that the PDP candidate Alhaji Atiku Abubakar and his running mate, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta have articulated the issues they want to tackle and how they intend to rescue the country,\u201d\n\nThe Delta Information Commissioner said Atiku was instrumental to the growth of the economy during the Obasanjo regime, adding that Governor Okowa has brought his administrative and political sagacity to bear on the economy of Delta in the last seven years.\n\nHe said the Atiku-Okowa ticket will return the party to winning ways and the country to the path of development which had eluded the country in the last seven years.\n\n\u201cThe Atiku-Okowa ticket have the needed experience to turn things around for this country because Nigeria is like a patient in an emergency room, you need a doctor who is well equipped to go and carry out the operation to rescue the country,\u201d he stated.\n\nAniagwu further said the party has commenced a hunt for credible Nigerians across political, religious or ethnic sentiments to give strength to its recovery plan for Nigeria.\u200b\n\n\u201cWhat Atiku and Okowa want to do is not what you are used to. They want to look at the elements in the youths; that vibrancy\u2026. The Atiku/Okowa ticket will return power to the youths and appreciate the role and position of women\u201d.\n\nOn the capacity of Governor Okowa to galvanize votes for the PDP, Aniagwu said that beyond Okowa\u2019s acceptability, he valued consensus and does not run a one-man show.\n\n\u2018\u2019This means that Okowa will work with other leaders in the south and across the country to galvanize the voters. He believes that to have an inroad in Rivers State, for example, he will need leaders led by Wike to get the votes.\n\n\u2018\u2019Okowa will work with Wike very well. Okowa will also reach out to our brothers and sisters in the South-west and in the South-east which is already happening. The challenge at hand is not a one-man show\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nResponding to the northern/southern dichotomy in the emergence of Nigeria\u2019s next president, Mr Aniagwu enjoined Nigerians to move away from such divisive tendencies as purportedly encouraged by the current Federal Government.\n\n\u2018\u2019We agree that the Buhari administration has not been able to open up our system for us to appreciate our diversity rather, they took advantage of this diversity in the wrong way.

I think that will take care of the flooding situation on the existing bridge.\n\n\u201cBut this bridge itself is not going to be destroyed in anyway because during the dry season, it will still be useful but during the rainy season and dry season, this alternate bridge can be used at all times,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOkowa added that the contractor had promised that \u201cin another few weeks, they are likely to be through with the piling process on the bridge and that in three months, they will be through with the deck of the bridge, and that they intend to deliver the project by December, this year.\n\n\u201cSo, hopefully, we will be inaugurating this project before Christmas, this year.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has agreed to resign, his office, Thursday, ending an unprecedented political crisis over his future that has paralyzed Britain\u2019s government.\n\nAn official in Johnson\u2019s Downing Street office confirmed the prime minister would announce his resignation later.\n\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity because the announcement had not yet been made.\n\nJohnson had rebuffed calls by his Cabinet to step down in the wake of ethics scandals. He gave in after more than 40 ministers quit his government and told him to go.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether Johnson would stay in office while the Conservative Party chooses a new leader, who will replace him as prime minister.\n\nMinutes before the news broke, Treasury chief Nadhim Zahawi called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to resign just 36 hours after Johnson put him in the job, while another newly appointed Cabinet minister quit her post.\n\nZahawi said Johnson knew \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d was to \u201cgo now.\u201d\n\nZahawi was appointed late Tuesday to replace Rishi Sunak, who resigned saying he could no longer support Johnson after a series of ethics scandals.\n\nEducation Secretary Michelle Donelan, who was also appointed on Tuesday following the resignation of her predecessor, announced her resignation Thursday morning.\n\nJohnson had rejected clamors for his resignation, digging in his heels even as dozens of officials quit and previously loyal allies urge him to go after yet another scandal engulfed his leadership.\n\nA group of Johnson\u2019s most trusted Cabinet ministers visited him at his office in Downing Street Wednesday, telling him to stand down after losing the trust of his party. But Johnson instead opted to fight for his political career and fired one of the Cabinet officials, Michael Gove, British media reported.\n\nIt is rare for a prime minister to cling on to office in the face of this much pressure from his Cabinet colleagues. The Guardian\u2019s frontpage on Thursday called him \u201cDesperate, deluded.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s breached the trust that was put in him. He needs to recognise that he no longer has the moral authority to lead. And for him, it\u2019s over,\u201d Scottish National Party leader Ian Blackford told The Associated Press.\n\nJohnson, 58, was known for his knack for wiggling out of tight spots. He remained in power despite allegations that he was too close to party donors, that he protected supporters from bullying and corruption allegations, and that he misled Parliament and was dishonest to the public about government office parties that broke pandemic lockdown rules.\n\nBut recent disclosures that Johnson knew about sexual misconduct allegations against Chris Pincher, a Conservative lawmaker, before he promoted the man to a senior position turned out to be the last straw.\n\nLast week, Pincher resigned as deputy chief whip after complaints he groped two men at a private club. That triggered a series of reports about past allegations leveled against Pincher \u2013 and shifting explanations from the government about what Johnson knew when he tapped him for a senior job enforcing party discipline.\n\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid and Treasury chief Rishi Sunak resigned within minutes of each other Wednesday over the scandal. The two Cabinet heavyweights were responsible for tackling two of the biggest issues facing Britain \u2013 the cost-of-living crisis and COVID-19.\n\nJavid captured the mood of many lawmakers when he said Johnson\u2019s actions threaten to undermine the integrity of the Conservative Party and the British government.\n\n\u201cAt some point we have to conclude that enough is enough,\u201d he told fellow lawmakers Wednesday. \u201cI believe that point is now.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

Gbemisola Saraki, made this known at the 16th International Maritime Seminar for Judges, organised by the Nigerian Shippers Council NSC under the Auspices of Federal Ministry of Transportation in collaboration with the National Judicial Institute NJI on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nHighlights of the event was hinged on the importance of Nigerian ownership of shipping activities within the country in order to reap the full economic benefits of the maritime sector.\n\nRepresented by the Director of Procurement, Useni Adamu, Saraki emphasised the need for capacity building in the maritime industry.\n\n\u201cIt is a common knowledge that most of our maritime transportation is conducted by foreign shipowners, thereby limiting the economic benefits accruable to the nation and the sub-region in areas such as creation of jobs, freight and insurance earnings etc\u201d she noted.\n\nThe Minister explained that it is in the above regard that the development of a national fleet becomes imperative.\n\n\u201cThe present administration is looking into ways of encouraging the establishment of a private sector-driven national shipping line to ensure maximum exploitation of the potentials in our maritime industry.\n\n\u201cA Ministerial Committee has been working on this important initiative and I look forward to having their concrete recommendations for immediate implementation\u201d she stated.\n\nWhile welcoming Judges of Federal High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court, the Chief Judge of Sierra Leone and the Representatives of Supreme Court Judges from Ghana, Kenya and other West African countries, Saraki explained the need for continues engagement with the judiciary in ensuring smooth development of the maritime sector.\n\n\u201cMy Lords, the lacuna created by the low penetration level in Maritime Law at the undergraduate levels of our Universities, coupled with the fast pace of development in international trade, exerts a lot of strain on our judicial officers some of whom are confronted with this special area of the law for the first time when Admiralty matters are brought before their courts for adjudication.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore commendable that this seminar has created a veritable forum where prominent jurists and legal luminaries come together to rub minds on how to enhance the competitiveness and economic viability of our maritime industry, not only through the capacity building of the judicial officers, but indeed also in tackling some of the crucial issues on the front burner of maritime discourse both locally and globally.\n\n\u201cThis will no doubt increase the confidence of investors in the industry, since it is obvious that an efficient, lucid, predictable and stable legal system plays a very significant role in attracting investors\u201d the Minister noted.\n\nIn his Address, the Acting Chief Judge of Nigeria, Justice Olukayode Ariwoola said the seminar is designed among other things to acquaint participants with emerging trends in the sphere of Admiralty Law and the challenges that digitalisation and globalisation may throw up on the adjudication of admiralty matters.\n\n\u201cI can say without contradiction that Judges who have experienced and participated in this Seminar in the past, have become better equipped with knowledge of rudimentary maritime laws necessary in handling compicx maritime claims/cases\u201d.\n\nIn his vote of thanks,, the Executive Secretary of NSC, Hon. Emmanuel Jime said \u201cthe task of organizing and maintaining a high quality event like this, is understandably, not an easy one.\n\nIt requires enormous commitment, sacrifice, dedication and patriotic duty and responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore in this light that I want to thank the Chairman and members of the International Maritime Seminar for Judges Organizing Committee led by the Honourable, the Chief Justice of the Federal High Court, Honourable Justice John T. Tsoho for their untiring and priceless work done in putting all this together in spite of the unusual late start of the preparations. May the good Lord bless all of you and the work that you do\u201d added Jime.",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Economic Diversification: Value addition in solid minerals sector will spur industrialization- DG NSRMEA",
          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nDirector General, National Steel Raw Materials Exploration Agency, NSRMEA, Engr, Dr. Umar Albarka Hassan, has said that value addition in iron and steel production was not only for the purpose of revenue generation but will also spur industrialization and investment rates in the country.\n\nHassan during an interview session with journalist in Abuja on progress made in the steel and minerals sector noted that the country has established smelting companies that will produce in large sums steel metals that had exportable characteristics to the world and which investors have come to reckon with.\n\nSpeaking on the resuscitation of the Ajaokuta Steel Company located in Kogi State, he stated that, \u201d there is hope for the Ajaokuta Steel Company, not only for it but for others of which Ajaokuta is one of the many steel plants in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cFor Ajaokuta, it has perculiar challenges and we are aware of the MOU the government has signed for the development of the steel company this is not only for the blast furnace functions. Our key plan is not only for Ajaokuta. We also have these hub that produces iron ore for most of the private owned steel companies in the country that produces steel through scrap metal, that hub will help to reduce the amount of money expended in materials required to produce steel products.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the plant has still not come on steam. But the reason are pretty straight forward. Subsequent administrations simply failed to put in place some components required to make it functional. For instance logistics challenges. The blast furnace requires thousand tonnes of liquid steel for the first phase. Some of these materials like 1.3million tonnes of coking coal that needs to be imported annually for the 1.3million tonnes annual production of liquid steel require ships sailing to nearby ports.\u201d\n\nHe disclosed that the agency has been able to establish the production of manganese which will definitely step up the importation of that resources for the production of steel in Nigeria emphasising that, \u201cwe don\u2019t produce steel, we produce steel, we establish local sources to facilitate the local producers to boost their capacities to produce steel there by bridging those gaps.\n\nSo if we do that along with the processing of some local sources for our raw materials especially for iron ore, then we will improve the sector.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the role of the Agency in exploration and sourcing for raw materials for economic development, he explained that, \u201cas for my agency, our minerals resources are found and majored under iron and steel minerals. When you talk about steel production it is actually extracting iron ore and converting it into steel which is also value addition. And our mandate is to source for materials for iron and steel production and ofcourse adding value. When you talk about other minerals that are exploited example gold and other minerals we have established smelting companies to create value addition to such minerals.\n\nHe also revealed that some of our achievements of the agency in developing the nation\u2019s economy includes \u201cestablishing the gap of characterising our minerals resources, we explore, establish deposits but are they really suitable for use to produce iron and steel so that agency ensures this using our improve and confirmed laboratories to facilitate characterisation on these raw materials that we established.\n\n\u201cAnd currently these laboratories are apt and in good working conditions. We have the Scintrex( Fluxgate) Magnetometer for magnetic surveys, SARIS Resistivity Meter for Earth Resistivity Measurements, drilling rigs and support equipment and mineral separation equipment that will enable us produce and sample products that we can test their suitability. Similarly for the physical survey activities we have acquired equipment that would empower that department to enable them to establish locations and facilitate determination of real targets to minimize searching for actual locations of these resources.\u201d\n\nHe further stated that the role of the agency in sourcing for local sources of raw materials for example iron ore has fostered the development of the African Natural Resources Steel Plant in Kaduna State noting that, NSRMEA helped in the exploration of iron ore that was used to establish the company similarly for Ajaokuta Steel.\n\n\u201cBuilding upon the previous achievements of the agency, we have discovered and established iron ores in some areas where such had not been established, talking about the Raw Materials industry in Niger State, there is also the establishment of Bauxite in Ekiti State and similarly a very important local sources for Silica Sand resources that we established in five, 5, States of Katsina, batches found in Ogun, Ondo, Akwa Ibom. Also we have established Manganese resources located in Cross River and Kogi State we have also established and earmarked local sources deposits in Zamfara State,\u201d he added.\n\nContinuing on the achievements of the NSRMEA which has been in existence for the past 50 years since its establishment in 1971 with the discovery of iron ore deposits by the agency through the Nigerian Steel Development Authority, NSDA, which led to the creation of Ajaokuta Steel Company which is a major milestone, the Director General also said that the agency has discovered deposits of very necessary raw minerals resources that was required for the production of steel products in Nigeria adding that the essence of this local resources is to ensure that these raw materials were not imported.",

Ben Nwude, a former President of the Nigerian Society of Mining Engineers reviewed efforts made by the governments of 36 States of the federation and resolved that none was satisfactory.\n\nKadiri said state governments were not doing enough in the quest to jointly pursue the realisation of the Roadmap for Growth and Development of the Nigerian mining sector.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cNone of the 36 State governments satisfied the criteria for organisation ten most impactful mining sector entities of 2022. The absence of states in the list is a sad commentary that undermines the realisation of set goals for the sector, especially the economic diversification agenda.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman expressed concern that although the economic diversification agenda was repeatedly adopted by successive federal administrations in the country, \u201cthere is little to show for it as over 80 per cent of Nigerians were still poor despite the abounding multiplicity of solid mineral resources in the thirty-six of the federation.\n\nHe called on states to collaborate with the federal government to realise set goals, and quoted a World Bank poverty assessment report titled, \u201cA Better Future for All Nigerians: 2022 Nigeria Poverty Assessment,\u201d as saying that the number of poor Nigerians is increasing, and it is projected to hit 95.1milloin in 2022.\n\n\u201cThere are so many policies and campaign promises to develop the solid minerals sector but there is hardly equipment or financial support from state governments to indigenous mining operators, and there are too few state government-owned mineral development companies.\u201d\n\nKadiri added that state governments must make commitment to the development of the sector as some of them have accorded the agriculture sector.\n\nHe disclosed that the 10 entities earned the recognition for commitment to global best practices and for working against all odds to put the Nigerian mining sector on the world map and by providing information needed by prospective investors, and needed to support critical projects of government that are designed to facilitate economic diversification.\n\nHe therefore congratulated the entities that made the list and urged them to continue to contribute to the growth and development of the Mining and Mineral sector of Nigeria.",

This is complemented by the deployment of the Human Resource Module of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System, IPPIS, the Federal Civil Service Strategy Implementation Plan and the reinforcement of the Innovation Division in all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs.\n\n\u201cLEAD-P and SMART-P trainings have also been consistently carried out to realise this laudable vision of the HCSF.\n\n\u201cMMSD is among the first set of MDAs to receive these facilities and efforts are on to ensure that we blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation. We have achieved a major improvement in the ACTU rating from about 26.5% to 74.5% compliance and have also surpassed our revenue projections,\u201d Akinlade said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary disclosed that efforts had also been made within the ministry\u2019s limits of available resources to provide facilities that would enhance productivity and welfare of Staff, adding that in that regard, \u201cwe now have a clinic that can provide basic health services to all staff to ensure that our health is given the priority that it deserves\u201d.\n\nShe said many may be unaware that within the few months of operation of the clinic, health crises had been averted for some staff just through routine check by the medical team in the clinic.\n\n\u201cAlso, we can easily see the massive deployment of ICT infrastructures within office complex aimed at achieving the full automation of the work processes in the ministry,\u201d she added.\n\nCongratulating the members of management and staff of the ministry on week-long activities being commemorated, Akinlade craved their indulgence over the delay in the commemoration which was being held this week instead of last week that was officially set aside to mark the event, adding that it was due to exigencies of duty.\n\n\u201cSince 1999 when the African Union, AU, set aside 23rd June, as the \u201cAfrica Public Service Day, APSD, Nigeria has consistently\n\ncommemorated the day annually with series of activities and we are grateful to God for the opportunity to be part of this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cIn her characteristic style of celebrating civil servants, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation approved a full package of week-long activities for this year including Jumat and Church Services, Keep-fit/aerobics session, a Town-hall Meeting and Special Awards to selected officers for outstanding performance,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe told the workers that the occasion also affords the opportunity to specially acknowledge members of staff that have distinguished themselves through outstanding performance.\n\nSpeaking further, she said, \u201cAs usual, one person was nominated from each department out of which three were selected and forwarded to OHCSF. I want to therefore congratulate all the recipients of this year\u2019s award and appreciate them for their diligence.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly congratulate Engr.

          "title": "Economy Diversification: Why Nigeria\u2019s mining sector offers robust economic potential- Adegbite",
          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn efforts to boost the nation\u2019s economy through the mining sector, the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologist, NSEG has held its 1st international conference and exhibition in Abuja, with the theme: \u201cEconomic Diversification: The Role of the Geoscientist, Government and Private Sector\u201d, to brainstorm on the better ways to explore the sector.\n\nDeclaring the two- day event open, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite noted that as part of its effort to reposition the Solid Minerals Sector, the Ministry in early 2016, had identified insufficient geoscientific data, geological knowledge, weak\n\nimplementation and enforcement of mining law and regulations, and poorly regulated and informal artisans and small-scale mining sub-sector as critical binding constraints to the mining sector\u2019s development.\n\nAdegbite who was represented by the Director General, Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, MCO, Engr Simon Obadiah Nkom stated that this had propelled the Ministry to immediately begin the process of preparing a detailed sector Roadmap aimed at advancing certain strategic objectives, which would eventually result in the: creation of a globally competitive sector capable of contributing to wealth creation;\n\nprovision of jobs and advance social and human security by focusing on using its mining assets to drive domestic industrialization; and\n\nmigration to winning in global markets through a value chained-based growth plan.\n\nAccording to him, he considered the theme as strategic and timely, given the compelling\n\nurgency to diversify the economy for the prosperity of the nation adding that the\n\ntheme seeks to define the roles of the critical stakeholders in developing\n\nthe minerals sector, key amongst which were the government, private\n\nsector, and the professionals driving the mineral sector development\n\nprocess.\n\nHe said undeniably, Nigeria\u2019s Minerals sector offered a robust economic potential for diversification of the nation\u2019s economy yet the country and indeed, many other African Countries have continued to suffer under\n\nutilization of their mineral resources\n\nThis he reasoned has accounted for the slow phase of socio-economic\n\ndevelopment in Nigeria and many African countries noting that \u201cOur country is known\n\nto operate a mono economy where oil accounts for almost 90% of the foreign exchange earnings. This present administration found this appalling and described the situation as unacceptable and promised to urgently find solutions to redress the challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government through the Ministry of Mines and Steel\n\nDevelopment, MMSD, over, which I preside as the Honourable Minister\n\nplays the role of administrator and regulator of the mining industry\n\nactivities. Some of the key reform programmes include amongst others the\n\nothers the following: Formulation of a robust Policy/Legal/Regulatory/ Institutional frameworks and a Roadmap for the development, growth and good\n\ngovernance of the mineral sector development activities in line with global best practices.\n\n\u201cFacilitating the development of seven (7) Strategic Minerals including Gold, Barite, Coal, Lead/Zinc, Iron ore, Bitumen and Limestone as a matter of priority; generating geoscience data through the National Integrated Mineral\n\nExploration Project, NIMEP, for subsequent concession to\n\nprospective genuine investors. This is the first exploration project funded directly by the Federal Government in the history of Nigeria; upgrading of the mineral title administration and management system of MCO to standard online application processes.\n\nConcessioning of the delineated Bitumen blocks to prospective\n\ninvestors through transparent competitive bidding process, which is ongoing.\n\nThe minister asserted that the private sector on its part plays the role of owner and operator\n\nof commercial mining entities and businesses saying that this shows the high premium, which government places on the private sector in driving\n\neconomic development activities.\n\n\u201cThe geoscientist plays such an invaluable role, which cannot be\n\noverstated in driving mineral exploration activities leading to discoveries of minerals and preparation of definitive feasibility reports on the viability of mineral reserves. The works of the geoscientists produce the treasured\n\nmineral raw materials that form the backbone of modern-day industrial revolution\n\nHe also called on all geoscientists and\n\nstakeholders to support Government\u2019s policy and efforts in diversifying the\n\nnation economy using the mineral sector as one of the key drivers stating that \u201cthe\n\noutcome of such efforts will benefit all of us and the generation of Nigerians yet unborn,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reassured them of government\u2019s commitment in continuous support towards the growth and development of the minerals sector by generating geoscience data to de-risk and make it more attractive to genuine investors maintaining that \u201cGovernment will also continue to support Research and Development, R & D, endeavours tailored towards addressing real time mineral sector development challenges.\u201d\n\nEarlier, delivering his Welcome Address Director General, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, who also doubles as the President of the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologists, NSEG, Dr. Abdulrazaq Abubakar Garba, emphasized that the strategic objectives, professional targets and timelines set as enshrined in the constitution of the society needed to be pursued and met.\n\nGarba noted that the essenc of the conference was to discuss and brainstorm on the emerging challenges arising from the dynamic operating environment of its profession especially in the face of the new normal occasioned by the much-talked-about need to diversify the Nigerian economy away from its sole dependence on crude oil by focusing more on other areas including the solid mineral and agricultural sectors to boost the wealth of the Nation.\n\n\u201cEconomic geology can succinctly be defined as a subdiscipline of the geosciences that focuses on earth materials that can be used for economic or industrial development purposes. Often, much of the purpose of study is to identify new ore deposits for excavation as well as understanding how ore deposits are generated and localized within the Earth\u2019s crust.\n\n\u201cThe theme of this year\u2019s conference, was chosen to underscore our role in the diversification agenda of the Federal Government. Economic geologists play vital roles across the entire mineral value chain from exploration to mining; and even during the post-mining phase as the issues of environment and land reclamation for sustainable use are addressed. Additionally, economic geologists also have to interface with interested stakeholders in obtaining social and mining permit licenses to operate while at the same time provide investors with the prerequisites to raise capital for mineral exploration and mining. Economic geologists therefore provide veritable and robust linkages in the entire mineral development, utilization and environmental preservation chain and are therefore key to the Federal Government\u2019s economy diversification programme targeted at job and wealth creation.\n\n\u201cLet me emphasis that, investment in the minerals and mining sector by stakeholders is a patriotic duty of every citizen who believe in the Nigerian Project. In this respect, the role of governments, both at the national and sub-national levels, is to coordinate and ensure a responsible development of the country\u2019s natural resources. To this effect, necessary laws and regulations have been put in place by government, setting clear requirements that must be met by the industry operators. The economic diversification policy of government, which is anchored on shared and sustainable mining prosperity, emphasizes the need for cooperation of governments to unlock the full potentials of the minerals and metal sector. The Federal government is developing a well governed mining sector with sustainable capacity and has also articulated a roadmap to address some of the identified challenges in the mining sector. The initiatives and strategies outlined in the roadmap are designed largely to make the mining and minerals sector an irresistible destination for global capital.\n\nHe maintained that the success of the Ministry\u2019s National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP executed through the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA and other collaborating Agencies was mainly attributable to the role played by geoscientists from its conceptualization, design and execution.\n\n\u201cThe recent approval by the Federal Executive Council of a Scale of Fees for professionals in geosciences and mining is a testimony of government\u2019s resolve to stimulate the sector and ensure commensurate benefits to the professionals who are indeed the \u2018brain\u2019 and think tank of the sector.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the nation is witnessing a re-awakening in this sector, and the Government is not resting on its oars to grab the bull by the horn. Happily, the organized private sector such as the likes of Thor Exploration (Segilola Gold), Iron Ore/Aurelia, AG Vision, etc are now taking up the gauntlet,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe added that the economic geologist is unique with skills cutting across many of the specialists listed above.\n\nAlso the President of Nigeria Mining Geological Scientist, NMGS, Surv. Charles Alabo said that a lot has been done in providing the necessary framework and conducive environment for mining to play a pivotal role in this regard.\n\nAlabo also said that although Nigeria was committed to a system of free enterprise, Government should continue to play vital roles in the mining industry apart from its traditional regulatory functions.\n\n\u201cThe federal government also supplies some vital information necessary to stimulate and encourage investment for the optimum utilization of the huge mineral wealth of our country.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution gives the Federal Government control of all-natural resources, meaning that there is no private ownership of solid minerals in Nigeria. Though mining is within the purview of the Federal Government, sub national govemments can contribute to the growth and effective functioning of the mining sector by partnering with the federal government to ensure sustained economic growth, environmental protection, occupational safety and provision of infrastructure in host mining communities. In addition, developmental plans should take into cognizance the overall development aspirations of the State alongside the prospects and challenges of mining activities\n\n\u201cThe Mining sector to significantly contribute to Nigeria\u2019s economy cannot be over-emphasized. The Roadmap for the Growth & Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry highlights the potential for a progressive increase in the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP over the next decades. It is envisaged that this shift would translate to increased public and private sector investment, more employment creation for the citizenry and overall growth and financial stability for the economy International investor interest in the sector will continue to improve with the federal government also recognizing the sector as a potential prime income generator away from oil. However, so much more still needs to be done to tap the full potentials of the mining sector given the large mineral resources of the Nation,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe further stated that the NMGS will continue to support NSEG and indeed all the other Specialist Groups of the NMGS as they play their roles as drivers of the technical think tank of the society adding that \u201cWe shall continue to empower them to drive geosciences and mining innovations under the umbrella of our great Society. Key programs of relevance to the sector must be critically and more robustly assessed by qualified professionals in the mix of our national development. Economic geologists particularly have an obligation to future generations in providing safe and sustainable mineral exploration, exploitation and utilization programs while also ensuring minimal environmental impact. As professionals, we must therefore aim at providing sustainable geosciences and mining information for investors and policy makers including national representatives, federal and state agencies, industry, academia, and other stakeholders in the sector. Professionals in geosciences and mining should be poised to expand their roles and lead in finding sustainable solutions for modern socio-economic challenges through mineral resources development and innovative efforts.\n\n\u201cThe need for full integration of mining into national, regional, and continental development frameworks cannot be over emphasized as such integration would bring about accelerated development to national and sub national economies to ensure maximum benefits for our people.\u201d",

Debo Ologunagba, in a statement on Wednesday noted that the terrorist attack on President Buhari\u2019s convoy in his home State of Katsina as well as the \u201cferocious invasion and the freeing of hundreds of terrorists and criminals from the Kuje Correctional Facility further confirm that Mr. President has lost control of the security of the nation and that Nigerians are no longer safe under the APC\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: ISWAP Claims Responsibility For Kuje Prison Attack\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe escalated spate of terrorism across the country has heightened apprehensions of complicity by the APC to open up our nation to more terrorist attacks with the view to stall the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cThe failure of the APC administration to act on the intelligence provided by the Directorate of State Services (DSS) which on Tuesday July 5, 2022 reportedly warned of an impending attack on the Kuje Correctional Facility gives credence to fears by Nigerians of complicity at very high level of the APC administration.\n\n\u201cThis is in addition to further reports that soldiers deployed to the precinct of the Kuje Correctional Facility and who had become familiar with the terrain were redeployed 24 hours before the terrorists attacked\u201d.\n\nThe PDP through its spokesman demanded that the APC government should come clean on who ordered the reported redeployment of soldiers and who failed to act on the intelligence provided by the DSS.\n\n\u201cNigerians can recall the public confession by the Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai at the wake of the bloody Abuja-Kaduna terrorist attack that the APC-led administration knows the whereabouts and the plans of the terrorists ravaging our nation but deliberately refused to act.\n\n\u201cNigerians will also recall how APC leaders publicly romanced and paid money to terrorists.\n\n\u201cIt is rather distressing that President Buhari appears helpless without any decisive and concrete steps taken to stem the tide of terrorist attacks in our country.\n\n\u201cEven more curious is that President Buhari continues to retain Mr. Isa Pantami as Minister of Communication and Digital Economy to head and coordinate this very critical sector in the fight against terrorism in our country in spite of Isa Pantami\u2019s confession of affiliation to terrorists.\n\n\u201cWith the sequence of events in the last 48 hours, it is clear to Nigerians that the APC government headed by President Buhari has failed in the basic purpose of government which is to secure life and properties of the citizens,\u201d the PDP argued.\n\nThe party also stated that given the urgency of the security situation in the country, it has become imperative that President Buhari convenes an emergency Council of State meeting for a review of the prevailing dangerous security atmosphere in our country.\n\nThe PDP further called on the National Assembly to pass a vote of no confidence in Isa Patimi and insist on his immediate removal as a minister.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly should also immediately summon the Security Chiefs for a thorough investigation on the circumstances resulting in the failure of our security system,\u201d the opposition party demanded.\n\nThe PDP urged Nigerians to remain at alert and keep hopes alive, adding that the nightmare of the APC administration will be over by May 2023.",

          "text": "Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said attempts by the West to punish a nuclear power such as Russia for the war in Ukraine risked endangering humanity, as the near five-month conflict leaves cities in ruins and thousands homeless.\n\nRussia\u2019s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has triggered the most serious crisis in relations between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, when many people feared the world was on the brink of nuclear war.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden says Russian President Vladimir Putin is a war criminal and has led the West in arming Ukraine and imposing crippling sanctions on Russia.\n\n\u201cThe idea of punishing a country that has one of the largest nuclear potentials is absurd. And potentially poses a threat to the existence of humanity,\u201d Medvedev, now deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council, said on Telegram on Wednesday.\n\nRussia and the United States control about 90% of the world\u2019s nuclear warheads, with around 4,000 warheads each in their military stockpiles, according to the Federation of American Scientists.\n\nMedvedev cast the United States as an empire which had spilled blood across the world, citing the killing of Native Americans, U.S. nuclear attacks on Japan and a host of wars ranging from Vietnam to Afghanistan.\n\nAttempts to use courts or tribunals to investigate Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine would, Medvedev said, be futile and risk global devastation. Ukraine and its Western allies say Russian forces have engaged in war crimes.\n\nPutin launched his invasion, calling it a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d, to demilitarise Ukraine, root out what he said were dangerous nationalists and protect Russian speakers in that country.\n\nUkraine and its allies say Russia launched an imperial-style land grab, sparking the biggest conflict in Europe since World War Two.\n\nAfter failing to seize the capital Kyiv early, Russia is now waging a war of attrition for Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region, parts of which are controlled by Russian separatist proxies.\n\nOn Sunday, Putin claimed his biggest victory when Ukrainian forces withdrew from Luhansk province. Russian forces then launched an offensive to take neighbouring Donetsk province. Donetsk and Luhansk comprise the Donbas.\n\nRussia says it wants to wrest control of the eastern and heavily industrial region on behalf of Moscow-backed separatists in two self-proclaimed people\u2019s republics.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Ukrainian military said it had so far staved off any major Russian advance into the north of Donetsk, but pressure is intensifying with heavy shelling on the city of Sloviansk and nearby populated areas.\n\nIt said Russian forces were bombarding several Ukrainian towns with heavy weaponry to enable ground forces to advance southward into the region and close in on Sloviansk.\n\n\u201cThe enemy is trying to improve its tactical position\u2026(They) advanced \u2026 before being repulsed by our soldiers and retreating with losses,\u201d the Ukrainian military said in its evening note.\n\nOther Russian forces, it said, aimed to seize two towns en route to the city of Kramatorsk, south of Sloviansk, and were also trying to take control of the main highway linking Luhansk and Donetsk provinces.\n\n\u201cWe are holding back the enemy on the (Luhansk/Donetsk) border,\u201d Luhansk Governor Serhiy Gaidai told Ukrainian TV. Later, he said Luhansk was still not entirely occupied by Russian forces and that Russia had sustained \u201ccolossal losses.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will continue to try to advance on Sloviansk and Bakhmut. There is no doubt about that,\u201d he said.\n\nSloviansk Mayor Vadym Lyakh told a video briefing the city had been shelled for the last two weeks.\n\n\u201cThe situation is tense,\u201d he said, adding that 17 residents had been killed there since Feb. 24.\n\nRussia\u2019s defence ministry says it does not target civilians and on Wednesday said it was using high-precision weapons to take out military threats.\n\nUkraine has repeatedly pleaded with the West to send more weapons to repel the invasion that has killed thousands, displaced millions, and flattened cities.\n\n\u201cAt last, Western artillery has started to work powerfully, the weapons we are getting from our partners. And their accuracy is exactly what is needed,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said In his nightly video message.\n\nIn the Donetsk city of Kramatorsk, which Russian forces are expected to try to capture in coming weeks, Ukrainian soldiers and a handful of civilians ran errands in green-painted cars and vans on Wednesday. Much of the population has left.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost deserted. It\u2019s spooky,\u201d said Oleksandr, a 64-year-old retired metal worker. He was unlikely to follow official advice to evacuate, he said, despite an increase in missile strikes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking for death but if I encounter it it\u2019s better to be at home,\u201d he said.\n\nOutside the Donbas, Ukraine\u2019s second largest city Kharkiv was being subjected to \u201cconstant\u201d longer-range Russian shelling, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said on Ukrainian TV.\n\n\u201cRussia is trying to demoralise Kharkiv but it won\u2019t get anywhere,\u201d he said. Ukrainian defenders pushed Russian armoured forces well back from Kharkiv early in the war, and Terekhov said around 1 million residents remained there.\n\nSouth of Kharkiv, the governor of Dnipropetrovsk said the region had been battered by missiles and shelling, while on the southern coast the port of Mykolaiv was also being heavily shelled, Oleksandr Senkevych, its mayor, told a briefing.\n\n\u201cThere are no safe areas in Mykolaiv,\u201d he said. \u201cI am telling the people\u2026 that they need to leave.\u201d\n\nReuters was unable to immediately verify battlefield reports.",

          "text": "There was a massive security cordon around Abuja, following the attack on Kuje Correctional Center by fighters of Boko Haram, who stormed the prison and freed 150 terrorists, as well ass 450 inmates detained at the medium security prison, which also houses high profile inmates such as governors and senators.\n\nFollowing fears that the insurgents were still lurking in the shadows and might launch another attack in the city, security forces were deployed to beef up troops at the entry points of the city as well as the entry and exit points of Kuje Area Council.\n\nThe Federal Capital Territory Authorities (FCTA), had last week, issued a veiled red alert, directing all social, relaxation centers and recreational parks to close by 7pm daily till further notice.\n\nIt was further gathered that beyond troop deployment, massive patrols and surveillance activities were intensified by police and intelligence agencies even as a flurry of security meetings had commenced apace.\n\nThere was also controversy surrounding the whereabouts of suspended Deputy Commissioner of Police, Abba Kyari, after bandits attacked the facility, where he was kept.\n\nAn official, who preferred anonymity, said the whereabouts of Kyari remained unknown to him as of 09.30am on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe have not seen him today. He didn\u2019t also come for early morning prayer as usual. But I don\u2019t know what is happening. I am sure he is not missing and he didn\u2019t escape. But I don\u2019t know where exactly he is,\u201d he said.\n\nSpokesperson of the Nigerian Correctional Service, Umar Abubakar, also said, \u201cKyari is not missing\u201d and was not moved from the Kuje prison.\n\n\u201cHe is still in our custody. Nothing happened to him. He has not been moved,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS), said the armed squad of the service in collaboration with other security agencies responded to the attack.\n\nThe statement titled: \u201cMedium Security Custodial Centre, Kuje attacked by gunmen\u201d, stated that, the armed squad of the the service responded to the attack.\n\n\u201cI wish to confirm that at about 2200hrs, some yet-to-be-identified gunmen attacked the Medium Security Custodial Centre, Kuje, in the Federal Capital Territory.\n\n\u201cHowever, men of the Armed Squad of the Nigerian Correctional Service and other security agencies attached to the Custodial Centre have responded and calm has been restored to the facility and the situation is under control. Other details will be made available soon,\u201d it said.\n\nAbout 300 terrorists launched a violent attack on Kuje Correctional Center, deploying bombs, Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) and General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMG).\n\nSix inmates and one security personnel were killed during the attack.\n\nThe Minister of Defence, Maj.Gen Bashir Magashi (rtd), said of the 994 inmates at the prison, 600 escaped.\n\nMinister of the Federal Capital Territory, Mohammed Bello, and the Commissioner of Police, Mr Sunday Babaji, were at the scene of the attack to inspect damaged facilities in the aftermath of the attack.\n\nPrison officials said at the end of the attack after a roll call was taken at 2am Wednesday, only 111 inmates were left.\n\nThe situation has also forced the relocation of other other high profile detainees.\n\nThe insurgents had attacked through the back of the prison and planted bombs around the facility.\n\nThe minister, who said the situation was under control, confirmed that Boko Haram inmates had all escaped.\n\n\u201cThe attack started around 10:30pm. They came in their numbers, gained entrance into the prison and they released some of the inmates and which we are now following to see the kind of inmates that they have released.\n\n\u201cVery soon, we will give you the correct figure of the inmates that were taken. Aside that, we are trying to see what we can do to ensure that all escapees are returned.\n\n\u201cThe prison is accommodating about 994 inmates and over 600 escaped. Many people have been recaptured and brought back to the prison. Maybe by the close of the day, more will have been captured and returned.\n\n\u201cI think everything is under control. The people who came to do this activity, from the records, we believe they belong to a particular group. Most likely, they are Boko Haram members, because we have sizeable number of Boko Haram suspects in detention, and presently, we cannot locate any of them. I think they are about 64 in the prison and none of them now is available; they have all escaped,\u201d the minister said.\n\nA statement issued by the minister\u2019s office, said, Magashi, who was received and conducted round the damaged facility by the Permanent Secretary Ministry of Interior, Belgore, described the organised crime as unfortunate.\n\n\u201cThe Defence Minister, who had to delay his flying time to Owerri, Imo State, to attend the Nigerian Army Day Celebration (NADCEL), was also briefed extensively by the Controller General of the Nigerian Correctional Service, Haliru Nababa, as well as other heads of military and para-military agencies on hand at the location.\n\n\u201cThis was with a view to conducting a post-attack analysis and to forestall a re-currence of the dastardly act by the gunmen believed to be terrorists,\u201d the statement stated.\n\nFielding questions from journalists, the minister, however, appreciated the timely repelling of the attack by the gallant security operatives, who were drafted in on reinforcement to contain the attackers.\n\nHe reassured Nigerians that President Buhari would be briefed and also gave an assurance that the jailbreakers could not go unapprehended and would definitely face the wrath of the law.\n\nThe defence minister disclosed that further briefing on the incident that led to the attack would be received, adding that one life was lost on the side of the proactive repellants security forces.\n\nThe minister also tasked the Gomo of Kuje, Haruna Tanko Jibrin to summon all traditional chiefs in Kuje Area Council to combine intelligence with security agencies to apprehend all inmates, who escaped from the correctional facility.\n\nHe called on members of the communities to provide appropriate intelligence to the security agencies to enable them do their work.\n\nHe added that such incidents constituted a threat to everybody, hence the need for everyone to support the security agencies in carrying out their assignments.\n\nPrison officials said over 150 terrorists were freed that night.\n\n\u201cAll the major, biggest terrorists, armed robbers and kidnappers have escaped. No reinforcement came two hours after attack. Nobody came for assistance. Kuje correctional center completely taken over and all criminals and terrorists have escaped,\u201d an official, who spoke anonymously, said.\n\nAtiku Worries over Implications of Escapees on Abuja, Environs\n\nPresidential candidate of the PDP in 2023, Atiku Abubakar, on Wednesday, expressed shock over the Kuje Prison break, stating that it has great security implications for people living in Abuja and environs.\n\nHe also consoled the federal government over the death of the immediate past secretary general of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Sanusi Mohammad Barkindo.\n\nIn series of tweets, the former vice-president, said, \u201cI am concerned and saddened by reports of the attack on Kuje Prison by suspected terrorists.\n\n\u201cMy concern arises not only from the prospects of the escape of detained terrorists and hardened criminals but of its implications for the security of lives and property to residents of Abuja and its environs.\n\n\u201cI wish to restate what I said to THISDAY Newspapers on Monday that our inability to enthrone a regime of law and order in which the arrest and prosecution of criminals will be made a priority as a deterrent to copycats is the reason why insecurity continues to fester in our country,\u201d Atiku stated.\n\nOn the death of the immediate past Secretary General of OPEC, Atiku said, \u201cInna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji\u2019un. I am saddened by the passing away of the Wali of Adamawa, Secretary-General of OPEC, and former GMD NNPC, Dr Muhammad Sanusi Barkindo. Barkindo left indelible marks in his service to our nation and OPEC. He was indeed a worthy ambassador of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHe died in active service, having delivered a speech at the ongoing Nigerian Oil and Gas Conference in Abuja and held a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari hours before passing. He was my very good friend, and he will be sorely missed.\n\n\u201cMy condolences to his family and friends, management and staff of NNPC and OPEC. I pray that Allah forgives his sins and grants him Aljannah Firdaus. Ameen,\u201d he stated.",

          "title": "Buhari Visits Kuje Prison, Queries Intelligence, Response as ISWAP Claims Responsibility for Attack",
          "text": "Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari, on Wednesday, visited the Kuje Medium Security Custodial Centre, Abuja, which was attacked Tuesday night by scores of armed terrorists, and queried the intelligence gathering system of the authorities at the centre.\n\nThe president, who spent 30 minutes to assess the extent of damage at the Correctional Centre, however, wondered why prison defences failed to work and immediately requested for a comprehensive report on the incident.\n\nMeanwhile notorious terrorist group, the Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP), has claimed responsibility for the violent attack on Kuje Prison in Abuja.\n\nBuhari, who, like most Nigerians, was shocked by both the scale and audacity of the attack asked: \u201cHow did the defences at the prison fail to prevent the attack? How many inmates were in the facility? How many of them can you account for? How many personnel did you have on duty? How many of them were armed? Were there guards on the watchtower? What did they do? Does the CCTV work?\u201d\n\nAfter inspecting some of the points impacted by the attack, the president spoke to newsmen, during which he expressed disappointment with the intelligence system (and utilisation).\n\n\u201cI am disappointed with the intelligence system. How can terrorists organise, have weapons, attack a security installation and get away with it?\u201d he queried.\n\nAccompanied by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, and his Chief of Staff, Prof Ibrahim Gambari, the President, said at the end of the visit that he was expecting \u201ca comprehensive report\u201d on the incident.\n\nEarlier upon arrival, Buhari was briefed on the attack by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Interior, Dr. Shuaib Mohammad Lamido Belgore, and the Controller General of Nigerian Correctional Service, Haliru Nababa, showing him the bombed-out section used to access first, and the records office, which was set on fire, adding that the invaders thereafter launched an attack on all cells in which Boko Haram terrorists were held.\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief was told that at the end of the attack, none of the 63 terrorists were accounted for, but it was emphasised that records were not lost, because they had been backed up.\n\nBuhari was also informed that the security forces had recaptured 350 of the escapees while about 450 others were still unaccounted for, and that rapid work was under way to recapture the rest.\n\nThis, nonetheless, the presidency has said government would not be deterred from performing its official duties for the citizenry, despite the activities of terrorists in some parts of the country.\n\nThe Special Adviser on media and publicity to the President, Femi Adesina, made this known while responding to insinuation that President Buhari ought to shelve his journey to Dakar, Senegal to attend the International Development Association (IDA) for Africa Summit scheduled to hold today.\n\nCritics had contended that cancelling the trip would allow the president to attend to pressing security issues, following the twin attacks on his advance convoy in Katsina and on Kuje Correctional Centre.\n\nAdesina, who anchored the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting\u2019s briefing by ministers, disagreed with the notion, saying, \u201cThe president should go (to Senegal), because there\u2019s an international conference meant for heads of states and presidents; he should attend.\n\n\u201cYou should never give in to terrorists. The moment terrorists begin to stop you from doing things, then, we might as well throw up our hands in surrender. The President should go ahead. Yes, it\u2019s an international obligation.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier release, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, had hinted that, the President would leave for Dakar to attend the IDA summit and return Thursday.\n\nIDA, an institution of the World Bank Group, he said, was deepening its support to drive a resilient recovery for countries hit by the global crises of climate and COVID -19, growing levels of insecurity and more recently, by the impact of the war in Ukraine through its historic $93 billion 20th replenishment cycle (IDA20) which goes into effect between July 1, 2022 and June 30, 2025.\n\nISWAP Claims Responsibility for Kuje Attack\n\nThe Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP), a notorious terrorist organization, has claimed responsibility for the attack on the Kuje facility, Abuja.\n\nIn a footage Wednesday night, the terrorist sect showed some of its men shooting their way into the facility, as tens of fighters were seen marching in groups while vehicles and buildings were on fire in the 38 seconds video.\n\nAn elderly man dressed in a native attire also joined the young men, who were shouting on top of their voices\n\nThe Islamic State\u2019s A\u2019maq Agency released the video with the caption, although in Arabic: \u201cFighters of Islamic State attacked Kuje prison in Abuja, yesterday, and succeeded in freeing dozens of prisoners.\u201d\n\nAttack on Buhari\u2019s Convoy Daring, Says Akeredolu\n\nOndo State Governor, Mr Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN), yesterday, condemned Tuesday\u2019s attack on President Buhari\u2019s convoy by bandits in Kastina State, describing it as daring.\n\nThis is as the governor said, the call for State Police was not for self-aggrandizement but a reality of the time.\n\nAkeredolu spoke in Akure while playing host to his former school mates at Loyola College Ibadan (1968/1972) set, where he lamented the security situation in the country, adding that, it had gone from bad to worse.\n\nHe noted that the country\u2019s security challenges had gone beyond Fulani herdsmen to the menace of bandits and ISWAP.\n\n\u201cWe, governors in the Southwest met and we are still more than convinced that there is no solution other than state police. The truth is that, we will be prepared to protect ourselves and die in the process more than other people from outside. We can only protect ourselves better.\n\n\u201cWe will be more committed to protecting ourselves. By the time we have State Police, we will be encouraged to recruit people in a local government to work in that local government as security.\n\n\u201cFor me, state police is not for self-aggrandizement; it is a reality of the time. For us in the South and even in the North, I know so many of them that have come to accept that a single command of Police is not good for this country. This country is too big.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to make our voice heard everywhere. We are almost there. We are licking our wounds here over the June 5 attack in Owo. It is a serious wound. We will never forget. We are putting together a memorial in a conspicuous place in Owo,\u201d governor Akeredolu said.\n\nEarlier, the Acting President of the Loyola College Old Boys\u2019 Association (1968/1972) set, Mr Ayodele Adigun condemned the June 5 attack in Owo, while expressing shock that such heinous crime could be carried out in the Southwest.\n\nHe said the attack was particularly aimed at tarnishing the image of the governor and rubbish his efforts so far, especially, on the security of lives and property of the people.\n\nNSCDC Promises to Compensate Family of Dead Officer\n\nCommandant-General, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Dr. Ahmed Audi, has promised compensation to the family of its staffer lost in the attack on Kuje Minimum Custodial Centre.\n\nSpeaking during a visit to the Centre, in company with the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Interior, Dr Shauibu Belgore, Inspector General of Police, Controller General of Corrections Service, Comptroller General of the Federal Fire Service, representative of the Comptroller of Nigeria Immigration Service and Director Special Duties in the Ministry of Interior, Dr Funsho Alabi, Audi assured the family of the deceased, Inspector Ilyasu Abraham, that they would be reached out to and necessary compensation delivered in due time.\n\nThe Corps helmsman sympathised with the family of the deceased, who was deployed by the Federal Capital Territory command of the NSCDC to the custodial centre on guard duty but unfortunately paid the supreme price during the attack.\n\nThe CG commiserated with his immediate family and prayed God to grant them the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss, adding that Ilyasu was a gallant officer, who fought a good fight and died in active service defending the land.\n\nHe urged citizens to keep calm as NSCDC in collaboration with other security agencies were working tirelessly to ensuring the safety of lives and protection of Critical National Assets and Infrastructure.\n\nThe CG, however, said adequate measures would be put in place to avoid such reoccurrence across the country.\n\nKachikwu Urges Buhari to Resign over Worsening Insecurity\n\nPresidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Dumebi Kachikwu, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari, to resign amid worsening insecurity in the country.\n\nKachikwu, in a statement, said the attack on the convoy of the President on its way to Daura, Katsina State and simultaneous attack on Kuje Correctional Centre, were clear signs that the country is now faced with a grave security threat.\n\nHe wondered who then is safe if the President\u2019s convoy could be attacked as well as the Kuje Prison, which is just a few kilometers to the seat of power.\n\nHe insisted that the twin deadly attacks have once again exposed the nation\u2019s weak security architecture, which Buhari has failed to strengthen.\n\n\u201cThe events of the last 24 hours, have once again exposed the weak underbelly of our nation\u2019s security architecture. Some members of the President\u2019s advance team were slain while the Kuje prison in our nation\u2019s capital was attacked and scores of prisoners released by terrorists.\n\n\u201cThis is indeed another low moment in a series of low moments under the Buhari administration. I sympathise with the families of those killed in the line of duty. I once again call on President Buhari to do the honourable thing and resign since he can no longer secure the Nigerian people.\n\n\u201cNigerians are paying a huge price for his inept leadership. If the terrorists are now bold enough to attack the President\u2019s convoy and a heavily guarded prison just a few kilometres away from the Aso Villa, who then is safe in Buhari\u2019s Nigeria?\u201d Kachikwu asked.\n\nDeji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Kingsley Nwezeh, Olawale Ajimotokan, Michael Olugbode in Abuja, James Sowole in Abeokuta and Fidelis David in Akure",
