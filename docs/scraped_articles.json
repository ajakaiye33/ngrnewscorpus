          "text": "An 11-year-old girl on Tuesday told the Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Court, Ikeja, Lagos State, how she was allegedly raped and impregnated by a 39-year-old car wash operator, Ezekiel Udoh.\n\nPUNCH Metro learnt that the incident occurred in the FESTAC Town area of the state in 2020.\n\nThe police prosecutor, Z.A. Dindi, led the minor in evidence.\n\nNarrating her ordeal to the court, the victim said Udoh took advantage of her twice.\n\nOn the first occasion, she said the defendant sent her on an errand and directed her to take the item into his room, where he raped her.\n\nShe said, \u201cHe (Udoh) sent me to buy something for him and when I returned, he told me to take it upstairs. When I took it there, he came and told me to take it inside his room and he slept with me for the first time. He said if I told anyone, he would kill me.\n\n\u201cWhen he slept with me the second time, I saw blood coming out of my private parts. I did not know I was pregnant. My grandma asked why I was getting fat and I said I did not know.\u201d\n\nThe victim, who is now 13-year-old, gave birth to a baby boy, who is currently one-year-and-five-month-old.\n\nHer grandmother, who told the court that the minor had been living with her since she was two years old, said she initially did not know that her granddaughter was raped.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe first day I saw a trace of blood, I thought it was menstruation. I said, \u2018At 11, you have started menstruation, yours is fast.\u2019\n\n\u201cI just noticed she was becoming fat. Not until one day that my sister came and told me if I didn\u2019t notice her. She said it seemed she was pregnant. Then we took her for a medical check-up and they told us she was five-month pregnant.\n\n\u201cWe asked her and she said it\u2019s a brother at the car wash. She also did not know his name. We went there to ask him if he knew her and he asked us if she was pregnant.\u201d\n\nThe case was adjourned till September 29, 2022, for further trial.",

          "text": "Director, Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu\n\nBy Wole Mosadomi, Chinedu Adonu & Ibrahim Wuyo, Minna\n\nTerrorists, yesterday, attacked a mining firm located in Ajata-Aboki in Gurmana Ward of Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State, killing 20 military personnel, seven mobile policemen and scores of civilians.\n\nMany other security operatives and civilians were also said to have sustained injuries and were rushed to medical centres.\n\nConfirming the attack, the Nigerian Army, in a statement by its Director, Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, said some bandits were also gunned down during the attack.\n\n\u201cSadly, a number of personnel paid the supreme price in the fierce firefight that ensued.\n\n\u201cSubsequently, the location has been reinforced and troops are on the trail of the criminals with some already neutralised.\n\n\u201cThe GOC 1 Division has moved to the location to take charge of the follow up operations\u201d, the statement added.\n\nRead Also: Boko Haram, bandits are different from IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu\u2014 El-Rufai\n\nThe Niger killings came as two policemen were, yesterday, killed by gunmen at a checkpoint in Enugu.\n\nThis is even as the people of Birnin-Gwari in Kaduna State appeared to have heeded the directive of Zamfara State governor, Bello Mattawale, on Nigerians to defend themselves against bandits and terrorists, as they now confront those terrorising their communities.\n\nAmong those abducted in the Niger attack are said to be four Chinese nationals working in the mining site.\n\nThere are, however, conflicting figure in the number of casualties given by sources in the affected communities .\n\nVanguard reliably gathered that the terrorists, whose number could not be immediately ascertained, stormed Ajata-Aboki village at about 4pm on Wednesday and made straight to the mining site, shooting sporadically to register their presence and scare the workers.\n\nThe terrorists were said to have been armed with sophisticated weapons, including AK-47 assault rifles.\n\nCo-convener, Concerned Shiroro Youths, Niger State, Sani Abubakar Yusuf Kokki, who confirmed the attack, said seven mobile policemen attached to the firm were gunned down with six other civilians workers in the firm.\n\nKokki said: \u201cThe terrorists gruesomely murdered seven mobile policemen attached to the firm and six other civilians working in the firm. They also succeeded in kidnapping some Chinese nationals and several others who are currently being held hostage.\u201d\n\nKokki stated that the military stationed at Erena town, near the attacked firm, rushed to the scene on a rescue mission during which there was exchange of fire between the terrorists and the soldiers.\n\nSeveral soldiers killed\n\nHe said: \u201cOn getting wind of the ugly development, the Nigerian Army stationed at a nearby Erena town swung into action by engaging them fire-for-fire during which six officers were gunned down and many others wounded.\n\n\u201cAs I am talking to you this morning (yesterday), the death toll has risen astronomically because over 30 soldiers have been discovered in the bush and confirmed dead.\u201d\n\nThe state Commissioner for Internal Security and Humanitarian Affairs, Emmanuel Umar, who also confirmed the attack, however, said the exact number of casualties from both sides were yet to be ascertained.\n\nHe said: \u201cA yet-to-be ascertained number of workers in the mining site, including four Chinese nationals, were reported to have been abducted but I cannot confirm the exact number of casualties and those abducted now.\n\nGov Bello orders security to rescue victims alive\n\nThe state governor, Abubakar Sani Bello, has also directed the security agencies to go all out to ensure the safe return of the kidnapped victims and ensure that none of the terrorists escaped.\n\nWhen Vanguard visited the IBB Specialist Hospital where the corpses were deposited, it was learnt that over 20 corpses of the casualties had been deposited at the morgue.\n\nOne of the doctors who preferred anonymity, confirmed that 20 corpses had been deposited there.\n\n\u201cThere can be conflicting figures on the casualties but I can confirm to you that no fewer than 20 corpses of the security personnel have been deposited in the morgue here,\u201d the doctor declared.\n\nSome military personnel who sustained injuries, are also said to be on admission at IBB Specialized Hospital as some wards in the hospital were cordoned off by some security operatives, an indication of their admission.\n\nGunmen attack police checkpoint in Enugu, kill two officers\n\nIn Enugu, gunmen in the early hours of yesterday, attacked a police checkpoint and shot dead two police operatives.\n\nIt was gathered that the gunmen overpowered the policemen who mounted a checkpoint at the popular MTD junction at Akwuke, Garriki area of the state capital.\n\nEfforts to get police confirmation proved abortive, as the state Police Public Relations Officer, Daniel Ndukwe, did not respond to calls put across by our reporter.\n\nWe\u2019ve started defending ourselves in Birnin-Gwari \u2014 Community leader\n\nMeanwhile, disturbed by the activities of bandits in Birnin-Gwari emirate of Kaduna State, a community leader in the emirate and former Managing Director of Kaduna State Media Corporation, Zubairu Abdulra\u2019uf, said yesterday that his people were already responding to the call by Zamfara State governor, Bello Mattawale, on Nigerians to defend themselves against bandits and terrorists.\n\nIt would be recalled that Birnin-Gwari communities have, over time , been taken over by bandits who imposed all sorts of levies on the people.\n\nThe bandits also recently banned political activities in the communities, while forcibly recruiting youths in the areas in their fold.\n\nAbdulrra\u2019uf said the incessant attacks on his people had completely paralysed economic activities in their rural communities and made travelling in the area difficult or even impossible in some places.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have reached the point of no return. People are being pushed to the wall. Just yesterday (Wednesday), the people of Randagi confronted these bandits who tried to overrun their communities. Randegi is one of the areas the bandits have their routes through Zamfara to Niger State.\n\n\u201cThe people of Randagi, which is a farming community, succeeded in dislodging the bandits. So, I think our people are now ready, if the government cannot perform its constitutional function.\u201d\n\nThe former broadcaster with DW Radio, said the bandits had for over two years, imposed tax on the Birnin-Gwari farmers, stressing that N200 million was paid to bandits in Randegi district alone.\n\nVanguard News",

It said another 38, including six children and a pregnant woman, were hospitalized with injuries. Most of the victims were in the apartment building, Ukrainian emergency officials said.\n\nThe airstrikes followed the pullout of Russian forces from Snake Island on Thursday, a move that was expected to potentially ease the threat to nearby Odesa, home to Ukraine\u2019s biggest port. The island sits along a busy shipping lane.\n\nRussia took control of it in the opening days of the war in the apparent hope of using it as a staging ground for an assault on Odesa.\n\nThe Kremlin portrayed the departure of Russian troops from Snake Island as a \u201cgoodwill gesture\u201d intended to facilitate shipments of grain and other agricultural products to Africa, the Middle East and other parts of the world.\n\nUkraine\u2019s military claimed a barrage of its artillery and missiles forced the Russians to flee in two small speedboats. The exact number of withdrawing troops was not disclosed.\n\nThe island took on significance early in the war as a symbol of Ukraine\u2019s resistance to the Russian invasion. Ukrainian troops there reportedly received a demand from a Russian warship to surrender or be bombed.

With a population of over 200 million mainly young men and women, Nigeria is a natural and attractive hub for foreign investment and one-stop market access to over 50 countries.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Nigerian leader welcomed the Business Forum organized during the visit and the signing of many Memoranda of Understanding between the two countries\u2019 investment promotion agencies and chambers of commerce.\n\nHe described the signing of the agreements \u2018\u2018as excellent foundations for increased bilateral trade.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari also commended his Portuguese counterpart for extending his country\u2019s engagement with Africa and African issues beyond Lusophone countries.\n\n\u2018\u2018In that context, I wish to remind us that in addition to giving our former capital, Lagos, its name, the Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive in what later became Nigeria, even before the British.\n\n\u2018\u2018During that time, the Benin Kingdom had diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Portugal. The bodyguards of the Oba of Benin were sent from Portugal.\n\n\u2018\u2018Today, there are streets in some states in Nigeria that still bear Portuguese names. This shows a strong bond that has endured a long time between our two countries,\u2019\u2019 Buhari said.",

          "title": "Buhari in Portugal: A prophet has no honour only in his country, by Femi Adesina The Nation Newspaper",
          "text": "When Jesus was on earth, people from different walks of life embraced his message, got saved, healed, delivered from demon possession. But most of his fellow Jews took everything with a pinch of salt. They considered him one of themselves, and therefore said he lacked authority to preach to them.\n\nJesus then said: \u201cOnly in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own household is a prophet without honour.\u201d (Mark Chapter 6, verse 4).\n\nNow, I know the twisters and contortionists very well. They will go to town after reading this piece, with headlines like \u2018Adesina compares Buhari with Jesus.\u2019 \u2018PMB is like Jesus, says Adesina.\u2019 Mischief makers, who don\u2019t understand biblical allusion. Good luck to them.\n\nWhat am I saying? The Buhari some people abuse, deride, and excoriate at home has been standing ramrod straight in Lisbon, Portugal, this week, paying an official visit to that country, guest of President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa. He has attended Economic Seminar between Nigeria and Portugal, visited the Portuguese Parliament, and got conferred with the highest National Honour, Grand Collar of the Order of Prince Henry.\n\nBefore heading back home, President Buhari will also be presented with keys to the City of Lisbon, making him an exalted citizen of the domain.\n\nAnd that is the Buhari some people call names at home. People who don\u2019t have the slightest achievements to their names, people who are both anonymous and miscellaneous, completely undistinguished. They wash their mouths on a man who has ruled the country twice, both as military and democratically elected leader. Let some of those critics run for councilor. Zero votes.\n\nThe Grand Collar of the Order of Prince Henry is a Portuguese order of knighthood created in June, 1960, to commemorate the quincentenary of the death of the Portuguese explorer, Prince Henry the Navigator, one of the main initiators of the Age of Discovery. The Award is reserved for Portuguese heads of state, and some distinguished foreign recipients. President Buhari is now one of such, and the first Nigerian leader to be so honored.\n\nFlashback to September 2019, at the 74th edition of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, United States of America.\n\nI was with President Buhari when he received President de Sousa at a bilateral meeting, and the latter invited him to visit Portugal. He had said: \u201cPlease come, even if it\u2019s for half a day. It would be a great honor to have you, and we have been waiting for you to visit for three years. Many African leaders have come, but we want Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe visit was envisaged for 2020, but then COVID-19 struck, and it became impossible for about two years. Now, \u2018come has come to become,\u2019 and President Buhari is visiting in a blaze of glory. Nigeria\u2019s flag is fluttering proudly in the European skyline, thanks to the Mai Gaskiya, the honest man, man of integrity, widely respected across the globe.\n\nI\u2019ve seen President Buhari decorated with National Awards across continents, completely unsolicited. And the man remains ever self-effacing, without a single bone of arrogance in his body. Don\u2019t you love to follow a man like this? I sure do.\n\nPresident Buhari\u2019s footprints will be indelible on the sands of time. His strides in infrastructure, agriculture, social investment, and many others will remain evergreen. Security is a thorny issue. I pray he cracks it in the remaining 11 months. As for revisionists, who try to ensure that the administration would be remembered for only massive insecurity that has plagued the land, they will never win. Buhari\u2019s place in history is secure already. Good and honest Nigerians will always remember him for his positive strides, and the world will not forget him either.\n\nIn Spain about four weeks ago, one of the diplomats we had lunch together had said at our table that President Buhari was a man of high integrity, who they respect highly in the West. This has been proven again in Portugal. Grand Collar of the Order of Prince Henry. So, again, let\u2019s \u2018buga\u2019 for Mr President, \u2018go-low-low-low buga won.\u2019\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity",

          "text": "Gunmen went on a killing spree in different parts of the country yesterday, leaving many deaths in their trail.\n\nThe bodies of 30 soldiers were allegedly evacuated following a terrorist attack on Ajata-Aboki Mining Site in Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State.\n\nThe military confirmed the killing of a number of its personnel, but did not give the figure.\n\nIn a statement last night, the Director, Army Public Relations, Brig.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, said the troops were ambushed by the terrorists, while responding to a distress call from a village that was under attack.\n\nSeven riot policemen and two civilians were confirmed killed in the attack.\n\nFour Chinese workers were abducted, but the number of abducted workers remained unknown.\n\nIn Enugu State, two policemen were feared killed by gunmen who attacked a checkpoint in the Garki area of the state capital.\n\nAlso yesterday, the police in Rivers State confirmed that an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Chris Josiah, was killed by five gunmen in Oyigbo Local Government Area.\n\nBandits continued to hold sway in Kaduna State.\n\nA community leader in Birnin-Gwari, Alhaji Zubairu Idris Abdulra\u2019uf, lamented that farming communities in the council paid over N300 million as taxes to terrorists in two years.\n\nBloody day in Niger\n\nThe Niger killings occurred at the mining site in Ajata-Aboki in Gurmana Ward of Shiroro Local Government.\n\nSpokesperson of the Coalition of Shiroro Associations, Salis Sabo, said the bodies of 30 soldiers were recovered.\n\nThe Nigerian Army said that \u201ca number of personnel paid the supreme price when troops ran into an ambush in Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State\u201d.\n\nThe riot policemen were attached to the site to provide security for the expatriate workers.\n\nMany sustained gunshot injuries during the attack in which four Chinese nationals were abducted.\n\nThe terrorists, armed with sophisticated weapons, were said to have invaded the mining site, shooting at everyone in sight.\n\nThe Niger State Commissioner for Internal Security and Humanitarian Affairs, Emmanuel Umar, confirmed the abduction of four Chinese nationals.\n\nHe said a joint security team was mobilised to the scene in response to a distress call.\n\n\u201cThe joint security team engaged the terrorists and they were yet to determine the number of casualties from both sides.\n\n\u201cHowever, a yet to be ascertained number of workers in the mining site, including four Chinese nationals were reported to have been abducted.\n\n\u201cSecurity forces were reinforced for the manhunt of the remaining terrorists as some of them were neutralised and rescue of the injured victims, including security personnel,\u201d he said.\n\nThe commissioner said those injured had been evacuated to government hospitals.\n\nGovernor Abubakar Sani Bello ordered a manhunt for the terrorists.\n\nCondemning the attack, he said: \u201cThis is really disturbing, especially as the state has been relatively peaceful with only pockets of attacks being recorded as compared to some time past.\n\n\u201cIt really saddened my heart to hear about this. It is even more worrisome to know that the lives of security personnel were involved and expatriates were also among those kidnapped.\u201d\n\nThe governor commiserated with heads of the security agencies that are part of the joint operatives in the state for the loss of their personnel.\n\nHe sympathised with the families of slain security agents, assuring them that the sacrifices of their loved ones will not go in vain.\n\nBello commended the bravery of those who engaged the terrorists in a gunfight.\n\nHe appealed to the security personnel not to be discouraged but to remain committed to discharging their duties and ensuring the safe return of the four Chinese nationals and the abducted persons.\n\nThe governor prayed for the safe return of those kidnapped.\n\nGunmen attack\n\npolicemen in Enugu\n\nAt least two policemen were killed in the Enugu attack.\n\nIt was learnt that there was a heavy shooting at the popular MTD junction in Akwuke as the operatives engaged the gunmen in a shootout.\n\nThe attack occurred at about 10.30am, forcing motorists to take refuge in the Gariki Park.\n\nThe state police command said its operatives were on the trail of the hoodlums.\n\nThe spokesman, Daniel Ndukwe, said the operatives were on stop-and-search when they were attacked.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere was an attack on policemen on stop and search duty this morning along Agbani Road, close to Enugu/Port-Harcourt Expressway, by yet-to-be identified hoodlums.\n\n\u201cHowever, details of the incident are still sketchy, while Command\u2019s Tactical/Operational Operatives have been mobilised and are on the trail of the miscreants.\u201d\n\nThe statement was silent on the number of casualties.\n\nHowever, sources in the area said that at least two policemen were feared killed during the attack.\n\n\u2018How five gunmen killed our officer\u2019\n\nThe Rivers police command, in a statement by its spokesman, Grace Iringe Koko, said five masked gunmen shot dead the victim along Assemblies of God Church, Obeama Community, Oyigbo.\n\nShe said Josiah was killed in his Sports Utility Vehicle while returning from work on Tuesday.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe Commissioner of Police has ordered a massive deployment of personnel across Oyigbo Local Government Area of Rivers State to fish out criminal elements and perpetrators of violent crimes against the good people of the area.\n\n\u201cThis is coming on the heels of the gruesome murder of an Assistant Superintendent of Police, Chris Josiah, attached to Afam Divisional Police Headquarters in the evening of 28th June 2022, while returning home after work.\n\n\u201cThe deceased officer was ambushed by five yet-to-be-identified armed masked men, who opened fire at the Officer along the Assemblies of God Church, Obeama Community, Oyigbo, and shot him dead inside his Lexus RX 300 SUV.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police has equally ordered a full-scale investigation into the incident with a view to unraveling the remote and immediate cause of the attack and bringing the perpetrators to justice.\n\n\u201cHe strictly warns that further attacks on police pfficers tasked with the protection of lives and property will not be tolerated by the Police authority.\u201d\n\nBandits rule in Kaduna\n\nAlhaji Abdulra\u2019uf, who was Managing Director of the Kaduna State Media Corporation (KSMC), lamented the rule by bandits in his Kaduna community.\n\nHe said the community has paid over N300 million taxes to bandits in two years.\n\nHe told reporters that the incessant attacks on his people had paralysed economic activities and made traveling in the area so difficult or even impossible in some places.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have reached the point of no return. People are being pushed to the wall.\n\n\u201cRandegi is one of the areas where these bandits have their routes through Zamfara State to Niger State.\n\n\u201cYesterday (Wednesday), the people of Randegi confronted these bandits who tried to overrun the farming community and they succeeded in dislodging them.\n\n\u201cSo, I think our people are now ready if the government cannot perform its constitutional function.\u201d\n\nThe community leader, a former broadcaster with DW Radio, said the bandits have for over two years, imposed taxes on the Birnin-Gwari farmers.\n\nHe said: \u201cYes, N200 million was paid to bandits in Randegi District alone.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk of Birnin-Gwari Local Government as a whole, it is between N300 million to N400 million paid to these bandits.\n\n\u201cThere are three stages of paying taxes to these bandits.\n\n\u201cYou have to pay pre-season and mid-season when the crops are about to start yielding, otherwise, you won\u2019t have access to your farm.\n\n\u201cThen, at the end of the season when you are harvesting, you will give these bandits money before you access your farm.\n\n\u201cAnd when you access your farm after paying these taxes, they will now tell you that apart from giving them money, you will give a ratio of two bags of every 10 bags of all the assorted grains you harvest.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cFor the past three years, this is what Birnin-Gwari people have been enduring and we are now in a state of hopelessness and frustration.\n\n\u201cWhen people are frustrated, they will look for the best option for themselves, which is to arm themselves if the government cannot protect them.\n\n\u201cWe are living in a situation where people can no longer work or even travel one kilometre from Birnin-Gwari town to other areas and it is the same thing that we have in all the districts in Birnin Gwari.\n\n\u201cIf something is not done, we are going to have food crisis.\n\n\u201cBirnin-Gwari Gwari used to produce at least 700 metric tonnes of assorted grains but now people cannot access their farms.\n\n\u201cThere are many cases, since the beginning of this rainy season, that people are being abducted on their way to the farm and even the cattle they use for farming are being collected from them.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, had during the presentation of the 2021 security report confirmed that bandits were taxing farmers in parts of Birnin-Gwari, Giwa, Igabi and Chikun local government areas to grant them access to their farms.\n\nStory By\n\nJustina Asishana, Minna; Damian Duruiheoma, Enugu; Mike Odiegwu, Port Harcourt and AbdulGafar Alabelewe, Kaduna",

So, we see good things coming.\u201d\n\nThe Executive Secretary however, lamented the activities of fraudsters as a major challenge PTAD was facing, saying, \u201cWe have a situation where some people call our pensioners and tell them that you have to bring some amount of money for them to process their pension. PTAD does not collect money from anybody for pension processing.\u201d\n\nShe listed other challenges to include inherited arrears to be liquidated in the parastatals, accommodation, as well as problems associated with the Next-of-Kin payment, which according to her, has to go through a rigorous process and validation in order to make sure that the money goes to the right person.\n\nEjikeme assured that PTAD was working hard and committed towards addressing all the identified challenges.\n\nSpeaking earlier, Director Pensioner Support Services Department, Mrs. Nneka Obiamalu called on pensioners to always channel their complaints to any of their platforms and offices for immediate solution.\n\nShe made a presentation on how PTAD was transforming pension administration from the ugly past to serve their needs.",

          "text": "*Appreciates Portugal for regional security support\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has disclosed that his administration has made it a top priority to tackle the issue of insecurity in Nigeria, the West African subregion and the Sahel.\n\nSpeaking Thursday at a State Dinner in National Palace Ajuda, Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, the President said this would not have been possible without the regional as well as global partners of Nigeria.\n\nAccording to him: \u2018\u2018The Boko Haram insurgency in the North-eastern part of Nigeria is being tackled through the efforts of government, as well as the Multinational Joint Task Force (MJTF) of member countries\u201d.\n\nPresident Buhari also appreciated Portugal for the deployment of weapons and training of military personnel in ensuring peace in the sub-region.\n\nHe commended President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa for deploying troops for peacekeeping in the Central African Republic, monitoring political developments and providing assistance to some countries in Africa, including Equatorial Guinea, Cape Verde and Mozambique.\n\nPresident Buhari at the dinner attended by the President of the Portuguese National Assembly, Augusto Santos Silva, and Prime Minister Antonio Costa, expressed optimism that his State Visit would further strengthen the goodwill and collaboration between the two countries.\n\nHe noted that the establishment of a Joint Commission, which is one of the main priorities of the visit, would further promote the full realisation of the objectives of bilateral relations, achieving concrete, specific and viable projects and programmes for the benefit of citizens of the two countries.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2018Today, Portugal imports about 60 percent of its gas from Nigeria which makes it our second-largest market in Europe.\n\n\u2018\u2018There is still more that can be achieved between the two countries, especially with the current Russia-Ukraine war which has disrupted steady gas supplies to Europe.\n\n\u2018\u2018Furthermore, Nigeria wants to see trade diversified to non-oil products such as agriculture, power projects, renewable energy and pharmaceuticals where a lot could be achieved\u201d.\n\nThe President emphasized the need to revive the Bilateral Air Services Agreement (BASA) and finalize all pending bilateral agreements so as to boost economic activities and movement of people between the two countries.\n\nPresident Buhari described Nigeria as one of the most attractive destinations for investment in Africa, adding that his Government is prioritizing building a business-friendly environment.\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigeria is part of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AFCFTA) \u2013 the largest free trade area in the world. With a population of over 200 million mainly young men and women, Nigeria is a natural and attractive hub for foreign investment and one-stop market access to over 50 countries.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Nigerian leader welcomed the Business Forum organized during the visit and the signing of many Memoranda of Understanding between the two countries\u2019 investment promotion agencies and chambers of commerce.\n\nHe described the signing of the agreements \u2018\u2018as excellent foundations for increased bilateral trade.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari also commended his Portuguese counterpart for extending his country\u2019s engagement with Africa and African issues beyond Lusophone countries.\n\n\u2018\u2018In that context, I wish to remind us that in addition to giving our former capital, Lagos, its name, the Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive in what later became Nigeria, even before the British.\n\n\u2018\u2018During that time, the Benin Kingdom had diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Portugal. The bodyguards of the Oba of Benin were sent from Portugal.\n\n\u2018\u2018Today, there are streets in some states in Nigeria that still bear Portuguese names. This shows a strong bond that has endured a long time between our two countries,\u2019\u2019 the President said.",

Faith sees. Faith has her eyes opened and possesses the evidence upon which it builds its belief. Faith prepares long, sometimes for years just as Joseph did for the years of famine. Faith counts the cost before embarking,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWithout having real evidence upon which you are acting nor preparation for the task, recognising real obstacles that lie ahead and making concrete plans, one is just being delusional about the outcome. The enthusiasm of the youth must not be wasted on poorly planned projects.\n\n\u201cNoah spent months/years planning for the flood & he was operating in faith. Jesus said no man goes to battle without taking stock first nor lays the foundation of a tower without counting the cost first lest he will be mocked. Our faith is intelligent it doesn\u2019t live in denial.\u201d\n\nAlthough the clergyman did not mention any name, the tweets were seen as an attack on the youth movement of Obi, sparking a backlash and fierce criticism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Twitter user, @spotlight_abby wrote: \u201cPastor Poju Oyemade thought that by throwing in FAITH, WORKS & PLAN into that tweet, he could bamboozle us?

This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise.

Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s constitutional court has ruled against Khumbudzo Ntshavheni\u2019s decision to switch off analogue broadcast systems by June 30, 2022, declaring it unconstitutional. Ntshavheni \u2013 who serves as the country\u2019s who is the current Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies \u2013 wants South Africa country to migrate to digital broadcast systems.\n\nThis follows an appeal by e.tv and two other applicants, Media Monitoring Africa (MMA) and SOS Support Public Broadcasting, who sought to overturn a judgment and order of the High Court of South Africa that had ruled in favour of the minister and government earlier this year.\n\nIn 2006, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), of which South Africa is a member, resolved that all member states in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East should migrate from analogue broadcasting systems to digital broadcasting systems by the year 2015.\n\nCurrently, in South Africa, traditional analogue broadcast systems are occupying the frequency bands between 700 MHz and 800 MHz which could be used for mobile data. Digital migration would free up those bands, making the provision of mobile data services cheaper.\n\nTo comply with the ITU resolution, in September 2008, the then minister of communications and digital technologies in South Africa, Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, published a Broadcasting Digital Migration Policy (BDM Policy) which stated that the analogue switch-off would be on November 1, 2011, 4 years earlier than the ITU\u2019s proposed deadline.\n\nIn February 2021, South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, announced that the phased switch-off of analogue transmitters would be completed by the end of March 2022.\n\nOn October 5, 2021, the minister made a final call for those qualifying for state-sponsored set-top boxes (STBs) to register, with the deadline for registration set for October 31, 2021. STBs would enable households to continue having access to television channels on their analogue television sets after the analogue switch-off.\n\nAfter this announcement, e.tv brought an application to the High Court against minister Ntshavheni, seeking to prevent the minister from disconnecting millions of people who had not yet migrated to digital transmission.\n\nIn the court order, the applicants wanted the minister to, among other requests, consult all affected parties before determining the analogue switch-off date as well as provide a report on the steps taken to ensure access to STBs within 1 month of the date of the court order.\n\nIn its judgement on March 28, the court had accepted that out of over 14 million television sets in South Africa, 10.5 million were compliant with digital transmission and 3.75 million were analogue.\n\nThe High Court held that 3 months would be sufficient to allow the minister to complete the outstanding installation of STBs in households with analogue television sets.\n\nIn the final ruling, the High Court dismissed the application from e.tv, MMA and SOS but extended the analogue switch-off date to June 30, 2022.\n\nFollowing the ruling by the High Court, e.tv, MMA and SOS appealed the matter against the minister in the Constitutional Court arguing that the Minister had a duty to consult the public, including the applicants, before imposing the STB registration cut-off date and determining the analogue switch-off date.\n\nIn a unanimous judgment, the Constitutional Court ruled that the power to determine the analogue switch-off date and the registration deadline for STBs is located within the minister\u2019s original constitutional policymaking function. The court thereafter had to determine whether the minister exercised this power rationally and lawfully.\n\nIn that respect, the Constitutional Court held that it was not only irrational but also unlawful for the minister to set a switch-off date without adequate notice to the analogue broadcast providers and the public.\n\nAs to the remedy, the Court held that the decisions of the minister, as well as the order of the High Court, had to be set aside.\n\nThe judgement will further delay South Africa\u2019s migration into digital broadcasting, meaning that services like mobile data which could do with the freed-up space on the frequency spectrum as a result of digital migration will continue to be expensive, further hurting citizens\u2019 pockets.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Nigerian airlines have seen their insurance costs surge above what their peers in Ghana, South Africa and other African countries pay to insure their aircraft.\n\nOperators told BusinessDay that the perception of Nigeria as a high-risk environment and the high insurance premiums demanded by local insurance firms had pushed up the cost of insuring their aircraft.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s investigations show that while Nigerian airlines pay between 8 percent and 10 percent of the value of an aircraft to insure it, airlines operating in Ghana, South Africa and other African countries pay 2-3 percent.\n\nAirlines operating in Europe and the United States pay between 0.5 percent and one percent to insure the same aircraft.\n\nFor instance, airlines operating in Nigeria pay an average of $1 million annually to insure a B737-300 aircraft while airlines in Ghana or US pay between $200,000 and $300,000 to insure the same aircraft type.\n\nThe scarcity of foreign exchange in Nigeria has continued to worsen the situation for airlines as they have to pay for insurance in foreign currencies.\n\nThe National Insurance Commission had spearheaded the enactment of a law that no airline can insure any aircraft registered in Nigeria except it goes through a local insurance firm in Nigeria. This law has made it difficult for airlines to source for affordable alternatives outside the country.\n\nRead also: EXPLAINER: What passengers could gain from Nigerian airlines\u2019 new alliance\n\nIn addition to this, the inability of all Nigerian insurance companies to put together to insure a single brand new aircraft in the country made them to reinsure with foreign insurance companies, thereby increasing airlines\u2019 insurance costs.\n\nMost African airlines, including Nigeria, insure their aircraft through local insurance firms, which then reinsure with Allianz, a German firm or the Lloyd\u2019s of London, an insurance and reinsurance market located in London.\n\nAllen Onyema, chairman of Air Peace, Nigeria\u2019s largest carrier, said what it cost Nigerian airlines to insure just one aircraft is what it cost airlines outside Nigeria to insure over three aircraft.\n\nOnyema, who cited the perception of Nigeria as a high-risk environment, as a reason for high insurance premiums, said: \u201cAll insurance firms put together do not have the capacity to insure a new aircraft in Nigeria; yet airlines are forced to insure their aircraft in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nObiukwu Mbanuzuo, chief commercial officer at Green Africa, told BusinessDay that insurance premiums vary from airline to airline.\n\nHe said: \u201cI know an airline in Nigeria that pays $1 million annually for insurance of a B737-300 aircraft while for a UK or US airline, it would probably not cost more than $100,000-$200,000.\n\n\u201cThe perception of risk in Nigeria started when the number of crashes was high but has remained the same even with low rates of aircraft crashes and incidents because our infrastructure is still substandard. Runways still lack proper landing aids or runway lights, navigation aids break down frequently and sometimes radio communications are unreliable.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ibrahim Mshelia, owner of West Link Airlines Nigeria and Mish Aviation Flying School, Nigerian insurance companies have continued to raise insurance premiums higher than the global standards.\n\n\u201cSo many people think that insurance premiums are high in Nigeria because of the country\u2019s risks but this is not true,\u201d Mshelia said.\n\nHe said the criteria insurance companies use to assess risk factors include ratings by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), experience of airlines\u2019 personnel, personnel training, facilities where aircraft maintenance are carried out and the frequency in the number of claims made by the airlines.\n\nAccording to Mshelia, Nigeria meets all these criteria as airlines carry out maintenance as and when due, train personnel as required by the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority, and the country has Category 1 rating, and the country\u2019s risk factor remains low.\n\nHe, however, faulted the law that says no airline can insure any aircraft registered in Nigeria except they go through local insurance firms in Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey decided to become very expensive. All the insurance companies in Nigeria cannot insure a single brand new aircraft in Nigeria. So, they reinsure with foreign insurance companies. They become middlemen and get so greedy and they raise insurance to 1o percent or more of the value of the aircraft.\n\n\u201cAbroad, some countries charge 0.5 to one percent. I was operating a non-Nigerian registered airplane that cost $6.5 million. Despite the fact that I insured it with a third-party liability to enable me to fly into Europe, I was paying about $67,000 as insurance premium a year. If I was to pay an insurance company in Nigeria, I will pay $650,000 a year. They will charge me between five and 10 percent. From this, they will pay the insurance broker less than $65,000 and they will keep the remaining money.\u201d\n\nBut Ajibola Dalley, an aviation lawyer and senior advocate of Nigeria, said even though Nigeria meets all ICAO requirements, there are still some perceived risks in the country that drive up the insurance premiums.\n\nHe said: \u201cInsurance companies will look at the environment. I think when you look at the factors that determine payment of premiums, over the past years, you have to look at the maintenance culture, companies and individuals involved in running of airlines, the support system and environment of aviation in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPrior to the year 2006, when the Civil Aviation Act came into force, we didn\u2019t have a good record on air accidents. Before 2006, planes were falling off the sky. We had the Sosoliso, Belview and Chachangi crashes, among others, and then Dana Air crash.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, these factors still determine the premiums that are charged and an insurance company will also look at the regulation.\n\nDalley said: \u201cWe have had a decent safety record since 2006. When you look at repayment on premiums and the responsibility of airlines, can you really blame an insurance company? Are the regulators doing a proper job on safety and security oversight? The risk of paying out is higher; so in order to insure you, they will increase their premiums, so that they know that they will recoup a considerable part of what is potentially a loss.\n\n\u201cHow many airlines survive in Nigeria? How many aircraft do they have? We have runways that have problems, no light at the airports and the security issues keep getting worse. These factors raise premiums for airlines.\u201d",
          "summary": "Nigerian airlines have seen their insurance costs surge above what their peers in Ghana, South Africa and other African countries pay to insure their aircraft.\nBusinessDay\u2019s investigations show that while Nigerian airlines pay between 8 percent and 10 percent of the value of an aircraft to insure it, airlines operating in Ghana, South Africa and other African countries pay 2-3 percent.\nRead also: EXPLAINER: What passengers could gain from Nigerian airlines\u2019 new allianceIn addition to this, the inability of all Nigerian insurance companies to put together to insure a single brand new aircraft in the country made them to reinsure with foreign insurance companies, thereby increasing airlines\u2019 insurance costs.\nMost African airlines, including Nigeria, insure their aircraft through local insurance firms, which then reinsure with Allianz, a German firm or the Lloyd\u2019s of London, an insurance and reinsurance market located in London.\nAllen Onyema, chairman of Air Peace, Nigeria\u2019s largest carrier, said what it cost Nigerian airlines to insure just one aircraft is what it cost airlines outside Nigeria to insure over three aircraft.",

          "text": "\u201cSince May 14, I have been waiting for the \u00a34,000 I requested from the bank to pay for the deposit I must make at the British university where I intend to pursue my master\u2019s degree,\u201d a young Nigerian who identified herself simply as Veronica told BusinessDay.\n\nShe said the deposit is needed for her to be able to get a confirmation of acceptance for studies (CAS), and my course is slated to start in September.\n\n\u201cWithout the CAS, I would not be able to apply for a visa, and visa application these days takes up to five weeks,\u201d she added.\n\nBusinessDay learnt that it is difficult for Nigerian students studying or seeking to study abroad to access the funds they need to fulfill their academic obligations because of foreign exchange (FX) shortage in the country.\n\nLast week, there were comments on Twitter that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) wanted to restrict international students from using Form A to pay for their tuition from their bank accounts.\n\nForm A is an application form designed by the CBN to pay for service transactions. The form allows customers to purchase funds at the CBN or interbank rate to make payments for eligible services as predetermined by the foreign exchange manual.\n\nOn Twitter, an email purportedly written to a Nigerian student at the University of Hull in the UK said: \u201cFrom 2023, the requirement to use Form A when transferring your money from your bank account to the university is no longer needed.\n\nThe change has occurred following a decision by the Central Bank of Nigeria which has resulted in the Form A scheme being eliminated.\n\n\u201cPayers that plan to leverage the Form A scheme over the coming weeks should prepare to do so in advance to ensure sufficient time to meet their financial commitments.\u201d\n\nRead also: PSBs: Experts highlight opportunities for Banks in Nigeria\n\nHowever, the CBN released a statement, saying it had not stopped the allocation and sale of foreign exchange for the purpose of paying school fees and medical bills overseas.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said in June that despite supportive oil prices, Nigeria\u2019s gross foreign exchange reserves fell to $38.6 billion at the end of May 2022 from $41.5 billion in September 2021.\n\n\u201cThe external reserves have been impacted by a lot of factors, which include pressure on importation of goods services, particularly petroleum, rigid foreign exchange fixed policy of the CBN, among others,\u201d Muda Yusuf, chief executive officer of Centre for Promotion of Private Enterprise, said.\n\nThe limited access to FX from CBN by commercial banks has led to these banks coming up with rules to manage FX spending.\n\nBanks require a month\u2019s notice for students to request FX. A recent email sent to customers by Access Bank said, \u201cDue to limited FX availability provided by the Central Bank of Nigeria, we require a 30-day period to fulfil requests for school fees, upkeep, and rent payment.\u201d\n\nThose who also require Personal Travel Allowance (PTA) and Business Travel Allowance (BTA) were instructed to submit their applications 14 days earlier to allow disbursement within the timeline.\n\nIn March, some banks reviewed the spending limit on their naira cards for international online and PoS transactions to $20 monthly, an 80 percent reduction from the previous limit of $100.\n\nStudents are not the only ones affected by the FX scarcity. Some foreign investors have been unable to access their funds. This has discouraged investors from investing, thereby limiting the inflows into the country.\n\nAccording to the Capital Importation report of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the total value of the foreign investment in the country declined by 28.1 percent to $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2022 from $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter of last year.\n\nThe World Bank, in its latest Nigeria Development Update report, said the country would not be able to attract the desired level of foreign investment if it fails to implement a single exchange rate regime and embrace the timely implementation of foreign exchange policy.\n\nThe multilateral lender said favourable external conditions such as high crude oil prices provide the country with the opportunity to implement a single exchange rate that is reflective of the market dynamics.",

          "title": "Low investment in technical workforce slows Nollywood\u2019s growth",
          "text": "\u2018Max Escapes the Mind Lair\u2019, a scene in the Netflix series \u2018Stranger Things\u2019, became the most talked-about in the series not only because of Kate Bush\u2019s \u2018Running Up That Hill\u2019, which became a global hit after the episode aired. It was also because of the visual effects of Max, the character trapped in a make-believe alternate dimension, running to meet with her friends in the real world, and it is the kind of story interpretation Nollywood film industry constantly starves its audiences because of the lack of adequate investment in technical workforce to create such scenes.\n\nNiyi Akinmolayan, a filmmaker and founder of Anthill Studios, speaking in a Twitter space early this week raised issues on building capacity in the Nollywood ecosystem in terms of the technical workforce.\n\nNollywood movies are mostly categorised under the drama genre and miss out on the bulk of revenue the action genre generates. Between 2018 and 2021, five out of the six Hollywood movies that made the top 10 in Nigeria\u2019s top box office list are of the superhero genre and in 2021, Nigerians spent a total of N2.3 billion on action movies with Hollywood accounting for 67 percent of those movies.\n\n\u201cWhat is missing in Nollywood is our ability to tell our stories in a way that is powerful, that it communicates something really great and creates genuine experiences for the audience and you can only do this by building a solid technical workforce,\u201d Akinmolayan said.\n\nRead also: Remakes of Nollywood classics breath life into $6.4bn industry\n\nAccording to him, if Nollywood doesn\u2019t have the right tools to complement the stories, the industry will be limited in the number of stories they can tell and it will not have that global reach that other industries boast of.\n\nThe Anthill Studio founder told the audience on the Twitter space that a lot of films are submitted to streaming platforms but are returned because of quality control issues.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons why we are largely under-priced is because of technical quality like lack of uniformity of pictures or bad audio,\u201d Akinmolayan said.\n\nThe lack of adequate expertise for the technical workforce to serve all studios and producers in the Nollywood ecosystem, according to him, stalls the growth of the industry.\n\nSome of the major issues he cited were the aspect of lack of good Automated Dialogue Replacement for sound, makeup for believable biopics, cinematography, and production design.\n\nLack of funding is also a factor slowing down the growth of the industry. Speaking with BusinessDay on the issue of funding in Nollywood, David Nnaji, a Nigerian filmmaker, actor, and writer, said that Nollywood is funded by private investors who are family or friends of the filmmakers.\n\nHe said a grant scheme to the industry by the previous government had not reached the potential it was set up for because the people that were put in charge of the funds had not done a creditable job.\n\nIn 2011, President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s government created a grant scheme for filmmakers called Project Act, which saw the movie sector receive a $200 million government loan that was meant to improve distribution and production. An additional $18.9 million was donated to the industry in 2013 and $1.26 million in 2017.\n\nIbinabo Fiberesima, former president of the Actors Guild of Nigeria, while speaking with newsmen, said the Project Act initiative benefitted 240 practitioners in skill enhancement training in the US, India, UK, South Africa, and Nigeria.\n\nHowever, Nnaji said the grants from the government were well-intentioned but were sabotaged by people he claimed to be a cartel in the industry. He said instead of the fund trickling down to young filmmakers who have ideas to create growth in the industry, the money seemed to only be going to this cartel.\n\nRead also: Nollywood battles internet pirates as streaming booms\n\nProffering solutions on that, Akinmolayan stressed the need to train many people on these technical aspects of filmmaking. \u201cPeople should have a diploma in the sound technical area of filmmaking.\u201d\n\nHe said most of the funds coming into the industry either from outside or from within the industry are only used to make films and not used to train people on the technical side that will grow the industry.\n\nNollywood experts, in recent times, have been calling for major capacity building in the industry. Rimini Makama at the Afro culture convention last year spoke on the need to strengthen capacity in the Nollywood ecosystem.\n\n\u201cAssociations like the American Business Council can partner with international organisations to establish training along with the US mission to bring in directors and film festivals that could lead to building capacity,\u201d Makama said.\n\nHe said that Nollywood can position itself to grow technical hands that the country can export and make good money from just the way the UK has done through Pinewood Studios, a place where filmmakers can shoot films using all kinds of locations, from old English mansions to underwater scenes.\n\nAkinmolayan spoke about the level of training in tertiary institutions, saying: \u201cFilmmakers don\u2019t hire students who graduate from the department of theatre arts because they don\u2019t possess the necessary skills to headline most films.\n\n\u201cA lot of schools have not upgraded, a lot of schools don\u2019t have a film curriculum, and you don\u2019t even need to have one. If you\u2019re not fully ready to invest in it, it can be part of what they are doing in theatre arts.\u201d\n\nHe also suggests that making the course a compulsory elective in schools and working with experienced professionals in that field will give future film editors the background knowledge of products and software.\n\nHe also called on private investors and streaming platforms that have branches in Nigeria to also invest in scaling the technical workforce.\n\n\u201cStreamers should invest in Nollywood by identifying potential partners like rental companies, post-production companies, costume companies, and training programs that can help scale their businesses,\u201d Akinmolayan said.",

          "text": "The Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund, managed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN),has guaranteed 1.232 million loans estimated to be worth N130.903 billion, given to farmers across the country.\n\nThe apex bank also challenged farmers to join hands in revitalising the country\u2019s $430 billion economy by enhancing value-addition and diversification.\n\nThese were the highlights of the national award ceremony for the 2021 Best Farmer of the Year Award under the ACGSF held on Thursday in Abuja.\n\nChairman, ACGSF, Mr Stephen Okon noted that, \u201cA total of 1,232,326 loans valued N130.903b were guaranteed from inception to May 2022 out of which 973,646 beneficiaries had repaid a total of N98.91b.\u201d\n\nAccording to Okon, the Federal Capital Territory had, from January to May 2022, guaranteed a total of 82 loans under the scheme, valued at N22.580m.\n\nThis, according to him, brought the total guaranteed loans in the FCT from inception of the scheme in 1978 to May 2022 to 14,258, valued N1.748 billion.\n\nIn terms of loan recovery, Okon said 11,726 loans valued N801.058m were repaid under the scheme in the FCT from inception, noting that the records showed a high level of commitment of the officers in the FCT as well as the determination of the farmers to utilise the opportunities offered by the scheme to empower themselves and improve their lots.\n\n\u201cWe do hope that before long, participants in the agricultural value chain in the FCT will take advantage of the opportunities provided in the Amended Act,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ACGSF was established by Decree No. 20 of 1977 and started operations in April, 1978. It was targeted at de-risking agricultural loans by providing guarantees to banks lending to the agricultural sector and encouraging lending to the agricultural sector to boost its contribution to output and incentivise good credit behaviour by obligors repaying conformably.\n\nOkon further said that the disbursement was part of the proactive measures to encourage people and cushion the impact of the global crises on the economy and support the agricultural sector.\n\n\u201cTruly, the Federal Government, through the ACGSF scheme as well as other development finance interventions of the CBN, has continued to promote the quest for the nation to attain food sufficiency,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe Abuja Branch Controller, CBN, Michael Onyeka Ogbu, said the ceremony was an expression of the apex bank\u2019s management\u2019s commitment to supporting hard work, innovation, and productivity in the agricultural value chain.\n\n\u201cTo this end, the CBN challenges Nigerian farmers to explore our various agricultural interventions aimed at enhancing value addition to their output towards attaining food self-sufficiency, provision of raw materials to our manufacturing industries and also for export, which ultimately assists in diversifying and improving the foreign exchange earnings base of our economy,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Former governor of Ekiti State Ayo Fayose has outlined why he thinks Nyesom Wike, governor of Rivers State, will never back Atiku Abubakar, the PDP candidate for president (PDP).\n\nAccording to Premium Times, Mr. Ayo Fayose declared that after President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s second term expires in 2023, leadership must be transferred to the southern region of Nigeria.\n\nIn addition, the former governor recalled how Mr. Atiku \u201cpromised\u201d to name Mr. Wike, the governor of Rivers State, as his running mate once he was named the winner of the PDP presidential primary contest.\n\nAccording to the former Ekiti governor, Mr. Atiku failed to fulfill his promise to Mr. Wike when he settled for the Delta State governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as his running mate.\n\n\u201cWike never said he wanted to be VP, but when Atiku visited him, he was the one who said, \u2018I want you to be my VP\u2019. He said that to Wike. If that then changes, is Wike not supposed to be told? Is he not supposed to know?\u201d\n\nHe recalled that Mr. Atiku had ignored the recommendation of a committee set up by the opposition party to pick his running mate.\n\n\u201cPDP set up a committee to recommend a running mate for the candidate and the committee voted and picked Wike, but they didn\u2019t comply with the recommendation of the committee.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the party is now a one-man show, we will show them that we can resist it. We are with Wike 100 percent.\n\n\u201cWhen they need Wike\u2019s money and Wike\u2019s support, they will say, \u2018Wike is good enough. Wike has been injured, but we will remain with him. Whatever he does is what we would do; wherever he asks us to go is where we will go.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what would happen should Mr. Wike ask them to support Mr. Atiku, the former governor said: \u201cWike will never say we should support Atiku.\n\n\u201cWike cannot come out to say he is supporting Atiku. I dare him to say so; because he knows that whatever he says will haunt him forever. If Wike supports Atiku, we will abandon him.\u201d\n\nAtiku\u2019s response\n\nContacted for a response, Paul Ibe, Mr. Atiku\u2019s spokesperson, said his principal and the party will continue to appeal to aggrieved persons within their fold to embrace dialogue.\n\n\u201cBecause the bigger challenge is winning the election, kicking out the APC, and stopping them from the many years of impoverishing our people,\u201d said Mr. Ibe.\n\n\u201cIt is normal for our people to be aggrieved but the PDP has a way of resolving issues like this and that will be done and we all shall be happy.\u201d\n\n\u2018Power to the south\u2019\n\nOn whether the plan is now to technically support the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Bola Tinubu, or his counterpart in the Labour Party, Peter Obi, Mr. Fayose said: \u201cThis is not about Bola Tinubu or Obi, but this is about our belief that power must come to the south and it is a struggle we must actualize.\n\nMr. Fayose further explained that \u201cwhen the June 12 election was canceled, the presidency was zoned to the southwest to pacify the southwest region.\n\n\u201cWhen former President Goodluck Jonathan was over staying, it was believed that he was already using the northern slot. So, he was opposed and a northern candidate was installed through the APC.\n\n\u201cThis time, it is the turn of the south because Buhari has spent eight years. Why will PDP be insisting that it must again be the turn of the north.\u201d\n\nMr. Fayose also stated that he does not care if his actions are perceived as anti-party activity.\n\n\u201c What I am saying is, it is the turn of the South, and if they want to expel me, to hell with them. I am not taking money from anyone to belong to this party.\n\n\u201cIf they want to rock this boat, we will help them to rock it.\u201d",

Abuse, calling names, hate and bigotry are no strategies. They hated and abused PMB since 2015 and now they have transferred the aggression to Asiwaju. We wait and see.\u201d\n\nWike has remained silent since losing out in the power play that led to the emergence of the vice-presidential ticket of the PDP which led to the emergence of Delta state Governor Ifeanyi Okowa.\n\nSome PDP governors, including Samuel Ortom of Benie state, were absent at the inauguration of the Osun state PDP campaign council.\n\nIn fact, Ortom was reported to have said Wike deserved to be picked as running mate to the PDP presidential candidate, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar.\n\nGovernor Okowa emerged Atiku\u2019s running mate after a committee had recommended Wike.\n\nThe development is coming in the wake of Tinubu\u2019s statement on Sunday that he was still searching for his running mate for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nNorth-west APC seeks running mate\n\nMeanwhile, the race for Tinubu\u2019s running mate continues with the Northwest zonal leaders of the APC expressing their readiness to engage Tinubu over the position.\n\nThe zone, however, boasted that it is the highest political region with votes for the ruling party in 2015 and 2019 respectively.\n\nNorth-west region comprises of Kano, Kaduna, Zamfara, Sokoto, Kebbi, Jigawa and Kastina states.\n\nIn a communique released after its consultative meeting Thursday in Abuja and signed by APC zonal chairman (North-west) Salihu Moh Lukman, the party said APC governors, governorship candidates and ministers from the states of the zone were in attendance.\n\n\u201cThe meeting welcomed the initiative to commence this consultative meeting as vital for strengthening the APC in the North-West and improve leadership engagements and cohesion within the zone.\n\n\u201cParticipants received the zonal report from the National Vice Chairman (North-West) and reviewed the state of the party at the national level and within the zone. The zonal meeting welcomed the successful conclusion of primaries at the state and national levels. Participants acknowledged the challenges facing some state chapters of the party and resolved to promote efforts at reconciliation as an urgent priority.\n\n\u201cThe meeting noted the contribution of the North-West to the emergence and growth of the APC and its electoral viability, with the North-West providing about 39% of the votes the APC recorded in the 2019 and 2015 presidential elections. Therefore, the zone resolved to aggregate its interests and vital concerns and engage accordingly with the presidential candidate of the party,\u201d they said.\n\nThe statement, however, said the participants requested the zonal chairman to ensure stakeholders of the zone meet regularly.\n\n\u201cParticipants requested the National Vice-Chairman (North-West) to ensure that the consultative meeting is sustained as a vital tool for cohesion within the party.\u201d\n\n\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

Consequently, credible feedback from the locals around Kofar Danya disclosed that over Eighty Two (82) of the terrorists suffered heavy casualties as many of them were neutralized while other sustained various degree of injuries,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaking further on operations in the South-South Zone, Onyeuko said the military recovered stolen crude, 68 wooden boats and 9 speed boats amongst other equipment from economic saboteurs.\n\n\u201cA total of three million and seventy-four thousand (3,074,000) litres of Automotive Gas Oil, three million eight hundred and then thousand (3,810,000) litres of crude oil, fourteen thousand (14,000) litres of Premium Motor Spirit and Fourteen Thousand (14,000) litres of Dual Purpose Kerosine was discovered,\u201d he said.\n\nBandits kill attack Niger mining site\n\nAnd in a related development, terrorists reportedly killed 30 people including security personnel and villagers at the Ajata-Aboki mining site in Gurmana ward of Shiroro local government area of Niger state.\n\nThe terrorists were said to have invaded the mining site Wednesday evening during which several people were also abducted.\n\nCo-convener Concerned Shiroro Youths of Niger state Sani Abubakar Yusuf Kokki said this in a statement Thursday in Minna.\n\nHe said the casualties included mobile police men, soldiers and villagers working in the mining company.\n\nKokki said many others also sustained various degrees of multiple bullet injuries and taken to various medical facilities for treatment.\n\nKokki also said scores of the bandits were also neutralised as security personnel fought back to repel the attack.\n\n\u201cOn getting the wind of the ugly development, the Nigerian Army stationed at a nearby Erena swung into action by engaging them in fire for fire. Unfortunately and sadly, as at yesterday, officers were gunned down while many others have been wounded through multiple gunshots,\u201d the statement added.\n\nTop army officers as victims\n\nAt the IBB Specialist Hospital Minna, some of those who spoke to Blueprint said over 40 bodies were deposited at the morgue.\n\nAn eyewitness said \u201cthe bodies of the slain persons were mostly soldiers brought in this morning at about 11am with a truck.\u201d\n\nHe said the military personnel have been pouring in more retrieved bodies of their dead colleagues at intervals till 5pm, Thursday.\n\nIt was learnt that a Colonel of the Nigerian Army was among those wounded and on admission at the hospital, while a Major and Captain were among the gallant officers who lost their lives.\n\nHowever, a medical doctor who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 20 bodies were at the morgue with five wounded soldiers receiving treatment at the emergency ward.\n\nGov directs manhunt\n\nConfirming the development, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello directed a manhunt for the remaining terrorists who attacked the mining site.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the governor condemned the attacks, assuring the terrorists would be brought to justice.\n\n\u201cThis is really disturbing especially as the state has been relatively peaceful with only pockets of attacks being recorded as compared to some time past.\n\n\u201cIt really saddened my heart to hear about this. It is even more worrisome to know that the lives of security personnel were involved and expatriates were also among those kidnapped,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commiserated with heads of the various security agencies that were part of the joint security operatives in the state for the loss of their personnel while ensuring the people\u2019s safety.\n\nThe governor also sympathized with the families of the slain security agents, assuring them that the sacrifices of their loved ones would not go in vain and commended the bravery of those who engaged the terrorists, causing them to record casualties also.\n\nBello appealed to the security personnel not to be dampened by the incident on their colleagues encouraging them to remain committed to discharging their duties and ensure the safe return of the four Chinese nationals and an unspecified number of workers kidnapped at the mining site.\n\nHe also prayed for the safe return of those kidnapped.\n\nNSCDC in Kwara\n\nIn another development, the Kwara state command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) Thursday paraded two suspected terrorists arrested near a gold mining site in the state.\n\nThe command also recovered dangerous arms in their possession.\n\nAddressing journalists during the parade, the command\u2019s Public Relations Officer (PRO), Olasunkanmi Ayeni, said the suspects were arrested at a location close to gold mining site at Agbede village in Moro local government area of the state with locally made pistol and rifle, among other dangerous weapons.\n\nThe corps\u2019 image maker, who identified the suspects as Abdulahi Alhaji, 19-year-old and 39-year-old John Ihenka, said the suspects were capable of using the arms in their possession to perpetuate different kinds of crime in the society.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are all aware of the security situation and banditry around us. This command has been working so much not to allow these bandits to infiltrate our state. The Corps Tactical Unit (CTU) of our command was able to apprehend these two suspects, namely Abdullahi Alhaji, 19 years old from Kaduna state and John Ihenka, 39 years old.\n\n\u201cAlhaji was trying to get cartridge for the local pistol he said he had bought for N8,000 and fortunately for Nigerians he asked question from the wrong person. From this process, we were able to trail him, leading to his arrest.\n\n\u201cIt was the arrest of Alhaji that led to that of John, who he said, sold the local pistol to him. On getting to John\u2019s place, the officers in intelligence unit were able to get this rifle from him and other dangerous weapons.\n\n\u201cWe know that no one has the right to own local pistol or local rifle. The highest is the one which is licensed from Nigeria Police. Keeping this with them, one should understand what they may be using it for. We implore members of the public to always furnish us with useful and timely information so that we can all live in peace and secured environment.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with journalists in an interview, the suspect, Abdullahi Alhaji, said he bought the gun to defend himself in his cattle business.\n\nIhenka, who confirmed he sold the locally made pistol to Alhaji, said he is a security guard in a gold mining company.\n\n\u201cThey already know that I\u2019m using it (gun) in the company and they said this gun is not good for security I should go and drop it. I then dropped it. I had a leg pain problem. I sold the local pistol to treat myself. I took permission from the company that I\u2019m going to plant in my farm. I bought chemical for the farm from where I was called and asked if I was the one who sold the local pistol to the suspect and I said yes.\n\n\u201cThe company knows that I have the gun. I\u2019m not a kidnapper. I\u2019m a security man in gold mining company. The reason why the suspect said I should sell the pistol to him is because he has cow and he is sleeping in the bush. That is why I sold it to him. I made a mistake for selling the gun to him. I don\u2019t have more guns to sell,\u201d said the suspect.\n\nMatawalle vindicated our position \u2013 CNG\n\nMeanwhile, the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) has commended Zamfara state Governor Muhammad Bello Matawalle for authorising the use of firearms by citizens of the state in protecting themselves against attacks by bandits.\n\nIn a statement made available to Blueprint in Abuja, Thursday, CNG Director Strategic Communication Samaila Musa, said the coalition had been vindicated at Matawalle\u2019s directive.\n\nIt said no matter how belated, the governor\u2019s decision \u201cis aimed at involving and directly engaging communities in protecting, preserving, and defending their lives and livelihoods against marauding terrorist-bandits that are terrorising and pillaging our communities with little or no requited force.\u201d\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cThe Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) views the recent policy for authorisation for use of firearms by citizens of Zamfara State for self-defence by Governor Muhammad Bello Matawalle with mixed interest.\n\n\u201cWe note that the effort by the Zamfara State Government is aimed at involving and directly engaging communities in protecting, preserving, and defending their lives and livelihoods against marauding terrorist-bandits that are terrorising and pillaging our communities with little or no requited force.\n\n\u201cWhile CNG is delighted that some of its positions are being recognised and accepted in tackling the security challenge in the North; it is however frowning at certain efforts that try to maintain the status quo without genuine commitment to ending the bloodbath across the North.\n\n\u201cCNG wishes to remind Nigerians that it has been advocating community mobilisation, engagement and participation in addressing the insecurity in the northern Nigeria in particular and the country as a whole.\n\n\u201cWe therefore commend Governor Matawalle for recognising this approach although belatedly. We have equally keenly observed reactions from individuals and groups across the country with a particular concern with the position of Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) who faulted the authorisation for self-defence. We reject his rejection of self-defence! Self-preservation and defence are natural, inalienable and fundamental that cannot be denied.\n\n\u201cWe wish to remind the CDS that even his principal, Minister of Defence, has once called for self-defence amidst incessant killings by terrorists in Nigeria. The CDS himself told Nigerians that many personnel of the armed forces were facing court-martial for conniving with the kidnappers, bandits, terrorists and other criminals.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "title": "Economy Diversification: Why Nigeria\u2019s mining sector offers robust economic potential- Adegbite",
          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn efforts to boost the nation\u2019s economy through the mining sector, the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologist, NSEG has held its 1st international conference and exhibition in Abuja, with the theme: \u201cEconomic Diversification: The Role of the Geoscientist, Government and Private Sector\u201d, to brainstorm on the better ways to explore the sector.\n\nDeclaring the two- day event open, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite noted that as part of its effort to reposition the Solid Minerals Sector, the Ministry in early 2016, had identified insufficient geoscientific data, geological knowledge, weak\n\nimplementation and enforcement of mining law and regulations, and poorly regulated and informal artisans and small-scale mining sub-sector as critical binding constraints to the mining sector\u2019s development.\n\nAdegbite who was represented by the Director General, Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, MCO, Engr Simon Obadiah Nkom stated that this had propelled the Ministry to immediately begin the process of preparing a detailed sector Roadmap aimed at advancing certain strategic objectives, which would eventually result in the: creation of a globally competitive sector capable of contributing to wealth creation;\n\nprovision of jobs and advance social and human security by focusing on using its mining assets to drive domestic industrialization; and\n\nmigration to winning in global markets through a value chained-based growth plan.\n\nAccording to him, he considered the theme as strategic and timely, given the compelling\n\nurgency to diversify the economy for the prosperity of the nation adding that the\n\ntheme seeks to define the roles of the critical stakeholders in developing\n\nthe minerals sector, key amongst which were the government, private\n\nsector, and the professionals driving the mineral sector development\n\nprocess.\n\nHe said undeniably, Nigeria\u2019s Minerals sector offered a robust economic potential for diversification of the nation\u2019s economy yet the country and indeed, many other African Countries have continued to suffer under\n\nutilization of their mineral resources\n\nThis he reasoned has accounted for the slow phase of socio-economic\n\ndevelopment in Nigeria and many African countries noting that \u201cOur country is known\n\nto operate a mono economy where oil accounts for almost 90% of the foreign exchange earnings. This present administration found this appalling and described the situation as unacceptable and promised to urgently find solutions to redress the challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government through the Ministry of Mines and Steel\n\nDevelopment, MMSD, over, which I preside as the Honourable Minister\n\nplays the role of administrator and regulator of the mining industry\n\nactivities. Some of the key reform programmes include amongst others the\n\nothers the following: Formulation of a robust Policy/Legal/Regulatory/ Institutional frameworks and a Roadmap for the development, growth and good\n\ngovernance of the mineral sector development activities in line with global best practices.\n\n\u201cFacilitating the development of seven (7) Strategic Minerals including Gold, Barite, Coal, Lead/Zinc, Iron ore, Bitumen and Limestone as a matter of priority; generating geoscience data through the National Integrated Mineral\n\nExploration Project, NIMEP, for subsequent concession to\n\nprospective genuine investors. This is the first exploration project funded directly by the Federal Government in the history of Nigeria; upgrading of the mineral title administration and management system of MCO to standard online application processes.\n\nConcessioning of the delineated Bitumen blocks to prospective\n\ninvestors through transparent competitive bidding process, which is ongoing.\n\nThe minister asserted that the private sector on its part plays the role of owner and operator\n\nof commercial mining entities and businesses saying that this shows the high premium, which government places on the private sector in driving\n\neconomic development activities.\n\n\u201cThe geoscientist plays such an invaluable role, which cannot be\n\noverstated in driving mineral exploration activities leading to discoveries of minerals and preparation of definitive feasibility reports on the viability of mineral reserves. The works of the geoscientists produce the treasured\n\nmineral raw materials that form the backbone of modern-day industrial revolution\n\nHe also called on all geoscientists and\n\nstakeholders to support Government\u2019s policy and efforts in diversifying the\n\nnation economy using the mineral sector as one of the key drivers stating that \u201cthe\n\noutcome of such efforts will benefit all of us and the generation of Nigerians yet unborn,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reassured them of government\u2019s commitment in continuous support towards the growth and development of the minerals sector by generating geoscience data to de-risk and make it more attractive to genuine investors maintaining that \u201cGovernment will also continue to support Research and Development, R & D, endeavours tailored towards addressing real time mineral sector development challenges.\u201d\n\nEarlier, delivering his Welcome Address Director General, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, who also doubles as the President of the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologists, NSEG, Dr. Abdulrazaq Abubakar Garba, emphasized that the strategic objectives, professional targets and timelines set as enshrined in the constitution of the society needed to be pursued and met.\n\nGarba noted that the essenc of the conference was to discuss and brainstorm on the emerging challenges arising from the dynamic operating environment of its profession especially in the face of the new normal occasioned by the much-talked-about need to diversify the Nigerian economy away from its sole dependence on crude oil by focusing more on other areas including the solid mineral and agricultural sectors to boost the wealth of the Nation.\n\n\u201cEconomic geology can succinctly be defined as a subdiscipline of the geosciences that focuses on earth materials that can be used for economic or industrial development purposes. Often, much of the purpose of study is to identify new ore deposits for excavation as well as understanding how ore deposits are generated and localized within the Earth\u2019s crust.\n\n\u201cThe theme of this year\u2019s conference, was chosen to underscore our role in the diversification agenda of the Federal Government. Economic geologists play vital roles across the entire mineral value chain from exploration to mining; and even during the post-mining phase as the issues of environment and land reclamation for sustainable use are addressed. Additionally, economic geologists also have to interface with interested stakeholders in obtaining social and mining permit licenses to operate while at the same time provide investors with the prerequisites to raise capital for mineral exploration and mining. Economic geologists therefore provide veritable and robust linkages in the entire mineral development, utilization and environmental preservation chain and are therefore key to the Federal Government\u2019s economy diversification programme targeted at job and wealth creation.\n\n\u201cLet me emphasis that, investment in the minerals and mining sector by stakeholders is a patriotic duty of every citizen who believe in the Nigerian Project. In this respect, the role of governments, both at the national and sub-national levels, is to coordinate and ensure a responsible development of the country\u2019s natural resources. To this effect, necessary laws and regulations have been put in place by government, setting clear requirements that must be met by the industry operators. The economic diversification policy of government, which is anchored on shared and sustainable mining prosperity, emphasizes the need for cooperation of governments to unlock the full potentials of the minerals and metal sector. The Federal government is developing a well governed mining sector with sustainable capacity and has also articulated a roadmap to address some of the identified challenges in the mining sector. The initiatives and strategies outlined in the roadmap are designed largely to make the mining and minerals sector an irresistible destination for global capital.\n\nHe maintained that the success of the Ministry\u2019s National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP executed through the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA and other collaborating Agencies was mainly attributable to the role played by geoscientists from its conceptualization, design and execution.\n\n\u201cThe recent approval by the Federal Executive Council of a Scale of Fees for professionals in geosciences and mining is a testimony of government\u2019s resolve to stimulate the sector and ensure commensurate benefits to the professionals who are indeed the \u2018brain\u2019 and think tank of the sector.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the nation is witnessing a re-awakening in this sector, and the Government is not resting on its oars to grab the bull by the horn. Happily, the organized private sector such as the likes of Thor Exploration (Segilola Gold), Iron Ore/Aurelia, AG Vision, etc are now taking up the gauntlet,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe added that the economic geologist is unique with skills cutting across many of the specialists listed above.\n\nAlso the President of Nigeria Mining Geological Scientist, NMGS, Surv. Charles Alabo said that a lot has been done in providing the necessary framework and conducive environment for mining to play a pivotal role in this regard.\n\nAlabo also said that although Nigeria was committed to a system of free enterprise, Government should continue to play vital roles in the mining industry apart from its traditional regulatory functions.\n\n\u201cThe federal government also supplies some vital information necessary to stimulate and encourage investment for the optimum utilization of the huge mineral wealth of our country.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution gives the Federal Government control of all-natural resources, meaning that there is no private ownership of solid minerals in Nigeria. Though mining is within the purview of the Federal Government, sub national govemments can contribute to the growth and effective functioning of the mining sector by partnering with the federal government to ensure sustained economic growth, environmental protection, occupational safety and provision of infrastructure in host mining communities. In addition, developmental plans should take into cognizance the overall development aspirations of the State alongside the prospects and challenges of mining activities\n\n\u201cThe Mining sector to significantly contribute to Nigeria\u2019s economy cannot be over-emphasized. The Roadmap for the Growth & Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry highlights the potential for a progressive increase in the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP over the next decades. It is envisaged that this shift would translate to increased public and private sector investment, more employment creation for the citizenry and overall growth and financial stability for the economy International investor interest in the sector will continue to improve with the federal government also recognizing the sector as a potential prime income generator away from oil. However, so much more still needs to be done to tap the full potentials of the mining sector given the large mineral resources of the Nation,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe further stated that the NMGS will continue to support NSEG and indeed all the other Specialist Groups of the NMGS as they play their roles as drivers of the technical think tank of the society adding that \u201cWe shall continue to empower them to drive geosciences and mining innovations under the umbrella of our great Society. Key programs of relevance to the sector must be critically and more robustly assessed by qualified professionals in the mix of our national development. Economic geologists particularly have an obligation to future generations in providing safe and sustainable mineral exploration, exploitation and utilization programs while also ensuring minimal environmental impact. As professionals, we must therefore aim at providing sustainable geosciences and mining information for investors and policy makers including national representatives, federal and state agencies, industry, academia, and other stakeholders in the sector. Professionals in geosciences and mining should be poised to expand their roles and lead in finding sustainable solutions for modern socio-economic challenges through mineral resources development and innovative efforts.\n\n\u201cThe need for full integration of mining into national, regional, and continental development frameworks cannot be over emphasized as such integration would bring about accelerated development to national and sub national economies to ensure maximum benefits for our people.\u201d",

          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nMinister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc. has called on Civil Servants to be dedicated to duty for improved productivity.\n\nAdegbite made the call during the celebration organized by the ministry to commemorate the 2022 African Public Service Day in Abuja.\n\nHe expressed satisfaction working with staff of the ministry due to their commitment to duty which he stressed should be sustained to take the ministry to enviable heights.\n\nDelivering her speech at the ceremony, Permanent Secretary, of the Ministry, Dr Oluwatoyin Akinlade, revealed that efforts were on to ensure that the ministry blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation.\n\nAkinlade who hailed the passion of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, HCSF, Folashade Mejabi Yemi-Esan, for improved productivity and welfare of civil servants, said the theme of the day, \u201cPerformance Management System, PMS: Impact on productivity in the Nigeria Public Sector\u201d was most apt as it summarises the vision of the HCSF to make the service a world class system that drives optimum productivity through effective and efficient performance management.\n\n\u201cShe has vigorously pursued the full implementation of the new Performance Management System through training of various categories of officers. This is complemented by the deployment of the Human Resource Module of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System, IPPIS, the Federal Civil Service Strategy Implementation Plan and the reinforcement of the Innovation Division in all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs.\n\n\u201cLEAD-P and SMART-P trainings have also been consistently carried out to realise this laudable vision of the HCSF.\n\n\u201cMMSD is among the first set of MDAs to receive these facilities and efforts are on to ensure that we blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation. We have achieved a major improvement in the ACTU rating from about 26.5% to 74.5% compliance and have also surpassed our revenue projections,\u201d Akinlade said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary disclosed that efforts had also been made within the ministry\u2019s limits of available resources to provide facilities that would enhance productivity and welfare of Staff, adding that in that regard, \u201cwe now have a clinic that can provide basic health services to all staff to ensure that our health is given the priority that it deserves\u201d.\n\nShe said many may be unaware that within the few months of operation of the clinic, health crises had been averted for some staff just through routine check by the medical team in the clinic.\n\n\u201cAlso, we can easily see the massive deployment of ICT infrastructures within office complex aimed at achieving the full automation of the work processes in the ministry,\u201d she added.\n\nCongratulating the members of management and staff of the ministry on week-long activities being commemorated, Akinlade craved their indulgence over the delay in the commemoration which was being held this week instead of last week that was officially set aside to mark the event, adding that it was due to exigencies of duty.\n\n\u201cSince 1999 when the African Union, AU, set aside 23rd June, as the \u201cAfrica Public Service Day, APSD, Nigeria has consistently\n\ncommemorated the day annually with series of activities and we are grateful to God for the opportunity to be part of this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cIn her characteristic style of celebrating civil servants, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation approved a full package of week-long activities for this year including Jumat and Church Services, Keep-fit/aerobics session, a Town-hall Meeting and Special Awards to selected officers for outstanding performance,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe told the workers that the occasion also affords the opportunity to specially acknowledge members of staff that have distinguished themselves through outstanding performance.\n\nSpeaking further, she said, \u201cAs usual, one person was nominated from each department out of which three were selected and forwarded to OHCSF. I want to therefore congratulate all the recipients of this year\u2019s award and appreciate them for their diligence.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly congratulate Engr. Umar Adamu Tsoho who was honoured with the \u201cPresidential Public Service Award\u201d by the OHCSF for outstanding service. He made it to the top ten among the nomination from all the MDAs. We are proud of you and we thank you for bringing honour to this Ministry.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the HCSF, I want to congratulate and specially thank all the retiring staff for the year 2022. It is indeed a noble achievement to successfully exit the Federal Civil Service through retirement. It is the beginning of new life for you and we wish you good health of mind and body as well as a fulfilling life after retirement from public service.\u201d\n\nAlso Member of staff and retirees of MMSD were rewarded with gift items and plaques for the outstanding dedication to duty.",

This is complemented by the deployment of the Human Resource Module of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System, IPPIS, the Federal Civil Service Strategy Implementation Plan and the reinforcement of the Innovation Division in all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs.\n\n\u201cLEAD-P and SMART-P trainings have also been consistently carried out to realise this laudable vision of the HCSF.\n\n\u201cMMSD is among the first set of MDAs to receive these facilities and efforts are on to ensure that we blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation. We have achieved a major improvement in the ACTU rating from about 26.5% to 74.5% compliance and have also surpassed our revenue projections,\u201d Akinlade said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary disclosed that efforts had also been made within the ministry\u2019s limits of available resources to provide facilities that would enhance productivity and welfare of Staff, adding that in that regard, \u201cwe now have a clinic that can provide basic health services to all staff to ensure that our health is given the priority that it deserves\u201d.\n\nShe said many may be unaware that within the few months of operation of the clinic, health crises had been averted for some staff just through routine check by the medical team in the clinic.\n\n\u201cAlso, we can easily see the massive deployment of ICT infrastructures within office complex aimed at achieving the full automation of the work processes in the ministry,\u201d she added.\n\nCongratulating the members of management and staff of the ministry on week-long activities being commemorated, Akinlade craved their indulgence over the delay in the commemoration which was being held this week instead of last week that was officially set aside to mark the event, adding that it was due to exigencies of duty.\n\n\u201cSince 1999 when the African Union, AU, set aside 23rd June, as the \u201cAfrica Public Service Day, APSD, Nigeria has consistently\n\ncommemorated the day annually with series of activities and we are grateful to God for the opportunity to be part of this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cIn her characteristic style of celebrating civil servants, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation approved a full package of week-long activities for this year including Jumat and Church Services, Keep-fit/aerobics session, a Town-hall Meeting and Special Awards to selected officers for outstanding performance,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe told the workers that the occasion also affords the opportunity to specially acknowledge members of staff that have distinguished themselves through outstanding performance.\n\nSpeaking further, she said, \u201cAs usual, one person was nominated from each department out of which three were selected and forwarded to OHCSF. I want to therefore congratulate all the recipients of this year\u2019s award and appreciate them for their diligence.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly congratulate Engr. Umar Adamu Tsoho who was honoured with the \u201cPresidential Public Service Award\u201d by the OHCSF for outstanding service. He made it to the top ten among the nomination from all the MDAs. We are proud of you and we thank you for bringing honour to this Ministry.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the HCSF, I want to congratulate and specially thank all the retiring staff for the year 2022. It is indeed a noble achievement to successfully exit the Federal Civil Service through retirement. It is the beginning of new life for you and we wish you good health of mind and body as well as a fulfilling life after retirement from public service.\u201d\n\nAlso Member of staff and retirees of MMSD were rewarded with gift items and plaques for the outstanding dedication to duty.",

The increase, which will come into effect on Wednesday, 13 July 2022, is aimed at ensuring the sustainability of the BRT and standard route schemes.\n\n\u201cOperations of the transport scheme, of late, had been hampered due to rising cost of inputs required for sustainable service offering and the attendant high number of buses out of operation as a result of lack of spare parts.\n\n\u201cFor instance, the exponential increase in the pump price of diesel from N187 to N830/litre between August 2020 and June 2022, had greatly affected the optimal performance of the bus operating companies leading to the withdrawal of buses from the operation and longer waiting time at bus stations.\n\n\u201cThe governor, in consenting to the fare increase, also approved a proposal for a bailout for the bus operating companies in other to cushion the effect of the harsh operating environment and safeguard private partnership investment and forestall the demise of formalised bus operations in the state.\n\n\u201cWith the increase, a bus ride from Ikorodu \u2013 TBS will now cost N600 from N500 while Berger to Ajah is now N700, up from N600.

As a result, the high-powered inter-ministerial committee set up by the federal government to fast-track resolution of the dispute could not submit its report to the president as expected.\n\nWabba said: \u201cI think there is reluctance in addressing this issue and therefore CWC has decided that there will be a one-day national protest to call the attention of government to resolve the issue immediately after that the next decision of the CWC will take place.\n\n\u201cWe have also asked all our affiliates in the next one week to issue statements,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the lingering scarcity of fuel and the long queues across the country, NLC said it was pathetic that Nigeria has not availed itself of the rich endowment of oil resource by continuing to depend on imported petroleum products for local consumption.\n\nWabba said the situation had brought about dire consequences on productivity, economy and wellbeing of the citizens.\n\nFor instance, he said that diesel now sells at more than N800 per liter.\n\n\u201cIt is on unfortunate that Nigeria despite being a major oil producing country has continued to fail to refine her own crude oil.\n\n\u201cThe result of this, is the net total of 100 per cent importation of refine petroleum product into Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd the consequence is the heavy hemorrhage of our national coffers especially given our most important challenge which has also brought about the long queues in almost all the filling stations,\u201d he added.\n\nThe NLC president also lamented that the situation had affected the purchasing power of many Nigerians and brought hardship with many businesses brought to a halt because they run on generator.\n\n\u201cMany people are closing their business and many workers are losing their jobs.\n\n\u201cThere is no way this situation can be allowed to continue. The position of the NLC and the organised labour is that the only way out of this issue and even to end subsidy or not is for us to refine product for domestic use,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NEC meeting of the NLC which held behind closed doors was expected to endorse the decisions of the CWC and further give specific date for the nationwide protest on the university strike.\n\nOnyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",

          "text": "Following improved corporate earnings by companies, low yield in fixed income market, among other factors, the stock market segment of the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX) added N5.64 trillion in the first half (H1) of 2022.\n\nPrecisely, the market capitalisation in H1 2022 appreciated by N5.64 trillion or 25.3 per cent to close at the end of the first half of 2022 at N27.935trillion, from the N22.297 trillion it opened for trading activities on January 4, 2021.\n\nConsequently, the overall market performance, the NGX All-Share Index (ASI), which tracks the general market movement of all listed companies on the Exchange, rose by 21.31 per cent or 9,101.15 basis points to close at 51,817.59 basis points in H1 2022, the highest performance in 14 years, from 42,716.44 basis points it opened for trading.\n\nThe stock market in H1 2022 maintained positive momentum with domestic investors raising their stake amid rising inflationary pressure and the challenging business environment.\n\nData gathered by THISDAY revealed that, sectors performance on the NGX was mixed on the backdrop of investors\u2019 sentiment.\n\nFor instance, with the rise in global oil prices, the NGX Oil & Gas Index outperformed other indices on the bourse, gaining 58.06 per cent to 545.34 basis points in H1 from 345.01 basis points it opened trading. It was closely followed by Industrial Index that rose by 7.7 per cent to 2,152.24 basis points from 2,008.30 basis points it closed in 2021.\n\nOn the flipside, the NGX Banking Index suffered a decline of 2.04 per cent in H1 to 397.79 basis points as of June 30, 2022 from the 406.07 per cent it opened for trading, just as the NGX Insurance Index depreciated by 9.98 per cent to 178.33 basis points in H1 2022 from 198.11 basis points it opened for trading this year.\n\nStocks that contributed to growth in the market performance included Seplat Energy Plc that appreciated by N650 per share from December 31, 2021 to N1,300 per share as of June 30, 2022, while Airtel Africa gained 81.4 per cent to N1,732.20 per share from N955 per share it opened for trading.\n\nAirtel Africa in the first H1 2022 appreciated by N2.9 trillion in terms of market capitalisation to contribute about 23.3 per cent or N6.91trillion to overall market capitalisation of listed stocks on the NGX.\n\nOthers were: MTN Nigeria with a 17 per cent increase in stock price to N230 per share from the N197 per share it closed in 2021, while Dangote Cement gained seven per cent in stock price to close at N275 per share from N257 per share.\n\nThe stock market in the first quarter of 2022 had gained N3.02 trillion on the backdrop of impressive corporate earnings by major listed companies that led to robust dividend pay-out to shareholders.\n\nAlso, the overall market performance, the NGX ASI had risen by 9.95 per cent to close at 46,965.48 basis points in the first Q1 2022.\n\nCapital market analysts said H1 2022 was positive for the domestic market and urged investors to trade the stock market with caution over political uncertainty.\n\nAnalysts at Cordros Securities, in a report titled, \u201cHeightened uncertainties amid great policy unwind,\u201d noted that while emerging (EM) and Frontier (FM) markets had been rattled by the impact of policy normalisation and inflationary pressures occasioned by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the performance of the Nigerian financial market was relatively strong, stressing that the volatility in the Fixed Income (FI) market has also been uncharacteristically muted.\n\nThe report stated the fixed income market return settled at +eight per cent, which was below the return in the prior year (H1-21: 10.1per cent), but was a stark difference from the market performances in peer countries, where investors significantly reduced exposure to risk assets as central banks across the globe raised benchmark interest rates in response to spiralling inflation.\n\nThey attributed the growth in stock market performance to resilience rooted in the exodus from the market due to Foreign Exchange (FX) liquidity issues.\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cThis situation also limited inflows from investors and resulted in: the market being dominated by domestic investors and foreign investors\u2019 inability to repatriate funds, leading to the re-investment of dividends in the market.\n\n\u201cTo buttress these points, domestic investors accounted for an average of 86.6per cent of all transactions in five months of 2022, while the market performance in Q2-22 was 10.1per cent (Q1-22: 10per cent; H1 2022: 21.per cent.\u201d\n\nAnalyst at PAC Holdings, Mr. Wole Adeyeye attributed the stock market performance to impressive financial reports for full year 2021 and dividend pay out to shareholders in the first half of 2022 by listed companies.\n\nHe added that, \u201cThus, investors positioned themselves for dividend payment during the period. In addition, investors patronised the equities market as yields in the fixed income market were not encouraging, especially in the first quarter of 2022.\u201d\n\nGoing forward, he said, \u201cBears may dominate equities market in the second half of 2022 due to the expectation of improved yields in fixed-income market, upcoming elections and uncertainties surrounding the economy.\u201d\n\nThe Vice president, Highcap Securities Limited, Mr, David Adonri said, \u201cNGX ASI surged at the beginning of the second quarter due to the impressive 2021 full year and Q1 2022 results.\n\n\u201cThe rising crude oil price also enhanced the performance of equities. However, the market slowed down in June due to unfavorable domestic factors which the rising crude oil market could not off set.\n\n\u201cThese were the rising inflation rate, hike in interest rate and excruciating energy crisis. As the political risk associated with the 2023 general election heightens and possibility of further hike in interest rate looms, economic fundamentals may not be strong enough to engender further market growth in H2 2022.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with THISDAY the Managing Director, ARM Securities Ltd, Mr. Rotimi Olubi, also said, \u201cWe continue to see improved participation by local investors in the market which is boosting the performance of the ASI as foreign investors maintain the side-lines.\n\n\u201cStrong earnings from some stocks in the consumer goods and industrial goods as well as some banks also buoyed investor sentiment.\u201d\n\nKayode Tokede",
