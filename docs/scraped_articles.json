These challenges, regrettably, are mutually reinforcing with one aggravating the other and thus undermining the efforts to address them. Whilst we call on governments at all levels to double up the efforts and seek innovative solutions, we urge Nigerians not to give up on the Nigerian project.\n\n\n\nHe appealed to all stakeholders to come together, and work towards the Nigeria of our aspiration, adding that \u201cwe are stronger together as a united, prosperous and just country that works for, and is fair to all irrespective of tribe, creed or geographical location.\n\n\n\nHe stated that the commitment of UMA to the Nigeria project informed the theme of the Association Pre-Ramadan Lecture last year: Thou Tongue and Tribe may differ: Interrogating Nigeria\u2019s Nationhood.\n\nHe promised that the UMA will continue to be actively involved in shaping the polity and in the search for solutions to our national challenges.\n\n\n\nThe President also commended the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC, for the recent creation of new polling units across the country to improve access to voters.\n\n\n\nHe said the elites owe the nation the duty and responsibility to ensure right ambience and conducive environment for political participation of and emergence of right people in position of leadership at all levels.\n\n\u201c As potent opinion moulders, the elites have the responsibility to ensure that the political space has the right ambience and conducive environment for participation of and emergence of right people in positions of leadership at all levels. The elites owe the nation this duty,\u201d he said.\n\nYouth development\n\nOn youth development, the UMA President hailed the resilience of the youth, adding that despite a number of challenges that have limited available opportunities to them and undermine their potentials, they are neither deterred by the constraints of the environment nor their spirit dampened by negative narratives. \u201c They are the heroes of today and icons of tomorrow. UMA salutes this category of trail blazing youth and urges others not to be discouraged by the current challenges in the environment.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on networking for career success, Country Human Resources Manager, Shakiru Lawal urged members to explore the opportunity of networking inorder to succeed in any chosen career, adding, \u201cYour network is your net worth. Don\u2019t limit your networking to your field,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHighlights of the event was the unveiling of the new logo of the association by the Vice Chancellor, Prof Oluwatoyin Ogundipe.

          "text": "\u2022 No congress in Oyo until authentic delegate list is out, says party leaders\n\n\u2022 Committee Chairman held hostage for hours as members pull out\n\nBy Sola Isola\n\nThe crisis within rocking the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Oyo took a new turn on Saturday as stakeholders and several leaders of the APC absconded the congress that produced the former commissioner for lands and survey, Mr Isaac Omodewu as the chairman of the party in the state.\n\nOur Correspondent who was at Obafemi Awolowo Stadium, venue of the congress observed that party faithfuls started arriving the venue as early as 8am.\n\nIt was also observed that the main bowl of the stadium was under lock and key, even though there was heavy security presence there and the congress did not start until about 4:30pm.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Omodewu appealed to members of the party in the state to put their grievances aside and come together to move the party to greater heights, adding that the focus should be on how to win election come 2023.\n\nHe also thanked leaders of the party for their support, promising to do his best to reconciled aggrieved members and repositionig the party to it\u2019s initial position.\n\n\u201cLet peace reigns in Oyo APC, am going to represent everybody, my job is to put this party into one fold.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some leaders of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State have said that state congress will not hold in Oyo until the result of the ward and local government congress of the party is released.\n\nThe APC leaders stated this at a press conference on Saturday at the Premier Hotel, Ibadan, appealed to the national leadership of party to delay the state congress till an authentic delegates\u2019 list is provided.\n\nSome of the leaders at the Press Conference include, the Minister of Youths and a Sports Development, Mr Sunday Dare, Chairman of the Nigerian Communication Commission, Professor Adeolu Akande, Senator Ayoade Adeseun, Senator Olufemi Lanlehin, Chief Niyi Akintola who was represented, the 2019 Governorship flag bearer for the state, Mr Adebayo Adelabu, Ex-SSG Sharafadeen Alli, Dr Azeez Adeduntan and Joseph Tegbe.\n\nSome of the federal lawmakers in attendance include, Prince Akeem Adeyemi, Mrs Tolulope Shadipe, former Oyo Assembly Speaker, Mr Olagunju Ojo, Prince Ayodeji Abass-Aleshinloye.\n\nOther prominent leaders present include, Chief Fatai Ibikunle, Niyi Adeagbo, Mrs Folake Oshinowo, Gbenga Olayemi, Kola Olabiyi, Wasiu Owolabi, Ambali Abiodun and Olalekan Kazeem among others.\n\nThey alleged that a serving senator and a former governor are responsible for the falsification of the delegates\u2019 list in circulation.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of other party leaders, Senator Adeseun stated that some people have inserted fake delegates into the list.\n\nHe said:\u201dSome dubious people have inserted fake delegates into the list brought from Abuja.\n\n\u201cNormally, when you have written an examination, you need to know the result either you pass or fail. We did the first congress, we did not get its result. We held the second one, no result.They kept them all.\n\n\u201cThey brought them altogether to us yesterday (Friday) for us to hold the State Congress. When we got the delegates\u2019 list, we observed the list they brought it is fake and falsified. False names are in the list. When we held previous congresses, everyone of us mobilized people for them. When there is competition, each will bring out his or her people to test strength.\n\n\u201cIn this state congress, we have agreed to go for consensus, but some elements in the party, have falsified the delegates \u2018 list, they are now saying they don\u2019t want consensus anymore.\n\n\u201cThere is no way we will use falsified delegates\u2019 list for the state congress. If they use the falsified delegates list to hijack party structure, can they use the same approach to win in the general elections?\n\n\u201cTwo people are behind this falsified, adulterated and fake delegates\u2019 list. One serving senator and one former governor of the state. We think those who have attained such high positions should be trustworthy and reliable. But they are not.\n\n\u201cParty members and leaders in Oyo State are vehemently kicking against using such delegates\u2019 list to conduct the state congress.\n\n\u201cWe are using this medium to appeal to the national leadership of our party, the suffering in Oyo State is too much. We don\u2019t want to suffer against. The only way the suffering will not continue is to allow our party to conduct election and win. Our party was in government for eight years and brought unprecedented development to the state. But with this step they are taking they working towards the defeat of the party.\n\n\u201cIt is not possible to hold today\u2019s congress because if we don\u2019t get good, legitimate and authentic list, that is transparently compiled.\n\n\u201cThey should bring out the authentic list of ward and local government congresses. They should bring them out. If they do, we are ready for the congress. We cannot hold congress with falsified delegates\u2019 list\u201d.\n\n\n\nIn another development, Sources revealed to Vanguard that the Congress Committee Chairman, Hon. Gambo Lawan was held hostage at Jericho Apartment, Jericho, Ibadan where he lodged by some party members who besieged the facility as early as 7am after four of the seven members in the congress committee have allegedly pull out of the assignment and returned to Abuja.\n\nSources close to the party hierarchy hinted that the members sneaked out one after the other from the Jericho Apartment, Jericho where they were lodged to head for Abuja enroute Lagos.\n\nThe four members are Mr Lanre Edun, Mallam Abdullai Kontagora, Mr Diran Iyantan and Chief Ralph Igbokwe.\n\nIt was gathered that the four members had argued at a meeting of the committee last night that the protest against the delegates list presented at the Stakeholders meeting should not be dismissed if the party would be reconciled for the 2023 elections.",

          "title": "Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s brother opens up: IPOB now in charge of Southeast",
          "text": "From Okey Sampson, Umuahia\n\nMr Emmanuel Kanu is the brother of detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nIn this interview, he revealed that some politicians do not want agitation by IPOB to stop because they\u2019re benefitting from it.\n\nHe equally accused the Southeast governors of not being sincere about the activities of Nnamdi Kanu and his group in the region.\n\nWhile denying his brother is the cause of insecurity in the Southeast geo-political zone as alleged by the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, he among other issues, proffered dialogue as solution to the present problem. Excerpts:\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nRecently, the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami accused the IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu of being responsible for the insecurity in the Southeast. Could this be true?\n\nNnamdi Kanu is not the problem we have in the Southeast, rather, youth unemployment, marginalization of the Southeast and nepotism, these are the problems Nigeria presently has. Nnamdi Kanu has said it time and again that he does not give life and will not take it. So, if the people of the Southeast have received any atom of justice, equity and fairness, do you think there will be any reason for unrest in the Southeast? The answer is no. So, what Malami should blame as the problem in the Southeast, is the Constitution of this country. The Constitution is one sided and people have waited for so long for the Constitution to be changed without success, so, they have turned themselves into symbol of change. They should look at people\u2019s agitation, know why they are agitating, if they should understand that, then the problem will be solved. So, the problem is not Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe Attorney General and Minister of Justice specifically accused the IPOB leader of giving directives to ESN to kill security agents in the region. How true is this?\n\nESN is created to defend our farmlands against bandits and terrorists. ESN was not designed to attack anyone, their job is more of that of a vigilante. You and I are aware that so many people have been killed in the course of defending their farmlands. Since the creation of ESN, we no longer hear such ugly news and that was why ESN was created and not to attack anybody. And, the instruction is clear, don\u2019t attack anybody.\n\nAre you worried that instead of Malami focusing attention in the North where insecurity is even worst, he is talking about Nnamdi Kanu and the Southeast?\n\nI\u2019m extremely surprised, I was thinking that the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Malami should have focused more on what is happening up in the North, between the Kanuris, the Gwaris and the Fulanis. Few days ago, we heard that the Boko Haram bombed the rail lines. A market in Sokoto was equally attacked and over 30 people killed, and there are so many incidents of such magnitude in the North to the extent that the governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir el-Rufia has asked the Federal Government to designate bandits as terrorists. And they don\u2019t make headlines, to Malami, they don\u2019t mean anything, they are nothing. Let me advise Malami, he should first of all remove what is in his own eyes before removing that of others. He understands the problems of the country too well and he should deal with those problems, not Nnamdi Kanu. Nnamdi Kanu is not the issue, the issue is about marginalization, nepotism and the killings of our youths. And the issue remains that those you have killed their children will not fold there hands, it could be a direct revenge from them, yet they are blaming ESN, they should not do that because what goes around, comes around. This is the right time like I have always said, to sit down and deal with this problem once and for all. Everybody is hiding under Nnamdi Kanu and ESN to unleash mayhem. But if they can sit down with Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of IPOB and get these things ironed out once and for all, so that whoever that is causing these problems, we will be bold enough to pinpoint that person and have to arrest that person as well. But when they allow all these things untouched, they keep allowing problems here and there.\n\nWhat\u2019s your take on the proposed one-week sit-at-home order by IPOB?\n\nThe proposed one-week sit-at-home order by IPOB headed by Mazi Chika Edoziem (the head of DOS) as it stands now, he made it clear that if you do not release Nnamdi Kanu from now to November 4, then the sit-at-home will commence for one week. They could have chosen to carry arms, but the answer is that we believe that civil disobedience is the best, it\u2019s a far potent weapon than arms, so, that is why they have maintained that position. So, the thing is that, release Nnamdi Kanu unconditionally and dialogue with him. I keep on saying it, what they are doing is mere waste of resources. Everyday you come to the court, security agents, the court staff, all of us will come to the court at the end we go back to our various homes. There is no need for that. The truth remains that a lot of people, a lot of politicians are befitting from what is happening, they want it to continue; they are telling the president, don\u2019t dialogue with IPOB, don\u2019t dialogue with Nnamdi Kanu, that they are in charge, while they are not in charge. It is clear to everybody that the governors of the Southeast are not in charge, the person that is in charge is Nnamdi Kanu. I know a lot of things are going to unfold, but let the government arrest the situation once and for all and that should be done through dialogue.\n\nSit-at-home is a potent weapon as you said, is IPOB taking cognizance of its bandwagon effect on the people?\n\nThat was why I said what I said earlier that I pray government will arrest the situation once and for all. Let them arrest this once and for all. And again, the Southeast governors are not being truthful, I put this to them, they are not being truthful. In 2017, there was a dialogue between Nnamdi Kanu and the Southeast governors and from my little findings, or should I say from my extensive findings, I can categorically tell you that the Presidency is not aware of that particular discussion that was held with Nnamdi Kanu. If the Southeast governors were truthful and told the Presidency what is happening in the Southeast, I believe they will arrest the situation. But because when they go to Abuja, the governors will tell them they\u2019re in charge, nothing is happening, they will destroy the boys, they are divided, give us money, we will do this, we will do that, they are not saying the truth. Nnamdi Kanu is the arrow head, he is the leader, go to the leader and solve this problem. If you want to solve the problem, go to the leader and everything will be over. It is clear to all that someone is in charge of this people and who is that person? The answer is Nnamdi Kanu and anyone telling you otherwise, forget it. Having said that, I will also have to commend some politicians who are making reasonable efforts to get Nnamdi Kanu out from detention and individuals too. I also commend journalists in this country, they are doing wonderful job, they also believe in equity and justice. They want to see things happen transperantly, they know the truth, they want to know what Nnamdi Kanu has done and that was why they were so angry on Thursday when he appeared in court, though they were denied access into the court, but they remained resolute and I commend them for that.\n\nWhen you saw your brother in court, how did you feel?\n\nI was happy to see him as a brother, like I have always said, I would want him to have his doctors examine him. The Federal Government should allow us bring his personal physicians to check him and if possible examine him and see what he\u2019s passing through, it is very, very important. I\u2019m saying this because if anything happens to him where he is, God help us.\n\nWhen you talk about dialogue, in what shape do you think this will take?\n\nNnamdi Kanu is the arrowhead of all this, I am not going to speak on his behalf. When they sit him down, they will look at the issues he has raised, I know they are germaine, look at those issues and treat them, that\u2019s all.\n\nI ask the question because some leaders of the country said the issue of oneness of the nation was settled 51 years ago. Could this be true?\n\nWhatever anybody said, one thing you and I know is that what has remained constant in the face of this earth is change; and change can take place any time, any day. Change could come as a result of the wish of the people and nobody can stop that.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

          "title": "Why Justice Odili\u2019s home was raided",
          "text": "From Godwin Tsa, Abuja\n\nFresh facts have emerged to the effect that the raid carried out on the home of Supreme Court Justice Mary Odili by the Joint Panel Recovery Unit of the Federal Ministry of Justice followed a petition by a whistleblower, Aliyu Umar.\n\nArmed with a warrant issued by the hand of an Abuja Chief Magistrate, Emmanuel Iyana, on October 29, the panel, which comprises the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, the Nigeria Police Force and the Ministry of Justice, stormed the No. 9, Imo Street, Maitama, Abuja.\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, has washed his hands off the sordid development even as he ordered a full investigation.\n\nUSA companies need customer service reps to work from home, hourly pay in $13 per hour, must have a quiet environment to work, internet access.Click here to apply .\n\nIn the said petition, which triggered the questionable raid, Umar claimed that he had observed illegal activities going on at the home. His affidavit dated October 13, 2021, read in part: \u201cI have observed some illegal activities going on in those houses within Abuja which are illegal and hereby report the said matter to the law enforcement agency.\n\n\u201cI hereby state that all information provided by me to the EFCC is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.\u201d\n\nIn a second affidavit deposed to by a senior police officer, CSP Lawrence Ajodo, the panel applied to the Chief Magistrate in Abuja seeking a search warrant to search the house.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief Magistrate court has revoked the search warrant on the ground that it was misled into granting the order.\n\nThe revocation order read, \u201cUpon misrepresentation to this honourable court that led to the issuance of a search warrant in favour of Joint Panel Recovery, Ministry of Justice, against House 9, Imo Street, Maitama, Abuja, dated October 29, 2021. In view of the above fact, the said search warrant is hereby revoked.\u201d\n\nFollowing the uproar that greeted the development, the EFCC Spokesman, Mr Wilson Uwujaren, said in a statement that the commission had no hand in the matter, stressing, \u201cIf there was any such operation as claimed by the media, it was not carried out by the EFCC. The commission enjoins the public to discountenance the report.\u201d\n\nIn the growing heat of the fallout, the Malami distanced himself from the controversial invasion of Justice Odili\u2019s residence by security operatives.\n\nIn his reaction to the invasion, Malami said he was not in any way connected with the fabrications and concocted lies linking him to the embarrassing raid on the residence of a Justice Mary Odili. He also denied the existence of such a panel under his ministry and ordered a full-scale investigation of the matter.\n\nMaking his position known in statement by his spokesman, Dr. Umar Jibrilu Gwandu, Malami said that as the Chief Law Officer of the Federation, he would not stoop so low to be associated with an apparent inelegant and nasty court process on the strength of which the purported search warrant was procured.\n\n\u201cThe media reports on the issue depict too untidy process that could never emanate from the Office of the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice. The general public needs to know that there is nothing called \u201cJoint Panel Recovery Under the Ministry of Justice\u201d in the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, and by extension the entire Federal Ministry of Justice. What we have is \u201cAssets Recovery and Management Unit\u201d the mandate of which does not include sting operations.\n\nNumerous incongruities in the documents being circulated in relation to the saga reveal traces of criminal actions which particular regards to: The name as contained on the purported letterheaded paper, \u201cGhost Account For Local Whistle Blowers & Assets Tax Recovery Panel\u201d, the ambiguous reference to \u201cMinistry of Justice\u201d without clarifying as to whether it is Federal or State Ministry and of which state; the claimed office address which as revealed by the letter-headed paper is not the address of the Federal Ministry of Justice and email address used on the letterhead. All these deductions would have assisted a discerning mind to arrive at a reasonable conclusion of criminal undertones associated with the court process on the basis of which the purported search warrant was procured.\n\n\u201cThe Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice has since reached out to the relevant authorities for an intensified wider investigation on the matter for necessary action leading to the prosecution of anyone involved in the matter in view of the fact that the only names on record from the process filed in court are a purported police officer who claimed to be \u201cO/C Assets Recovery Team\u201d and one Aliyu Umar a deponent in the affidavit. The claim of the Chief Magistrate as reported by a section of the media to the effect that he was misled by Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice into the issuance of the search warrant is equally forwarded to the relevant investigation agencies to ascertain the veracity or otherwise of the purported association of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice and which officer, if any, in the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice is associated with such claimed misrepresentation.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice President of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar, in a statement by his media office strongly condemned the invasion. He said: \u201cIt is with utmost disgust that we continue to witness situations whereby law enforcement agencies conduct raids on residences of senior judges in the country. Irrespective of the investigations that they pursue, such practices give expression of professional misconduct and put our country in very poor images.\n\n\u201cIt needs not be reiterated that this is a democratic republic and every organ of the state bureaucracy, especially the security agencies, must conduct themselves in responsibility to the people of Nigeria,\u201d Atiku said.\n\nIn similar swift reaction, Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr. Orji Kalu, described the invasion of the Abuja home of Justice Mary Odili of the Supreme Court as \u201ca cruel, undemocratic and uncivilised act.\u201d\n\nCondemning the raid on justice\u2019s home, Kalu called on the federal government to commence a full-scale investigation into the ugly incident, adding that the unwarranted invasion of the house of Justice Odili was capable of causing tension in the country.\n\nKalu, who is the former governor of Abia State, stressed that in a democratic set-up, the rule of law must be strictly adhered to for the sake of national progress and development.\n\nHis words: \u201cThe invasion of the residence of Justice Mary Odili of the Supreme Court in a Gestapo manner is totally condemnable and unacceptable in a democratic dispensation. The country\u2019s democracy is gradually growing and as such acts that are not in tandem with the constitution of Nigeria and democratic process must not tolerated.\n\n\u201cThe federal government should commence robust investigation into the sad development to save the face of the country in the comity of nations and to bring the perpetrators of the unfortunate incident to book. The rule of law must not be undermined in a democratic regime. The law must be respected by the government and the governed.\u201d\n\nKalu urged the federal government to bring the perpetrators of the evil act to book, adding that unlawful invasion of a citizen\u2019s residence is against the constitution of Nigeria and tenets of democracy.\n\nEqually incensed by the sordid affair, former national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Prince Uche Secondus, described the search carried out in the home of Justice Mary Odili of the Supreme Court Of Nigeria as a huge embarrassment and an insult on the judiciary.\n\nPrince Secondus said that nothing could explain the embarrassing act of the security operatives on a woman who has put in much in the service of her fatherland.\n\nHe said that relevant authorities should come clean on what informed such ignoble and dishonourable behaviour and render unreserved apology to the Justice Odili and the Judiciary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility as a democratic nation to ensure the continued sanctity of the judiciary as a critical component of democracy,\u201d Secondus said.\n\nPrince Secondus also noted that the development calls for more diligence on the part of judicial officers in responding to search warrant requests from overzealous officials of the executive.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection.

          "text": "\u2018I swore by the Holy Qur\u2019an that I will serve in accordance with the constitution and leave when my time is up\u2019\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday said he would leave office when his tenure ends on May 29, 2023, and warned against campaigns for tenure extension, saying he swore to serve in accordance with the constitution.\n\nThe President was speaking at a meeting in Makkah with a select group of Nigerians resident in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia where he just ended a visit.\n\nAccording to a statement titled, \u201cPresident Buhari Says I Will Leave On 29 May 2023, Warns Tenure Extension Campaigners To Desist,\u201d signed by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari told the Nigerians: \u201cI swore by the Holy Qur\u2019an that I will serve in accordance with the constitution and leave when my time is up. No \u201cTazarce\u2019\u2019 (tenure extension).\u201d\n\nBuhari adds: \u201cI don\u2019t want anybody to start talking about and campaigning for unconstitutional extension. I will not accept that.\u201d\n\nShehu said the President also promised to provide support to increase the role of technology in the nation\u2019s elections, arguing that the introduction of the card reader and electronic register was God\u2019s answer to his prayers, having been cheated of his victory in three previous elections.\n\n\u201cAfter the third so-called defeat, I said, \u2018God Dey\u2019. My opponents laughed at me but God answered my prayers by bringing in technology. At that point, nobody can steal their votes or buy them,\u201d Buhari was quoted as saying.\n\nThe President also said he would continue to abide by the constitution in all its ramifications, adding that he will at all times supervise and deal with his ministers on the same basis.\n\nHe also assured that he would improve the welfare of Nigerians: \u201cIn the balance of 18 months or so left of my time, whatever I can do to improve the life of Nigerians, I will do it for the country.\u201d\n\nThe President commended Diaspora Nigerians in the Kingdom for representing the country well and projecting its good image.\n\nShehu said Bhari used the opportunity to urge citizens at home to be fair to his administration at all times, asking the critics to compare the security situations in the North-east and South-south in 2015 and how things have improved as of now.\n\nHe quoted Buhari as saying, \u201cMy problem is the North-west where people are killing and stealing from one another. I had to be very hard on them and I will continue to be very hard until we put them in line and bring back order.\u201d\n\nHe said President Buhari urged Nigerians living in Saudi Arabia to remain law-abiding and do nothing to derogate from the many years of friendly and mutually beneficial relationships between the two countries.\n\nA leader of the community, Dr. Abdulkadir Maikudi, who spoke on behalf of the group, requested the President to assist the privately-run Nigerian International School in the Kingdom by equipping it to provide science and technical education.\n\nAt the meeting, the Nigerian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Yahaya Lawal, and the Consul-General in Jeddah, Ambassador Abdulkarim Mansur attested to the good conduct of the nearly 1.5 million Nigerians there.\n\nAccording to them, \u201cNigerian professionals are doing well and projecting a good image of our country.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*New NWC won\u2019t assume office until December 9 when Secondus\u2019 term ends\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Chuks Okocha in Abuja and Blessing Ibunge in Port Harcourt\n\nAn Appeal Court sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, yesterday dismissed the appeal of the suspended National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Uche Secondus seeking to restrain the party from conducting its National Convention, thus paving the way for the congress to commence today in Abuja.\n\nThe three-man panel dismissed the appeal which was filed on October 14, 2021, \u201cfor lacking in merit.\u201d\n\nWith the scare that the convention might be stopped by a court over, 3,600 delegates from all over the country will today converge on the Eagles Square, Abuja, to elect a new National Working Committee for the party.\n\nSecondus had approached the court of appeal to challenge his removal as chairman. He also sought an order of injunction restraining the PDP from holding its National Convention.\n\nThe judgement read by Justice Gabriel Kolawale, was unanimously endorsed by the other two members of the panel, who said the suit by Secondus was an afterthought and an abuse of court process.\n\nKolawole held that the attempt by the applicant to suspend the planned convention \u201cis an act of self-induced urgency to disrupt an ongoing lawful process of the party.\u201d\n\nHe wondered why the applicant waited for too long to seek the stoppage of the process which had been communicated to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).\n\nThe judge noted that Secondus did not oppose the notice of the convention written by the acting chairman of the party to INEC, \u201cneither did he oppose INEC\u2019s response to the party.\u201d\n\nThe court thus granted the PDP the right to hold its National Convention as scheduled.\n\nThe counsel to Secondus, Tayo Oyetibo said the outcome of the main appeal, which is challenging the removal of his client as chairman of the PDP, would determine whether or not they will appeal.\n\nMultiple court orders were issued against Secondus resulting in his removal from office, and the Deputy National Chairman (South), Yemi Akinwonmi, appointed in his stead.\n\nPDP Holds National Convention at Eagle Square\n\nMeanwhile, 3600 delegates will converge on the Eagles Square, Abuja, to elect a new National Working Committee (NWC).\n\nThe PDP flag has been hoisted at the Eagle Square, while banners and decorations adorned the area. A podium had also been assembled at the centre of the square.\n\nThe party said there would be affirmative vote cast for 21 of the 24 offices of the NWC today.\n\nThe party also said the new NWC to be elected would assume office on December 9, 2021.\n\nAddressing a press conference ahead of the convention, the Chairman of the National Convention Committee, Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State said 21 of the 24 offices were returned on consensus basis.\n\nAccording to Governor Fintiri, the offices that would be contested are that of the Deputy National Chairman (South), National Auditor and National Youth Leader.\n\nThe former national secretary of the party, Olagunsoye Oyinlola and Ambassador Taofeek Arapaja will be contesting for the office of the Deputy National Chairman (South).\n\nSpeaking on the ruling of the Court of Appeal, Fintiri said the new NWC would assume office when that of the old one ends.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere will be no vacuum because we\u2019re not truncating anybody\u2019s tenure. We only called for an early convention, but that does not mean because we are having early convention, we are also terminating the tenure of the present NWC. They will still be asked to serve their time until December 9. If anything, it will give them a better chance to interface and have a smooth transition.\u201d\n\nGovernor Fintiri said the affirmative votes would be through open secret, explaining that in line with INEC\u2019s guidelines, votes will be cast, adding that the convention had achieved 80 per cent consensus.\n\nFintiri said 3,600 delegates were expected to cast their votes for the incoming NWC members.\n\nHe said, \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re making efforts to reconcile most of our contestants so that we can streamline them and have a better Convention. This will improve our elective chances in 2023.\n\nTambuwual: NWC to Emerge Through Consensus\n\nThe Chairman of the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum and Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwual, has said he and his colleagues were working towards ensuring that all members of the new NWC of the party emerged via consensus.\n\nHe said this after a meeting of the PDP-GF in Abuja, late on Thursday.\n\nTambuwual said, \u201cWe have held the meeting of the PDP governors\u2019 forum. As you can see again, 13/13, all of us attended and the chairman of the convention committee brought us up to speed on how prepared they are for us to hold our convention.\n\n\u201cWe are also happy to say that part of what we discussed was the process of getting consensus during the convention.\n\n\u201cSo far, we can say with certainty that we have achieved not less than 80 per cent of that process and it is still ongoing\n\n\u201cWe are hoping that at the end of the day, we are going to have a hitch-free convention and possibly have all the candidates emerge via consensus.\n\n\u201cConsensus is part of democratic process and we are imbibing that in the interest of our party so that we can continue to have stability that will reposition the party, as we have always said, for the future.\u201d\n\nWike Hails Ruling\n\nRivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has lauded the court ruling that restored PDP\u2019s National Convention.\n\nWike said Secondus\u2019 attempt to scuttle the convention \u201cmakes him an enemy of the party.\u201d\n\nHe said no individual could derail the party\u2019s mission to rescue Nigeria.\n\nWike said: \u201cWhat Secondus is doing is to sabotage the efforts of Nigerians, the efforts of PDP from rescuing this country from the hand of the party that has failed the country. And it is not fair.\n\n\u201cThis is a party that has given you everything and there\u2019s nothing wrong in making sacrifice. Even if, assuming though not conceding, that anything was wrong, we expected that having achieved what you have achieved in your life from this party, there is nothing wrong in making sacrifice.\u201d\n\nAccording to Wike, PDP\u2019s convention starting today would be one of the best that has ever been conducted.\n\nHe asserted that Nigerians were expecting PDP to come out of the convention more united.\n\nWike said the party members, particularly the PDP governors, were more united because they had realised that Nigeria was in difficulty and that only a united PDP could wrest power from the APC.\n\n\u201cNigeria is in problem and we cannot do it alone.

          "title": "The naira and its many enemies",
          "text": "When you sow the wind, you reap the whirlwind. This always comes to mind anytime there is an outbreak of debate over the naira. It is a discussion we have been having since, I think, 1986 when Gen Ibrahim Babangida, then military president, launched the structural adjustment programme (SAP) essentially to develop the non-oil sectors. Nigeria was facing a debt crisis and a crippling revenue shortfall and wanted to take a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). After a nationwide debate in which Nigerians opposed it, Babangida, if I recall well, said we would not take the loan but would implement the conditionalities \u2014 which bordered on economic restructuring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil then, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fixed the exchange rate. The naira was always stronger than the dollar. From the advent of the oil boom of 1973 up till the introduction of SAP in 1986, a dollar was sold for between 60 kobo and 80 kobo at various points. There was no magic to it: we were swimming in dollars. Let me be more accurate: we were drowning in dollars. Petrodollars. The October 1973 attack on Egypt and Syria by Israel had led to the boycott of international oil market by Arab countries in protest and solidarity. This caused a cut in production by over five million barrels per day. The shortage saw global oil prices tripled between October 1973 and March 1974.\n\nThe crude oil that was selling for $3/barrel in 1973 was going for $12/barrel by December 1974. While our oil earnings in 1970 amounted to just $200 million, we started averaging $4bn per year from 1973 to 1978. The jump was intoxicating. That was the beginning of our problem, even though we thought we were having fun. Nigeria was hit by the Dutch Disease \u2014 an economic concept that describes a situation where a glut of petrodollars leads to a strong local currency, making imports cheaper and exports more expensive, and ultimately leading to deindustrialisation. It became cheaper to import a bottle of water than to make it in Nigeria. Our exports became uncompetitive.\n\nAfter a fall in oil prices in 1978/79 as a result of many developments \u2014 for instance, fuel-efficient cars were introduced by Japanese manufacturers, the US started exploring oil in the Gulf of Mexico and companies started a scheme of buying pool cars for their staff to reduce fuel consumption \u2014 the black gold was back on its feet in 1980. Nigeria earned $22.4bn that year alone and exchange rate was 55 kobo/$1. Of course, we resumed our extravagance and forgot about tomorrow. After all, are we not Nigerians? The global economic crisis of 1982 bit us badly. Oil revenue was down to $9.6bn. With the Dutch disease, we had become import-dependent and local factories were dying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is also this issue: torrential revenue from a natural resource crowds out other sources (such as cocoa and groundnuts) and creates a harmful dependency on one source. This seriously distorts an economy where everything revolves around government. Oil went from being 57.2% of our exports in 1970 to 92% in 1974 \u2014 and till this day. If we were earning forex from multiple sources, the fall in oil prices would not have hit us that hard. Oil wealth encourages lazy, wasteful and extravagant behaviours: from expanding the size of government to acquiring tastes for foreign goods. When oil prices rise, we lose our heads. When they fall, we gnash our teeth. This is the story of our lives.\n\nWhile the trouble went on, exchange rate remained at roughly 60 kobo/$ while our reserves were getting depleted to keep the naira alive. From a fairly handsome reserves kitty of $10bn in 1980, we had only $1bn by 1982. We were no longer creditworthy to import goods, particularly food items. A country with massive arable land that should be producing and exporting things like rice and milk had become hopelessly dependent on food imports. Manufacturers had little or no forex to import raw materials and spare parts. Shutdowns and retrenchment were inevitable. The import licensing regime \u2014 introduced to allocate forex to manufacturers \u2014 was hijacked by politicians and cronies.\n\nWhat happened next? Many of the favoured receivers of forex from the CBN diverted it to the streets for the arbitrage \u2014 and the black market, or parallel market, was born. We have been living with this anomaly since 1982. Why? The fundamental problems have remained the same: we are import-dependent and we do not earn enough forex to import and the forex coming into the economy are mainly from oil exports and the revenue goes to the government and government is virtually the only source of forex supply and the CBN remains the central figure in determining the allocation and the rate at which the forex will be bought and sold. And so on and so forth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe introduction of the second-tier foreign exchange market (SFEM) by Babangida in 1986 was an attempt to cage the black market. The first-tier rate, fixed at N1/$ (99 kobo actually), was solely for the government. The second tier was for other forex users. Officially, the government wanted a currency that would be traded freely at SFEM to eliminate arbitrage. In reality, the naira lost value. It started trading at N4/$ on its debut. It has not stopped losing value since then. It is now N411/$. Why? The fundamental problems have remained the same: we are import-dependent and we do not earn enough forex to import and the forex coming into the economy are mainly from oil exports\u2026\n\nNow that the naira is seriously challenged yet again, the question for me remains: has anything changed to give us hope that we will reach stability at a point? You cannot be earning $1 from exports and needing $2 to pay your import bills and think your currency will be stable, especially as you are stuck with one major export whose price you don\u2019t determine. That is why many economists insist the naira is overvalued: when demand is higher than supply, price adjustment is a natural consequence. The government knows this and has been adjusting the rates, albeit not at the pace and rate some would want it. The exchange rate was N155/$ in 2014. It is now officially N411/$.\n\nThere would never be an end to devaluation as long as the economic structure remains as it is. The naira will continue to be severely challenged as long as the relationship between forex outflows and forex inflows is unhealthy. Cost of living will keep rising as we keep depending on imported goods, especially food. And except we improve the standard of living of Nigerians, poverty, unemployment, disease and crime will continue to hurt us. Inequality will worsen. We need to be clear on this. That is why it breaks my heart that, confronted with this dire situation, we are still enmeshed in wasteful spending and brazen corruption. Nobody should be surprised that Nigeria is like this.\n\nWhat I have observed is that per time, there are many enemies fighting the naira. I put the blame squarely at the feet of the government. Or, more appropriately, leadership. I am not going to sit here and start lamenting over the errors we made in the 1970s when we started drowning in petrodollars. There is nothing we can do about that. We mismanaged the opportunity. We cannot turn back the hand of time. But some of our policy failings since we started facing economic crises in the 1980s have not be helpful. We need to seriously address these failings, otherwise the value of the naira will continue to tumble without much benefits to the economy and the people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will pick just three \u201cenemies\u201d for discussion in this article. One, local refining. The biggest pressure on forex today is from importation of petroleum products \u2014 petrol, diesel and aviation fuel in particular. What we are doing, essentially, is export oil and then use most of the forex earnings to import refined products. How on earth can the naira not keep losing value? Take away the fuel import component of forex demand today and there would be a huge relief for the naira. In the past, some of us advised that the government should build refineries so that we would stop importing products. We were told it was the job of the private sector to build refineries. Here we are.\n\nI understood the deregulation and privatisation bits of the argument very well, but I was pursuing what in my opinion was a more realistic position: private sector investors wanted the pricing mechanism of petroleum products free of government control, otherwise they would not sink their capital into building refineries. Yet, freeing fuel pricing was going to be at heavy social and political costs. My proposal then was that to kickstart the process, government should build refineries, lease out the management, fulfil local consumption, and even start exporting to earn forex from both crude and products, and then sell off the refineries to core investors and on the stock exchange.\n\nA very influential oil company executive called and \u201ctutored\u201d me that there was little difference between importing petroleum products and local refining. \u201cSimon,\u201d he said in a clearly patronising tone, \u201cthe difference is just in shipping cost, which is negligible. Shipping is the cheapest mode of transportation in the world.\u201d But when you spend about 50% of your oil income to import petroleum products, of course there is a huge difference: your forex reserves will get depleted and the naira will come under attack, minus the fact that you are shutting out manufacturers and other forex users. If we were not importing products but refining locally, the story would be different.\n\nThe second enemy is the state of our education and third is the health care system. According to the CBN, these two items gulp billions of dollars every year. We all know that the quality of education and health care in the country has gone down over time because of poor, inept and selfish leadership at different levels. This is worsened by the constant strikes. Anyone who can afford to school abroad or seek foreign treatment will not miss the chance. The forex demand for these two items puts significant and avoidable pressure on our forex reserves and humiliates the naira. I can go on and on, but I have chosen these three items because I believe we can easily relate with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIronically, it wouldn\u2019t really matter if the exchange rate was N1000/$ if we were productive. The real issue would be the quality of life the currency can give to Nigerians and that goes to deeper structural issues and the size of the economy against our population. The Indonesian rupiah is 14,228/$1 but the GDP per head (purchasing power) is $12,800. Ours is $5,250. Indonesia is industrialised, produces most of what it eats and exports palm oil, steel, textiles, and automobiles, etc. Apart from oil, what else can Nigeria sell to the world? How can we become better educated, healthier, secure and more productive? Our journey to development is still a very long one.\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nPOLICE POLLS\n\nThey say politics is a game of numbers. So also is security for elections in our troubled country. Ahead of the November 6 governorship poll in Anambra state, the deployment of security personnel is massive in view of the situation in the south-east which curtailed campaign rallies and led to low-key electioneering. The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) says it will have 20,000 officers on the ground. The police have announced the deployment of five AIGs, 14 CPs, 31 DCPs and 34,587 officers. While this is intended to assure residents that they are safe in the midst of threats by the separatist Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), it can equally scare voters away. Catch-22.\n\nCOVID COST\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe federal government will have to review its international travel protocols because something just doesn\u2019t sound right, except there is a financial motive. The United Kingdom has finally recognised the integrity of our COVID-19 vaccination and no longer requires a pre-departure PCR test for those travelling on Nigerian passports. They are only required to do a Day 2 test on arrival. Curiously, Nigeria has failed to reciprocate this gesture. Fully vaccinated travellers to Nigeria are still required to do pre-departure tests as well as Day 2 test on arrival. For a country that wants to get more people jobbed, full vaccination for international travels can be an incentive for some. Rethink.\n\nPUBLIC PROPERTY\n\nNow, wait for this: the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) says it has recovered 301 \u201cillegally acquired\u201d houses from two public officials in the federal capital territory (FCT). I don\u2019t think Mr Bolaji Owasanoye, ICPC chairman, needed to put the \u201cillegally acquired\u201d phrase in his revelation.

          "title": "The naira and its many enemies",
          "text": "When you sow the wind, you reap the whirlwind. This always comes to mind anytime there is an outbreak of debate over the naira. It is a discussion we have been having since, I think, 1986 when Gen Ibrahim Babangida, then military president, launched the structural adjustment programme (SAP) essentially to develop the non-oil sectors. Nigeria was facing a debt crisis and a crippling revenue shortfall and wanted to take a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). After a nationwide debate in which Nigerians opposed it, Babangida, if I recall well, said we would not take the loan but would implement the conditionalities \u2014 which bordered on economic restructuring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil then, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fixed the exchange rate. The naira was always stronger than the dollar. From the advent of the oil boom of 1973 up till the introduction of SAP in 1986, a dollar was sold for between 60 kobo and 80 kobo at various points. There was no magic to it: we were swimming in dollars. Let me be more accurate: we were drowning in dollars. Petrodollars. The October 1973 attack on Egypt and Syria by Israel had led to the boycott of international oil market by Arab countries in protest and solidarity. This caused a cut in production by over five million barrels per day. The shortage saw global oil prices tripled between October 1973 and March 1974.\n\nThe crude oil that was selling for $3/barrel in 1973 was going for $12/barrel by December 1974. While our oil earnings in 1970 amounted to just $200 million, we started averaging $4bn per year from 1973 to 1978. The jump was intoxicating. That was the beginning of our problem, even though we thought we were having fun. Nigeria was hit by the Dutch Disease \u2014 an economic concept that describes a situation where a glut of petrodollars leads to a strong local currency, making imports cheaper and exports more expensive, and ultimately leading to deindustrialisation. It became cheaper to import a bottle of water than to make it in Nigeria. Our exports became uncompetitive.\n\nAfter a fall in oil prices in 1978/79 as a result of many developments \u2014 for instance, fuel-efficient cars were introduced by Japanese manufacturers, the US started exploring oil in the Gulf of Mexico and companies started a scheme of buying pool cars for their staff to reduce fuel consumption \u2014 the black gold was back on its feet in 1980. Nigeria earned $22.4bn that year alone and exchange rate was 55 kobo/$1. Of course, we resumed our extravagance and forgot about tomorrow. After all, are we not Nigerians? The global economic crisis of 1982 bit us badly. Oil revenue was down to $9.6bn. With the Dutch disease, we had become import-dependent and local factories were dying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is also this issue: torrential revenue from a natural resource crowds out other sources (such as cocoa and groundnuts) and creates a harmful dependency on one source. This seriously distorts an economy where everything revolves around government. Oil went from being 57.2% of our exports in 1970 to 92% in 1974 \u2014 and till this day. If we were earning forex from multiple sources, the fall in oil prices would not have hit us that hard. Oil wealth encourages lazy, wasteful and extravagant behaviours: from expanding the size of government to acquiring tastes for foreign goods. When oil prices rise, we lose our heads. When they fall, we gnash our teeth. This is the story of our lives.\n\nWhile the trouble went on, exchange rate remained at roughly 60 kobo/$ while our reserves were getting depleted to keep the naira alive. From a fairly handsome reserves kitty of $10bn in 1980, we had only $1bn by 1982. We were no longer creditworthy to import goods, particularly food items. A country with massive arable land that should be producing and exporting things like rice and milk had become hopelessly dependent on food imports. Manufacturers had little or no forex to import raw materials and spare parts. Shutdowns and retrenchment were inevitable. The import licensing regime \u2014 introduced to allocate forex to manufacturers \u2014 was hijacked by politicians and cronies.\n\nWhat happened next? Many of the favoured receivers of forex from the CBN diverted it to the streets for the arbitrage \u2014 and the black market, or parallel market, was born. We have been living with this anomaly since 1982. Why? The fundamental problems have remained the same: we are import-dependent and we do not earn enough forex to import and the forex coming into the economy are mainly from oil exports and the revenue goes to the government and government is virtually the only source of forex supply and the CBN remains the central figure in determining the allocation and the rate at which the forex will be bought and sold. And so on and so forth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe introduction of the second-tier foreign exchange market (SFEM) by Babangida in 1986 was an attempt to cage the black market. The first-tier rate, fixed at N1/$ (99 kobo actually), was solely for the government. The second tier was for other forex users. Officially, the government wanted a currency that would be traded freely at SFEM to eliminate arbitrage. In reality, the naira lost value. It started trading at N4/$ on its debut. It has not stopped losing value since then. It is now N411/$. Why? The fundamental problems have remained the same: we are import-dependent and we do not earn enough forex to import and the forex coming into the economy are mainly from oil exports\u2026\n\nNow that the naira is seriously challenged yet again, the question for me remains: has anything changed to give us hope that we will reach stability at a point? You cannot be earning $1 from exports and needing $2 to pay your import bills and think your currency will be stable, especially as you are stuck with one major export whose price you don\u2019t determine. That is why many economists insist the naira is overvalued: when demand is higher than supply, price adjustment is a natural consequence. The government knows this and has been adjusting the rates, albeit not at the pace and rate some would want it. The exchange rate was N155/$ in 2014. It is now officially N411/$.\n\nThere would never be an end to devaluation as long as the economic structure remains as it is. The naira will continue to be severely challenged as long as the relationship between forex outflows and forex inflows is unhealthy. Cost of living will keep rising as we keep depending on imported goods, especially food. And except we improve the standard of living of Nigerians, poverty, unemployment, disease and crime will continue to hurt us. Inequality will worsen. We need to be clear on this. That is why it breaks my heart that, confronted with this dire situation, we are still enmeshed in wasteful spending and brazen corruption. Nobody should be surprised that Nigeria is like this.\n\nWhat I have observed is that per time, there are many enemies fighting the naira. I put the blame squarely at the feet of the government. Or, more appropriately, leadership. I am not going to sit here and start lamenting over the errors we made in the 1970s when we started drowning in petrodollars. There is nothing we can do about that. We mismanaged the opportunity. We cannot turn back the hand of time. But some of our policy failings since we started facing economic crises in the 1980s have not be helpful. We need to seriously address these failings, otherwise the value of the naira will continue to tumble without much benefits to the economy and the people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI will pick just three \u201cenemies\u201d for discussion in this article. One, local refining. The biggest pressure on forex today is from importation of petroleum products \u2014 petrol, diesel and aviation fuel in particular. What we are doing, essentially, is export oil and then use most of the forex earnings to import refined products. How on earth can the naira not keep losing value? Take away the fuel import component of forex demand today and there would be a huge relief for the naira. In the past, some of us advised that the government should build refineries so that we would stop importing products. We were told it was the job of the private sector to build refineries. Here we are.\n\nI understood the deregulation and privatisation bits of the argument very well, but I was pursuing what in my opinion was a more realistic position: private sector investors wanted the pricing mechanism of petroleum products free of government control, otherwise they would not sink their capital into building refineries. Yet, freeing fuel pricing was going to be at heavy social and political costs. My proposal then was that to kickstart the process, government should build refineries, lease out the management, fulfil local consumption, and even start exporting to earn forex from both crude and products, and then sell off the refineries to core investors and on the stock exchange.\n\nA very influential oil company executive called and \u201ctutored\u201d me that there was little difference between importing petroleum products and local refining. \u201cSimon,\u201d he said in a clearly patronising tone, \u201cthe difference is just in shipping cost, which is negligible. Shipping is the cheapest mode of transportation in the world.\u201d But when you spend about 50% of your oil income to import petroleum products, of course there is a huge difference: your forex reserves will get depleted and the naira will come under attack, minus the fact that you are shutting out manufacturers and other forex users. If we were not importing products but refining locally, the story would be different.\n\nThe second enemy is the state of our education and third is the health care system. According to the CBN, these two items gulp billions of dollars every year. We all know that the quality of education and health care in the country has gone down over time because of poor, inept and selfish leadership at different levels. This is worsened by the constant strikes. Anyone who can afford to school abroad or seek foreign treatment will not miss the chance. The forex demand for these two items puts significant and avoidable pressure on our forex reserves and humiliates the naira. I can go on and on, but I have chosen these three items because I believe we can easily relate with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIronically, it wouldn\u2019t really matter if the exchange rate was N1000/$ if we were productive. The real issue would be the quality of life the currency can give to Nigerians and that goes to deeper structural issues and the size of the economy against our population. The Indonesian rupiah is 14,228/$1 but the GDP per head (purchasing power) is $12,800. Ours is $5,250. Indonesia is industrialised, produces most of what it eats and exports palm oil, steel, textiles, and automobiles, etc. Apart from oil, what else can Nigeria sell to the world? How can we become better educated, healthier, secure and more productive? Our journey to development is still a very long one.\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nPOLICE POLLS\n\nThey say politics is a game of numbers. So also is security for elections in our troubled country. Ahead of the November 6 governorship poll in Anambra state, the deployment of security personnel is massive in view of the situation in the south-east which curtailed campaign rallies and led to low-key electioneering. The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) says it will have 20,000 officers on the ground. The police have announced the deployment of five AIGs, 14 CPs, 31 DCPs and 34,587 officers. While this is intended to assure residents that they are safe in the midst of threats by the separatist Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), it can equally scare voters away. Catch-22.\n\nCOVID COST\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe federal government will have to review its international travel protocols because something just doesn\u2019t sound right, except there is a financial motive. The United Kingdom has finally recognised the integrity of our COVID-19 vaccination and no longer requires a pre-departure PCR test for those travelling on Nigerian passports. They are only required to do a Day 2 test on arrival. Curiously, Nigeria has failed to reciprocate this gesture. Fully vaccinated travellers to Nigeria are still required to do pre-departure tests as well as Day 2 test on arrival. For a country that wants to get more people jobbed, full vaccination for international travels can be an incentive for some. Rethink.\n\nPUBLIC PROPERTY\n\nNow, wait for this: the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) says it has recovered 301 \u201cillegally acquired\u201d houses from two public officials in the federal capital territory (FCT). I don\u2019t think Mr Bolaji Owasanoye, ICPC chairman, needed to put the \u201cillegally acquired\u201d phrase in his revelation. There is no way they would have acquired 301 houses legally and legitimately. We generally know that real estate is the biggest arena for money laundering globally. What we don\u2019t know is what will happen to these two public officials. It would be very good for ICPC to be making these startling revelations in court, supported with diligent prosecution. Imperative.\n\nDRUG DEVILS\n\nProf Mojisola Adeyeye, the director-general of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), recently lamented that \u201ccabals\u201d, capitalising on the removal of the agency from the ports between 2011 and 2016, are behind the influx of fake and substandard drugs into the country.

          "text": "Facebook on Thursday, October 28 announced that it has changed its company name to Meta. This change of name was announced by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook\u2019s annual Connect augmented and virtual reality conference.\n\nThe company said it chose the name \u201cMeta\u201d to serve as a reminder that there is always more to build. The rebrand is part of the company\u2019s efforts to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse \u2014 a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.\n\n\u201cRight now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can\u2019t possibly represent everything that we\u2019re doing today, let alone in the future,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cOver time, I hope that we are seen as a metaverse company, and I want to anchor our work and identity on what we\u2019re building toward.\u201d\n\nPer The Verge, \u201cZuckerberg owns the Twitter handle @meta and meta.com, which now redirects to a welcome page on Facebook outlining the changes. The site previously redirected to meta.org, a biomedical research discovery tool that was a project of the Chan Zuckerberg Science Initiative. That\u2019s part of the philanthropic arm Zuckerberg co-founded with his physician wife, Priscilla Chan, in 2015. In a Medium post on Thursday, the group says it\u2019s sunsetting Meta.org on March 31st, 2022.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going to change?\n\nAs expected, the new name implies that some things about the way Facebook operates would change. Facebook said its corporate structure is not changing, however, how the company reports its financials will. Starting with results for the fourth quarter of 2021, Facebook plans to report on two operating segments: Family of Apps and Reality Labs. The company also said that it will change its stock ticker from FB to MVRS, effective December 1. In addition, Facebook assured users that the announcement does not affect how the company uses or shares data.\n\nAt the Connect conference, Facebook also announced new tools to help people build for the metaverse, including Presence Platform, which will enable new mixed reality experiences on Quest 2, and a $150-million investment in immersive learning to train the next generation of creators.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that within the next decade, the metaverse will reach a billion people, host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce, and support jobs for millions of creators and developers,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in a letter on Thursday.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "title": "Beyond investing in African startups, Kepple Africa Ventures is creating new industries",
          "text": "For Satoshi Shinada, taking bets and investing is not something he just started doing.\n\nAt the age of 18, he took his first bet to invest in himself by leaving Japan to visit 40 African countries in the space of almost two years. I know what you\u2019re thinking: \u201cThat\u2019s bold! Why did he do this?\u201d I had the same thought too, so I asked him about it.\n\n\u201cI was born and raised in Japan, so I wanted to expose myself to a different environment and culture. I also loved reading stories of adventures which exposed me to stories about Africa,\u201d he told me over a Zoom call.\n\nHow was he able to afford the trip? He had just won a pact he made with his grandma. The deal was if he got admitted to the best university in Japan, the University of Tokyo, she\u2019d give him an allowance. It turned out to be an allowance of $10,000.\n\nIn hindsight, Shinada believes he used the money for a better endeavour: instead of buying items, he bought experience. His experience crisscrossing Africa taught him that, even among diverse cultures, trading is a common language.\n\nBefore making the trip around Africa, he was conflicted on whether to become a researcher or a businessman. At the end of the trip, he had chosen to become a businessman.\n\nIn 2010, upon graduation from college, Shinada joined Sojitz, a Japanese company that led investment in infrastructure and energy projects in West Africa. At Sojitz, he was in charge of developing and investing in infrastructure and energy projects like the first desalination project in sub-Saharan Africa at a commercial scale. After seven years on the job, he itched to do something different.\n\nHe took some time off to return to Japan before heading to Harvard Business School for his MBA. Afterwards, he returned to Africa as a general partner at Kepple Africa Ventures.\n\n\u201cWhile at Sojitz, I had started becoming interested in Nigerian entrepreneurs starting their own businesses. I saw a lot of Africans who studied or lived in Europe and the US coming back to their home countries to start businesses that leveraged on new technologies. This was the opposite of the brain drain. I knew I had to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: How did Kepple Africa Ventures start?\n\nSatoshi Shinada: The origin of Kepple dates back to when Takahiro Kanzaki, a certified public accountant, left KPMG to provide accounting and back-office support for startups in Japan. After a few years, he saw that his startups turned out to be well-established companies and unicorns. So, he came up with the idea of creating Fundboard, a portfolio management software-as-a-service (SaaS) company for venture capitalists and private equity firms.\n\nAs a result of that decision, today Kepple is at the centre of the startup community in Japan with this tool. This provided Kepple with access to a network of investors to raise $18 million for Kepple Africa Ventures.\n\nThere are three persons involved in Kepple Africa ventures. Takahiro Kanzaki is in charge of fundraising from Japanese investors. Ryosuke Yamawaki handles investing in East and Southern African startups while I focus on investing in West and North African startups. Yamawaki started investing in Kenyan startups in 2018 while I started doing the same in Nigeria the following year.\n\nDA: What\u2019s Kepple\u2019s investment thesis?\n\nSS: Kepple Africa Ventures came to bridge two gaps. The first was the deep gap between seed and Series A because investors are very fragmented. We wanted to become an anchor investor in the seed stage for startups in Africa.\n\nThe second was, we wanted to bridge the mismatch between what African startups needed and the type of investors available in the ecosystem. We wanted to solve this problem by bringing more Japanese companies to invest directly in African startups and providing strategic support/capital, and in the end becoming an acquirer of the startups.\n\nIn Africa, you usually find financial investors and impact-driven social investors from Europe or the US, but you don\u2019t find lots of strategic investors. These strategic investors are supported by the existing big businesses. They drive the growth of the startups through partnerships and end up even acquiring startups and giving exit opportunities to the ecosystems. You\u2019ll find more of these strategic investors in India or Southeast Asia than in Africa.\n\nSo far, we\u2019ve already facilitated Japanese companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to directly invest in our portfolio companies. In the past 10 months, we\u2019ve brought four or five Japanese companies to directly invest into our portfolio companies.\n\nDA: Hmm, that\u2019s good to hear. What do you look for in the companies you invest in?\n\nSS: First, I\u2019d like to point out that our big vision is to create new industries from Africa. So we don\u2019t consider our investment standalone. We want to create clusters of businesses that become new industries in Africa.\n\nNow to answer your question, we lookout for the quality of the founders; they have to have a big vision to tackle real problems. Beyond having a big vision, they need to understand the biggest pain points of their customers. And why I say so is that in Africa it\u2019s easy to mix up individual pains and social pains. For instance, deciding to tackle the pain point of poverty in Africa, although an important issue, doesn\u2019t really help you to monetise your business model. Africa is also a place where it is very difficult to make people pay for your service.\n\nSo, your service or product should be really laser-focused on the biggest pain points of your customers and then you monetise that solution. We are not charity investors; we are commercial investors, so monetisation and revenue growth are very important.\n\nDA: Are there any sectors you prefer to invest in?\n\nSS: We\u2019re sector agnostic, but we filter the startups we invest in based on four investment pillars. The first pillar is startups helping to complement or supplement the lack of public infrastructure. For example, we invested in a company called Flare. They are building an ambulance network for Africa. You know in Africa it\u2019s difficult to access a reliable ambulance network, but by providing an Uber-like platform to the owners of ambulances and hospitals, they can create that kind of public service infrastructure of the ambulance network to make people\u2019s lives better and safer.\n\nThe second pillar is startups that help businesses to digitise their operations and production, and make them more efficient. In this case, I\u2019m talking about helping companies with a business-to-business (B2B) model, because in Africa, business-to-consumer (B2C) models are not as active as other markets in Southeast Asia or India.\n\nThe third pillar is focused on startups pioneering innovation where Africa does not have legacy infrastructure yet. Sometimes you can find leapfrogging technology from Africa and that technology could be applicable to other parts of the world. An example of this is one of our portfolio companies called Shyft Power in Nigeria. They automate the management of different power sources: grid of generators, solar power or batteries. They could commercialise this technology because in Nigeria many people don\u2019t rely solely on power from the grid.\n\nIt\u2019s not the same in Japan. If we need to develop that technology in Japan, we have to create a very artificial environment where power is not stable enough. Interestingly, in Japan we are seeing more solar power sources being introduced in each home and now they need to get this power generated by solar to be combined with the power coming from the grid and sell to their communities.\n\nTo wrap this up, the fourth pillar is about startups that facilitate African content created by Africans for Africans. That\u2019s why we have invested in a company like Mdundo, which is seen as the African version of Spotify. We\u2019ve also invested in a company called Athlst, which publishes first-person narratives of African athletes from around the world.\n\nSatoshi Shinada, Maya Tada ( team member at Kepple Africa) and Lanre Aina, Co-Founder/CEO of ATHLST\n\nDA: You\u2019ve invested in almost 100 startups within 3 years. That\u2019s unusual. Why?\n\nSS: Yes, it\u2019s intentional for a number of reasons. We didn\u2019t start out early in VC investing in Africa; we entered this market in 2018. But I think we came to the market at the right time. When we came in, the ecosystem had matured, so we thought it would make sense to bet on great startups quickly.\n\nOur swift approach is modelled after one of the most successful VCs in Southeast Asia, BeeNext. BeeNext makes most of its returns from follow-up investments. So their first cheque is to get their feet in so many startups so they become an insider and know what\u2019s going on in their portfolio companies. Once they see signs of exponential growth, they double down on their investment.\n\nAnother reason we invested in many startups was that we were new to the ecosystem, so we had to establish a reputation by increasing our presence so that we would access greater deal flow. Moving very fast and efficiently did that for us.\n\nFurthermore, we wanted to challenge the perception that Japanese companies are slow. Japanese companies are notoriously known for their very slow decision-making process, compared to Indian or Chinese companies.\n\nDA: How have you been able to combine speed and quality while investing in startups?\n\nSS: That\u2019s a good question, It\u2019s always a balance between the quality and the speed. If you\u2019re investing in seed-stage startups, you don\u2019t have to do very detailed due diligence because one day the startup can decide to change its entire business model. This rarely happens in Series A. You just need to do more detailed due diligence on their product, tech, corporate governance and the founder.\n\nFor the seed-stage deals, it\u2019s more based on your conviction and trust in the founders. If you can build enough trust and conviction, with the minimum amount of due diligence, you should go ahead. And that\u2019s the strategy we took: we usually spend less than one month for due diligence when we invest in seed-stage deals. The quickest investment we\u2019ve made took two weeks, from the first introductory call to wiring the capital.\n\nDA: Tell me about some mistakes you\u2019ve made?\n\nSS: I\u2019ve made a number of mistakes. One that stands out is investing in some startups that are trying to solve too many problems at the same time. It looks beautiful because the startup is solving everything and it involves different stakeholders in that sector. But a downside to this is that the startup struggles with monetisation for lack of understanding about their customer\u2019s biggest pain point.\n\nAnother mistake that I made is caring too much about how we can connect startups with Japanese companies. A while back, some of the startups we brought to Japan got lots of attention from Japanese companies, but because the startups are at an early stage, the Japanese companies couldn\u2019t invest. So we decided to be the first investor with these startups. But, as you know, when your investment decision is driven by excitement and not purely commercial criteria, it distorts healthy decision-making.\n\nDA: Have you had any bad experiences with the startups? Has any startup in your portfolio gone bankrupt?\n\nSS: I don\u2019t have any business that went bankrupt in my portfolio companies.\n\nWe\u2019ve had two companies that stopped operating, but it\u2019s not like the founders just disappeared. We understood how it happened and the founders were serious enough to explain to us what\u2019s going on. One of them even gave back 100% of the money that we invested. So, it wasn\u2019t a very bad situation.\n\nInitially, we thought we\u2019d have many cases of the stories you hear about startups going under or disappearing because our investment has been driven more by conviction and trust with our founders than anything else, but that\u2019s not happening yet. I think this is great validation.\n\nSatoshi Shinada, Maya Tada and the co-founders of Releaf\n\nDA: I see on your website it says you\u2019ve stopped accepting applications. What\u2019s happening?\n\nSS: Yes, that\u2019s true. Now we are in transition to our fund two. So we temporarily stopped accepting applications, but we still keep the form open and get about three to four applications per day. We think it\u2019s very important to keep our doors open to any new startups.\n\nInterestingly, about 85% of our investments was made into the startup that was introduced by one of our portfolio companies, or other co-investors. So the referral is the most important source of the deals. But if you just rely on that, you might miss someone coming from outside the network. So, we want to keep that door open for the outside.\n\nDA: What\u2019s your ticket size?\n\nSS: We are focused on seed-stage deals. Our first cheque is between $50K and150K. Once we invest, we look at the revenue growth in our portfolio companies, and if it shows very dramatic growth, we will do a follow-up investment, which could be somewhere between $200K to $1 million. Where we invest $1 million, it would be a syndicate between other Japanese investors.\n\nDA: Talking about Japanese investors, are there any other Japanese investors in Africa?\n\nSS: There are a few other Japanese VCs, but unfortunately, none of them have their cooperation in Africa. They just go back and forth between Japan and Africa; they\u2019re remote investors.\n\nCompared to them, we think of ourselves as very much committed to Africa because of our background of doing business in Africa. We\u2019ve noticed that a number of them just copy our investment deals. We don\u2019t like this and aren\u2019t comfortable with people just copying us while we\u2019re on the ground bearing the cost of making investments.\n\nDA: Hmm, so why are there not so many Japanese investors on the ground like Kepple?\n\nSS: Well, I think it\u2019s not as a result of the lack of capital or lack of willingness from the Japanese investors to invest in Africa; it\u2019s more about the shortage of capable and experienced talents who can manage the funds in Africa. It\u2019s very difficult to find talent who understand the African market and who can commit their lives to Africa.\n\nI\u2019m single, so it\u2019s very easy for me to move around, but my partner Ryosuke, who is based in Kenya, had to bring his wife and two kids along with him. He\u2019s really committed. His family has been around for a while such that his kids now speak Swahili.\n\nShare this article\n\nDaniel Adeyemi | Author @Danieltadeyemi",

          "text": "Nigeria became the first country in Africa to launch a central bank digital currency (CBDC) this week after President Muhammadu Buhari unveiled the eNaira at the State House in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nIssued by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the digital currency is built on a private blockchain technology developed by Bitt Inc and has the same value as the fiat or physical currency.\n\nThe new currency can be accessed and used via the eNaira wallet (named \u201cSpeed\u201d), a digital storage held and managed on a distributed ledger. The wallet is available for download via app stores like Google Play Store and Apple App Store.\n\nHowever, questions remain about the use cases of the eNaira.\n\neNaira use cases\n\nFinancial institutions are responsible for onboarding their customers and integrating the eNaira wallet feature into their digital banking channels.\n\nFor individuals and merchants/businesses, the wallet is required to access, hold and use the eNaira. Users can also dial a USSD shortcode and follow the required steps to perform transactions.\n\nGoing by CBN\u2019s guidelines, the requirements for opening a wallet, transaction and balance limits, as well as transaction types available, are based on the wallet tier a user belongs to.\n\nThe dedicated individual wallet for eNaira recorded over 100,000 downloads on Google Play Store less than 48 hours after its rollout, according to reports, before it was removed following a series of complaints and poor ratings. The merchant version had been downloaded more than 10,000 times.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFor now, eNaira transaction types available to individual consumers via the wallet include person-to-person (P2P) transfers between friends and family; person-to-business (P2B) to pay for goods or services; and person-to-government (P2G) to pay for public services.\n\nNigerians can also transfer cash from bank accounts to the eNaira speed wallet and vice versa, receive support allowance directly from the CBN through government-to-person (G2P) transfers and carry out any other services as may be approved by the CBN from time to time.\n\nUsing the wallet, merchants can send money to their bank accounts and vice versa, as well as carry out merchant/business-to-person (M/B2P) transfers. Merchants also have to sweep their balance(s) into their bank accounts on a daily basis.\n\neNaira Merchant speed wallets can thus be used for receiving and making eNaira payments for goods and services as well as salary payments.\n\nCommercial banks like Stanbic IBTC and Guaranty Trust Bank already have how-to instructions on their websites. According to the banks, the wallet guarantees secure, faster, cheaper, and more convenient transactions for individual and merchant users.\n\nIn the long run, CBN envisions a scenario where financial institutions build an ecosystem of services, such as cross-border transfers, with eNaira as the base product. For instance, a Nigerian trader with a UBA account will be able to settle his import bills from China using eNaira.\n\nThe digital currency could also bring a significant majority of Nigerians without bank accounts into the formal financial economy. The minimum requirement for opening a tier 0 wallet is a phone number while the tier 1 category requires a mobile number and verified national identity number (NIN).\n\nThus, a plumber or vulcaniser in Oyo or Cross River State without a bank account can accept payments via his phone, store them in his wallet, and make transactions with any vendor.\n\nThe eNaira wallet tiers and conditions. Image credit: CBN whitepaper\n\nThe eNaira project will be implemented in phases. Image credit: CBN whitepaper\n\nIn addition, the CBN plans to integrate the eNaira into its forex process via international money transfer operators (IMTOs) to enable Nigerians easily receive remittances.\n\nTransactions on the eNaira platform are free for the first 90 days from Monday, after which banks will revert to applicable charges as outlined in the CBN\u2019s guide.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Estonian on-demand transportation company, Bolt, plans to launch electric taxi services in South Africa four months after introducing e-bike food delivery services in the country.\n\nBolt\u2019s plan comes on the heels of launching a \u201cgreen category,\u201d which allows riders to hail an electric or hybrid vehicle.\n\nHow would this be done? Per TechCrunch, Bolt plans to partner with banks in its African markets to assist its drivers in obtaining credit for buying electric vehicles and is exploring alternatives to its current scheme with leasing companies.\n\nThe company, which has operations in 45 countries \u2013 including seven in Africa \u2013 was launched in 2013 by Markus Villig, Bolt CEO.\n\nWhat does Bolt do? The company offers a variety of services such as ride-hailing, car, scooter, and bike rentals, food delivery, and, most recently, grocery delivery, branding itself as a transport and deliveries company.\n\nBesides, Bolt recently launched its food delivery service in Nigeria, and it has expanded its reach in South Africa to Johannesburg after moving to Cape Town in 2020.\n\nIs this familiar? Yes. The company provides a green card option in Kenya and also operates e-bike food delivery.\n\nThe company also plans to introduce food delivery e-mobility options in other East African markets, including Uganda and Tanzania.\n\naYo to modify business model to fuel growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Assistant on the Nokia \u2018Banana\u2019 8110 feature phone. Image: Screenshot from \u2018How KaiOS Is Becoming the 3rd Major Mobile OS\u2019.\n\naYo Holdings, a micro-insurance joint venture between MTN and Momentum Metropolitan Holdings (MMH), announced yesterday, Thursday, October 28th, 2021, that it will be transforming its technology backend and data management approach.\n\nWhat does this mean? This means aYo will be modifying its business model.\n\nWhy? The company plans to drive greater scale, better customer experience, and faster access to markets across the African continent in the coming years.\n\nWhy should you care? Launched in 2017, aYo offers hospital and life cover in Zambia, Uganda, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. Also, the company says it currently has more than 15 million customers.\n\nMarius Botha, aYo Holdings CEO, said the company\u2019s vision is to become Africa\u2019s largest financial services technology platform by enabling the distribution of a diverse range of affordable and accessible microfinance products.\n\naYo and its shareholder, MTN, as of the time of writing, are currently finalising the details of a partnership with a new insurance group to gain access to more underwriter licenses and expand its product range and market penetration.\n\nAs part of this technological evolution, aYo has shifted to a cloud data warehousing approach, employing Snowflake as a solution to deal with growing volumes of customer data.\n\nBotha said, \u201cData is a key asset that we want to grow and leverage, as it will allow us to drive better outcomes and value for our customers.\u201d\n\naYo believes that experimenting with cutting-edge technologies will help them achieve their goal of providing disenfranchised Africans with access to financial services and bringing them into the economic mainstream.\n\nFacebook changes its name to Meta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happened? Yesterday, Thursday, October 28, 2021, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, announced at the company\u2019s Connect event that its new name will be Meta.\n\nWhy? Per The Verge, the rebranding is part of the company\u2019s efforts to shift its focus away from being known solely as a social media company and toward Zuckerberg\u2019s plans for building the metaverse.\n\nIn a blog post, Zuckerberg said its corporate structure would not change, but it would affect how financials are reported.\n\nNamibian government to reduce crime through SIM card registration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, October 26, 2021, the Namibian government announced that its plan to encourage citizens to register their identities when purchasing SIM cards is to aid the tracking down of criminals who use technology to commit crimes, among other things.\n\nIn March 2021, the government approved new regulations requiring all mobile phone subscribers to register their SIM cards before accessing network services.\n\nIs this common? Yes. 50 countries in Africa have introduced mandatory SIM card registration laws.\n\nBut Mbeuta Ua-Ndjarakana, Executive Director of the Information Ministry, has not set a date for the regulations to take effect.\n\nIn a statement, Ua-Ndjarakana stated that the request for information from stored SIM cards would be made following the regulations, including an order issued by a judge or magistrate authorising the obtaining of that information from service providers.\n\nUa-Ndjarakana said that the SIM card registration process would be done to protect consumers\u2019 privacy. He also mentioned that once the Communication Regulatory Authority of Namibia (CRAN) completes the consultation process and implementation modalities with operators, he will issue a start date for SIM card registration in the country.\n\nBut does SIM card registration reduce crime in Africa? Per The Citizen, information gathered from SIM cards during the registration process is unreliable in combating cybercrime.\n\nAccording to The Citizen, experts have warned of an increased risk of citizens being subjected to state surveillance due to this technology.\n\nHowever, according to Isa Pantami, Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, incidents of terror like banditry and kidnapping have significantly decreased in the country due to the implementation of a policy requiring citizens to obtain a National Identification Number (NIN).\n\nWhat\u2019s your take? Do you think SIM card registration combats crime or increases surveillance in Africa?\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nLiving Below Your Means: The First Step to Wealth.

Find an investor?\n\nFor Affiong Williams, founder and CEO of ReelFruits, it was leaving her comfortable job in South Africa to start a (almost unheard of) dried fruits company in Nigeria, hawking prototype products around Lagos, and somewhat building the entire business model on the hope of winning a UN grant that never happened.\n\nWas that such a good idea? Well, on the one hand, her tech-enabled agribusiness recently raised a $3m Series A round to help accelerate global expansion. That\u2019s plenty validation. But then, it took her five years to build her first factory, and nine years in total to the Series A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffiong Williams, founder and CEO, ReelFruit.\n\nBut how did someone who had dreams of becoming a medical doctor end up as an entrepreneur? And what would motivate them to leave their comfort zone, in a bid to singlehandedly start a sub-industry that never existed?\n\nThese and many more I sought to find out during a recent interview with Affiong Williams at the ReelFruit HQ in Lagos, Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this inspiring interview, Affiong Williams shares her motivations, inspirations, ambitions, entrepreneurial lessons, and tips on how to achieve a work-life balance while running a global company.\n\nWatch full interview or continue below for summarised text version\n\nThe full interview will go live on Tuesday November 2, 2021 at noon.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi there,\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nStitch\u2019s Nigeria expansion and $2m seed extension\n\nAfrica\u2019s military coups\n\nRecoMed\u2019s $1.5 million funding\n\nUnion54\u2019s $3 million seed\n\nBefore we dig in today\u2019s newsletter, we\u2019ve got an announcement for you.\n\nStarting next week, our week-daily newsletter, Techpoint Digest, will now hit your inbox three times a week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou\u2019ll be getting it on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.\n\nStitch\u2019s Nigeria expansion and seed extension\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStitch Team. Source: Supplied,\n\nSouth African API fintech startup, Stitch has today announced its expansion into Nigeria and a $2M seed extension, with investment from Future Africa and Norrsken Foundation, among others.\n\nStitch announced an initial $4 million seed in February when it came out of stealth. This brings its total seed round to $6 million.\n\nThe startup launched officially in February 2021 with an API that provides software companies with identity verification tools and access to users\u2019 financial data.\n\nSince its launch, the company claims to have grown by 40-50% month-on-month.\n\nSpeaking about the company\u2019s expansion to Nigeria, Kiaan Pillay, Stitch CEO, says, \u201cNigeria is one of the most active markets on the continent, if not the world, for fintech. The opportunity we see here is endless.\u201d\n\nHe says the company plans to become the \u201cgo-to partner for any businesses building financial products in Africa.\u201d\n\nMore competition: Stitch would be facing off with other API fintech players such as Mono which announced a $15 million Series A earlier this month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMono, which launched in 2020, boasts partnerships with 270 businesses and 200 million financial data transactions.\n\nMeanwhile, this seed extension is to enable Stitch to grow its team in Nigeria as it prepares to expand into other African countries.\n\nCoup attempts in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica\u2019s latest military coup occurred on Monday, October 25, 2021, in Sudan.\n\nThousands of Sudanese were met with bullets as they took to the streets to protest the dissolution of their democracy.\n\nPer Reuters, 7 people were killed by gunfire while 140 others were injured in clashes between soldiers and protesters.\n\nCoup \u2018pon coup: As a continent, Africa has experienced her share of challenges, deeply rooted in political tyranny and unaccountability, resulting in coups or dictatorships.\n\nAccording to Intelligence by Techpoint, Africa has witnessed 83 coup attempts since 1990, with 42 successful. Although rare today, coups still threaten democracy.\n\nRecoMed\u2019s $1.5m funding\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Tyck via Iwaria\n\nRecoMed, an online healthcare marketplace, has closed a $1.5 million financing round.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the round was led by Vunani Fintech Fund with participation from others including, Growth Grid Venture Capital Partners and Push Ventures.\n\nWhat does RecoMed do? Look at it as an Amazon for healthcare professionals.\n\nLaunched in 2013, it is a platform where patients can request healthcare professionals across South Africa by searching practitioner profiles while checking reviews.\n\nRecoMed says its platform reduces the time it takes for patients to get the medical services they need. The startup takes a cut per requests made on the website.\n\nIs healthtech the next fintech? While fintech startups still get a significant chunk of African funding, healthtech startups seem to be attracting some serious cash.\n\nAccording to Disrupt Africa, funding for healthtech startups increased by 257.5% from 2019 to 2020.\n\nHowever, Africa\u2019s healthcare sector still needs more funding to increase access to quality and affordable health services. According to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), $25-30 billion in new investment will be needed to meet Africa\u2019s healthcare demand over the next decade.\n\nRecoMed plans to integrate new products into its platform with the funding.\n\nUnion54 raises $3m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnion54 Founders, Perseus Mlambo and Alessandra Martini. Credit: TechCrunch.\n\nZambian fintech startup, Union54 has raised $3 million in seed funding.\n\nAccording to TechCrunch, The Y Combinator-backed startup saw investments from Tiger Global, ACE & Company, and Runa Capital.\n\nWhat does the startup do? Union54 owns an API that helps software companies issue debit cards without a bank or third-party processor.\n\nThe startup was launched by a couple, Perseus Mlambo and Alessandra Martini, this year. It is an offshoot of their previous company, Zazu, which launched in 2015 as a neobank in Zambia.\n\nThe duo launched Union54 after they encountered difficulty in issuing debit cards at Zazu. The cards had to be issued through partner banks, a process that took a lot of time.\n\nMlambo told TechCrunch that they \u201crealised that either the processor or the bank was not necessarily well equipped to be able to answer our questions or to be able to give us the product that we\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\nThe funding will be channelled at building a strong engineering and product and sales team.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nNigeria\u2019s March to the Gallows.

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has called for an end to multiple exchange rates to achieve sustainable economic growth and development in the country.\n\nThe governor reiterated the need for the government to relax capital control measures and promote exchange rate uniformity to create more incentives for investors in the domestic market.\n\nObaseki spoke at the 25th yearly conference of the Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers (CIS) in Lagos.\n\nHe further urged governments at all levels to invest massively in infrastructure, and improve on the ease of doing business to shore up the country\u2019s weak economic indices and make it more competitive in the global market.\n\nObaseki said while multiple exchange rates could hinder capital inflows into the country, a stable rate would boost domestic production and attract more investment.\n\nAccording to him, countries like the U.S., Europe and Asia have exchange rate stability, necessitating free movement of capital and developed capital markets.\n\nThe governor situated a nexus between the development of a country\u2019s capital market and the economy, as reflected in the percentage of market capitalisation to the Gross Domestic Products (GDP) of developed economies.\n\nHe stated: \u201cIn the U.S., the market capitalisation is 143 percent of the GDP; Canada\u2019s is 24 per cent, while Japan is 92 percent. But that cannot be said of Nigeria or most emerging countries.

          "text": "The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) and suspended National Chairman of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus, have joined other well meaning Nigerians and organisations to condemn the invasion of the residence of Justice Mary Odili, a Supreme Court judge, by security operatives on Friday night.\n\nA team of police officers, said to be operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), and soldiers late Friday, invaded Justice Odili\u2019s official residence at Maitama, Abuja, brandishing a search warrant issued by Emmanuel Iyanna, a chief magistrate at Wuse Zone 6 Magistrate Court, which has since been withdrawn.\n\nReacting to the development, the NBA in a statement on Saturday by its president, Olamide Apata, said it \u201creceived with grave concern the news of the unlawful siege on the Abuja residence of a Justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, Honourable Justice Mary Ukaego Peter-Odili, last night by officers of one or more of the Nigerian security agencies.\u201d\n\nThe NBA regretted that, \u201cAlmost 24 hours later, information concerning the basis of the siege remains hazy and the subject of speculation, apart from reports that the invasion was pursuant to a search warrant issued by a Magistrate Court in Abuja, which search warrant has now been revoked.\n\n\u201cThe Honourable Attorney-General of the Federation under whose office the team that purportedly carried out the raid is allegedly domiciled has also denounced the team, which suggests the inference that the residence of the second most senior judicial officer in Nigeria was raided by rogue security agencies. The grave implications of this possibility leave a lot to be desired.\n\n\u201cWhen viewed in the context of a similar raid on the premises of Supreme Court Justices in 2016, the rationale of which was never fully explained or indeed justified, the NBA interprets last night\u2019s incident as a part of an orchestrated affront on the Judiciary, designed to intimidate and ridicule the Judiciary. The NBA will no longer allow this to continue.\n\n\u201cIn case the law enforcement agencies have not learnt their lessons, events like this do nothing but erode the independence of sacred democratic institutions like the Judiciary, undermine the rule of law in Nigeria, and set the country back in the quest to instil confidence in citizens of Nigeria, Nigerian businesses, and foreign investors that Nigeria operates a democracy with an independent Judiciary.\n\n\u201cI have spoken with My Lord, Peter-Odili JSC and I am happy to report that she is alive and well. Beyond that however, it is my pledge to Nigerians that the NBA will get to the root of this matter.\u201d\n\nApata emphasized that the invasion was an affront on the judiciary, noting that the association will convene an emergency meeting to discuss it.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, last night\u2019s event is an affront on the Judiciary and grossly undermines the democracy that we profess to practise. In line with the aims and objectives of the NBA which include the protection and defence of the independence of the Judiciary and the Rule of Law in Nigeria, we will be convening an emergency meeting of the NBA National Executive Committee solely to discuss this issue and take a definitive stand on behalf of the NBA,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI will also lead a delegation to the Honourable Attorney-General of the Federation, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN and the relevant heads of security agencies to seek further clarification on the circumstances of this incident. Thereafter, the NBA will ensure that all those responsible for this unfortunate incident are brought to book. We must do all that is required to safeguard the independence of our Judiciary and indeed protect our hard-won democracy.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Secondus in a statement by Ike Abonyi, his SA Media, described the invasion as an embarrassment to the nation, \u201cand an insult on the judiciary the search carried out in the home of Justice Mary Odili of the Supreme Court Of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe statement further said, \u201cPrince Secondus said that nothing can explain the embarrassing act of the security operatives on a woman who has put in much in the service of her fatherland.\n\n\u201cHe said that relevant authorities should come clean on what informed such ignoble and dishonourable behavior and render unreserved apology to the Justice and the Judiciary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility as a democratic nation to ensure the continued sanctity of the judiciary as a critical component of democracy.\n\n\u201cPrince Secondus frowned at the frequent harassment of the judiciary by this administration pointing out that it does not tell well on our democratic credentials and the respect for the doctrine of separation of power.\n\n\u201cPrince Secondus also noted that the development calls for more diligence on the part of judicial officers in responding to search warrant requests from overzealous officials of the executive.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "The Nigerian Army on Saturday, said the violent attacks carried out by suspected members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in the country\u2019s Southeast, has betrayed their heinous and directionless agenda for Igbo people, hence their loss of popularity in the region.\n\nThe Army which was refuting an allegation by a certain Kalu Odinakachi, that it has a hand in the attacks by unknown gunmen in the region, noted in a statement by its spokesman, Brig. General Onyema Nwachukwu, that the suggestion was baseless, unfounded and could be absolutely described as a hoax.\n\nIt said the proscribed separatist group has in recent times foisted a sit-at-home order to show sympathy for their self acclaimed leader, which was greeted with violence, orchestrated destruction of public installations and facilities, arson, as well as looting of shops and malls in the region, to demonstrate their criminal potency.\n\nThe army suggested that following a backlash from the people over attacks by the group, its propagandists are trying to blame soldiers for the attacks.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army(NA) is not unmindful of the antics of individuals or group, whose stock in trade is to peddle falsehood and disinformation to remain relevant in South East Nigeria. One of such scheming. currently in the media domain is the mischievous submission by Kalu Odinakachi, who alleged that the DMI and DSS created and funded BNG, UGM to Enforce-Sit-at Home in a bid to discredit IPOB/ESN. It must be be abundantly clarified that this spurious allegation is unfounded and could be absolutely described as a hoax,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThough the NA would not like to elevate such purveyors of disinformation and propaganda, it is expedient to put on record, that in recent times, the activities of IPOB/ESN have undoubtedly assumed a violent dimension. This unimaginable level of violence is olled with propaganda and disinformation to whip up sentiments and draw sympathy from unsuspecting citizens in the region.\n\n\u201cFor the records, the proscribed organization has in recent times foisted a sit-at-home order to show sympathy for their self acclaimed leader. This was greeted with violence, orchestrated destruction of public installations and facilities, arson, as well as looting of shops and malls in the region, to demonstrate their criminal potency. They defiled the sanctity of the highly revered traditional institution of Ndigbos by recklessly murdering their own traditional leaders. These spineless and irresponsible actions targeted at the very people they claim they want to liberate, clearly unmask their heinous and direction less agenda for Ndigbos.\n\n\u201cRealising the futility, hollowness and public rejection of their violent agitation, they resorted to twisting the narrative in the region to galvanize local support. Their wild allegation that BNG and UGN were an overt operation by the DMI and DSS is not only laughable, but remains largely illusive and a ploy to diminish the public support the NA is savouring in the ongoing exercises. In his blatant display of ignorance, Odinakachi failed to realize that such designation as DMI has since ceased to exist in the NA. These criminal elements with their cohorts must come to terms with the reality of the ongoing Exercise GOLDEN DAWN and turn themselves in to security agencies or be ready to face the consequences of their lawlessness.\n\n\u201cMore grotesque is the narrative peddled by these merchants of propaganda, in respect of IPOB/ESN gunmen recently eliminated by troops in a shootout at Ekwulobia Roundout in Aguata LGA. These unscrupulous elements insinuated that those taken out were Fulanis. An outrageous claim that should be disregarded in its entirety. This is apparently another failed attempt in their usual mannerism, to attribute their criminal activities to a third party and feign innocence; an indication of a visionless group totally devoid of integrity.\n\n\u201cThe NA wishes to reassure the good people of the South East to go about their normal businesses, as efforts are stepped up to rid the region of criminal elements masquarading as BNG and UGM. We encourage members of the public to provide actionable information to security agencies as the Exercises progress.\u201d\n\nFacebook Notice for EU! You need to login to view and post FB Comments!",

This followed the assailants\u2019 armed attack on personnel of security agencies deployed at Ekwulobia Round About in Aguata Local Government Area of Anambra State, during which troops swiftly mobilised to the scene and subsequently embarked on pursuit of the criminals along Nnewi \u2013 Nnobi road,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cTroops made contact with the fleeing gunmen and engaged them in a fire fight, neutralising four of the criminals.\n\n\u201cThe gallant troops also recovered two AK-47 Rifles, one GALIL Ace 5.56 x 45 Iwi Gun, one Avofeng Hand held radio and one Black Highlander jeep. Sadly, a personnel of one of the security agencies paid the supreme price.\n\n\u201cIn a separate operation, troops have foiled another attack by IPOB/ESN gunmen at Umunze Checkpoint, in Orumba South Local Government Area. The vigilant troops overwhelmed the attackers in the shootout that ensued, forcing them to take to their heels, abandoning, one Pump Action gun with nine cartridges, one dark blue Ford and four motorcycles, which the troops have recovered.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Army notes that the recent attacks are part of proscribed IPOB/ESN plan to instil fear into the public and sabotage forthcoming Anambra State Governorship Election. Members of the public are reassured that the Nigerian Army, sister services and other security agencies will not relent in resolutely confronting all criminals intents against the citizenry and national interest. Law abiding citizens are enjoined to continue to go about their daily activities without any fear. They are also encouraged to report any unusual activity observed across Anambra State to the nearest security post.\u201d",

The Federal Government will ensure that all innocent, law-abiding citizens and residents will not lose access to their phone lines as long as they obtain and link their NIN.\n\n\u201cGovernment will also continue to provide an enabling environment for investors in the telecommunications sector.\n\n\u201cThe unique 66 million NIN enrolments, with an average of 3 to 4 SIMs linked to the NIN, is a testament to the commitment and dedication of the Federal Government, through the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) and the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), to ensure the success of the project.\n\n\u201cWith the creation of additional NIN enrolment centres within and outside the country, and many more coming up, the remaining citizens and legal residents living in the country and the diaspora should be able to obtain their NINs and link them with their SIMs before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the Honourable Minister enjoins Nigerians and legal residents to make use of the opportunity of the extension to enrol for their NINs and link with their SIMs.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the FGN, the Honourable Minister, the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, and the Director-General/CEO of NIMC, Engr. Aliyu A. Aziz, urge citizens and legal residents to take advantage of the window to complete the process of enrolment and verification before the end of the year 2021,\u201d the statement added.",

          "text": "\u20263, 600 to decide aspirants, party\u2019s fates \u2026Consensus candidates were imposed on us\u2019 \u2026We\u2019re not forcing anybody to step down \u2013 Fintiri \u2026Aftermath always not palatable \u2013 Analyst \u2026We\u2019ll come out united \u2013 Tambuwal\n\nAs members and other critical stakeholders in the leading opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), converge on the Eagle Square Abuja to elect a new set of 18-member National Working Committee (NWC) into different positions, ABDULRAHMAN ZAKARIYAU writes on the tension and sharp divisions on who gets what and what may come after the \u2018consensus national convention.\u2019\n\nThe recall\n\nWhile the PDP held sway as the ruling party for 16 years, it produced the likes of Presidents Olusegun Obasanjo, the late Umaru Musa Yar\u2019\u00c1dua, and Goodluck Jonathan in straight feats.\n\nNot only that, in 1999, with the return to democratic rule, the party was controlling not less than 28 states with the majority members in both the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nSadly, events of the past few years have depicted the party as one without respect for its Constitution, while almost all of its NWC never served its four-year term, most of the party\u2019s national officers were disgraced out of office. The party is one that has seen all but one of its eight chairmen forced out of office in controversial circumstances.\n\nFrom its pioneer chairman, the late Chief Solomon Lar, to Barnabas Gemade, Audu Ogbeh, Ahmadu Ali, Vincent Ogubulafor, and Okwesilieze Nwodo to Bamanga Tukur, and then Prince Uche Secondus, only one, Amadu Ali, served out his tenure and bowed out without rancour.\n\nThe late Lar was booted out of office by former President Olusegun Obasanjo a few months after he assumed office as president in 1999. His successor, Barnabas Gemade who played an influential role during Obasanjo\u2019s administration, was later shown the door in 2001 after his relationship with Obasanjo got sour.\n\nThe exit of Gemade paved the way for the Audu Ogbeh-led NWC. Ogbeh\u2019s tenure is perhaps the most dramatic of all as he was forced to resign in December 2004, allegedly at gunpoint, after its much-talked about letter to the president advising Obasanjo to act on the anarchy that had taken over Anambra state, where the then godfather, Chris Uba, a known supporter of the president, had allegedly overrun the state and taken its governor, Chris Ngige, captive.\n\nLike Ogbeh, another Obasanjo\u2019s friend, Ahmadu Ali, was made the party\u2019s national chairman. Though he served his term, he left without a second term. Consequently, Vincent Ogbulafor was elected the new chairman at the party\u2019s national convention of 2008. However, as a result of a bitter feud with his state governor, Theodore Orji, over the party\u2019s structure in the South-east, Ogbulafor was charged with corruption and forced to resign in May 2010.\n\nOkwesilieze Nwodo who succeeded Ogbulafor also left sometime around 2012 under controversial circumstances after a dispute with his governor, Sullivan Chime. Similarly, Bamanga Tukur who took over ran into troubles also at home where his control of the party structure in Adamawa state was challenged by Governor Murtala Nyako. He was booted out in 2014.\n\nThe present\n\nLike many others, the Prince Uche Secondus-led NWC problems started when he failed to support Governor Nyesom Wike\u2019s plot to install the Sokoto state governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, as the party\u2019s presidential candidate in 2018. However, the fear of him hijacking the party\u2019s structure for the 2023 presidential aspirants, Wike and others succeeded in getting Secondus sacked by a competent court.\n\nCumulatively, the PDP governors have continued to install their choices of NWC and sacking them at will. This has led to mass defections of party members from state to national levels, and this has affected their performances in many elections. While this remains a great concern to the party\u2019s supporters, analysts believe that the act will continue to affect the party\u2019s internal democracy.\n\nThe convention\n\nOf all the positions, only those of the national auditor, national youth leader and deputy national chairman (South) would be contested out at the convention ground as the others have already been concluded on a consensus arrangement.\n\nMeanwhile, the chairman, conventional planning committee, the governor of Adamawa state, Ahmadu Fintiri, has disclosed that 3,600 delegates were expected to participate at this year\u2019s national elective convention of the party.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are expecting 3, 600 delegates tomorrow. This is the exact reason I told you that I\u2019ll be updating you because we\u2019re still packaging the list of delegates. You know PDP has produced a lot of officials for this country and our Constitution has also allowed for some former this and former that. We have people that have crossed over to the other side, so have to be careful so that we don\u2019t include them. But at the moment I think we\u2019re satisfied.\u201d\n\nConsensus convention, issues\n\nKeen followers of political events in the country are of the view that the main opposition party seems not to have learnt any lessons from the imposition of candidates and leaders which largely led to its downfall after reigning supreme as a ruling party for sixteen years.\n\nAs the party prepares to elect its national officials across the country today and tomorrow, tension is high as a result of what perhaps can be described as a \u201cfailed consensus.\u201d\n\nThough zoning, micro-zoning and consensus remain alien to the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria and that of the PDP, they have now become a norm. Like in the past, the party zoned and micro-zoned the positions available in the NWC; this development has increased tension among party members. Consequently, many aspirants are not comfortable going for the election; one of such aspirants is Okey Muo-Aroh, who wanted to run for national secretary before he was disqualified for allegedly taking the party to court.\n\nHe said, \u201cSome people are bragging that there was a consensus candidate; this is the bane of the party in the South-east. We have a situation where the party in its wisdom zones offices to the South-east, and nobody was privy to any arrangement. We only heard that the office of the national secretary has been zoned to Anambra auditor to Imo state.\n\n\u201cThat was why Hon. CID Maduabum, Osita Chidoka and I started having consultations and moving around, only for us to come to Enugu on Thursday and the zonal chairman said the governors would brief us. The Enugu state governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, introduced the Abia state governor, Okezie Victor Ikpeazu. And Governor Okezie Victor Ikpeazu read from a script and said they had changed their mind, and that they have put the secretary to Imo state and their candidate is Senator Sam Daddy Anyanwu. And they pronounced somebody from Anambra as the auditor. So, on that basis, the people of Anambra rejected that so-called arrangement.\u201d\n\nAlso, in the same South-east, a former national publicity secretary of the party, Chief Olisa Metuh, had a misunderstanding with the former Anambra state governor, Peter Obi, on the choice of candidate for the national auditor.\n\nMetuh, in a statement signed by his special assistant, Ebiloma Abdullahi, recently said, \u201cWhile we concede to the former governor and acknowledge his stories on moral values to the general public, we are totally against his lack of consultation, dialogue and inclusion on matters affecting party administration; an area where he knows little or nothing about.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that in the South-east caucus meeting of the PDP, Peter Obi himself led the rejection of a name put forward by Senator Ekwunife as a candidate for the position of the national auditor, wherein he openly stated that the person is not known to him and the PDP.\n\n\u201cIt is instructive to state that this position was re-echoed by the entire Anambra stakeholders present at the meeting except for Senator Ekwunife. However, 24 hours later, the same Peter Obi, a man said to be of very high moral standard, somersaulted to claim the adoption of the same name without any form of dialogue or consultation.\u201d\n\nGrudges\n\nIn the South-west too, many are aggrieved over the zoning and micro-zoning arrangement. A former secretary of the party, Professor Wale Ladipo, and former national vice-chairman (South), Dr. Eddy Olafeso, both alluded to the fact that they were disqualified to force a consensus candidate on the zone and the party at large.\n\nReacting to his disqualification, Prof. Ladipo said, \u201cYes, I saw it coming. I have been joking with some members of our party in Osun state over the last one week that it has been in the public domain that certain people were not comfortable with my candidature. They said clearly that I would be screened out. I thought it was impossible, but then it became a reality. I spoke to people who are close to me and I said I was not going to the screening because I hate \u2018arrangee things.\u2019 I like people to be straightforward. We spoke to senior members of the party and they said I should go for the screening and see how it goes. And lo and behold, about 10 minutes before my appearance before the screening committee, somebody brought a petition and hurriedly gave it to them. Up till now, I have not been privileged to read the petition.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Dr. Olafeso said: \u201cThis is pure politics to scheme me and others out of the race.\u201d\n\nPolitical pundits believe that this type of consensus has increased the level of tension in the party, which if not properly managed may make some people leave the party.\n\nAn aspirant who does not want his name mentioned in print told Blueprint Weekend that many people never consented to the consensus arrangement, adding that \u201cconsensus candidates were forced on us.\u201d\n\nHe told this reporter that, \u201cI was told to step down; in fact they stopped me from purchasing forms. Some of us felt that the issue of consensus should be discussed, but in this case, we were more or less forced.\n\n\u201cThey invited me and others for a series of meetings, and said you step down, this is the person that we want, I felt so bad. To me, all positions should be open for all and the delegates should decide the fate of every aspirant. Unfortunately, this is not the case, as consensus candidates were forced on us.\u201d\n\nGov. Fintiri\u2019s reaction\n\nReacting to allegations that some aspirants were forced to step down, the chairman of the convention planning committee, Governor Fintiri said aspirants were not forced to step down.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt the moment, we\u2019re making efforts to reconcile most of our contestants so that we can streamline them to have a better Convention which will be hitch-free and will deepen our chances for 2021. Most of the positions as of today, except for three, will not be contested for.\n\n\u201cThe problems have reduced significantly and we will keep posting as the events unfold. At the moment we are talking to those that are contesting for the office of the deputy national chairman (South) and those that are contesting for the office of the auditor, and those that are now contested for the office of youth leader. I think at the moment it is just the offices that still have many people contesting for. The rest have been streamlined and the consensus looks okay.\n\n\u201cLike I told you, there are positions and there are people that we\u2019re still talking to. We\u2019re not forcing anybody to step down and the candidates are talking amongst themselves.\u201d\n\nAn analyst\u2019s take\n\nA political analyst, Jide Ojo, said the aftermath of an improper consensus arrangement is not always palatable. Ojo, in a telephone chat with this reporter, said: \u201cI am not a fan of consensus arrangements, but the political leaders who initiated that did it because they thought it is a better arrangement to how people negotiate for political offices than to fight for the political offices at a ballot.\n\n\u201cBut we know that it has also backfired to an extent. The way it has been playing out in Nigeria is synonymous with imposition. And when you impose candidates, the aftermath of that is always not palatable. This is because what then happens is that people who felt bad may end up defecting from the party to another. But if they have agreed through horse-trading and it works out well, then it may go well. For those who are opposed to a consensus I think it is always good to allow people to vote for the candidate of their choice.\n\n\u201cThe way the consensus arrangements have been done is another way for imposition of candidates.\u201d\n\nTambuwal\u2019s hope\n\nIn his reaction, the chairman of the PDP Governors Forum, the Sokoto state governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, said the party \u201cwill come out of the national convention united.\u201d\n\nTambuwal, who stated this recently, said: \u201cWe have just finished our meeting where we received briefings from the chairman of the convention planning/organising committee, the governor of Adamawa state, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, that we are on course and by the grace of God, they have almost concluded every arrangement and plan for a very successful, free and fair convention.\n\n\u201cWe are very grateful to the convention planning committee and other sub-committees for the work they are doing. We are optimistic that PDP is going to come out more united from this convention and much more ready to provide the desired platform upon which many Nigerians can realise their aspirations. And we shall continue to deepen our democracy and work together as democrats for a greater Nigeria.\u201d",

Olamilekan Adegbite in his keynote address said the launch of the Nigerian Barite was a culmination of several efforts and collaboration with critical stakeholders in the sector.\n\nWhile appreciating President Muhammadu Buhari for the unwavering support he has given to the mining sector, Adegbite noted that the current administration has demonstrated an unflinching commitment to the growth of the sector.\n\nThe Minister highlighted some of the benefits of the Nigerian Barite initiative to include; accelerated development of the sector along the Barite value chain; Increased revenue to Government through Royalty payment and Conservation of foreign exchange hitherto spent on importing barite.\n\nOthers he mentioned were; Job creation along the Barite value chain and Local Content promotion in line with federal government policy.\n\nAdegbite added that the launch of Nigerian Barite was poised to save the country millions of dollars spent importing barite.\n\nHe said a major component of the initiative was the promotion of local content in the production, quality assurance, and sale of Barite.\n\n\u201cThe bags of barite we are presenting today meet the American Petroleum Institute (API) standard, which is the global bench mark accepted by the oil industry\u201d, he explained.\n\nThe Minister recalled that barite was among the seven strategic minerals designated for top priority development by the Nigerian government.\n\nHe said Barite occurs within the Benue Trough (Benue, Taraba, Adamawa States) and its fringes to the north (Nassarawa, Platueau and Gombe States) and the Southern fringe (Cross River State).\n\nHe however cited a major exception of occurrence in Zamfara State, Northwestern Nigeria.\n\nHe disclosed that an open market place Portal that would connect all stakeholders along the Barite value chain would soon be commissioned.\n\nIn his words, \u201c the open market place portal would connect all stakeholders along the Barite value chain to a hub that allows for easy coordination, stocking, effective costing and seamless sale of Barite while the Ministry would assume the role of coordinating the entire process.\u201d\n\nAdegbite further explained that the open market place solution would be integrated with the Treasury Single Account, TSA, to ensure prompt remittances of government revenue\n\nIn his speech, the Executive Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike represented by the Deputy Governor, Dr (Mrs) Ipalibo Harry-Banigo, congratulated the Ministers for the feat achieved while thanking them for choosing the State for the launch.\n\nEarlier in his welcome remarks, the Minister of State, Dr Uchechukwu Ogah said Barite is one among the over 44 solid mineral types found within the country, which have mostly remained unexploited.\n\nHe said the launch of Nigerian Barite is an attestation that the Ministry\u2019s investment in exploration activities and capacity building targeted at sustainable production of Nigerian processed Barite has finally paid off.\n\n\u201cIn our commitment to deliver on Mr. President\u2019s mandate, we have not only rejigged our Vision and Mission but have developed and adopted new reform initiatives and innovative strategies to ensure optimal performance and sustainable growth in the minerals and metal sector\u201d, he further explained.\n\nIn her closing remarks, the Permanent Secretary, Dr (Mrs) Oluwatoyin Akinlade said the Ministry aligned with the strategic and visionary diversification agenda of the President through the roadmap to completely rejuvenate the sector for national prosperity.\n\nShe acknowledged the unwavering parliamentary support of the National Assembly.\n\nThere were goodwill messages from CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, the Group Managing Director NNPC Mele Kyari, the Executive Secretary, Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), Engr. Simbi Wabote and a presentation by the Director General Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, Dr Garba Abdulrazaq.\n\nBarite is a mineral that is very vital to the development of the Nigerian oil and gas sector. It plays essential role as a weighing material in drilling muds used in oil and gas drilling primarily to prevent the explosive release of gas during drilling. It is also used in the plastic, cosmetics, pharmaceutical, paper making and paint industry.",

We are still talking with those contesting,\u201d Fintiri said on Friday.\n\nDisagreements, Legal Tussles\n\nBefore this convention, the main opposition party have been faced with disagreements and legal tussles.\n\nFormer chairman Uche Secondus had sought to halt the convention over his suspension from the party.\n\nBut on Friday, the Appeal Court in Port Harcourt, Rivers State granted the party the right to hold the convention in a suit brought by Secondus.\n\nAlthough Mr Secondus has vowed to appeal the ruling, the convention is poised to proceed.\n\nRivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, backed the ruling of the Court of Appeal, describing it as a victory for the party.\n\n\u201cIt is a victory for every member of PDP,\u201d Wike told reporters. \u201cIt is a sign that PDP is prepared for 2023.\u201d\n\nThe Governor said Mr Secondus had already handed over his chairmanship to PDP National Deputy Chairman (South), Yemi Akinwonmi, and had no right to seek the postponement of the convention.\n\n\u201cWe will not allow any individual or groups to derail the rescue mission of the PDP,\u201d he said. \u201cThe title of our convention is \u2018Join us to rescue Nigeria\u2019.\n\n\u201cNigeria is in problem and we cannot do it alone. We require everybody to work with us for collectively and see how this country can be rescued.\n\n\u201cSo, if there is anybody or group who are being used to derail us, PDP will not take it lightly. We are serious about it and nothing will stop us from rescuing this country.\n\n\u201cPDP should be thanking God Almighty. We should be jubilating and praising God for bringing unity to this country.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that the Court of Appeal judgement granted PDP an \u201cunrestrained\u201d right to hold the convention, making any other court judgement obtained to halt the process irrelevant.",

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nA Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mike Ozekhome has described the siege on the home of a Supreme Court Justice, Mary Odili, as a ploy to embarrass her family.\n\nThe lawyer spoke to Channels Television after security operatives supposedly attached to the Ministry of Justice tried to gain entry into the Justice\u2019s home in Abuja on Friday.\n\nThe Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has denied his involvement in the botched operation.\n\nREAD ALSO: I Was Not Involved In Raid On Justice Odili\u2019s House, Says Malami\n\nBut Ozekhome, who faulted the details of the warrant, said the Federal Government should issue an apology for the embarrassment.\n\n\u201cThe search warrant did not carry any name, of any person. It didn\u2019t say Justice Mary Peter Odili. It didn\u2019t say the husband, Dr Peter Odili. It just said, number 9, Imo Street,\u201d Ozekhome said.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the very address of Justice Odili is not number 9, Imo street. Who were the persons, they did not put a single name. What address? You got the wrong address.\n\n\u201cSo there is this theory that it could have been a clear case of genuine mistaken identity. I only hope so.\n\n\u201cBut the other theory, which I seem to want to believe more, because of the activities and antecedents of this government, is that it was politically motivated.\n\n\u201cSo I believe it was done to embarrass them. But for whatever it was done, it was a shame to this country. If they now find that it was an erroneous entry or that it was mistake, let them do Nigerians and Nigeria the minimal of saying \u2018we are sorry, we made a honest mistake\u2019. And heavens will not fall; and they will be applauded for it.\n\n\u201cBut let them not always pretend that all is well, even after causing great embarrassment.\u201d",

          "text": "The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) has condemned the raid on the residence of a justice of the Supreme Court, Justice Mary Peter-Odili, by a group of yet-to-be-identified security operatives.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, NBA President Olumide Akpata listed some of the actions to be taken by the legal body to ensure the perpetrators were brought to justice.\n\nThese actions, he explained, are in line with the aims and objectives of the NBA, including the protection and defence of the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe will be convening an emergency meeting of the NBA National Executive Committee solely to discuss this issue and take a definitive stand on behalf of the NBA,\u201d said Akpata.\n\n\u201cI will also lead a delegation to the Honourable Attorney-General of the Federation, Mr Abubakar Malami, SAN, and the relevant heads of security agencies to seek further clarification on the circumstances of this incident.\n\n\u201cThereafter, the NBA will ensure that all those responsible for this unfortunate incident are brought to book. We must do all that is required to safeguard the independence of our judiciary and indeed protect our hard-won democracy.\u201d\n\nRidicule The Judiciary?\n\nHe stated that about 24 hours after the incident, information concerning the basis of the siege remained hazy and the subject of speculation.\n\nThe NBA president stressed that this was far from reports that the invasion was pursuant to a search warrant issued by a Magistrate Court in Abuja, which has now been revoked.\n\nAccording to him, the AGF under whose office the team that purportedly carried out the raid is allegedly domiciled has also denounced the team, which suggests the inference that the residence of the second most senior judicial officer in the country was raided by rogue security agencies.\n\n\u201cThe grave implications of this possibility leave a lot to be desired,\u201d Said Akpata. \u201cWhen viewed in the context of a similar raid on the premises of Supreme Court Justices in 2016, the rationale of which was never fully explained or indeed justified, the NBA interprets last night\u2019s incident as a part of an orchestrated affront on the judiciary, designed to intimidate and ridicule the judiciary.\n\n\u201cThe NBA will no longer allow this to continue. I have spoken with My Lord, Peter-Odili JSC and I am happy to report that she is alive and well. Beyond that, however, it is my pledge to Nigerians that the NBA will get to the root of this matter.\u201d\n\nThe NBA president believes the law enforcement agencies ought to have learned from past incidents, events like this do nothing but erode the independence of sacred democratic institutions like the judiciary.\n\nHe added that they undermine the rule of law in the country and set the nation back in the quest to instill confidence in citizens, Nigerian businesses, and foreign investors that Nigeria operates a democracy with an independent judiciary.",

          "title": "Lagos Targets 4m By Year-End with Covid Mass Vaccination Programme",
          "text": "The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu has launched a mass vaccination campaign against COVID-19, as part of strategies to stave off re-emergence of the viral infection.\n\nThe objective was aimed at vaccinating four million residents in Lagos before the end of the year.\n\nThe immunisation programme was flagged off at an event held in Lagos.\n\nThe governor warned of the possibility of the fourth wave of COVID-19 as the yuletide approaches, saying residents of Lagos, who are 18 years and above were eligible to be fully immunised with the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe accelerated vaccine rollout is tagged: \u201cOperation Count Me in 4 Million Lagosians Vaccinated Against COVID-19\u201d and is being undertaken by Lagos State government in collaboration with National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA).\n\nThe governor believed the mass vaccination campaign would help bolster the State\u2019s response to the emerging threat posed by the pandemic.\n\nSanwo-Olu said the joint committee set up by the Lagos State Government and the NPHCDA to oversee the implementation of the campaign would be opening vaccination sites in high traffic locations as part of the strategies to expand vaccine access in underserved communities.\n\nMobile vans, the Governor added, would be deployed to move round boundary settlements in order to reach individuals in areas with limited access to health facilities.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere is potential for the fourth wave of COVID-19, as our borders would be opened to all people coming into Lagos in December. To prevent the catastrophic events we witnessed in the previous waves, the state has developed a robust vaccination drive, leveraging on both the strengths we have in the public and private sectors of our healthcare system.\n\n\u201cIn development of our strategy and counter-measures, we prioritise the protection of human lives and keeping our economy open for business.\n\n\u201cTo mitigate against this potential damage that will further spread existing variants of COVID-19 in the State, and accelerate efforts towards herd immunity, the need for a different strategy became a front burner issue.\n\n\u201cThis is what has culminated in the campaign, tagged \u2018Count Me In! 4 million Lagosians Vaccinated Against COVID-19\u2019 to target the full vaccination of 4 million Lagos residents before the end of December 2021. Once achieved, this will bring the State closer to reaching our promise to vaccinate 30 percent of our population within one year.\u201d\n\nSince March when Lagos started its vaccination programme, Sanwo-Olu said the state had successfully vaccinated 800,000 residents with the first dose of Moderna vaccine and 310,000 persons fully vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\nThis, he said, made the total number of residents vaccinated with the first dose of either AstraZeneca or Moderna 1.2 million, while raising the number of fully vaccinated individuals to 550,000, which accounts for about four per cent of the State\u2019s population.\n\nSanwo-Olu re-emphasised that the vaccines being administered are safe and remain free of charge in public health facilities. The governor, however, said an administrative charge of N6,000 would be paid by individuals who wish to get the vaccines at approved private facilities.\n\nThe governor charged all stakeholders, including the local council chairmen, to mobilise for participation in the programme and ensure the success of the campaign.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have set up COVID-19 vaccination in all our 205 public primary health centres, 14 of the State\u2019s second and tertiary hospitals, and we are hoping that this partnership can be implemented in over 400 private health centres across seven underserved Local Government Areas in the State.\n\n\u201cLet me re-emphasise that we are not compelling anyone to get vaccinated. But, we want everyone to take it as personal responsibility, which is highly important. What we seek to achieve by this campaign is to ensure there is access to the vaccines and availability. Then, give people an opportunity to get vaccinated at centres close to them. This will give nobody a reason not to get the vaccines.\u201d\n\nCommissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, described the vaccination campaign as \u201cambitious\u201d, saying the State Government had put in place two-pronged approach to prevent the fourth wave of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe first step is to control the in-bound flight passengers and maintain adherence to all preventive measures that have been put in place, while the second step is to closely monitor the isolation of those coming from the red zone area,\u201d Abayomi said.",

          "text": "A few countries have begun using other COVID-19 vaccines in children under 12, including China, which just began vaccinations for 3-year-olds. But many that use the vaccine made by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech are watching the U.S. decision, and European regulators just began considering the companies\u2019 kid-size doses.\n\n\u201cThe rationale here is protect your children so that they can get back towards normal life,\u201d said FDA vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks. \u201cThe tremendous cost of this pandemic has not just been in physical illness, it\u2019s been in the psychological, the social development of children\u201d too.\n\nOne more regulatory hurdle remains: On Tuesday, advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will make more detailed recommendations on which youngsters should get vaccinated, with a final decision by the agency\u2019s director expected shortly afterwards.\n\nThe FDA cleared kid-size doses \u2014 just a third of the amount given to teens and adults \u2014 for emergency use, and up to 28 million more American children could be eligible for vaccinations as early as next week.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Friday paved the way for children ages 5 to 11 to get Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nWith FDA\u2019s action, Pfizer plans to begin shipping millions of vials of the pediatric vaccine \u2014 in orange caps to avoid mix-ups with the purple-capped doses for everyone else \u2014 to doctors\u2019 offices, pharmacies and other vaccination sites. Once the CDC issues its ruling, eligible kids will get two shots, three weeks apart.\n\nWhile children are at lower risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19 than older people, 5- to 11-year-olds still have been seriously affected \u2014 including over 8,300 hospitalizations, about a third requiring intensive care. The FDA said 146 deaths have been reported in that age group.\n\nAnd with the extra-contagious delta variant circulating, the government has counted more than 2,000 coronavirus-related school closings just since the start of the school year, affecting more than a million children.\n\n\u201cWith this vaccine kids can go back to something that\u2019s better than being locked at home on remote schooling, not being able to see their friends,\u201d said Dr. Kawsar Talaat of Johns Hopkins University. \u201cThe vaccine will protect them and also protect our communities.\u201d\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics also applauded FDA\u2019s decision, and said pediatricians were \u201cstanding by\u201d to talk with parents.\n\nVaccinating this age group is \u201can important step in keeping them healthy and providing their families with peace of mind,\u2019\u2019 said Dr. Lee Savio Beers, the academy\u2019s president.\n\nEarlier this week, FDA\u2019s independent scientific advisers voted that the pediatric vaccine\u2019s promised benefits outweigh any risks. But several panelists said not all youngsters will need to be vaccinated, and that they preferred the shots be targeted to those at higher risk from the virus.\n\nNearly 70% of 5- to 11-year-olds hospitalized for COVID-19 in the U.S. have other serious medical conditions, including asthma and obesity, according to federal tracking. Additionally, more than two-thirds of youngsters hospitalized are Black or Hispanic, mirroring long-standing disparities in the disease\u2019s impact.\n\nThe question of how broadly Pfizer\u2019s vaccine should be used will be a key consideration for the CDC and its advisers, who set formal recommendations for pediatricians and other medical professionals.\n\nA Pfizer study of 2,268 schoolchildren found the vaccine was nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infections, based on 16 cases of COVID-19 among kids given dummy shots compared to just three who got vaccinated.\n\nThe FDA ultimately assessed more children \u2014 3,100 \u2014 who received the kid dosage to conclude it was safe. Youngsters experienced similar or fewer temporary reactions \u2014 such as sore arms, fever or achiness \u2014 that teens experience.\n\nBut the study wasn\u2019t large enough to detect any extremely rare side effects, such as the heart inflammation that occasionally occurs after the second full-strength dose, mostly in young men and teen boys. It\u2019s unclear if younger children getting a smaller dose also will face that rare risk. FDA pledged Friday to keep a close watch.\n\nSome parents are expected to vaccinate their children ahead of family holiday gatherings and the winter cold season.\n\nLaura Cushman of Salt Lake City plans to get her three children \u2014 ages 7, 9 and 11 \u2014 vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWe just want them to get to resume their pre-COVID life a little bit more. And feel safe about it,\u201d she said.\n\nBut a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey suggests most parents won\u2019t rush to get the shots. About 25% of parents polled earlier this month said they would get their children vaccinated \u201cright away.\u201d But the remaining majority of parents were roughly split between those who said they will wait to see how the vaccine performs and those who said they \u201cdefinitely\u201d won\u2019t have their children vaccinated.\n\nThe similarly made Moderna vaccine also is being studied in young children, and both Pfizer and Moderna also are testing shots for babies and preschoolers.\n\n___\n\nAP reporter Lindsay Whitehurst in Salt Lake City contributed.",

Biden is trying to revive the 2015 nuclear deal and bring Iran back into compliance with the pact that would have kept the Islamic republic at least one year away from the potential to field a nuclear weapon.\n\nU.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the meeting with Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, and Britain\u2019s Boris Johnson would feature the leaders \u201call singing from the same song sheet on this issue.\u201d\n\nHe called it a \u201cstudy in contrast with the previous administration since Iran was one of the areas of most profound divergence between the previous administration and the Europeans.\u201d\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s atomic watchdog has said Iran is increasingly in violation of the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear deal and the U.S. has participated indirectly in talks aimed at bringing both Washington and Tehran back into compliance. Those Vienna talks have been on hiatus since June, when Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi took power.\n\nBritain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union remain part of the deal.\n\nThe meeting will take place while the leaders are in Rome for the Group of 20 summit, the first stop on Biden\u2019s five-day foreign trip. He\u2019s also going to a U.N. climate conference in Scotland.\n\nBiden was welcomed to the summit site by Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi and joined his counterparts for the customary \u201cfamily photo,\u2019 before he attended the opening plenary session on the COVID-19 pandemic and economic recovery.\n\nSaturday\u2019s meeting follows days after Ali Bagheri, Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister and chief negotiator for the talks, tweeted that Iran has agreed to restart negotiations by the end of November and a date for a resumption of talks \u201cwould be announced in the course of the next week.\u201d\n\nSullivan said Thursday that the U.S. was still trying to determine whether Iran was serious about the negotiations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not entirely clear to me yet whether the Iranians are prepared to return to talks,\u201d he told reporters aboard Air Force One as Biden flew to Rome for the Group of 20 summit. \u201cWe have heard positive signals that they are, but I think we have to wait and see when and whether they actually show up at the negotiating table.\u201d\n\nSullivan said the group would be sending \u201cclear messages\u201d to Iran that the window for negotiation \u201cis not unlimited.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe, of course, retain all other options to be able to deal with this program as necessary,\u201d he said.\n\nSaturday\u2019s meeting comes days after American officials blamed Iran for a drone attack on a remote U.S. outpost in Syria. Officials said Monday the U.S. believes that Iran resourced and encouraged the attack, but that the drones were not launched from Iran.\n\nNo deaths or injuries were reported as a result of the attack.\n\nIn retaliation, the U.S. Treasury Department on Friday announced new penalties against two senior members of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps and two affiliated companies for supplying lethal drones and related material to insurgent groups in Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and Ethiopia.\n\nAt the summit, Biden was expected to push for progress toward his goal of establishing a global 15% corporate minimum tax, even as his domestic effort to raise the business rate to that figure was stuck in limbo in Washington.\n\nHe also was expected to discuss measures to ease a global energy supply crunch that has led to rising prices, imperiling the global economic recovery.",

          "text": "Rebellious Tigrayan forces said on Saturday they had seized the strategic town of Dessie in Ethiopia\u2019s Amhara region where tens of thousands of ethnic Amharas have sought refuge from an escalation in fighting.\n\nThe fighters pushed Ethiopian government forces from Dessie and were headed towards the town of Kombolcha, Getachew Reda, spokesperson for the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF), told Reuters by satellite phone from an undisclosed location.\n\nHe said Tigrayan forces had captured numerous Ethiopian soldiers.\n\nLegesse Tulu, the Ethiopian government spokesperson, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reuters could not independently verify the TPLF\u2019s account of developments.\n\nThe capture of Dessie would be a strategic gain for the Tigrayan fighters against the central government forces who are trying to dislodge them from the Amhara region.\n\nThe large town is some 385 km (240 miles) from the capital of Addis Ababa and is the furthest south in Amhara that the TPLF has reached since pushing into the region in July.\n\nWar broke nearly a year ago between federal troops and the TPLF, which had ruled Ethiopia for three decades but is now the ruling party of just the region. Thousands of people have been killed more than 2 million people have been forced to flee.\n\nTigrayan forces were initially beaten back, but recaptured most of the region in July and pushed into the neighbouring Amhara and Afar regions, displacing hundreds of thousands more.\n\nIn mid-October, the Tigrayan forces said the military had launched a ground offensive to push them out of Amhara. The military acknowledged on Thursday there was heavy fighting there, but accused the Tigrayan forces of starting it.",

          "text": "Security operatives on Friday laid siege for more than four hours to the Maitama, Abuja, residence of a Judge of the Supreme Court, Justice Mary Odili.\n\nThe operatives had conducted a search allegedly in connection with unspecified illegal activities at Odili\u2019s 9 Imo Street, Maitama residence.\n\nGovernor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State visited the Odilis after the security agents left the residence late Friday night after the search episode.\n\nThe Supreme Court justice is the wife of Dr. Peter Odili, former governor of Rivers, who is presently on the watch list of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nEFCC, had, Friday night, denied conducting any operation in the home of Justice Odili following reports that raid was an EFCC operation.\n\nA statement issued by the Spokesman of EFCC, Wilson Uwujaren, denied the involvement of the commission in the execution any search warrant at the residence of Justice Odili.\n\n\u201cThe attention of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has been drawn to claims in a section of the media that operatives of the Commission today, October 29, 2021 stormed the Maitama, Abuja home of a Judge of the Supreme Court, Justice Mary Odili, purportedly to execute a search.\n\n\u201cThe commission by this statement wishes to inform the public that the report is false as it did not carry out any operation at the home of Justice Odili. If there was any such operation as claimed by the media, it was not carried out by the EFCC.\n\n\u201cThe commission enjoins the public to discountenance the report\u201d, Uwujaren said.\n\nThe Chairman of EFCC, Abdulrasheed Bawa was also on Arise News Friday night to deny insinuations that his men carried out the raid.\n\nBawa said: None of our operatives was there. We did not carry out any raid anywhere in Abuja. It is difficult for anybody to do that without us knowing before, during or after.\n\n\u201cIt is not from EFCC. I think it\u2019s just mischief makers trying to link these things to us against the good working relationship we have with the judiciary. We have a very good working relationship with the judiciary\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cIn fact, I am happy to let Nigerians know that between January and May, we have recorded 1,343 convictions which is a record. They are our biggest partners\u201d, he said.\n\nHe said Justice Odili was expected to make a formal complaint to clear the air on the matter.\n\n\u201cI believe that Hon Justice Mary Odili will make a formal complaint to the appropriate authorities, who will look at it and find out what actually happened at her residence\u201d, he said.\n\nTHISDAY, however, gathered that the raid was part of the investigation of Odili by the Joint Panel on Recovery in the Federal Ministry of Justice headed by the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami.\n\nThe panel comprises representatives of the EFCC, the Nigeria Police Force, and the Ministry of Justice.\n\nIt was further gathered that the probe was targeted at her Justice Odili\u2019s husband, who was Governor of oil-rich Rivers State from 1999 to 2007.\n\nThe security operatives, who came with a search warrant, said they received information on \u201cillegal activities\u201d going on in the house.\n\nA witness, Aliyu Umar, said in an affidavit dated October 13, 2021, that he had given the information to the EFCC.\n\n\u201cI have observed some illegal activities going on in those houses within Abuja are illegal and hereby report the said matter to the law enforcement agency.\n\n\u201cI hereby state that all information provided by me to the EFCC is true and correct to the best of my knowledge,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a second affidavit deposed to by a senior police officer, CSP Lawrence Ajodo, the panel applied to a chief magistrate in Abuja seeking a search warrant for the house.\n\nThe Chief Magistrate, Emmanuel Iyanna, subsequently approved the search warrant on October 29, 2021.\n\nWike had arrived the residence with Abiye Sekibo, former minister of transportation; Raymond Dokpesi, founder of DAAR Communications; Austin Okpara, former deputy speaker of the House of Representatives; Okon Aniete and Lee Maeba, a former senator, among others.\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja",
