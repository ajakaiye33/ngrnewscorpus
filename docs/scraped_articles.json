With the recruitment of the new Amotekun corps, the spate of insecurity will be reduced to the barest minimum; criminal-minded elements should steer clear of the state or face their waterloo.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the newly recruited personnel will be posted to strategic places across the state to work in collaboration with conventional security agencies.\n\nAdeleye commended the governor for his commitment towards the provision of necessary logistics and moral support to ensure the effective take-off of the security networks.

          "text": "The Chief Judge of Akwa Ibom State, Justice Ekaette Obot, has threatened to put behind bars a Lagos-based human rights lawyer, Inibehe Effiong (Esq) for accusing her of being biased or likelihood of bias in the ongoing libel suit by Akwa Ibom State Governor, Mr Udom Emmanuel and Senator Effiong Bob against his client, Leo Ekpenyong, Esq.\n\nIt could be recalled that in suits No HU/279/2019 between deacon Udom Emmanuel VS. Leo Ekpenyong Esq and No: HU/273/2019 between Senator Effiong Bob VS Leo Ekpenyong respectively delivered on 2021by Justice Obot, the defendant was found guilty of libel and was asked to pay the governor a sum of N1.5 Billion and a sum of N500Million to Senator Effiong Bob.\n\nCounsel to the defendant, Mr Effiong, however, filed a motion for the judgement to be set aside, insisting that his client was not given a fair hearing; the prayer was later granted by the court.\n\nHowever, the defence counsel also filed another motion praying the Chief Judge to recuse from the case, alleging prejudice and likelihood of bias.\n\nDuring a proceeding held at High Court 1, Chief Judge\u2019s court, Barracks road today, the defence counsel said \u201cMy Lord, my client Mr Leo Ekpenyong (Esq) has alleged bias, or likelihood of bias of the honourable Chief Judge of Akwa Ibom State, Honourable justice Ekaette Obot.\n\n\u201cThat is why we filed an application before this court on the 23 of June 2022 asking the Honourable Chief Judge to disqualify himself from hearing or presiding over this matter. Defendant has raised that the grounds of that application clearly stated but not limited to the fact that in the course of this proceedings my Lord has personally berated us as counsels. I have been described in venomous terms, we know that by law, a court should not address a counsel in that manner. The seeming hostility that characterized the proceedings to set aside the default judgement is discouraging.\n\n\u201cWhy we are also asking that my Lord should reassign this matter is because my Lord has already delivered a judgement though in default against Mr Ekpenyong where he asked him to pay gov Udom Emmanuel a sum of N1.5 billion and I came before this court asking that, that judgement should be set aside having been delivered in error and in flagrant violation of right of my client to fair hearing because the date that judgement was given, no hearing notice was issued and the registrar gave that date off record. The court agreed with us that the right of our client was violated and set the case aside.\n\n\u201cWe are saying because you have already found the defendant guilty in this matter it is only just and fair that those matters should be reassigned to another Judge to be heard denovo, that is the practice my Lord, for example if the court of appeal has set aside a judgement and sends back the case to be tried before the lower court it usually goes with a consequential order that a new judge should handle that matter, so if the defendant said that he doesn\u2019t have confidence in the honourable Chief Judge of the State to hear his case, it\u2019s only fair that, the matter be reassigned to preserve the dignity, impartiality and honour of the court.\n\n\u201cAll we are saying is that we do not have confidence in my Lord to interprete my matter.\u201d\n\nIrked by the submissions of the defence counsel and his (Mr Effiong) refusal to sit when the counsel to the Claimant, Samuel Ikpo asked him to do so, the Chief Judge said the court will not condone unruly behaviour in the courtroom, warning of her power to send him behind bars or petition him to the National body.\n\nAccording to Justice Obot, \u201cYou cannot say that before me, you can\u2019t talk to your senior like that, I don\u2019t know when this man learnt law. You are trying to intimidate your senior, did you see the type of counter you filed over miscellaneous matters I overlooked? I still set aside that judgement only for you to capitalize on it and you want to play on the intelligence of the court? Do not allow me to send you to prison!\u201d\n\n\u201cSaying that when a matter is set aside that it must be reassigned to another Judge is not the practice, it is a lie from the pit of hell.\u201d\n\nThe Judge, however, proceeded with the hearing of the witness of the Claimant and later adjourned the case to 27 to 29 July for conclusion of Claimant and hearing of defendants case as well as motions filed even when the defence counsel said the dates were not convenient for him insisting that the case was that of defamation and no urgency in it for accelerated hearing.\n\nCounsel to the Claimant, Mr Ikpo refused to talk to journalists at the end of the session insisting that the matter is sub judice.\n\nBut, the defence counsel who spoke to journalists said, \u201cwhat is worrisome is despite the tendency of the application challenging the jurisdiction of the court raising the issue of bias on the last date in this matter, my Lord allowed the claimant in the two cases to call witnesses even when the jurisdiction of the court is being challenged and those witnesses were called in my absence even when I told them that I missed my flight and we were not there to cross examine them, that was why yesterday we filed a motion to set aside the proceeding including the order for the continuation of hearing.\n\n\u201cEven the proceedings of today were in error and should be set aside and I told the court that the motion should have been determined, my Lord did not determine the two motions and yet insisted that we continue with the hearing. We were basically forced to go into trial today.\n\n\u201cMy Lord consistently has accused me of bringing a herbalist to court, how on earth will I do that?

          "text": "A cashier in the office of the Secretary to the Government of Katsina State, on Thursday, was allegedly robbed of N61 million he withdrew from one of the banks in the state capital.\n\nAccording to reports, the cashier, identified as Mr Aminu Darma, had the N61 million packed in three bags when the gunmen attacked him around Steel Rolling Round About and forcefully took the bags of money from him.\n\nAn eyewitness, identified as Aliyu Shehu, said, \u201cI saw a Toyota Corolla, ram into a Hilux van and veered off the road while being chased by another car. Three armed men came out after the car stopped and started shooting into the air. They headed for the crashed car, opened its booth and took three loaded sacks into their car before they drove off.\u201d\n\nReacting to the development, the spokesperson of Katsina Police Command, SP Gambo Isahm, said the command suspected foul play in the attack.\n\n\u201cWe are investigating the surrounding circumstances of the alleged attack. It baffled the command for a state government staff to carry such a huge amount of money without police escort,\u201d Gambo said.\n\nHe lamented that the command is tired of receiving such stories from financial officers from the office of the Secretary to the Government of the State, explaining that a colleague of Mr Darma was also involved in a similar case where he withdrew money and left it in the trunk of his vehicle only to report that the money was stolen.\n\nGambo further disclosed that Mr Darma only sustained minor bruises in the attack, contrary to the story that the robbers shot him on his arm.\n\n\u201cThe modus operandi was very suspicious. An attack with AK 47 by real armed robbers may lead to fatal injury and not mere bruises. We are also investigating why the personnel went alone to pick up the money without any supporting staff and only to be robbed by two gunmen in an ash-coloured Camry.\n\n\u201cHe was alleged to have single-handedly withdrawn the sum of sixty-one million naira from the bank. There is a conspiracy theory we are investigating here,\u201d Gambo said.",

          "text": "The abrupt resignation of Justice Tanko Muhammed as the 17th Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) manifested as a rude shock to everyone during the week. It sent many tongues wagging. His resignation from service did not come without intrigues. The 68-year-old reportedly resigned on the grounds of ill health. His resignation comes about 18 months before his retirement in December 2023, when he will clock 69.\n\nRecall that Tanko was sworn in as substantive CJN on July 24, 2019, about six months after he assumed office in an acting capacity. His predecessor, ex-CJN Walter Onnoghen, was suspended in controversial circumstances by President Muhammadu Buhari in January 2019 over allegations of non-asset declaration.\n\nAccording to Tanko\u2019s profile on the websites of the Supreme Court and the National Judicial Council, he studied law at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria from 1976-1980 and then at the Nigerian Law School where he was called to the bar in 1981.\n\nTanko served as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria since 2005 and the CJN since 2019. He was formerly a Justice of the Nigerian Courts of Appeal.\n\nHe was born at Doguwa-Giade, a local government area in Bauchi State.\n\nIn a swift replacement, Justice Olukayode Ariwoola has since been sworn in to replace Tanko. The new CJN is said to be the most senior justice of the Supreme Court. He was born on August 22, 1958.\n\nAriwoola took the oath of office before Buhari to run the Judiciary while awaiting the Senate\u2019s confirmation of his appointment as the 22nd CJN. He is the third Supreme Court Justice to occupy the top position under the Buhari-led Administration.\n\nBuhari in his remarks while accepting Tanko\u2019s exit said history would be kind to the ex-CJN. In line with the usual custom, Buhari bestowed the nation\u2019s second-highest national honour of the Grand Commander of the Order of the Niger (GCON) on Muhammad.\n\n\u201cHistory will be kind to Justice Tanko Muhammed for his modest contributions to Nigeria\u2019s Judiciary, the strengthening of our democracy, and national development.\u201d the President said.\n\nBefore Tanko\u2019s resignation, there were hushed rumours in some quarters. Justices of the country\u2019s apex court had jointly accused him of corruption, maladministration, and incompetence.\n\nThe 14 justices decried the poor condition of service they were faced with. The Nation exclusively published the content of the protest letter on June 13.\n\nBut Tanko denied the allegations raised against him by the Supreme Court Justices.\n\nThe denial was contained in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant (Media), Ahuraka Isah, titled, \u2018Re: State Of Affairs In The Supreme Court And Demand By Justices Of The Supreme Court\u2019.\n\nTanko\u2019s resignation raised eyebrows. It also elicited mixed reactions. Many argued that Tanko\u2019s resignation was a swift one to avoid being consumed by his current travails.\n\nReacting, the Civil rights advocacy group, Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, called on the National Judicial Council and the Code of Conduct Tribunal to probe the corruption allegations levelled against Tanko.\n\nAlso, a senior lawyer and son of a former Justice of the Supreme Court, Emmanuel Ogebe, took a swipe at Tanko\u2019s tenure, describing his voluntary resignation on Monday as the \u201cend of an error\u201d.\n\nAlso, the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) pledged its readiness to collaborate with the new CJN and the Judiciary \u201cin cleansing the Augean Stable and addressing the ills that have continued to plague not just the Judiciary but the entire legal profession.\u201d\n\nA few weeks ago, Tanko\u2019s two sons \u2014 Siraj Ibrahim and Sani Ibrahim \u2014 emerged as Senatorial and House of Representatives candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), respectively, in Bauchi State.",

While some believe Matawalle\u2019s move is a strong challenge to the federal government and relevant security agencies to act swiftly and tame the marauders.\n\nSome others argued that granting residents permission to carry arms could open up a state of anarchy and lawlessness across Nigeria.\n\nBut the bottom line remains that the continuous bandit and terrorist attacks have left many victims agitated, bitter, and traumatised.

          "text": "Estranged celebrity couple, Funke Akindele-Bello and Abdulrasheed Bello aka JJC Skillz were in the public eye this week, especially on social media platform. Speculations had initially made the rounds that the celebrity couple whose union was recently blessed with a pair of twins was having troubles in their marriage.\n\nIt would be recalled that JJC Skillz, in April, dismissed rumours of a crisis in their marriage.\n\nHowever, he announced his separation from Akindele, an actress notable for her stellar performance in popular sitcom, Jenifa\u2019s Diaries, during the week, disclosing that their marriage had been problematic in the last two years.\n\nJJC Skillz stated that he had to move out of their home three months ago after Akindele insisted he did, and had not been able to discuss with her since the Africa Magic Viewer\u2019s Choice Awards on May 14.\n\nAnnouncing their separation, JJC Skillz wrote: \u201cDear Friends and family, I need to let you know that Funke and I have separated. While it lasted we shared a lot of things together and have created 2 beautiful children.\n\n\u201cThe last two years had been extremely difficult for us. I know I have tried my best to fix things but I believe it is beyond repair now.\n\n\u201cThree months ago and at Funke\u2019s insistence, I moved out of the house and apart from AMVCA have not been able to get Funke to sit down in an amicable manner to discuss the future of our relationship.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m making this announcement so that the public is clear that we both are pursuing separate lives.\n\n\u201cWe still have issues that need to be addressed such as the custody and well-being of our kids, which is paramount as well as business interests which need to be disentangled but I have no doubt that these will be resolved one way or the other.\u201d\n\nThe announcement generated controversy as different narratives made the rounds on social media.\n\nRecall that the now-estranged lovebirds got married in 2016 and welcomed a set of twins in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, Akindele is yet to make any official statement about the news of their separation, just as she has ignored several speculations regarding their troubled union.\n\nFunke, who is also a lawyer, is one of the most successful Nollywood actresses in contemporary times. She starred in the sitcom \u2018I Need to Know\u2019 from 1998 to 2002. She, however, rose to fame for her role in the movie titled Jenifa, which earned her the nickname Jenifa.\n\nShe has hit series like Jenifa\u2019s Diary, My Siblings and I, Aiyetoro Town and hit movies like the record-breaking Omo Ghetto: The Saga, all coming from her production company, Scene-One Production.\n\nAlthough Funke\u2019s sail through the world of marriage has not been a smooth and easy one, she has forged on regardless.\n\nRecall that the 45-year-old actress was previously married to Kehinde Almaroof Oloyede but divorced in July 2013, due to irreconcilable differences.\n\nShe got married to Oloyede, a Lagos-based businessman, in 2012 and the marriage lasted for only 413 days.\n\nHer ex-husband broke the news of their separation on his Facebook page.\n\nThe post read: \u201cIt\u2019s with a heavy heart that I am announcing the separation of me and my wife, Mrs Olufunke Akindele; we\u2019ve both agreed to go our separate ways because of irreconcilable differences. We are still best friends, and we 4ever(sic) remain good friends\u201d.\n\nReacting, to JJC SKillz recent announcement of his separation from Akindele, fans of the celebrity couple expressed sadness over the duo\u2019s sweet love gone sour.\n\nPopular actor, Samuel Jemitalo, advised men against marrying women who are successful, independent and established. The movie star also warned men about women who are \u201csocial media freaks.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting, Funke\u2019s stepson, Benito, who had on several occasions dragged his controversial step mum on social media, wrote a cryptic message.\n\nBenito has been in the public eye after he alleged that Akindele, his stepmom, was a horrible person.\n\nThe 17-year-old son of the music executive and director, who had once accused his father of physical assault, gloated at the separation after the senior Bello confirmed the marriage crash in an Instagram post.\n\nBenito wrote, \u201cI spoke the truth mehn,\u201d under his Instagram stories.",

          "text": "By \u2018Dare Odufowokan, Assistant Editor, Kolade Adeyemi, Jos and Okungbowa Aiwerie, Asaba\n\nJang: 2023 looks bleak over vice presidential nominee\n\nWe need Wike, says Okowa\u2019s aide\n\nI didn\u2019t meet with Rivers gov in France \u2013 Tinubu\n\nPressure is mounting on the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, and the party\u2019s National Chairman, Dr Iyorchia Ayu, to urgently address the festering crisis sparked by the recent nomination of Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa as presidential running mate.\n\nA former governor of Plateau State, Chief Jonah Jang, yesterday issued the latest warning that the party risked a disastrous outing in next year\u2019s polls should it fail to \u201cretrace its step in the right direction with hope of salvaging the already bad situation within the shortest time.\u201d\n\nJang spoke 48 hours after Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom expressed dismay at the way Atiku ignored the recommendation of the PDP committee that Rivers State Nyesom Wike be picked as vice presidential candidate.\n\nOn the same day as Ortom, former Ekiti State Governor Ayodele Fayose declared on Twitter that it was the turn of the southern part of Nigeria to produce President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s successor.\n\nHe insinuated that the PDP had deviated from the provisions of its own constitution on rotating the presidency between the North and the South.\n\nBut an aide to Governor Okowa said yesterday that his principal was willing to \u201cwork very well\u201d with Wike and ensure that the party emerges victorious in the 2023 elections.\n\nParty sources told The Nation yesterday that the anger over Atiku\u2019s choice of Okowa was not about to subside.\n\nAmong the aggrieved are some of the state governors elected on the platform of the PDP.\n\nSome are said to be canvassing for Okowa to be dropped outright for Wike who was recommended by 14 of the 17 members of the committee set up by the party to pick Atiku\u2019s running mate.\n\nAtiku and Ayu are currently out of the country; the former vice president in Dubai and the party chairman on vacation.\n\nA source said yesterday that the growing discontent in the party may force them back home earlier than planned.\n\nAtiku himself twitted on Thursday that \u201cwe are taking action to address the feelings of all party members.\n\nHe said when governors, legislators and other elected officials of the party speak, \u201cI listen. I do not only listen, appropriate actions have been taken, are being taken, and will continue to be advanced.\u201d\n\nA party source said yesterday: \u201dAll through the week, party elders, chieftains as well as other stakeholders have been bombarding the PDP secretariat with visits and calls to express their worries over the growing negative outbursts by some of our governors and chieftains as regards our chances at the 2023 presidential election. Many of them want urgent steps to be taken.\n\n\u201cThe National Chairman is aware of the developments and he is reaching out to concerned officials on what to do in the interim as he is out of the country.\n\n\u201cHopefully, he will be with us soon to personally lead the moves towards the needed solutions.\n\n\u201cI am not the national chairman and he is the only one who can officially comment on these issues. That is why I say this is off record.\n\n\u201cBut PDP is a serious party and we appreciate the concerns from Nigerians. It shows we are loved and Nigerians don\u2019t want us to do anything that can keep the ruling party in office beyond 2023.\n\n\u201cOur presidential candidate too is in touch with the secretariat and I can tell you he too will soon be here to take urgent steps to pacify all those who are genuinely aggrieved.\u201d\n\nThe Nation also gathered that some party elders met during the week and resolved to appeal to Governor Wike and his supporters to forgive whatever might have been done against them.\n\n\u201cThere was a meeting of prominent party elders in Abuja during the week. It was called by the BoT and the attendance was good. The main agenda was to begin moves to beg those who are angry,\u201d another source said.\n\n\u201cThe meeting resolved to not only reach out to Wike and his supporters, but to also mandate Atiku and Ayu to enter into discussions with angry party men to ensure that the PDP does not go into the next general elections divided.\n\n\u201cAside from the complaints over Okowa, there are also issues that emanated over the emergence of the governorship candidates in Osun, Delta, Lagos and Ogun states among others.\n\n\u201cBut the absence of most of the gladiators from the country at the moment stalled immediate action by the elders. Wike, Atiku and Ayu are all out of the country as we speak.\u201d\n\nSeveral sources however said it would be difficult to drop Okowa for Wike.\n\nWike declines meeting with Atiku\u2019s emissary in Turkey\n\nPremium Times reported last night that Governor Wike, who is currently vacationing in Istanbul, Turkey, yesterday declined to meet with Alhaji Adamu Waziri, a close ally of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar who was sent by the PDP presidential candidate for a dialogue to resolve their differences.\n\nWike has remained silent since he was overlooked by Atiku in his choice of running mate, although his associates, including Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom, have openly condemned the way the Rivers State governor was treated.\n\nThe Atiku emissary to Turkey is the latest effort by him to sort out things with Wike who reportedly declined Waziri\u2019s request for the two of them to huddle to enable him deliver a message from Atiku.\n\nTinubu\u2019s supposed meeting with Wike in France is \u2018fake news\u2019\n\nAll Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, yesterday denied speculations about a meeting between him and Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike outside Nigeria.\n\nHe dismissed the report as fake news.\n\nTinubu said in a statement by his media aide, Tunde Rahman, that although he is currently in France, there is no plan to meet the governor.\n\nBut he said he holds Wike in high esteem.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cWe have seen a viral social media post made by one of the chieftains of All Progressives Congress in Lagos State and media reports emanating from same about a supposed meeting in France between APC Presidential Standard-bearer, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and His Excellency, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State.\n\n\u201cIt has become imperative to set the record straight. Although Asiwaju Tinubu is presently in France, he didn\u2019t have any meeting with Governor Wike whether in that country or anywhere whatsoever.\n\n\u201cThis, however, does not detract from the fact that the APC presidential candidate holds Governor Wike in high esteem.\n\n\u201cAnd given the national and across-party lines appeal of Asiwaju Tinubu\u2019s candidature, he will not hesitate to meet any important national leader when desirable.\n\n\u201cAs made public earlier, Asiwaju Tinubu is in France for some important engagements. He will return to the country shortly.\n\n\u201cWe would like, once again, to advice journalists to always cross-check their information with appropriate officers before rushing to press to avoid unintended errors.\u201d\n\nOkowa\u2019s emergence is disheartening; it may cost us victory, says Jang\n\nA member of the PDP Board of Trustees (BoT) and former Governor of Plateau State, Senator Jonah Jang, warned yesterday that the party has a lot of home work to do to clear the mess caused by Alhaji Atiku Abubakar\u2019s choice of Governor Okowa as his running mate in contradiction of the recommendation of the committee set up by the party.\n\nJang told reporters in Jos that the 2023 presidential election looked bleak for the party except the crisis created by Atiku\u2019s adoption of Okowa as running mate was resolved immediately.\n\nHe said the outcome of last month\u2019s governorship election in Ekiti State was a clear message to the PDP that it could not afford to go into the next presidential election as a divided house.\n\nHis words: \u201cAs one of the founding fathers alive today, one who participated in the processes that set the background for our primaries, I am compelled to add my voice to that of prominent members of our great party who have shown dismay with recent happenings, particularly with the emergence of the vice-presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWhile it is no longer news that the presidential primaries have come and gone and a candidate emerged, it is disheartening that the manner in which the vice-presidential candidate emerged is nothing but sheer disregard for processes. We all are aware of the fact that the party, in consultation with the presidential candidate, set up a committee to select a running mate.\n\n\u201dTo turn around and throw away the outcome of the exercise is a clear proof that the work of the committee was either not appreciated or was not going to be in consideration ab initio.\n\nQuoting Governor Samuel Ortom, who was a member of the 17-member committee set up by the PDP to recommend a presidential running mate, Jang said, \u201cFourteen of us in the committee said the person should be Nyesom Wike unfortunately Atiku picked Okowa in his wisdom.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Jang said: \u201cYou cannot ignore the decision of a committee you set up yourself and expect people to be happy.\n\n\u201cThat such people are treated the way the party is currently doing is a pointer to the fact that more is to come. No one who intends to go against the APC, which has failed in its promises but thrives on propaganda, will go with a divided camp.\n\n\u201cThis explains the urgency with which the party ought to retrace its step in the right direction with a hope of salvaging the already bad situation within the shortest time.\u201d\n\nJang asked the BoT of PDP and the National Working Committee to do all within their power to stop further dissonance arising from the treatment of ranking members of the party, especially Governor Nyesom Wike.\n\nHe said the present situation where the governors of the party have started distancing themselves from the activities of the party and other influential members making public statements indicating their displeasure did not bode well for the PDP, adding that dragging the party into unnecessary disagreements months away from the general elections was not in anybody\u2019s interest.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is unfortunate that the very man, who admittedly has been a pillar of the party at a time the repressive tendencies of the governing APC was to send the PDP into oblivion, will be treated in the manner the party has.\n\n\u201cUntil we correct the mistakes, which we deliberately made, the future is bleak and the PDP may be caught in a trap it has set for itself. We cannot run a campaign for a candidate whose campaign promise is hinged on uniting Nigerians but not be seen to be doing enough to bring party members together.\n\n\u201cThe time to act is now, all well-meaning party leaders and stakeholders must rise in defence of the truth as a way of assuring our teeming supporters of the seriousness of the party to wrest power from the APC. We cannot fold our hands and watch the party drift away from the tenets which have made it the only truly democratic party in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe former governor said the whims of a few should not be allowed to override the choices of many who believe in the PDP and its ability to return Nigeria to the glorious days.\n\nWe need Wike, says Okowa\u2019s aide\n\nDelta State Information Commissioner Charles Aniagwu said yesterday that Governor Ifeanyi Okowa would work with other Southern leaders, including Governor Wike, to galvanise voters for PDP\u2018s victory in next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nAniagwu, speaking on \u201cFocus Today\u201d on African Independent Television (AIT), yesterday, said: \u201cOkowa will work with other leaders in the south and across the country to galvanize the voters. He (Okowa) believes that to have an inroad in Rivers State, for example, he will need leaders led by Wike to get the votes.\n\n\u2018\u2019Okowa will work with Wike very well. Okowa will also reach out to our brothers and sisters in the South-West and in the South-East, which is already happening. The challenge at hand is not a one-man show.\n\n\u201cBeyond members of our party, Nigerians believe that the PDP should get it right as the major option for the people ahead of the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cOur economy is at its lowest ebb, corruption and the need to curb it and the issue of hunger, poverty and unemployment as people are no longer sure of where their next meal will come from.\n\nThese are some of the issues that leaders must interrogate as we move closer to the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cIt will no longer be business as usual, it is not enough to identify these challenges, leaders must tell Nigerians how they intend to address them.\u201d",

          "title": "2023: Six govs move against Atiku",
          "text": "From Fred Itua, Abuja\n\nAhead of the constitution of the campaign organisation of the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, the crisis rocking the party appears far from over.\n\nThe latest development, Saturday Sun reliably gathered, may put a clog in the wheel of the opposition party\u2019s determination to triumph in next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nThe festering crisis in the party, which assumed a new dimension last month following the announcement of Ifeanyi Okowa as the running mate to Atiku, Saturday Sun has learnt, started a few weeks after Iyorchia Ayu was elected National Chairman of the PDP.\n\nA source in the PDP told Saturday Sun that the widening gulf has now pitted six PDP governors, predominantly from the South, against Atiku\u2019s presidential bid.\n\nThe source listed some of the governors as Nyesom Wike of Rivers State; Samuel Ortom of Benue State; Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State; Seyi Makinde of Oyo State and Ishaku Darius of Taraba and Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State, as governors unwilling to support Atiku\u2019s bid.\n\nConfirming the bad blood in the rank and file of the party, Ortom had, during the weak, said he might not work for the actualisation of Atiku\u2019s presidential bid.\n\nHe said: \u201cAll that was needed even before the pronouncement, after we did our recommendation, Wike would have been reached out to, he is a human being.\n\n2023: Court stops INEC from ending ... To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video 2023: Court stops INEC from ending voter registration\n\n\u201cThis is a man who has built the party today in PDP. He has fought all night and all day to see that this party remains together. So, he would have been reached out to, to say that this is the decision we are taking and this is the reason we are taking this decision, and I think he would have understood.\u201d\n\nAccording to the PDP source, trouble started when Ayu was elected national chairman of the PDP. The source said leaders of the party had agreed to zone the chairmanship of the PDP to the North, while the South, like the All Progressives Congress (APC), would produce the presidential candidate.\n\nHe said as soon as Ayu assumed office, he jettisoned the arrangement he inherited and started working for the emergence of Atiku, who is seen as his close political ally, to emerge as the candidate. The source, who didn\u2019t want to be named, said despite attempts by governors and other leaders of the party to prevail on Ayu to respect the agreement that he inherited, the former Senate President remained adamant.\n\n\u201cWhen it was obvious that Ayu wasn\u2019t ready to listen and zone the presidential ticket to the South, governors and other leaders decided to leave the contest open. But they agreed to support a Southern aspirant, but people like Okowa, Godwin Obaseki of Edo State and other people, especially from the South South, started working to ensure that a Northern candidate emerged,\u201d he narrated.\n\nRevealing further, the source said when Wike lost the primary election to Atiku, party leaders agreed that it would be best to pick him as the running mate to Atiku. He revealed the aforementioned governors met with Atiku and other leaders to pick Wike as a popular choice, but were ignored by Ayu and Atiku, who are believed to be micro-managed by some powerful Northern leaders. Unable to have their way, he said the six governors decided not to play any active role during the presidential campaign of Atiku. He said though they may not defect to the APC, they\u2019re likely to sabotage the chances of the PDP from within.\n\n\u201cThe governors can\u2019t and won\u2019t defect. They understand that clearly. If they defect now, their candidates can\u2019t win elections. Some of them are gunning for a second term. But they\u2019ll sabotage Atiku the same way PDP governors sabotaged President Goodluck Johnathan in 2015.\n\n\u201cIf you recall, many governors of the PDP, especially from the North, worked for the emergence of Buhari. They didn\u2019t leave the PDP, but they sabotaged it from within. That\u2019s what may play out in the case of Atiku.\n\n\u201cThere is a general consensus from Southern leaders that power should return to the region. And many PDP governors are close friends of the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. They will work for him. If that happens, hold Atiku and Ayu responsible,\u201d the angry source further revealed.\n\nSaturday Sun has also reliably gathered that Tinubu\u2019s men have started reaching out to the aggrieved governors and other key Southern leaders of the PDP. It was learnt that Tinubu\u2019s current vacation in Europe is part of the arrangement to meet with some of the governors who are also out of the country for the summer holiday.\n\nCurrently, Wike and Ikpeazu are in Turkey on their annual vacation. Beside Tinubu who is in Europe, other key PDP and APC leaders, are reportedly out of the country too for some clandestine meetings, ahead of the kick off of the campaigns in September. Despite the festering crisis, Atiku has assured that he will reconcile the various factions and address concerns raised. In a Facebook post, he wrote: \u201cThe Peoples Democratic Party will remain united. Focus on our actions. We are taking action to address the feelings of all party members. The unity in our community is my priority.

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu\n\nContrary to general assumption, the smashing of kidnappers\u2019 hideouts in parts of Anambra State is far from bringing an end to the criminal enterprise in the South East, as more of such dens have been discovered in the region.\n\nSaturday Sun investigations showed that the Umunneochi/Lokpanata axis of Abia State, Mbano/Mbaise and Isi-Uzo areas of Imo and Enugu States, respectively, harbour notorious camps of kidnappers.\n\nIt was also gathered that bandits operating in the Umunneochi and Isi-Uzo are majorly herders.\n\nAccounts of survivors of their dastardly attacks revealed that these criminals work hand in gloves with natives of such communities.\n\nOne of their latest escapades was the abduction of seven indigenes of Isiugwu Ohafia, in Ohafia Local Government Area of Abia State on Saturday, June 25, 2022, along the notorious Umunneochi section of the Enugu-Port Harcourt expressway.\n\nThough four of the abductees were initially freed by their abductors to go home and quickly mobilise ransom for the release of their remaining kinsmen, it was learnt that the captives regained their freedom within the week after some ransom was delivered.\n\nThe foregoing incident occurred at the same area where the Prelate of the Methodist Church of Nigeria, Dr Samuel Kanu-Uche and some of his clerics and assistants were abducted few weeks ago with N100million ransom paid. Indigenes of the area insist that a web consisting of security operatives including soldiers and Fulani herders was responsible for the nefarious acts. It was also discovered that their methods and tactics were almost similar notwithstanding the gang and where they operated.\n\nAgain gunmen invade, bomb Kogi poli... To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Again gunmen invade, bomb Kogi police station, kill one officer\n\nIn Enugu State, at least four indigenes of Ikem community in Isi-Uzo local government area have been abducted in the past two weeks with different sums of ransom paid for their release.\n\nThe victims were the Catechist of Saint James Catholic Church, Ishioroto-Ikem Lawrence Ndu; an Italy-based evangelist, Emeka Odo, his brother Ikechukwu Odo; and the most recent victim, Ejike Agbodo, a commercial bus driver who was abducted while on duty along Ikem-Benue State road.\n\nNarrating his experience, the Italy-based evangelist, Emeka Odo disclosed that the over 10 kidnappers who abducted them along Ikem- Obollo Afor road were all Fulani that wielded AK-47 rifles. Odo who quickly went back to his base shortly after he regained freedom, narrated that they were flagged down in their car, commandeered into the bush and were taken through bush tracks to Eha-Amufu and Benue State border, adding that they paid ransom before they were freed.\n\nOdo said that his abductors spoke Hausa and Fulfulde languages, claiming that most of them came from Niger Republic. Evangelist Odo told Saturday Sun that the criminals claimed that the have run a ring around the Eastern parts of the country. \u201cThey told us that they own all bush paths from Delta to all parts of South East and that they do anything they want to do,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also revealed that even people from Benue State who were kidnapped were brought to their bush camp in Eha-Amufu, Enugu State, where he said the kidnappers had sacked the indigenes. The spate of insecurity in the Eha-Amufu area of Isi-Uzo, Enugu State has continued to be a source of concern as several farmers have lost their lives with many others chased out of their farm settlements by marauding herders.\n\nIn January this year, an attack at Abor Community in Eha-Amufu, claimed one life with three others critically wounded. About two weeks earlier, Saturday Sun gathered that armed herders attacked Mgbuji farm settlements, also in the local government, resulting in the death of at least three farmers while the herders relocated to another farm settlement in Abor.\n\nPrecisely on January 27, at least six persons were feared dead following an attack by suspected herdsmen at a farm settlement in Mgbuji and Ebo, Eha-Amufu. It was further gathered that the particular attack lasted about eight hours.\n\nA community leader in Mgbuji, Eric Ebeh had confirmed the attack at the period. Then on March 26, 2022, six persons, including pregnant women, were again killed in another attack by suspected herdsmen in Mgbuji and Ebo autonomous communities in Eha-Amufu.\n\nMany residents of the communities were also said to be missing while houses and motorcycles were burnt during the attack on seven farm settlements. Trouble started when youths of the area chased some herders out of their farms for allegedly allowing their cows to destroy hectares of cassava plantation. In the ensuing struggle between the youth and the herders, some cows were reportedly killed, causing the herdsmen to launch a reprisal.\n\nThey were said to have invaded the settlements with AK-47 rifles and shot indiscriminately. Expressing his frustration, a community source had said: \u201cAfter soldiers left the community for about four days, the Fulani herdsmen launched the attack on Thursday. When we heard rumours that they were preparing to invade our communities, we promptly alerted the police and the military.\n\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is why all the soldiers deployed to the settlements were withdrawn. I must tell you that except one soldier from the South-South, all the soldiers deployed to the community were northern Muslims. On one of the occasions, they even opened fire on our local vigilantes who were patrolling the settlements to repel attacks by the invaders.\n\n\u201cSo, the herders came in full force and killed many people and burnt houses and property. There is high tension here. As we speak, we have recovered bodies of six people that were killed and so many are missing.\u201d\n\nBetween January and March, no fewer than seven brutal attacks had been launched on the agrarian community. It was learnt that one of the victims, Ejike Odo, got a report that his sister who went to the farm was attacked by herdsmen while she was returning from farm, and he rushed to the farm to rescue her.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the herdsmen who were about four overpowered him, stabbed him several times before slitting his throat,\u201d a community leader who gave his name as Justus Nwonye said. Also in May, 2022, suspected herdsmen reportedly killed a young man in Okpulugwu Agu-Amede community in Eha-Amufu.\n\nAlso, no fewer than six pilgrims were on Sunday, June 19, abducted near a Monastery at Ibite Awhum community in Udi Local Government Area of Enugu State, when some gunmen suspected to be Fulani invaded the town. However, sources from the community said that help came the way of the victims following a joint operation of forest guards from Udi and Enugu East Local Government Councils.\n\nWhile the skirmishes involving the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) sponsored Eastern Security Network (ESN) continued in the Orlu Senatorial District of Imo State and extending to Ihiala in Anambra State, kidnapping has upped in the Mbano/Mbaise areas of the state. Some of their camps and gangs had been identified and destroyed by security forces.\n\nMeanwhile, the whereabouts of the traditional ruler of Isuokoma community, in Onicha LGA of Ebonyi State, Eze Ambrose Ogbu and the woman leader of the area, Mrs Juliana Uzor, who were abducted in separate incidents about two weeks ago were still unknown. The woman leader was abducted at her farm while the monarch\u2019s incident happened in his palace.\n\nSaturday Sun learnt that the abductors of the royal father were demanding N200million ransom for his release. Indigenes said the two incidents have caused serious fear and panic in the hitherto peaceful settlement.\n\nThe apex Igbo socio-cultural and political body, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to address the precarious security situation instead of dissipating energy and resources trampling on members of IPOB. Its spokesman, Alex Ogbonnia said: \u201cOhanaeze contends that if Mr President confronts the menace of the Fulani herdsmen who have been terrorizing several states, communities and individuals for over seven years now with similar obsession and commitment deployed to IPOB, Nigeria will be a better place.\u201d",

Apart from being Nigeria\u2019s first Deep Seaport, Lekki Port will also be the first fully automated port at take-off.\n\n\u201cThis provides an insight into the path we are already toeing as a management team to govern the operationalisation of not just the forthcoming Badagry, Ibom and Bonny Deep Seaports, but also of the reconstruction of the aged Tin-Can Port, where work will commence immediately the transport ministry and FEC approve.\u201d\n\nHe said that automation remained the most veritable tool for assuring port efficiency.\n\n\u201cAs most of us are aware, the NPA is working assiduously under the technical guidance of the International Maritime Organization to deploy the Port Community System which will enable us respond squarely to the dictates of global trade facilitation and optimise the opportunities of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement to which Nigeria is signatory.\n\n\u201cOur strategic intent of becoming the maritime logistics hub for sustainable ports services in Africa rests heavily on how well we are able to deepen our efficiencies through a construction of deep seaports in order to leverage the concomitant benefits of economies of scale.\u201d\n\nBello-Koko congratulated all stakeholders on the milestone and prayed for greater strides as the nation pushes toward trade facilitation.\n\nNAN reports that the vessels came from Hong Kong.\n\nEarlier, Chairman of Lekki Port LFTZ Enterprise Limited, Mr Abiodun Dabiri, had said that the arrival of the vessel was historic as it would begin to deliver Nigeria as a regional hub for maritime business.\n\n\u201cNow, the vessel we just received is carrying some major cranes and those cranes will enhance the transformation business of the deep sea port.\n\n\u201cThe draft of the depth of this sea is about 16.5 meters and the vessel itself can only take about 14.5 meters; the implication of this is that there is no where else in this country that this vessel can berth and that is what makes it historic.\n\n\u201cSo, in terms of efficiency, when you talk of STS crane, it means ship to shore which is devoid of manhandling; it will just be automated.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be fully automated; it will transform the maritime business and make Nigeria a regional hub,\u201d he said.

By this singular action, Germany has taken the lead in correcting the wrongs of the past,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said Germany did not colonize Nigeria and was not part of the looting of its artefacts. He said that many of the Benin Bronzes in German public institutions got there via trade and donations.\n\n\n\n\u201cYet, Germany and the great people of this nation decided it is better to shape the future by correcting the ills of the past. I have\n\nno doubt in my mind that this pace-setting action by the Federal Government of Germany will become a harbinger of more\n\nrepatriation of cultural property to their place of origin, as other museums and institutions are expected to take a cue from what Germany\n\nhas done.\n\n\n\n\u201cGermany has gained more friends in Nigeria and all over the world by returning to Nigeria what rightfully belongs to it,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\n\n\nOn his part, Ambassador Dada called Germany the \u201cchampion of justice and fairness\u201d.\n\nIn her remarks, the German Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, Ms. Baerbock, said it was morally impermissible to take the Benin bronzes. \u201cIt was wrong to keep them for (125 years). This is the beginning to right the wrong\u201d.\n\nAt the signing ceremony and in a symbolic gesture signifying the impending return of the artefacts, two of the Benin Bronzes were handed over to Nigeria.\n\nThe signing was witnessed by top Nigerian and Germany government officials, including the Nigerian Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Yusuf\n\nTuggar, and the Director-General of Nigeria\u2019s National Commission for Museums and Monuments, Prof. Abba Tijani.",

          "text": "Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan\n\nThe gubernatorial candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Oyo state, Mr. Michael Lana, has come hard on governors in the country, accusing them of producing poor citizens rather than prosperous ones.\n\nThe former Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice said this after he was conferred with the Role Model Award, by the Rotary Club of Ibadan-Oritamefa.\n\nHe said there is the need to change from the present system that lacks ideology which is full of misplaced priorities, insisting that the time has come to go back to the old principle of ideology where governance will be felt in every household.\n\nOn how he joined partisan politics, he explained that people whom he has helped as a lawyer were the ones that prevailed on him to join the gubernatorial contest, adding that he joined the gubernatorial race ahead of the 2023 elections to heed the calls of Nigerians who got succour from him through his legal profession.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cSo many organisations, so many groups and individuals that I have helped through the cause of my career as a lawyer that I have handled cases for pro-bono are the ones that came to me and say that they were not satisfied with what is going on in Oyo State and they want somebody like me who has the passion for the people to come out and lead the people into another level of governance.\n\n\u201cBecause, what we have now is not governance, it is just mismanagement of state resources. What we have since 2004/2005 has been a mis-direction of priorities. They will leave what will benefit the people and spend substantial amount of state funds to do what people don\u2019t need.\n\n\u201cThat is why I choose SDP because it is more or less an offshot of Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) by late Obafemi Awolowo. Those who formed the bedrock of UPN are people from UPN. And the new generation can still see what Awolowo has done in 1959, in 1958. But, can we see what the governors did in the last six to seven years. What has been the effect of the expenditure of the state resources on the ordinary people.\n\n\u201cWe are only producing more poor and poor people instead of prosperous citizens.\n\n\u201cI have handled so many cases, people that were being oppressed by the government. These are what I stand for and that is why they called me people\u2019s lawyer. I tried to ensure that every oppressed people gets justice especially from the court. That is what I stand for and that is why they are honouring me today.\u201d",

While it lasted we shared a lot of things together and have created 2 beautiful children.\n\n\u201cThe last two years have been extremely difficult for us. I know I have tried my best to fix things but I believe it is beyond repair now. 3 months ago and at Funke's insistence I moved out of the house and apart from AMVCA, I have not been able to get Funke to sit down in an amicable manner to discuss the future of our relationship.\n\n\u201cI'm making this announcement so that the public is clear that we both are pursuing separate lives.

Sadly, such violence has become all too familiar for Christians in Africa\u2019s most populous country,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLast year, however, you inexplicably removed Nigeria\u2019s designation as a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) despite no demonstrable improvement in the country\u2019s religious freedom conditions.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, the situation in Nigeria has grown worse. We previously urged you to immediately reverse your misguided decision, and we write today to renew our call.\n\n\u201cRecent high-profile acts of violence underscore the intense religious persecution that is regularly experienced by Nigerian Christians.\n\n\u201cOn Pentecost Sunday, gunmen attacked St. Francis Catholic Church in Nigeria\u2019s Ondo state, reportedly killing at least 50 churchgoers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLast month, a violent mob brutally stoned to death Deborah Emmanuel Yakubu, a student at Shehu Shagari College of Education in northwest Nigeria.\n\n\u201cAccording to reports, some Islamist students were enraged by a \u201cblasphemous\u201d message Deborah had posted in a WhatsApp group, in which she said that \u201cJesus Christ is the greatest. He helped me pass my exams.\n\n\u201cMerely expressing one\u2019s Christian faith has apparently become tantamount to a death sentence in many parts of Nigeria. Religious violence and intolerance directed toward Nigerian Christians has worsened in recent years.\n\n\u201cOne report documented more than 4,650 cases of Nigerian Christians who were killed for their faith in 2021. Accordingly, Nigeria earns the dubious honor \u2014 for the second consecutive year \u2014 of being the deadliest country on earth for Christians.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMake no mistake: continued enforcement of state-sanctioned blasphemy laws enables the type of deadly violence that killed Deborah Emmanuel Yakubu and so many others.\n\n\u201cWhen we previously wrote you, we were met with a response which failed to answer our questions about why the State Department views Nigeria as not having engaged in or tolerated \u201csystematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom\u201d or even \u201csevere violations of religious freedom.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGiven the abysmal state of religious freedom in Nigeria, it is incumbent upon you to reverse last year\u2019s decision and redesignate the country as a CPC. The moment demands that you do so without delay. We look forward to your swift action on this important matter.\u201d",

Fintech startups raised $195,900,000 (44.82%), AI/deeptech startups raised $47,000,000 (10.75%), and mobility/logistics startups raised $45,700,00 (10.46%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nPer region, West Africa leads with 37.47% of the amount raised. This is largely led by fintech Interswitch\u2019s $110 million raise. North African startups are second with $122,700,000 (28.07%), while East African startups raised $64,400,000 (14.73%).\n\nImage credits: Timi Odueso/TechCabal\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of May are:\n\nNote: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in May 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nLightning-fast internet is coming to the continent but it\u2019s only for those who can afford the hefty fees.\n\nIn May, it was announced that Elon Musk\u2019s internet service, Starlink, had received approval to launch in rural areas in Nigeria and Mozambique. Starlink promises 150 Mbps on its standard plan and up to 500 MBps on its premium plan. That\u2019s super-fast, but how many Africans can truly afford Starlink?\n\nMay was a difficult month for the continent\u2019s biggest television streaming service.\n\nOn the heels of price hikes, DStv is facing 2 regulatory hammers in South Africa. On one end, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) is relaunching an inquiry that may cut DStv\u2019s monopoly in the streaming market. On the other, the African National Congress (ANC) has submitted a policy that will ban national sports teams in South Africa from giving DStv\u2014or any streaming service\u2014exclusive streaming rights.\n\nSpeaking of streaming in South Africa, the US-streaming platform Disney+ launched in South Africa, in May.\n\nDisney+ South Africa\u2019s arm offers users the Standard Plan at R119 ($7.47)/month or R1,190 ($74.64)/annum.\n\nFor South Africans, this means a lot more options, but for other services like DStv, it means heavy competition.\n\nA group of Facebook content moderators in Kenya are suing the company.\n\nMonths after it was revealed that Kenyan content moderators were being mistreated and underpaid, one of the ex-moderators, Daniel Motuang, has filed a lawsuit against Facebook and Sama, the managing company for Facebook\u2019s African content moderators.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks financial compensation, standard Facebook healthcare, and unionisation rights for all moderators in Kenya.\n\nIn May, American ride-hailing giant Uber announced that it had completed 1 billion rides and over 10 billion kilometres in terms of distance covered across all its markets in Africa.\n\nIn more news about Uber\u2019s moves on the continent, the company is also looking for an out-of-court settlement for the lawsuit levied by its Kenyan drivers.\n\nAbout 15,000 tech employees across the globe lost their jobs in May.\n\nA lot of these layoffs have been outside Africa, but right at the end of the month, Egyptian-born bus-hailing company Swvl announced that it would be laying off 32%\u2014about 400 people\u2014of its workforce. The company also announced voluntary salary cuts for senior management and reduced overhead costs.\n\nThere are at least 18 countries testing 5G in Africa, and 6\u2014South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Seychelles\u2014have already deployed the services.\n\nIn May, Ethiopia became the 7th African country to launch 5G after state-owned telecoms Ethio Telecoms announced that it had piloted 5G across the country\u2019s capital, Addis Ababa, with technology developed by Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe Ugandan government reaffirmed its 2019 stance on the subject of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of Uganda (BoU) issued a warning to all payment service providers, letting them know that any form of crypto trading in the country would be considered an illegal act.\n\nThis is understandable as Ugandans have reportedly lost $1 billion to crypto-related scams from 2018 to date. The ban is probably not the best way forward, but it is what it is.\n\nIn May, the world\u2019s biggest messaging service WhatsApp opened up its API with the launch of WhatsApp Cloud API.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, it means all businesses, big and small, can create business profiles, and automate messages that keep customers satisfied while freeing up time for business owners.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Telegram.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "South Africa\u2019s constitutional court has ruled against Khumbudzo Ntshavheni\u2019s decision to switch off analogue broadcast systems by June 30, 2022, declaring it unconstitutional. Ntshavheni \u2013 who serves as the country\u2019s current Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies \u2013 wants South Africa to migrate to digital broadcast systems.\n\nThis follows an appeal by e.tv and two other applicants, Media Monitoring Africa (MMA) and SOS Support Public Broadcasting, who sought to overturn a judgment and order of the High Court of South Africa that had ruled in favour of the minister and government earlier this year.\n\nIn 2006, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), of which South Africa is a member, resolved that all member states in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East should migrate from analogue broadcasting systems to digital broadcasting systems by the year 2015.\n\nCurrently, in South Africa, traditional analogue broadcast systems are occupying the frequency bands between 700 MHz and 800 MHz which could be used for mobile data. Digital migration would free up those bands, making the provision of mobile data services cheaper.\n\nTo comply with the ITU resolution, in September 2008, the then minister of communications and digital technologies in South Africa, Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, published a Broadcasting Digital Migration Policy (BDM Policy) which stated that the analogue switch-off would be on November 1, 2011, 4 years earlier than the ITU\u2019s proposed deadline.\n\nIn February 2021, South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, announced that the phased switch-off of analogue transmitters would be completed by the end of March 2022.\n\nOn October 5, 2021, the minister made a final call for those qualifying for state-sponsored set-top boxes (STBs) to register, with the deadline for registration set for October 31, 2021. STBs would enable households to continue having access to television channels on their analogue television sets after the analogue switch-off.\n\nAfter this announcement, e.tv brought an application to the High Court against minister Ntshavheni, seeking to prevent the minister from disconnecting millions of people who had not yet migrated to digital transmission.\n\nIn the court order, the applicants wanted the minister to, among other requests, consult all affected parties before determining the analogue switch-off date as well as provide a report on the steps taken to ensure access to STBs within 1 month of the date of the court order.\n\nIn its judgement on March 28, the court had accepted that out of over 14 million television sets in South Africa, 10.5 million were compliant with digital transmission and 3.75 million were analogue.\n\nThe High Court held that 3 months would be sufficient to allow the minister to complete the outstanding installation of STBs in households with analogue television sets.\n\nIn the final ruling, the High Court dismissed the application from e.tv, MMA and SOS but extended the analogue switch-off date to June 30, 2022.\n\nFollowing the ruling by the High Court, e.tv, MMA and SOS appealed the matter against the minister in the Constitutional Court arguing that the Minister had a duty to consult the public, including the applicants, before imposing the STB registration cut-off date and determining the analogue switch-off date.\n\nIn a unanimous judgment, the Constitutional Court ruled that the power to determine the analogue switch-off date and the registration deadline for STBs is located within the minister\u2019s original constitutional policymaking function. The court thereafter had to determine whether the minister exercised this power rationally and lawfully.\n\nIn that respect, the Constitutional Court held that it was not only irrational but also unlawful for the minister to set a switch-off date without adequate notice to the analogue broadcast providers and the public.\n\nAs to the remedy, the Court held that the decisions of the minister, as well as the order of the High Court, had to be set aside.\n\nThe judgement will further delay South Africa\u2019s migration into digital broadcasting, meaning that services like mobile data which could do with the freed-up space on the frequency spectrum as a result of digital migration will continue to be expensive, further hurting citizens\u2019 pockets.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

When they lash out during times of global suffering it is the act of a cornered animal, an act of desperation.\n\n\u201cAs always, their goal is the same: to sow fear and division amongst us. We will not let them.\n\n\u201cInstead let us pray for the families and loved ones of those who sacrificed their lives in the fight against evil, and let us pray for the safe and speedy return of those abducted. We will do everything possible to ensure their return.\n\n\u201cAnd to the sadists, I say this: we are coming. No matter what rock you crawl under, what hole you sink into, what lie you hide behind, we are coming and we will find you. Shiroro will see justice. Nigeria will know peace,\u201d the President assured.\n\nPresident Buhari, in a related development, expressed appreciation to Portugal for the deployment of weapons and training of military personnel in ensuring peace in the sub-region.\n\nSpeaking at a State Dinner in National Palace Ajuda, Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, the President commended President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa for deploying troops for peacekeeping in the Central African Republic, monitoring political developments and providing assistance to some countries in Africa, including Equatorial Guinea, Cape Verde and Mozambique.\n\nRead also: Attack on Churches: Enemies out to stoke religious war \u2013 Buhari\n\nThe President said the Nigerian Government has made it a priority to tackle the issue of insecurity in Nigeria, the ECOWAS, and the Sahel.\n\nHe added that this would not have been successful without our regional as well as global partners.\n\n\u2018\u2018The Boko Haram insurgency in the North-eastern part of Nigeria is being tackled through the efforts of the government, as well as the Multinational Joint Task Force (MJTF) of member countries,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nPresident Buhari expressed optimism that his State Visit would further strengthen the goodwill and collaboration between the two countries.\n\nHe noted that the establishment of a Joint Commission, which is one of the main priorities of the visit, would further promote the full realisation of the objectives of bilateral relations, achieving concrete, specific and viable projects and programmes for the benefit of citizens of the two countries.\n\n\u2018\u2018Today, Portugal imports about 60 percent of its gas from Nigeria which makes it our second-largest market in Europe.\n\n\u2018\u2018There is still more that can be achieved between the two countries, especially with the current Russia-Ukraine war which has disrupted steady gas supplies to Europe.\n\n\u2018\u2018Furthermore, Nigeria wants to see trade diversified to non-oil products such as agriculture, power projects, renewable energy and pharmaceuticals where a lot could be achieved,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe President emphasized the need to revive the Bilateral Air Services Agreement (BASA) and finalize all pending bilateral agreements so as to boost economic activities and movement of people between the two countries.\n\nHe described Nigeria as one of the most attractive destinations for investment in Africa, adding that his Government is prioritizing building a business-friendly environment.\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigeria is part of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AFCFTA) \u2013 the largest free trade area in the world. With a population of over 200 million mainly young men and women, Nigeria is a natural and attractive hub for foreign investment and one-stop market access to over 50 countries.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Nigerian leader welcomed the Business Forum organized during the visit and the signing of many Memoranda of Understanding between the two countries\u2019 investment promotion agencies and chambers of commerce.\n\nHe described the signing of the agreements \u2018\u2018as excellent foundations for increased bilateral trade.\u2019\u2019",

          "text": "Nigerian airlines have seen their insurance costs surge above what their peers in Ghana, South Africa and other African countries pay to insure their aircraft.\n\nOperators told BusinessDay that the perception of Nigeria as a high-risk environment and the high insurance premiums demanded by local insurance firms had pushed up the cost of insuring their aircraft.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s investigations show that while Nigerian airlines pay between 8 percent and 10 percent of the value of an aircraft to insure it, airlines operating in Ghana, South Africa and other African countries pay 2-3 percent.\n\nAirlines operating in Europe and the United States pay between 0.5 percent and one percent to insure the same aircraft.\n\nFor instance, airlines operating in Nigeria pay an average of $1 million annually to insure a B737-300 aircraft while airlines in Ghana or US pay between $200,000 and $300,000 to insure the same aircraft type.\n\nThe scarcity of foreign exchange in Nigeria has continued to worsen the situation for airlines as they have to pay for insurance in foreign currencies.\n\nThe National Insurance Commission had spearheaded the enactment of a law that no airline can insure any aircraft registered in Nigeria except it goes through a local insurance firm in Nigeria. This law has made it difficult for airlines to source for affordable alternatives outside the country.\n\nRead also: EXPLAINER: What passengers could gain from Nigerian airlines\u2019 new alliance\n\nIn addition to this, the inability of all Nigerian insurance companies to put together to insure a single brand new aircraft in the country made them to reinsure with foreign insurance companies, thereby increasing airlines\u2019 insurance costs.\n\nMost African airlines, including Nigeria, insure their aircraft through local insurance firms, which then reinsure with Allianz, a German firm or the Lloyd\u2019s of London, an insurance and reinsurance market located in London.\n\nAllen Onyema, chairman of Air Peace, Nigeria\u2019s largest carrier, said what it cost Nigerian airlines to insure just one aircraft is what it cost airlines outside Nigeria to insure over three aircraft.\n\nOnyema, who cited the perception of Nigeria as a high-risk environment, as a reason for high insurance premiums, said: \u201cAll insurance firms put together do not have the capacity to insure a new aircraft in Nigeria; yet airlines are forced to insure their aircraft in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nObiukwu Mbanuzuo, chief commercial officer at Green Africa, told BusinessDay that insurance premiums vary from airline to airline.\n\nHe said: \u201cI know an airline in Nigeria that pays $1 million annually for insurance of a B737-300 aircraft while for a UK or US airline, it would probably not cost more than $100,000-$200,000.\n\n\u201cThe perception of risk in Nigeria started when the number of crashes was high but has remained the same even with low rates of aircraft crashes and incidents because our infrastructure is still substandard. Runways still lack proper landing aids or runway lights, navigation aids break down frequently and sometimes radio communications are unreliable.\u201d\n\nAccording to Ibrahim Mshelia, owner of West Link Airlines Nigeria and Mish Aviation Flying School, Nigerian insurance companies have continued to raise insurance premiums higher than the global standards.\n\n\u201cSo many people think that insurance premiums are high in Nigeria because of the country\u2019s risks but this is not true,\u201d Mshelia said.\n\nHe said the criteria insurance companies use to assess risk factors include ratings by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), experience of airlines\u2019 personnel, personnel training, facilities where aircraft maintenance are carried out and the frequency in the number of claims made by the airlines.\n\nAccording to Mshelia, Nigeria meets all these criteria as airlines carry out maintenance as and when due, train personnel as required by the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority, and the country has Category 1 rating, and the country\u2019s risk factor remains low.\n\nHe, however, faulted the law that says no airline can insure any aircraft registered in Nigeria except they go through local insurance firms in Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cThey decided to become very expensive. All the insurance companies in Nigeria cannot insure a single brand new aircraft in Nigeria. So, they reinsure with foreign insurance companies. They become middlemen and get so greedy and they raise insurance to 1o percent or more of the value of the aircraft.\n\n\u201cAbroad, some countries charge 0.5 to one percent. I was operating a non-Nigerian registered airplane that cost $6.5 million. Despite the fact that I insured it with a third-party liability to enable me to fly into Europe, I was paying about $67,000 as insurance premium a year. If I was to pay an insurance company in Nigeria, I will pay $650,000 a year. They will charge me between five and 10 percent. From this, they will pay the insurance broker less than $65,000 and they will keep the remaining money.\u201d\n\nBut Ajibola Dalley, an aviation lawyer and senior advocate of Nigeria, said even though Nigeria meets all ICAO requirements, there are still some perceived risks in the country that drive up the insurance premiums.\n\nHe said: \u201cInsurance companies will look at the environment. I think when you look at the factors that determine payment of premiums, over the past years, you have to look at the maintenance culture, companies and individuals involved in running of airlines, the support system and environment of aviation in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPrior to the year 2006, when the Civil Aviation Act came into force, we didn\u2019t have a good record on air accidents. Before 2006, planes were falling off the sky. We had the Sosoliso, Belview and Chachangi crashes, among others, and then Dana Air crash.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, these factors still determine the premiums that are charged and an insurance company will also look at the regulation.\n\nDalley said: \u201cWe have had a decent safety record since 2006. When you look at repayment on premiums and the responsibility of airlines, can you really blame an insurance company? Are the regulators doing a proper job on safety and security oversight? The risk of paying out is higher; so in order to insure you, they will increase their premiums, so that they know that they will recoup a considerable part of what is potentially a loss.\n\n\u201cHow many airlines survive in Nigeria? How many aircraft do they have? We have runways that have problems, no light at the airports and the security issues keep getting worse. These factors raise premiums for airlines.\u201d",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nStakeholder have called for a review in laws that punishes poor people far more often and more harshly than the wealthy, often through pretrial detention and cash bail.\n\nThey made the call on Thursday at a National conference with the theme \u2018Nigerian Criminal Justice System: The Criminalisation of Poverty in Nigeria\u2019.\n\nThe conference was organised by a civil society organisation, Rule of Law and Accountability Advocacy Centre (RULAAC), in Abuja.\n\nThe conference was to examine Nigeria\u2019s dysfunctional criminal justice system, which the organisers said unequally and disproportionately affected the poor and the most vulnerable in the society.\n\nThe Minister of Women Affairs, Mrs Pauline Tallen, said it was imperative to review the justice system to support people faced with economic obstacles, rather than incarcerating them.\n\nTallen represented by Mrs Kenechi Umeh, an Assistant Legal Adviser in the ministry, said laws that incarcerate people who were unable to pay debts, fines, bail bond, accentuate poverty rather than solved it.\n\n\u201dCriminalisation of petty offences such as prostitution, common nuisance, alms begging, street hawking, environmental offences and neighborhood disputes accentuate poverty among the poor and vulnerable.\n\n\u201cThere is need to re-evaluate and improve awareness on the impact of the justice system as it relates to petty offences, including applying standards and principles of human rights in protecting the poor and promoting equality and fairness,\u201d she added.\n\nTallen said there should also be well thought-out poverty alleviation programmes that entailed technological skills acquisition, vocational training, micro-lending intervention solutions, as a panacea to poverty.\n\nAlso speaking, the Executive Director, RULAAC, Okechukwu Nwanguma said that the event was aimed at finding ways to end the criminalisation of petty offences in Nigeria.\n\nHe said that this was necessary because the criminal justice system in the country, disproportionately affect the poor.\n\nNwanguma said that there were situations where people were sent to jail for stealing yam while `big men\u2019 who steal huge amount of money get away with their crimes.\n\n\u201cThe notion of criminalisation of poverty manifests more in law enforcement than other sectors.\n\n\u201cWhether it is the police providing security cover for the demolition of settlements inhabited by the poor who are thereby rendered homeless while the settlements from which they have been displaced is apportioned to the rich ir task forces enforcing bans on street hawking or Okada riding, or on the use of pedestrian bridges.\n\n\u201cWhile it may be justifiable to demolish certain settlements or enforce certain bans \u2013 as long as the legal procedures are followed \u2013 the poor are often the victims of law enforcement excesses in the course of the enforcement of these state or federal laws or rules and regulations.\n\n\u201cThe poor constitute the majority of those who end up in prison for being unable to pay bribes for bail at police stations,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nHe said that the poor also constituted the majority of persons awaiting trial and who may never have the chance to appear in court again after the initial arraignment, as they may be forgotten by the system.\n\n\u201cPetty crimes committed by the poor attract more law enforcement action than big crimes committed by the rich.\n\n\u201cMore often, the rich have the means and ways and can hire Senior Advocates or buy their ways through.\n\n\u201cSo criminal justice in Nigeria, just like human rights violation, has a social class bias targeting mainly the poor and the most vulnerable in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe think that the criminal justice system that criminalises the people needs to be addressed,\u2019\u2019 he added.\n\nNwanguma, therefore, said it was imperative to reform the judiciary system to become fair and just, ensure speedy dispensation of justice and equal protection to both the poor and the rich, without discrimination.\n\nThe Keynote Speaker, Prof. Chidi Odinkalu who spoke on the topic `Criminalisation of Poverty in Nigeria, the Dimension, Effects and Solutions\u2019, said that criminal law and its institutions provide the framework to which lawful society defends itself and its values.\n\nOdinkalu said there was need to train the judiciary, decriminalise the polity and empower citizens to create a more egalitarian society.\n\nAlso speaking, Mr Emmanuel Nwakeze, of the Nigeria Correctional Service (NCS), said that the poor suffer more from cases of missing case files and delayed justice while in prison in custody .\n\nNwakeze said that although the NCS Act 2019 has a lot of provisions of protecting inmates, its implementation was slow because of poor budgetary allocation.\n\nHe observed that transfer of judges also cause setback during trials, leading to prison congestion.\n\nThe Country Director, Amnesty International Nigeria, Osai Ojigho, said the judicial system should be reformed to fast track justice delivery.\n\n`We do not need more people in jail for no good reasons or in pre-trial detention for many years.\n\n\u201cOne step to addressing

The beautiful unifying Green white and Green colours, which literally appeared to be losing its unifying and friendly powers driven by peace and unity.\n\nThe poet, through the poem, appealed to Nigeria through its national symbol, the flag, Nigerians and the leaders to work assiduously towards restoring the peace and conviviality for which the country and her citizens are known for, as they seem to be eluding the citizens. Strife, the poet in the poem, worries, seems to be overtaking the brotherhood, and promises of nationhood, the country promises.\n\nMrs Margie Offoha in a comment made available to our correspondent, said that the poem \u201cGreen white and Green\u201d is in her effort to bring global attention to Nigeria\u2019s prevailing security problems, helping the people and the government save lives.\n\nThe poet, raising concerns on the prevailing state of affairs in the country, started with a question, \u201cOh, mighty flag of our fatherland, are you still there? Reflecting the cover the flag hitherto gives to Nigerian citizens\u2019 in every part of the country and the world at large.\n\nThe poet went further to query, \u201cOh, mighty flag of our fatherland can you see the pain and suffering your children are enduring? Oh, mighty flag of our land, can you hear our cry? Oh, mighty flag, what happened to the promise you made, many years ago?

As a great empath, I carry other peoples\u2019 pain in my heart. I think this is a time for people living outside the country especially poets and artists of various kinds to use their voices to bring global attention to Nigeria, who knows it may make a difference in the lives of poor Nigeria citizens who are forever suffering\u201d\n\nWhile calling for stronger action to save lives and build a more united country, the poet in stanza three wrote \u2018\u2019Peace and unity have eluded your children. The echo of one Nigeria, one Nigeria, is now met with doubt as many no longer believe. Oh, mighty green, white, and green, the flag of our homeland, hear our cry.

          "title": "Insurgency in Nigeria spiraling out of control, threatens country\u2019s unity, stability",
          "text": "From PETER OKORE, Umuahia\n\nIn the wake of the inability of security agencies in Nigeria to halt the high-level insurgency and the ever-increasing cases of banditry reported in different parts of the country, there is a growing call for citizens to be allowed to defend themselves whenever attacked.\n\nNot quite long, the Zamfara state government enjoined her residents to arm themselves against bandits, even though the police and military have come up with a claim that the situation is still under control.\n\nZamfara has been one of the worst-affected states by banditry in Nigeria. For that, the state government said it is \u201cready to facilitate people, especially farmers, to secure basic weapons for defending themselves\u201d.\n\nIt also directed the police command to issue gun licenses to all who qualify and are willing to obtain firearms to defend themselves\n\nMoreover, the recent invasions of St. Francis Catholic church , Owo in Ondo State as well as parts of Abia state by bandits, kidnappers and terrorists in quick succession, under a fortnight, and the killing of Catholic priests, the burning of churches in Kaduna state and other areas, have compelled catholic communicators in Nigeria to call on the National Assembly to enact an enabling law that would enable Nigerians to own arms to defend themselves, their families and properties against arbitrary attacks by gunmen.\n\nIn a release signed by the President of the Association, Very Rev. Fr. Patrick Alumuku, and the General Secretary, Mr. Tony Agbugba, made available to members of Catholic Media practitionewrs all over Nigeria, the group noted that the time has come for all Nigerians, irrespective of their religious inclinations, to be more security conscious.\n\nThey particularly implored all Churches and Mosques to put in place stringent security measures that would enable them to defend the clergy, the worshippers, and the facilities henceforth.\n\nCatholic Communicators in Nigeria, under the auspices of SIGNIS, therefore, condemned in very strong terms the incessant attacks on Christian churches, killings of Priests and other innocent Nigerians by bandits, kidnappers, and terrorists.\n\nIn the minds of this concerned group of Christian faithful, the increased attacks on Catholic Churches in recent- times, which have led to the loss of several lives, including men of God and defenseless civilians could spiral into an orgy of violence that may have grave consequences on the peace and unity of the country.\n\nThe Catholic Communicators expressed even more concern over the seeming silence of the Buhari administration and the Federal Government in the face of these on-going attacks on the innocents . According to them, this seeming silence by both government and military in Nigeria do not, in any way, reassure Nigerians that the government is on top of the situation. Or that the government is , in all sincerity, fulfilling one of her primary obligation of protecting the lives and properties of her citizens.\n\nMaking special reference to the recent killings of two Catholic priests, Rev Frs. Christopher Odia of Auchi Dioceses and Bitrus Borigo of Kaduna Archdiocese, including the mauling of over 40 worshippers at Owo, Ondo State, respectively, the group wondered why the bandits have suddenly picked interest in harassing, and killing harmless clergy and innocent worshippers who pose no dangers or obstacles to anyone, rather than their desire to draw nearer their Creator.\n\nThey implored the security agencies at the federal and state levels and across all formations to intensify efforts to bring the killers to book, while also intensifying efforts to safeguard the lives of the citizens.\n\nIndeed, these acts of terrorism, banditry and the likes have been a source of worry and concern to the people and government of affected states of the country. Therefore, to deal decisively with the situation in affected areas, respective communities, the government, etc, have no option but to take-on them decisively by adopting traditional methods to nib the endemic in the bud by combing their forests.\n\nIn doing these, people should be strictly warned and advised to make sure that any information or intelligence about an informant must be true and nothing but the truth. Such information must carry correct data on the suspects, including their pictures, correct names, addresses, occupation and witness to testify the genuineness of the information given; while the government is taking punitive measures against anyone found as an informant. Any person who gives wrong information against anybody should equally serve the same punishment as an informant and will be treated as such.",

Goddy Nnadi, yesterday, unveiled his goals for the 2022/2023 Rotary Year.\n\nNnadi who spoke at a press conference in Abuja, said promotion of healthcare, blood donation, mental health, water, sanitation and peace building would be top on his priority projects as Governor of the District in the next one year.\n\nHe said the Rotary District 9125 would be collaborating with the National Blood Service Commission in promoting the culture of blood donation in order to save accident victims and patients in dire need of blood transfusion.\n\nHe added that the District under his administration would also promote awareness on and treatment of mental health issues which is fast becoming a major issue for society and families.\n\nHe said the District is finalising arrangements to build a 24-hour service hospital in Abuja to be manned by rotarians in the medical field within the city.\n\nAccording to him water and sanitation geared towards curbing open defecation in schools would be another top priority for his administration.\n\nHe said the District would also promote and encourage peace Building efforts by collaborating with relevant authorities through its Institute of Peace Building.\n\nRotary District 9125 is composed of 143 clubs, spread across 23 states including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), which makes it the largest Rotary District in the country.\n\nNnadi who has just taken over as the Governor of Rotary International District 9125, said: \u201cFor us our star projects are about four. One is that we intend to work with the National Blood Bank to expand the blood bank system in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is to ensure that the hospitals have blood available to them for accident victims. We have contact with the Director General of the National Blood Bank, we have had a series of meetings and we developed a Memorandum of Understanding through which Rotary District 9125 will work with them, first of all, to make our members donate blood and then create awareness for more people to donate blood.\n\n\u201cSo the blood will be certified okay, stored and made available for hospitals for helping those in need so that we don\u2019t have recurring cases of hospitals not having blood.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the issue of mental health is becoming a serious issue. There are do many causes for that even though I am not a medical doctor \u2013 those who take drugs, those who are depressed, dementia \u2013 and it is becoming so much that sometimes we don\u2019t understand it.\n\n\u201cIf it is not treated early the people will now become fully mental and it becomes an issue for society and for families.\n\n\u201cWe are going to create awareness about that and we are going to collaborate with so many foreign institutions.\n\n\u201cWe already have two American institutions and one from Switzerland. In fact, the first team will be arriving here in September for us to work with them to see how we can, one, conduct seminars and workshops and then see how treatment can be done through the hospitals and healthcare centers.\n\n\u201cFor number three, we are thinking about developing a 24-hour service hospital within Abuja.\n\n\u201cThe framework is being worked out and we are going to have the FCT involved in that. The hospital is going to run 24 hours in the sense that we are going to have our members who are involved in the medical field.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in NIPSS, our study was on universal healthcare delivery and we touched so many states, hospitals and healthcare centres. Some of them didn\u2019t have doctors and nurses.\n\n\u201cMany of them didn\u2019t even have auxiliary nurses to take care of patients. In some of them, people were sitting on the floor and we thought that wasn\u2019t right.\n\n\u201cSometimes, we build healthcare centres and hand them over to local authorities and they are not well managed.\n\n\u201cSo we said fine, why don\u2019t we build one as a test case with the support of the state or FCT, get it done and ensure 24 hour power supply \u2013 we are going to have inverters, solar and the normal public power supply.\n\n\u201cTwo, we are collaborating with our partners outside of Nigeria to build and equip those hospitals and then we use our members in the medical field to help service those hospitals on a shift basis.\u201d\n\nOn the plan of his administration to curb open defecation, Nnadi said: \u201cThe next one is water and sanitation which leads me to the issue of open defecation.\n\n\u201cWe have found out that in some of the schools that there is a real issue. The real issue is, you build schools and you build just one toilet to be used by both students and teachers \u2013 male and female \u2013 and that makes it susceptible for teachers to abuse some of these students.\n\n\u201cWe think that is wrong. We have done an experiment and we have built one or two here and there and we separated the toilets. We built for teachers separately, built for students separately, built for male and female separately and you find out that the issue of abuse in that place has stopped.\n\n\u201cWe intend to encourage all our clubs to make sure that these are done so that females are not abused and that they also have self esteem.\u201d\n\nHe said his administration would promote and encourage peace building efforts by collaborating with relevant authorities in the country.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe also intend to engage in the promotion of peace building. We have crises all over the place. We have an Institute of Peace Building and we have a committee nationwide working in collaboration with all the other Districts to make sure that we promote peace building through awareness creation, engagements with people in government and to make sure that everything is done.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2026Says PDP crisis\u2019ll frustrate the ex-VP\n\nA former chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who was also a commissioner for information in Edo state, Prince Kassim Afegbua, has said he would not want the presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar, to get close to Aso Villa come 2023.\n\nHe stated this Friday while featuring on a TVC News programme, Breakfast Show, monitored by Blueprint Weekend in Abuja.\n\nHe said further that the crisis rocking the main opposition party, emanating from the former vice-president\u2019s choice of running mate, would eventually frustrate him at the polls.\n\nAsked to share his thoughts on PDP as the largest opposition party considering its present crisis, he said the party under the leadership of professor Iyorchia Ayu was in disarray.\n\nHe said, \u201cWell, talking about the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the largest opposition party and all of that, well I think the party presently, under the leadership of Iyorchia Ayu, is in disarray. Just a few days ago we saw the news item that the National Working Committee removed Ayu.\n\n\u201cAlthough it turned out to be fake news, I can tell you categorically that such movements are in place because some people feel that the chairman of the Board of Trustees is from the North, chairman of the party is from the North, and the 2023 presidential candidate of the party is from the North.\n\n\u201cYou cannot have three major positions of the party from the North when we have eight governors of the party from the South and five governors in the North. So, presently if you put the equation together, the leadership of the party should come from the South where most of their governors are.\n\n\u201cBut like I told you earlier, I love them to make mistakes so that what I told them about balancing the political equation in the country will come to fruition. We cannot have a presidential candidate from the North in 2019 without a southerner contesting; then in 2023 again another candidate from the North jettisoned the South in the party where you eloquently capture in your constitution.\n\n\u201cArticle 7 sub-section 3c states that there should be rotation. So, when you have this kind of scenario where people manipulate and jettison the constitution of the party, you have the tendency to have this kind of situation where people are jostling for positions and horse trading, including manipulations that will continue to sustain crises. And the more crises the PDP comes up with, the better for me because I would not want Atiku Abubakar to smell Aso Villa in 2023.\u201d\n\nZoning\n\nAlso, baring his mind on the decision of the PDP to zone its presidential ticket to the North despite the fact that the incumbent president is from the North, Prince Afegbua said \u201cthis is a product of lazy scholarship; people who cannot dissect issues, who cannot understand the political algorithm in the country that come with this kind of nebulous claim.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, is not the President of APC. He is called President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. If that is the case why should you be talking that the last president of the PDP was a southerner and the next candidate should be from the North.\n\n\u201cLet me give you this scenario; I have interrogated those people who are coming up with this porous arithmetic and they have not been able to justify it. In 2019, in that realisation that Jonathan was the last occupant of that office of the PDP stock, all aspirants from the South withdrew from the race to allow the aspirant from the North take over the contest and Alhaji Abubakar emerged in the Port Harcourt Convention and all of us supported him in 2019. As soon as the election was over he bolted away to Dubai just the same way he has bolted away now when the Ekiti election was just around the corner. He is all about himself \u2013 me, I and myself. So, that sense of collegiate responsibility is never there.\n\n\u201cThen in APC, the APC has a northern candidate who is president of the country. They were trying to manipulate the process for Ahmad Lawan to come on stream until those governors, and I keep referring to them as heroes of our present situation, came together and said no, in order to deepen democracy and eliminate the mistrust that is becoming so obvious, there is a need to zone the presidency in the APC to the South. I expected PDP to do that and every other serious political party. But, of course, because Iyorchia Ayu came with a mindset, a pre-meditated mindset to come and return Alhaji Atiku Abubakar as the candidate, he was not ready to listen to that.\u201d\n\nHe said further that, \u201cHe set up a committee on zoning and at the end of the day they started selling forms and when they had sold forms mid-way, they said it was too late to talk about zoning because people had started buying forms. They kept working from question to answer and from answer to question and all of that.\n\n\u201cSo, whether anybody likes it or not, when you reply to justice with injustice, you are going to have the kind of crises that the PDP is having and these crises will endure, I can tell you that. I am an insider and I know what has been going on, that the crises will continue to endure in PDP and will frustrate the efforts of their candidate in the 2023 election and that will be to my own joy.\u201d\n\nAtiku\u2019s tweets\n\nWhen reminded that Atiku had tweeted that he was going to have peace with everybody in the party and everything would be well and good whereas Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state had said he was going into spiritual hibernation, and Wike was in silence, he said, \u201cI am sure you saw a picture on Dino Malaye\u2019s Facebook wall where he showed Atiku wearing a pair of shorts holidaying in Europe when the Ekiti governorship election was barely a week.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen the leadership of the party was to set up a campaign council, mobilise to Ekiti to campaign, Iyorchia Ayu went on holiday, the presidential candidate went on holiday and that has always been my point of disagreement with them \u2013 that rather than take up responsibility to confront the electoral challenges and hurdles with respect to contest, they will naturally break way when you need them most. They will not stay put to fight the battle of the electoral contest. That was why you saw the PDP for the first coming a distant third in the Ekiti election.\n\n\u201cI heard them complaining about vote-buying when they refused to campaign. When you have injustices or decisions are taken abusing processes without due process, you are likely going to have what is playing out. Ortom was just capturing exactly what is going on within the party. It is not just about Ortom, there are quite a number of other governors. Don\u2019t forget that Wike is in Turkey holidaying with the governor of Abia state. It is very painful that a panel will be set up by a party comprising 17 people; Ortom was part of that panel and other leaders of the party. Ortom was there on account of being a member of the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum. You made a decision, 14 in support of Wike, three in support of Okowa, then you were looking forward to the following day having conveyed the decision of that panel to the candidate, but what you had was a 360-degree turn and you handed over the ticket to the minority vote. Who will not be angry? So, it is a theory of contradictions, all of these factors will cancel themselves out and PDP will be worse for it.\u201d\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\n",

          "title": "Economy Diversification: Why Nigeria\u2019s mining sector offers robust economic potential- Adegbite",
          "text": "By Palma Ileye\n\nIn efforts to boost the nation\u2019s economy through the mining sector, the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologist, NSEG has held its 1st international conference and exhibition in Abuja, with the theme: \u201cEconomic Diversification: The Role of the Geoscientist, Government and Private Sector\u201d, to brainstorm on the better ways to explore the sector.\n\nDeclaring the two- day event open, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, MMSD, Arc Olamilekan Adegbite noted that as part of its effort to reposition the Solid Minerals Sector, the Ministry in early 2016, had identified insufficient geoscientific data, geological knowledge, weak\n\nimplementation and enforcement of mining law and regulations, and poorly regulated and informal artisans and small-scale mining sub-sector as critical binding constraints to the mining sector\u2019s development.\n\nAdegbite who was represented by the Director General, Nigeria Mining Cadastral Office, MCO, Engr Simon Obadiah Nkom stated that this had propelled the Ministry to immediately begin the process of preparing a detailed sector Roadmap aimed at advancing certain strategic objectives, which would eventually result in the: creation of a globally competitive sector capable of contributing to wealth creation;\n\nprovision of jobs and advance social and human security by focusing on using its mining assets to drive domestic industrialization; and\n\nmigration to winning in global markets through a value chained-based growth plan.\n\nAccording to him, he considered the theme as strategic and timely, given the compelling\n\nurgency to diversify the economy for the prosperity of the nation adding that the\n\ntheme seeks to define the roles of the critical stakeholders in developing\n\nthe minerals sector, key amongst which were the government, private\n\nsector, and the professionals driving the mineral sector development\n\nprocess.\n\nHe said undeniably, Nigeria\u2019s Minerals sector offered a robust economic potential for diversification of the nation\u2019s economy yet the country and indeed, many other African Countries have continued to suffer under\n\nutilization of their mineral resources\n\nThis he reasoned has accounted for the slow phase of socio-economic\n\ndevelopment in Nigeria and many African countries noting that \u201cOur country is known\n\nto operate a mono economy where oil accounts for almost 90% of the foreign exchange earnings. This present administration found this appalling and described the situation as unacceptable and promised to urgently find solutions to redress the challenges.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government through the Ministry of Mines and Steel\n\nDevelopment, MMSD, over, which I preside as the Honourable Minister\n\nplays the role of administrator and regulator of the mining industry\n\nactivities. Some of the key reform programmes include amongst others the\n\nothers the following: Formulation of a robust Policy/Legal/Regulatory/ Institutional frameworks and a Roadmap for the development, growth and good\n\ngovernance of the mineral sector development activities in line with global best practices.\n\n\u201cFacilitating the development of seven (7) Strategic Minerals including Gold, Barite, Coal, Lead/Zinc, Iron ore, Bitumen and Limestone as a matter of priority; generating geoscience data through the National Integrated Mineral\n\nExploration Project, NIMEP, for subsequent concession to\n\nprospective genuine investors. This is the first exploration project funded directly by the Federal Government in the history of Nigeria; upgrading of the mineral title administration and management system of MCO to standard online application processes.\n\nConcessioning of the delineated Bitumen blocks to prospective\n\ninvestors through transparent competitive bidding process, which is ongoing.\n\nThe minister asserted that the private sector on its part plays the role of owner and operator\n\nof commercial mining entities and businesses saying that this shows the high premium, which government places on the private sector in driving\n\neconomic development activities.\n\n\u201cThe geoscientist plays such an invaluable role, which cannot be\n\noverstated in driving mineral exploration activities leading to discoveries of minerals and preparation of definitive feasibility reports on the viability of mineral reserves. The works of the geoscientists produce the treasured\n\nmineral raw materials that form the backbone of modern-day industrial revolution\n\nHe also called on all geoscientists and\n\nstakeholders to support Government\u2019s policy and efforts in diversifying the\n\nnation economy using the mineral sector as one of the key drivers stating that \u201cthe\n\noutcome of such efforts will benefit all of us and the generation of Nigerians yet unborn,\u201d he added.\n\nHe reassured them of government\u2019s commitment in continuous support towards the growth and development of the minerals sector by generating geoscience data to de-risk and make it more attractive to genuine investors maintaining that \u201cGovernment will also continue to support Research and Development, R & D, endeavours tailored towards addressing real time mineral sector development challenges.\u201d\n\nEarlier, delivering his Welcome Address Director General, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA, who also doubles as the President of the Nigerian Society of Economic Geologists, NSEG, Dr. Abdulrazaq Abubakar Garba, emphasized that the strategic objectives, professional targets and timelines set as enshrined in the constitution of the society needed to be pursued and met.\n\nGarba noted that the essenc of the conference was to discuss and brainstorm on the emerging challenges arising from the dynamic operating environment of its profession especially in the face of the new normal occasioned by the much-talked-about need to diversify the Nigerian economy away from its sole dependence on crude oil by focusing more on other areas including the solid mineral and agricultural sectors to boost the wealth of the Nation.\n\n\u201cEconomic geology can succinctly be defined as a subdiscipline of the geosciences that focuses on earth materials that can be used for economic or industrial development purposes. Often, much of the purpose of study is to identify new ore deposits for excavation as well as understanding how ore deposits are generated and localized within the Earth\u2019s crust.\n\n\u201cThe theme of this year\u2019s conference, was chosen to underscore our role in the diversification agenda of the Federal Government. Economic geologists play vital roles across the entire mineral value chain from exploration to mining; and even during the post-mining phase as the issues of environment and land reclamation for sustainable use are addressed. Additionally, economic geologists also have to interface with interested stakeholders in obtaining social and mining permit licenses to operate while at the same time provide investors with the prerequisites to raise capital for mineral exploration and mining. Economic geologists therefore provide veritable and robust linkages in the entire mineral development, utilization and environmental preservation chain and are therefore key to the Federal Government\u2019s economy diversification programme targeted at job and wealth creation.\n\n\u201cLet me emphasis that, investment in the minerals and mining sector by stakeholders is a patriotic duty of every citizen who believe in the Nigerian Project. In this respect, the role of governments, both at the national and sub-national levels, is to coordinate and ensure a responsible development of the country\u2019s natural resources. To this effect, necessary laws and regulations have been put in place by government, setting clear requirements that must be met by the industry operators. The economic diversification policy of government, which is anchored on shared and sustainable mining prosperity, emphasizes the need for cooperation of governments to unlock the full potentials of the minerals and metal sector. The Federal government is developing a well governed mining sector with sustainable capacity and has also articulated a roadmap to address some of the identified challenges in the mining sector. The initiatives and strategies outlined in the roadmap are designed largely to make the mining and minerals sector an irresistible destination for global capital.\n\nHe maintained that the success of the Ministry\u2019s National Integrated Mineral Exploration Programme, NIMEP executed through the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency, NGSA and other collaborating Agencies was mainly attributable to the role played by geoscientists from its conceptualization, design and execution.\n\n\u201cThe recent approval by the Federal Executive Council of a Scale of Fees for professionals in geosciences and mining is a testimony of government\u2019s resolve to stimulate the sector and ensure commensurate benefits to the professionals who are indeed the \u2018brain\u2019 and think tank of the sector.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the nation is witnessing a re-awakening in this sector, and the Government is not resting on its oars to grab the bull by the horn. Happily, the organized private sector such as the likes of Thor Exploration (Segilola Gold), Iron Ore/Aurelia, AG Vision, etc are now taking up the gauntlet,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe added that the economic geologist is unique with skills cutting across many of the specialists listed above.\n\nAlso the President of Nigeria Mining Geological Scientist, NMGS, Surv. Charles Alabo said that a lot has been done in providing the necessary framework and conducive environment for mining to play a pivotal role in this regard.\n\nAlabo also said that although Nigeria was committed to a system of free enterprise, Government should continue to play vital roles in the mining industry apart from its traditional regulatory functions.\n\n\u201cThe federal government also supplies some vital information necessary to stimulate and encourage investment for the optimum utilization of the huge mineral wealth of our country.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Constitution gives the Federal Government control of all-natural resources, meaning that there is no private ownership of solid minerals in Nigeria. Though mining is within the purview of the Federal Government, sub national govemments can contribute to the growth and effective functioning of the mining sector by partnering with the federal government to ensure sustained economic growth, environmental protection, occupational safety and provision of infrastructure in host mining communities. In addition, developmental plans should take into cognizance the overall development aspirations of the State alongside the prospects and challenges of mining activities\n\n\u201cThe Mining sector to significantly contribute to Nigeria\u2019s economy cannot be over-emphasized. The Roadmap for the Growth & Development of the Nigerian Mining Industry highlights the potential for a progressive increase in the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP over the next decades. It is envisaged that this shift would translate to increased public and private sector investment, more employment creation for the citizenry and overall growth and financial stability for the economy International investor interest in the sector will continue to improve with the federal government also recognizing the sector as a potential prime income generator away from oil. However, so much more still needs to be done to tap the full potentials of the mining sector given the large mineral resources of the Nation,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe further stated that the NMGS will continue to support NSEG and indeed all the other Specialist Groups of the NMGS as they play their roles as drivers of the technical think tank of the society adding that \u201cWe shall continue to empower them to drive geosciences and mining innovations under the umbrella of our great Society. Key programs of relevance to the sector must be critically and more robustly assessed by qualified professionals in the mix of our national development. Economic geologists particularly have an obligation to future generations in providing safe and sustainable mineral exploration, exploitation and utilization programs while also ensuring minimal environmental impact. As professionals, we must therefore aim at providing sustainable geosciences and mining information for investors and policy makers including national representatives, federal and state agencies, industry, academia, and other stakeholders in the sector. Professionals in geosciences and mining should be poised to expand their roles and lead in finding sustainable solutions for modern socio-economic challenges through mineral resources development and innovative efforts.\n\n\u201cThe need for full integration of mining into national, regional, and continental development frameworks cannot be over emphasized as such integration would bring about accelerated development to national and sub national economies to ensure maximum benefits for our people.\u201d",

This is complemented by the deployment of the Human Resource Module of the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System, IPPIS, the Federal Civil Service Strategy Implementation Plan and the reinforcement of the Innovation Division in all Ministries, Departments and Agencies, MDAs.\n\n\u201cLEAD-P and SMART-P trainings have also been consistently carried out to realise this laudable vision of the HCSF.\n\n\u201cMMSD is among the first set of MDAs to receive these facilities and efforts are on to ensure that we blaze a trail in the service-wide project of work-process automation. We have achieved a major improvement in the ACTU rating from about 26.5% to 74.5% compliance and have also surpassed our revenue projections,\u201d Akinlade said.\n\nThe Permanent Secretary disclosed that efforts had also been made within the ministry\u2019s limits of available resources to provide facilities that would enhance productivity and welfare of Staff, adding that in that regard, \u201cwe now have a clinic that can provide basic health services to all staff to ensure that our health is given the priority that it deserves\u201d.\n\nShe said many may be unaware that within the few months of operation of the clinic, health crises had been averted for some staff just through routine check by the medical team in the clinic.\n\n\u201cAlso, we can easily see the massive deployment of ICT infrastructures within office complex aimed at achieving the full automation of the work processes in the ministry,\u201d she added.\n\nCongratulating the members of management and staff of the ministry on week-long activities being commemorated, Akinlade craved their indulgence over the delay in the commemoration which was being held this week instead of last week that was officially set aside to mark the event, adding that it was due to exigencies of duty.\n\n\u201cSince 1999 when the African Union, AU, set aside 23rd June, as the \u201cAfrica Public Service Day, APSD, Nigeria has consistently\n\ncommemorated the day annually with series of activities and we are grateful to God for the opportunity to be part of this year\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cIn her characteristic style of celebrating civil servants, the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation approved a full package of week-long activities for this year including Jumat and Church Services, Keep-fit/aerobics session, a Town-hall Meeting and Special Awards to selected officers for outstanding performance,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe told the workers that the occasion also affords the opportunity to specially acknowledge members of staff that have distinguished themselves through outstanding performance.\n\nSpeaking further, she said, \u201cAs usual, one person was nominated from each department out of which three were selected and forwarded to OHCSF. I want to therefore congratulate all the recipients of this year\u2019s award and appreciate them for their diligence.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly congratulate Engr. Umar Adamu Tsoho who was honoured with the \u201cPresidential Public Service Award\u201d by the OHCSF for outstanding service. He made it to the top ten among the nomination from all the MDAs. We are proud of you and we thank you for bringing honour to this Ministry.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the HCSF, I want to congratulate and specially thank all the retiring staff for the year 2022. It is indeed a noble achievement to successfully exit the Federal Civil Service through retirement. It is the beginning of new life for you and we wish you good health of mind and body as well as a fulfilling life after retirement from public service.\u201d\n\nAlso Member of staff and retirees of MMSD were rewarded with gift items and plaques for the outstanding dedication to duty.",

Femi Gbajabiamila while declaring open a Public Hearing on the development of the sector said if fully attained, Land Transportation has the capacity of encouraging economic diversification as well as providing investment and employment opportunities.\n\nRepresented by the Deputy Leader of the House, Rep Peter Akpatason, the Speaker noted that bringing this about required the collective effort of all road users in maintenance and ensuring safety by road users and vehicle owners.\n\nGbajabiamila disclosed that Nigeria recorded 3,700 road accidents in the 4th quarter of the year 2021, and described the statistics as high considering the fact that many such accidents remain unreported and not incidental.\n\nThe occasion was a public hearing on a bill for an act to repeal the Nigeria Transportation Act and come up with another Act to establish the institute of Transport Technology organised by the House Committee on Transport.\n\nThe Speaker described Transport as an activity as old as human existence, and explained that the sector could be made to lift the nation out from the blues.\n\nChairman, House Committee on Transport, Rep. Tajudeen Abbas in his remarks noted that developing nations have an alarming figure of road mishaps which stood at about 1.3million per annum stressing that Nigeria is faced with a quagmire of road mishaps.\n\nAccording to Mr Abbas, the House Committee on Land Transport is aware of all these menaces and is working assiduously to see how it can be brought to a halt or to the barest minimum.\n\nHe explained further that this was what necessitated the industry players meeting to brainstorm to bring to bear on experiences and knowledge to make the bill a better one.\n\n\u201cThe Committee on Land Transport is desirous to promulgate laws that would turn around the transport sector within the shortest possible time\u201d, he said.\n\nOn her part, Minister of state, Transport, Gbemisola Saraki commended the House for organising the public hearing and appealed that the National Assembly should repeal and enact the Nigeria institute of transport technology bill to offer courses of instruction and training for general development of transport and logistics sector of the Nigerian economy for junior, middle, semi cadre, managers, technicians, technologist, artisan and for related matters.",

          "text": "Russia on Thursday began shipping grain from Ukraine\u2019s occupied territory, with a vessel carrying 7,000 tons of cereal sailing from Ukraine\u2019s occupied port of Berdyansk.\n\nKyiv has for weeks accused Russia and its allies of stealing its grain from southern Ukraine, contributing to a global food shortage caused by grain exports blocked in Ukrainian ports.\n\nUntil now shipments have been transported by land, Kyiv says.\n\nThursday\u2019s grain shipment from the port of Berdyansk marks the opening of a sea route to export wheat from Ukraine to third countries.\n\n\u201cAfter numerous months of delay, the first merchant ship has left the Berdyansk commercial port, 7,000 tons of grain are heading toward friendly countries,\u201d Evgeny Balitsky, the head of the pro-Russia administration, said on Telegram.\n\nRussia\u2019s Black Sea ships \u201care ensuring the security\u201d of the journey, he said, adding that the Ukrainian port had been demined.\n\nBalitsky did not specify the final destination of the cargo.\n\nBerdyansk is a port city on the northern coast of the Sea of Azov, in the region of Zaporizhzhia in southeastern Ukraine.\n\nThe southern Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia have been largely under Russia\u2019s control since the first weeks of Moscow\u2019s military intervention, and are now being forcefully integrated into Russia\u2019s economy.\n\n\u2018Goodwill gesture\u2019\n\nThe pro-Moscow officials in the two Ukrainian regions claim that they have \u201cnationalized\u201d state infrastructure and property there and buy their crops from local farmers.\n\nA representative of the pro-Moscow authorities, Vladimir Rogov, told state news agency RIA Novosti that 1.5 million tons of grain can be exported via Berdyansk.\n\nMoscow\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine, a country known as Europe\u2019s breadbasket, has pushed up food prices and led to shortages, as Russia\u2019s blockade of Black Sea ports prevents millions of tons of grain from being shipped out.\n\nThe crisis has sparked fears of famine in vulnerable countries highly reliant on Ukrainian exports, particularly in Africa.\n\nRussia insists that it will let Ukraine ship its grain if Kyiv forces demine sea lanes.\n\nKyiv fears Russia will launch an attack on Ukraine\u2019s Black Sea coast.\n\nTalks involving Turkey and the UN have brought no results so far.\n\nOn Thursday, Russia said it had pulled its forces from Ukraine\u2019s Snake Island, calling it a \u201cgoodwill gesture\u201d to allow Kyiv to export agricultural products.\n\nRussia, the largest wheat exporter in the world, has said it is facing difficulties in exporting its own grain due to unprecedented Western sanctions over its intervention in Ukraine.\n\nPro-Moscow officials in the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are hoping that the occupied territories could stage a referendum and join Russia in the near future.\n\nOn Wednesday, pro-Russian authorities said they were launching bus and train services between Moscow-annexed Crimea and the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.\n\nThe pro-Moscow administration of the Kherson region also announced the opening of a branch of Russian Pension Fund responsible for paying state pensions.\n\nPutin has said Russian forces will not occupy Ukraine.\n\nThe Kremlin claims local residents will choose their own future, suggesting they are in favor of a referendum on the status of Ukraine\u2019s occupied territory.\n\nMoscow Times",
