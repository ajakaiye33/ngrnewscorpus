          "text": "The National Assembly has proposed removal of manual accreditation of voters for all elections in Nigeria.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission will be empowered to reschedule an election at a polling unit where a smart card reader fails to verify the identity of a voter card holder and the backup device also fails.\n\nThe Act also proposed oath-taking for INEC officials and security agents.\n\nThese are contained in the report on the Electoral Act 2010 (Amendment) Bill billed for consideration and adoption by the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nAccording to the report by the joint Senate and House Committees on INEC and Electoral Matters, a new Section 47(3) will read, \u201cWhere a smart card reader or any other technological device deployed for accreditation of voters fails to function in any particular unit and a fresh card reader or technological device is not deployed, the election in that unit shall be cancelled and another election shall be scheduled within 24 hours if the commission is satisfied that the result of the election in that polling unit will substantially affect the final result of the whole election and declaration of a winner in the constituency concerned.\u201d\n\nPresently, voters are accredited manually where electronic verification fails.\n\nThe Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill 2020 passed the second reading at the House on November 27, 2020, while Chairman of the House Committee on Electoral Matters, Aishatu Dukku, had since February 23, 2021, laid the report on a \u2018Bill for an Act to Repeal the Electoral Act, 2010 and Enact the Electoral Act, 2021 to Regulate the Conduct of Elections in Federal, States and Area Councils in the Federal Capital Territory; and for Related Matters.\u2019\n\nAt the public hearing, Dukku had noted that the bill was put together by the Senate, the House, INEC and the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN).\n\nOther recommendations by the joint committee in the report, a copy of which our correspondent obtained, include prohibition of transfer or sale of voter cards.\n\nSection 22 of the bill reads, \u201cAny person, including an entity, who (a) is in illegal possession of any voter\u2019s card whether issued in the name of any voter or not; (b) sells or offers to sell any voter\u2019s card whether issued in the name of the voter or not; or (c) buys or offers to buy any voter\u2019s card on whether his or her own behalf or in behalf of any other person; commits an offence and is liable, on conviction, to (i) in the case of an individual, a fine not more than N2,000,000 or imprisonment for a term not more than two years or both, and (ii) in the case of an entity, a fine of N5,000,000.\u201d\n\nAlso, Section 26(1) in the report (which was Section 28(1) in the bill) provides that all INEC staff members, Electoral Officers, Presiding Officers, Returning Officers, Security Officials \u201ctaking part in the conduct of an election shall affirm or swear to an oath of loyalty and neutrality, indicating that they will not accept bribe or gratification from any person, and shall perform their functions and duties impartially and in the interest of the Federal Republic of Nigeria without fear or favour.\n\nAn analysis of the amounts proposed as the ceiling for respective posts showed that the National Assembly raised some of them by 200 per cent.\n\nFor instance, in Section 91 under Limitation on Election Expenses in the original bill, the House had set the maximum election expenses to be incurred by a candidate for a presidential election at N5bn, while governorship was pegged at N1bn; Senate and House membership, N100m and N70m, respectively; state House of Assembly, N30m; chairmanship election in a Local Government Area or area council, N30m; and councillorship in an area council, N5m.\n\nHowever, in 88 (1) of the report, the joint committee recommended N15bn for presidential election; N5bn for governorship; N1.5bn and N500m for Senate and House membership, respectively; N50m for state House of Assembly membership; N50m for LGA or Area Council chairmanship; and N5m for LGA or Area Council councillorship.\n\n\u2018Direct grievances to your senators\u2019\n\nIn a related development, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, on Monday, told Nigerians that had been criticising the National Assembly over the ongoing amendments of the Electoral Act to channel their grievances to their representatives in the National Assembly as soon as possible.\n\nLawan stated this while inauguration of the reconstituted Public Complaints Commission by the National Assembly, led by the Chief Commissioner, Abimbola Ayo-Yusuf.\n\nHe said, \u201cThe National Assembly is embarking on the amendment of the Electoral Act. (It will) probably (be passed) by next week.\n\n\u201cIt is very important that those who feel very strongly about any amendment that they think should be effected in the Act should contact or talk to their members of House of Representatives as well as distinguished senators.\n\n\u201cI want to state categorically clear here that presiding officers are not the ones to determine what is coming or what is not.\n\nLawan challenged Nigerians to, utilise the newly reconstituted PCC to seek redress whenever their rights are trampled upon.\n\nAlso speaking at the PCC inauguration, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, described the PCC as \u201ca product of necessity due to human rights abuses, societal victimisation, high headedness practices of maladministration.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Peoples Redemption Party has said it is \u201csad and seriously concerned\u201d about the move to disallow electronic transmission of results in future elections in the country.\n\nThe National Chairman of the PRP, Falalu Bello, in a statement issued on Monday and titled \u2018Draft Electoral Bill: Three Steps Backwards,\u2019 called on Nigerians to mobilise against the planned removal by the National Assembly.\n\nSimilarly, a coalition of over 247 women groups on Monday protested against alleged manipulation of the final copy of the bill, includinh the prohibition of electronic transmission of results and removal of the power of the INEC to review results declared under duress or in contravention of electoral laws.\n\nThe gender groups statement was signed by the Executive Director of Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre and chairperson of Transition Monitoring Group, Dr Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi.\n\nOther signatories included 100 Women Lobby Group; Initiative for Girls Above, ActionAid Nigeria, Nigerian Women Trust Fund, Women in Nigerian Politics and Women in Radio.\n\nThe document reads partly, \u201cSome key provisions of the manipulated bill that are particularly worrying are the prohibition of electronic transmission of results (Section 50 (2)); the removal of INEC\u2019s power to review results declared under duress or in contravention of electoral laws and guidelines (Section 65); and the drastic increase in the limits for campaign expenses.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese provisions have the potential to undermine transparency and fairness in elections. This affects women disproportionately for two main reasons: Women rarely get the tickets for the \u2018big parties\u2019 and often their hope lies with the smaller parties.\u201d\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

It made me wonder about the kind of country we are in. I don\u2019t know if we still have leaders in this country. How can bandits enter Kaduna State and operate for 24 hours despite the presence of security agencies everywhere in the state?\u201d\n\nShe stated that her house was recently attacked as she lamented that nothing is being done to fish out the perpetrators.\n\n\u201cJust last two weeks, they attacked our own house in Nissi Village, and now my brother\u2019s school. It\u2019s not funny at all,\u201d she said.\n\nEmmanuel said authorities need to talk to the parents of the abductees about the 40 students they claimed to have rescued for them to know if they need a medical examination.\n\nAccording to her, \u201cYesterday they said they went to rescue 40 of the abductees. We are still waiting for them to tell us something about them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe government is selling propaganda, saying they rescued the children. They didn\u2019t. Those children escaped themselves,\u201d she pointed out.\n\n\u201cThey should show us the 40 students so that we can attend to them if they need medical attention.\u201d\n\nLamenting about the state of insecurity in the state, she said bandits \u201cattack us at home, in the farm and everywhere. We are not secured.\n\n\u201cState of Emergency should be declared in Kaduna State.\u201d\n\nPointing to some distraught parents, Emmanuel said, \u201cParents are saying that in the next two hours, if nothing is said about their children, this place will be burnt down.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the state government has announced that effort has been put in place to ensure the rescue of the abductees.\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement issued by the Kaduna State Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan\n\n\u201cA team of Military and Police personnel were mobilised to the school and pursued the bandits in a bid to avert their evil intention.\n\n\u201cAccording to reports received from security agencies, twenty-eight students were accounted for while an unspecified number were abducted by the bandits.\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies have assured the Kaduna State Government of vigorous search and rescue efforts to locate and secure the unspecified number of abducted students.\n\n\u201cThe Governor is following the development and receiving hourly situation reports.\u201d",

          "text": "By Omeiza Ajayi \u2013 Abuja\n\nThe All Progressives Congress APC Legacy Awareness and Campaign, a voluntary think-tank of the ruling party, has described the relationship between the President Muhammadu Buhari administration and state governors as cordial, dismissing speculations of frosty relations between the Federal and State Governments as obtained in the past.\n\nThe party\u2019s think-tank disclosed this in a statement issued Tuesday in Abuja and jointly signed by a presidential aide and Youth Representative in the APC\u2019s Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee CECPC, Barr. Ismail Ahmed, former National Publicity Secretary of the party and current Editor-in-Chief of the party\u2019s magazine, \u201cThe Progressives\u201d, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, another presidential aide, Mr Tolu Ogunlesi and Director General of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum PGF, Mr Salihu Moh. Lukman.\n\nThe group noted that the Federal Government under President Muhammadu Buhari has transformed relationship between the centre and sub-national entities, from one marked by constant acrimony and vindictiveness, to one that encourages mutual support and collaboration.\n\nIt noted that the old tense relations between Federal and State Governments is now history.\n\n\u201cNigerians could recall the extent to which the years prior to 2015 were marked by unnecessary and debilitating tensions between national and subnational governments in Nigeria, often on the basis of personal and partisan differences between senior officials.\n\n\u201cMany will recall the following: The withholding of Lagos State funds by the Federal Government, from 2004 onwards, in spite of a Supreme Court Judgement to the contrary.\n\n\u201cThe constant impeachments and attempted impeachments, engineered from the highest levels of government, of State Governors considered to be opposed to Federal Government, between 1999 and 2007.\n\n\u201cThe splitting of the Nigeria Governors Forum, following the 2013 Chairmanship elections that threw up a winner who was not the favoured candidate of the powers-that-be.\n\n\u201cThe suspension of meetings by the National Economic Council (NEC), following unresolved tensions relating to the management of Federation finances.\n\n\u201cThe stalling of the NLNG Train 7 project between 2011 and 2015, because of a desire to promote another project sited in a more favoured State\u201d, the think-tank stated.\n\nIt added that though President Buhari has been elected twice on the platform of the APC, he has consistently demonstrated that he is a politician for all of Nigeria, regardless of political or regional affiliations.\n\n\u201cAll of the administration\u2019s policies and programmes have been made available for all State Governments to take advantage of, and benefit from, for the benefit of all of the people of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe Bailout programmes of the Federal Government \u2013 including more than 600 billion Naira in Budget Support, and 575 billion Naira in commercial loans restructuring \u2013 that helped the States through the recession of 2016 and its immediate aftermath, were extended to all interested States in the country irrespective of partisan differences.\n\n\u201cThe President has approved trillions of Naira in vital Refunds to State Governments, since 2015. These include more than $5 Billion in Paris Club Refunds, owed since 2006, and 700 Billion Naira in Refunds for construction work carried out by State Governments on Federal roads. In the case of the latter, the highest benefiting State was Rivers State, receiving more than 10% of the entire amount disbursed to all the States. The State Government has since acknowledged receipt of the funds. That these actions can now be taken for granted demonstrate just how much President Buhari has done to restore normalcy to the dealings between the tiers of Government. Governors have often testified to the support they have received from the President and his administration, and his willingness to listen to them and find ways to help them achieve their governance agenda for their States.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari has brought an end to the tradition of Presidents lording it over State Governors, and trying to remove those deemed to have \u2018offended\u2019 the Federal Government. Even his harshest critics know this.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that President Buhari has set a new standard for national-subnational government relations. He has put a stop to toxic actions and attitudes of the past, and restored normalcy, and we expect that all succeeding administrations will toe his path and ensure that Nigeria never returns to the dark days of unnecessary animosity and poisonous relations with elected Governors\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Africa and the challenge of development",
          "text": "By Jerome-Mario Utomi\n\nIT is no longer news that the Director-General of the Industrial Training Fund, ITF, Sir Joseph N. Ari, recently presented the ITF Mobile Android GSM smart phone to President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.\n\nThe DG said at the presentation that the ITF mobile phone, which was comparable in quality to any other brand of Android phone in the world, was assembled by the ITF Model Skills Training Centre, MSTC, Abuja, as part of the implementation of the vision of the incumbent management of the ITF with particular emphasis on research and development. The phone was produced with 100 percent locally-sourced material.\n\nIt is proof that given the enabling environment and opportunities, Nigerians will unleash their creative potentials. Definitely a cheerful development, but such joy easily gets abbreviated when one remembers that the shadows still linger of similar feeble attempts in the past which ended in shame. There exists also new awareness that this challenge is by no means unique to Nigeria as a country but cuts across Africa.\n\nThe sad reality is that the continent is the second most-populated in the world (1.2 billion people), yet sadly represents only 1.4 per cent of the world manufacturing value added in the first quarter of 2020. This is further exacerbated by the fact that out of over 51 countries in Africa, only South Africa qualified as a member of BRICS, an acronym coined for an association of five major emerging national economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.\n\nThis worrying concern about how off-track Africa has gone in all facets of technological development and advancement recently came flooding during a conversation with C.N. Oragwu, a former university academic in physics, at his Lagos residence. Aside from the facts that the conversation leads to the title and partially forms the content of this piece, Oragwu, during the conversation critically highlighted how his new book entitled: Technology and Wealth of Nations, which is set for presentation to the public this month, chronicles the slanted and unsustainable effort different African governments made in the past to bring their nations out of technological woods, as well as outlined the way forward.\n\nThere is also another distinction to make. Similar to construction of any business strategy, where it is acknowledged that three main players must be taken into account, the corporation itself, the customers and the competition \u2013 as each of this \u2018strategic 3Cs which form the strategic triangle is a living entity with its own interests and objectives; but must be taken care of by any organisation desirous of survival; likewise, the book is evident with some strategic antidotes that signal solutions to Africa\u2019s hydra-headed and multi faceted technological challenge. A fact that more than anything else qualifies it a most read for policy makers in Nigeria and Africa as a continent.\n\nThe above is not the only explanation as he went ahead to make further distinction. Separate from thoughtfully and masterfully examining the inspiring relationship between technological development and economic progress of nations, the book deftly argues with facts that the point of sail of all economies is the introduction of the manufacturing sector or the industrial economy. He establishes that Africa\u2019s prolonged economic plight is centered on the two fundamental challenges of a manufacturing economy.\n\nIt traces Africa\u2019s economic backwardness to its roots \u2013 a key problem that has kept our policy makers handicapped and our economies crippled. With documented facts on the institutionalised crippling policies and organised sequences of stagnating events of the colonial masters, the author asks: Why is it that Europe, which hosted the industrial revolutions in the 17th and 18th centuries, did not permit technological education in Africa in about 50 years of colonisation, and prefers to send aids afterwards?\n\nOf course, the above question, in my view, may not be lacking in merit considering the fact that Africa presently is dotted with projects built with aids from Europe, United States of America, USA, and lately, China. For a better understanding of this piece, let\u2019s take a look at the Chinese development aid to Africa.\n\nGoing by reports, Chinese development aid to Africa comes to 47 per cent of its total foreign assistance in 2009 alone, and from 2000 to 2012 it funded 1,666 official assistance projects in 51 African countries. Also, the Brookings Institution Aid Data study found that at least 70 per cent of China\u2019s overseas aid was sent to Africa from 2000 to 2014.\n\nALSO READ:\n\nSome of these projects includes but not limited to the African Union building in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which cost $200 million to build and was handed over in 2012. Recently also, China announced its willingness to give the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, a $31.6 million grant to build a new headquarters in Abuja, Nigeria.\n\nChina\u2019s scarves have found their largest African market in Egypt, which imported supplies worth $45 million in 2014. The nations also have a healthy exchange of carpets, with multi-million dollar supplies travelling in both directions. Dozens of African hospitals have been built with Chinese funds in recent years. China\u2019s largest commitments in Africa are to infrastructure projects, such as Nigeria\u2019s $8.3 billion Lagos-Kano rail line, largely funded through Chinese loans.\n\nWhatever the true situation may be, I believe that there exists something troubling technologically that characterises Africa more as a dark continent. More so, looking at the current happenings and commentaries within the continent, it is obvious that fair-minded and foresighted Africans are in support of the position as conversed by the book.\n\nIn fact, many have at different times and places argued that though Africans may have overtly shown remarkable improvement in their culture and civilisation, the fact that after almost 60 years of independence, African countries continually look up to China for aid, tells a story of a continent lacking in capacity for taking responsibility for its actions and initiatives for values.\n\nOn the way out of the continent\u2019s technological debacle and the current wealth disparity among nations (industrial and industrial economies), let\u2019s again cast a glance on what the book is saying. The book argues that the current wealth disparity among nations (industrial and industrial economies) represented by highly industrialised Europe, North America and Japan on one hand and most developing (non-industrial economies) countries, in particular, those in sub-Saharan Africa, on the order is primarily the difference in the technical capability and capacity to produce and manufacture modern technologies and to use the technologies to produce and manufacture globally competitive industrial goods and to sustain the commanding tasks of science and technology in the economy.\n\nThe disparity it added, has since considerably widened and will continue to widen as long as the developing countries depend almost totally on industrial nations for the technologies and industrial inputs they need to sustain their economies.\n\nConsequently, the only way to bridge the wealth gap is for the developing countries of the world to build their domestic endogenous capabilities and capacities to produce modern technologies and competitive industrial goods in their own economies.\n\nCatalysing the process will again necessitate African leaders borrowing from Asian tigers in order to raise Africa\u2019s industrial soul. They need to analyse and understand the essential ingredients of foresight in leadership and draw a lesson on how leadership decision making processes involve judgment about uncertain elements, and differs from the pure mathematical probability process. Find out why Asia after grappling with the problems of unemployment in the region, their leaders came to the conclusion that the only way to survive was to industrialise.\n\nFinally, Sir Joseph N. Ari, may be right in his claim that in terms of quality and performance, our phone is comparable or even superior to most Android phones currently in our markets, however, it is important to underline that for us to succeed, there are certainly an infused lesson policy makers in Nigeria/Africa must draw from the above explanations.\n\n*Utomi, the Programme Coordinator ,Social and Economic Justice Advocacy, SEJA, Lagos, wrote via: [email protected]\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "The Federal Government has raised concerns over the recent outbreak of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in some parts of the country, just 11 months after being declared free of Wild Polio Virus (WPV) by the Africa Regional Certification Commission for polio eradication (ARCC).\n\nThe government said at least 13 states and the Federal Capital Territory have reported the outbreak, including, Abia, Bayelsa, Borno, Delta, FCT, Jigawa, Kano, Kebbi, Lagos, Niger, Rivers, Sokoto, Yobe and Zamfara.\n\nThe National Primary Health Care Development Agency, NPHCDA revealed this during a review meeting of the Northern Traditional Leaders Committee on Primary Health Care.\n\nThe Executive Director of NPHCDA, Dr Faisal Shuaib, has now warned that the continuous spread of this virus puts Nigeria\u2019s status as a Wild Polio Virus-free nation under threat.\n\nDr Faisal said the outbreak could have been the result of the large number of children missed during the COVID-19 outbreak response.\n\n\u201cThis year has been a challenging one due to the COVID-19 pandemic which has affected all areas of our lives including our immunization programme.\n\n\u201dThere are cases of cVDPV2 in some states, hence the need for us as a country to jealously guard our WPV-Free status and stop the cVDPV2 transmission in our communities.\n\n\u2018\u2018We have conducted four OBRs using the Novelle Oral Polio Vaccine which is a preferred choice as it doesn\u2019t seed the virus. However, sub-optimal performance has been recorded in all the States due to high number of missed children during the OBR\u2019\u2019\n\nDr Faisal urged the traditional rulers to maintain their effort of mobilising people for the OBR campaigns and other subsequent rounds of Polio vaccination.\n\nHe asked the traditional leaders to join the call for improved funding of Polio Outbreak Response Campaigns, stressing that donor support in that regard has continued to dwindle.\n\n\u2018\u2018It is pertinent to state that donor funding for Polio has reduced drastically. We will therefore be relying on your influence in advocating to Political leaders on the need to continue to fund Polio Outbreak Response campaigns. I also wish to humbly request for your continuous support in mobilising the people for the OBR campaigns and other subsequent rounds of the Polio vaccination\u2019\u2019, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sultan of Sokoto, Sa\u2019adu Abubakar, who spoke on behalf of other traditional rulers said though, certified WPV free, Nigeria\u2019s Routine Immunization coverage was still very poor while cases of maternal mortality were still unacceptably high in Northern communities.\n\n\u2018It is true, Nigeria is certified Polio Free, however, the reality is Nigeria is not out of the woods as cases of CVDPV2 continue to spread even in states that have been polio-free for nearly seven years.\n\n\u201cAdded to this, is the scourge of Covid-19 and the challenges of educating our people to create demand and acceptance for vaccines.\u201d",

          "text": "Residents of Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital, have expressed concerns over the indiscriminate floating of cooking gas dispense shops in every nook and cranny of the metropolis and its environs.\n\nThe residents, who lamented that they are sitting on a keg of gunpowder, called on the state government and relevant agencies to closely monitor the activities of the gas vendors.\n\nA resident of Urua Ekpa and shop owner in the area identified as John Bassey told our correspondent that they have no fewer than three shops along the street adding that all were sited around residential homes.\n\nHe said the call for clampdown was necessary given the inflammatory nature of gas especially in residential areas.\n\nAlso, one Unyime Akpan said, \u201cwe are gradually moving away from fossil fuel but my worry is the proliferation of these gas vendors in resident areas. We all know the combustible nature of gas.\n\nYobe govt moves to clamp down on private school operating without licence, standards\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard of sad occurrences in other places, and that is why the government must exercise strict control over their activities to safeguard lives and property.\u201d\n\nEbong Bassey, another resident of Asutan Street, echoed Akpan as he noted that almost all the streets where people reside have at least two gas vendors operating in the area noting that a dispensing shop is sited beside a kitchen of a popular restaurant in the area\n\nHe therefore urged the state government to ensure that the vendors are given frequent safety training considering the risk their operations pose.\n\nHowever the Deputy Director of Fire Service, Akwa Ibom State, Mr. Anthony Tom, in an interview said such proliferation is as a result of ignorance and lack of proper feasibility studies when venturing into business.\n\nHe advised operators to ensure strict compliance with safety precautions as laid down by the department to forestall the danger associated with illegal or indiscriminate siting of such shops.\n\nTom explained that since cooking gas is a common commodity that is used by people within the society, strict compliance to safety precautions in siting such shops and not isolating them should be harped on.\n\nHe urged those venturing into such business, to as a matter of first line priority, visit the Fire Service office for inspection, to determine the volume of hazard within a given environment.\n\n\u201cSome people might think such shops are supposed to be in isolated areas but that is not ideal, note that the volume of danger in that particular situation is also very high in case of any eventuality. You can have a whole city in flames and no one would be spared.\n\n\u201cThe best option is; stick to the rules: when you want to open a gas dispensing shop, follow the rules: number one: call in the fire service to inspect the space before you even pay for it, they will know the volume of danger in a given environment.\n\n\u201cWe have discovered in the course of our regular inspections that there could be a food outlet where open flame is used and beside it is a gas dispense shop. The danger here is applicable to everyone, the owner of the shop is not spared, the customers, even the ones patronizing the food outlet are not excluded,\u201d Tom explained.\n\nHe however called on the general public to partner in the safety business by writing petitions where necessary to the fire service department for necessary lawful actions, recommending fire extinguishers for every business owner and private homes.\n\nOn his part, the Operations Controller, Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) in Akwa Ibom, Mr Victor Ohwodiasa, in an interview said, \u201cIt is unacceptable practice, we will definitely clamp down on them, As i speak now, our men is on the way to check on the illegal gas stations and any one caught, we face the wrath of the law.\n\n\u201cIt is uncompromised operation because safety is involved and we are very critical about it and we don\u2019t need to be reactive but we want to be proactive before we have an incident, we need to nip it in the bud.\u201d\n\nInsecurity: Onitsha indigenes float security outfit, as NSCDC kicks over colours",

          "text": "First runner up at the primary election of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) held in Awka, Dr Obiora Okonkwo, has expressed his reservations about the poll.\n\nOkonkwo, in a statement, yesterday, alleged that there was a foul play in the process that produced the party\u2019s candidate. He asked his teaming supporters to wait for the next line of action which would be disclosed to them soonest.\n\n\u201cWe went into the election full of hope and expectation. Our hope was that our party, the PDP, and members of our party will conduct themselves in a manner that will prove that we are ready to do the right thing, devoid of subterfuge. Our expectation was that the wishes of the people would be allowed to prevail.\n\n\u201cFrom the result announced by the Committee led by His Excellency, Philip Shaibu, the deputy governor of Edo State, it is obvious that the outcome of that exercise did not reflect your wishes and desires. Just like you, our campaign team expected a different outcome which would be a true reflection of your choice and the reality on the ground.\n\n\u201cObviously, there were a number of serious issues and irregularities regarding the primary election. First, in response to conflicting court judgments the party decided to use super delegates in clear breach of its own constitution and in the process disenfranchised its statutory delegates who are the soul of PDP in Anambra state and who have been working in the past three years to reposition the party and sensitise the people for the simple reason that they were afraid of the choice that they might have made.\n\n\u201cHowever, there was a court judgement and order validating the Ndubuisi Nwobu-led executive which the party ought to have upheld and respected as the first in time.\n\n\u201cThe National Working Committee of the party decided, at the last minute to limit the voting to a small number of super delegates. Even with that, the list of the super delegates kept changing such that voting was unduly delayed after the first round of accreditation where 179 super delegates had been accredited. There were no explanations on why this should happen.\n\n\u201cThe second round of accreditation, done after the list had been changed again and many super delegates removed from the initial list, and many new ones added, turned in 218 super delegates. Again, there were no explanations about the increase.\n\n\u201cThere also were no explanations of the criteria used to exclude some hitherto approved super delegates while adding new ones, some of who are not eligible under the party\u2019s constitution. This prompted my question on the discrepancy which is yet to be answered.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, the most blatant of the irregularities came in the collation of votes. For instance, a total of 218 super delegates were finally accredited for the exercise. The tally of votes cast for the candidates, along with voided votes came to 200.\n\n\u201cA full week after the primary election, nobody has satisfactorily explained what happened to the other 18 votes cast by duly accredited super delegates. We expect those who conducted the election to provide the answer to this obvious discrepancy, particularly given the razor-thin margin of victory of the declared result.\n\n\u201cWhile we await the answer to this question and clarification on other matters relating to the primary election, I humbly urge you my teeming supporters, disenfranchised statutory delegates and the good people of Anambra State, including those in the Diaspora, who were intensely surprised by the outcome of the PDP primary election, to be calm and steadfast and faithful for only the Almighty God has the final say.\n\n\u201cFrom the time we started this journey, we have methodologically engaged the process, employing wide consultation and consensus to arrive at what we consider to be in the best interest of our people. This has never been about me as a person, even more so now that our efforts have morphed into a powerful grassroots political movement for the good governance of Anambra State.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been more than a week since the primary election was conducted; a period we have used for sober reflection and deep introspection about the process which also enabled us to consult widely with our teeming supporters, associates and critical stakeholders. We plead for your patience and understanding as that consultation will continue, for at least another week, after which we will make our position clear with respect to the event of June 26.\n\n\u201cWe solemnly assure that our decision, when it is made, will be based on principle and in the best interest of our people who have always been the driving inspiration of our project- Maka Ilu Olu Oma (doing the good work)\u201d, Okonkwo said\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nLeader of Pan-Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), Chief Edwin Clark, has described the newly passed Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) as satanic, unjust, embarrassing and dashing the hopes of Niger Delta people.\n\nClark, who is also leader of Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF), condemned the allocation of three per cent by the Senate and fiver per cent by House of Representatives to host communities and provision and allocation of 30 per cent of profits from oil exploitation for further frontier oil exploration in the north saying it was fraudulently inserted into the bill.\n\nHe said people of the Niger Delta, at all levels , both at home and abroad, have expressed their displeasure over what he called satanic and obnoxious allocation of a paltry percentage of operating expenditure to oil producing communities by the National Assembly, saying the PIB does not reflect the long clamour by the people of region for equity, fairness and justice.\n\nClark, represented at a press conference in Abuja by PANDEF\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Ken Robinson, declared that the region has had enough of colonial oppression and would resist the bill.\n\nThe two chambers of the National Assembly last week Thursday passed the PIB which seeks to introduce far-reaching reforms in the oil and gas industry, after about 13 years of legislative fireworks.\n\nThe bill was first sent to the National Assembly in 2008 by President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, now deceased, without translating into an Act.\n\nClark demanded that the bill as passed be reversed else the Niger Delta would take their destinies in their hands and deny International Oil Companies (IOCs) operations into the region.\n\n\u201cGiven the depth of ingratitude expressed and delivered after decades of exploitation and neglect of the region, the entire people of the Niger Delta region, for and on behalf of the host communities, vehemently reject the three and five per cent operating expenditure granted to the host communities; the fraudulent and provocative 30 per cent provision for the Frontier Exploration Fund, and now demand the PIB must be reversed, reviewed and amended to ensure that the oil-bearing communities must now receive not less than 10 per cent of operating cost. If this is not done, the Niger Delta people may be forced to take their destiny into their own hands and all IOCs may find themselves denied access to their oil activities in such communities.\n\n\u201cIt is important to state clearly here to all well-meaning Nigerians that the demand of the oil bearing communities of the Niger Delta region was for a minimum of 10 per cent equity participation. But you Mr. Senate President, the Right Honourable Speaker and some of your colleagues in the National Assembly, have further shown your disdain to the Niger Delta people by redefining host communities to include pipeline-bearing pathway communities, in which case states where pipelines pass through to aid them with the privilege of cheap supplies of Niger Delta petroleum products could also be entitled to the ridiculous and unacceptable percentages that the legislators are willing to cede to oil-bearing communities.\n\n\u201cWe want to warn seriously, that the people of the Niger Delta have had enough of this colonial and oppressive mentality of our Northern brothers and friends. Today, the north controls the oil sector, even though day-to-day operations are being handled by the International Oil Companies (IOCs) on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

Ugwuanyi, represented by his Special Adviser on Project Development and Implementation (PDI), Engr. Dr. (Mrs.) MaryRose Obiageli Abba, described sports as an important social phenomenon in all levels of modern society that has the ability to socialize, unify, \u201cprevent and reduce a large number of diseases as it is the most important means of enhancing human health, physical development and improvement\u201d.\n\nThe governor, who pointed out that Tennis is one of the most popular recreational and sporting activities in modern society, added that \u201cit has evolved into a game for all people of a variety of cultures, socio-economic levels and ages as it is a leisure-time activity with a huge health and emotional benefits as well as income generation\u201d.\n\nGov. Ugwuanyi revealed that his administration has constructed some rural roads, the municipal road in Ogrute, Enugu Ezike and other vital projects in Igbo-Eze North LGA, including the ongoing Amenity Hospital project, which he performed the foundation laying ceremony recently.\n\n\u201cYou are now witnesses to the serious commitment and the faithfulness which my administration has employed in fulfilling these promises\u201d, the governor told the elated stakeholders and royal fathers of Igbo-Eze North LGA, who came out en masse to witness the event.\n\nGovernor Ugwuanyi commended his Special Adviser on PDI, Engr. Abba, for the promptness and financial prudence her office displayed in executing the project. He equally thanked the Chairman of Igbo-Eze North LGA, Engr. Ejike Itodo, the LG Executives of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the people of the council area for their support and cooperation, saying that \u201cit is expected that the maintenance, safety and security of the sports facility installed in Igbo-Eze North Local Government Area is assured\u201d.\n\nIn his speech, the Chairman of Igbo-Eze North LGA, Engr.

          "text": "*States to promulgate anti-open grazing law by September 1\n\n*Reject 3% host community fund in PIB\n\n*Kick against 30% share of profit for frontier exploration\n\nSegun James, Vanessa Obioha in Lagos, Christopher Isiguzo in Enugu, Kemi Olaitan in Ibadan and James Sowole in Akure\n\nThe pan-Yoruba sociopolitical organisation, Afenifere; the Yoruba Ronu Leadership Forum; the apex Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo; and the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) have thrown their weight behind the demand by the southern governors for the next president of Nigeria to come from the South.\n\nRising from its second meeting held yesterday at the Lagos State Government House in Ikeja, the southern governors resolved that the next President of Nigeria should come from the southern region.\n\nIn a six-point communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of the meeting, which was signed by the Chairman of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum and Governor of Ondo State, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), the governors also gave their members a timeline of Wednesday, September 1, 2021, to promulgate the anti-open grazing law in all the southern states.\n\nThey also rejected the three per cent host community fund in the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) and recommended that the fund should be increased to five per cent.\n\nThe governors also rejected the removal of the electronic transmission of election results from the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021, and the confirmation of exclusive jurisdiction in pre-election matters on the Federal High Court.\n\nThe forum also unanimously chose Lagos State as its permanent secretariat and appreciated the Governor of the state, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, for the wonderful hosting of the meeting and his good work in the state.\n\nThe governors re-affirmed their commitment to the unity of Nigeria on the pillars of equity, fairness, justice, progress and peaceful co-existence between and amongst its people.\n\n\u201cThe forum reiterates its commitment to the politics of equity, fairness and unanimously agrees that the presidency of Nigeria be rotated between Southern and Northern Nigeria and resolved that the next president of Nigeria should emerge from the Southern Region,\u201d said the communiqu\u00e9.\n\nThe governors reviewed the security situation in the country and commended the security operatives for their relentless efforts in restoring security and safety.\n\nThey commiserated with families and loved ones of those who have fallen in the line of duty, and e-emphasised the need for state police.\n\nThe southern governors also \u201cresolved that if for any reason, security institutions need to undertake an operation in any state, the Chief Security Officer of the state must be duly informed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe forum frowns at selective criminal administration of justice and resolved that arrests should be made within the ambit of the law and fundamental human rights,\u201d and \u201cset a timeline of Wednesday, September 1, 2021, for the promulgation of the anti-open grazing law in all member states\u201d and \u201cresolved that funds deducted from the Federation Account for the Nigeria Police Security Trust Fund should be distributed among the states and federal government to combat security challenges.\u201d\n\nThe governors commended the National Assembly for the progress made in the passage of the PIB.\n\nThey, however, rejected the proposed three per cent and supported the five per cent share of the oil revenue to the host community as recommended by the House of Representatives.\n\nThe southern governors also kicked against the proposed 30 per cent share of profit for the exploration of oil and gas in the basins.\n\nAccording to them, \u201cThe forum rejects the ownership structure of the proposed Nigeria National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC). The forum disagrees that the company be vested in the Federal Ministry of Finance but should be held in trust by Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) since all tiers of government have stakes in that vehicle.\n\n\u201cIn order to consolidate our democracy and strengthen the Electoral process, the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum rejects the removal of the electronic transmission of the election result from the electoral act; and also rejects the confirmation of exclusive jurisdiction in pre-election matters on the Federal High Court.\n\nThey unanimously chose Lagos State as the forum\u2019s permanent secretariat.\n\nGovernors present at the meeting include Senator Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, Akeredolu of Ondo State, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State, Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom, Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, Douye Diri of Bayelsa State and Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, and Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State.\n\nGovernor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State was represented by his deputy, Placid Njoku; while Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo was represented by his deputy, Philip Shaibu.\n\nThe deputy governor of Ebonyi State, Kelechi Igwe, represented Governor David Umahi, while the deputy governor of Abia State, Oko Chukwu, represented Governor Okezie Ikpeazu.\n\nThe governors of Anambra and Cross River States were not represented at the meeting.\n\nMeanwhile, the Yoruba Ronu Leadership Forum has thrown its weight behind yesterday\u2019s resolutions of the southern governors.\n\nPresident of the forum, Mr. Akin Malaolu said in a statement yesterday that the southern \u201cgovernors took landmark decisions that may put the nation on a good road to the recovery of her beauty in African\u2019s eyes and the world.\u201d\n\nHe said the governors\u2019 objections on what host and producing communities will take for government mining of oil on their indigenous lands and as stated in the petroleum industry bill, including the reconfiguration of the NNPC deserves scrutiny once again by the two chambers of the National Assembly.\n\nHe called on the Senate and House of Representatives to revisit their versions of the bills to address some disagreement, especially in the area of the percentage that should be allocated to host communities.\n\n\u201cWe support the governors for recognizing the need for respect and regard for their positions as the chief security officers of their individual state. Their approval to enact anti-open grazing laws as legal teeth to reduce famine in the land and curb incessant conflicts deserve praises,\u201d the forum said.\n\nThe forum condemned what it described as the Gestapo-style known to belong to Hitler\u2019s era perpetrated against Chief Sunday Igboho, saying it was an incident that the Governor of Oyo State, Mr. Seyi Makinde, should take up officially and persuade the federal government to apologise for their criminal actions.\n\nAfenifere, Ohanaeze Back Govs\u2019 Demands\n\nReacting to the governors\u2019 demands, Afenifere, yesterday said since the North would have ruled consecutively for eight years by 2023, the next president would come from the South.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Jare Ajayi, while speaking with THISDAY, said it was imperative that the next president must come from the South if only for the sake of equity, fairness and justice.\n\nHe, however, maintained that what is important to the group is the restructuring of the country before the next election, noting that every section of the country has people who are capable of occupying any position in the country, including the presidency \u201cin order to ensure that every section of the country has a sense of belonging.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, to us in Afenifere, political parties should ensure that their presidential candidates are picked from the South. But beyond the issue of where the next president comes from, it must be a condition that restructuring takes place before the next elections in Nigeria! Restructuring that encapsulates true federalism and confers the leverage for self-determination on the constituent components of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting to the communiqu\u00e9, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Chief Alex Ogbonia, who spoke to THISDAY, appealed to the governors to move a step further by conceding the presidency to the South-east in the spirit of justice, equity and fairness.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe outcome of their meeting in Lagos is a welcome development because the issue of the presidency moving to the South-east should be non-negotiable.\n\n\u201cThis was part of the gentleman agreement reached between Northern and Southern leaders in 1998 to the effect that the Presidency should alternate between the North and the South.\n\n\u201cThe South-west have had their full share through President Olusegun Obasanjo while the South-south have equally had their share through President Goodluck Jonathan; it is, therefore the turn of the South East.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe governors should therefore be magnanimous enough to reciprocate the kindness of the people of the South-east by boldly declaring that 2023 is for the South-east.\u201d\n\nPANDEF Hails Southern Govs\n\nPANDEF has also hailed the unanimous resolution on the Southern presidency.\n\nThe group\u2019s spokesman, Hon. Ken Robinson, in a reaction, expressed happiness that the Southern governors met again, less than two months, after their historic Asaba meeting, to further accentuate the wishes and aspirations of the people of Southern Nigeria.\n\nPANDEF, he said, is happy that the Southern governors have now added their voice to the critical matter, given the irrational proposals by some mischievous persons that the presidency should be open to all zones of the country in 2023\n\nThe group congratulated the Southern Governors and commended them for the demonstration of solidarity, and the commitment to consolidate the Unity of Southern Nigeria adding that \u201cwe hope that they would sustain this spirit of understanding and congruence, in the best interest of our people and the country\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Pledges more support for MSMEs\n\nObinna Chima and Funmi Ogundare\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is to collaborate with universities in designing a framework for entrepreneurship development in order to arrest rising youth unemployment.\n\nThe CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, while delivering the 51st Convocation Lecture of the University of Lagos, yesterday in Lagos, urged universities to begin sending requests to the CBN for research or for some form of training on entrepreneurial development.\n\nThe topic of his lecture was: \u201cNational Development and Knowledge-Economy in the Digital Age: Leapfrogging SMEs in the 21st Century.\u201d\n\nEmefiele also pledged the CBN\u2019s readiness to increase its development finance interventions to support micro, small and medium scale enterprises (MSMEs).\n\nAccording to him, since the introduction of the Youth Entrepreneurship Development Fund (YEDP), one of the bank\u2019s development finance initiatives, there has been limited access by fresh school leavers.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is to support our youths who are graduating so that rather than going out to seek employment from\n\ncompanies, that they can on their own access finance, both grants and loans that would aid them in setting up their own business, thereby creating jobs not just for themselves, but for others as well. That is what I think we should begin to think about at this time.\n\n\u201cGiven population growth and the increasing number of graduates, we need to begin to see how SMEs can be incorporated and supported.\n\n\u201cClosing from this lecture today, we would be writing to all universities, to begin to conduct some kind of entrepreneurship development competition programme.\n\n\u201cIf you truly say you are a graduate of agriculture, are you coming out of the university to begin to look for a job in a company or you are graduating with your certificate to go into agriculture business? So, we would like to encourage universities.\u201d\n\nHe said the bank\u2019s Development Finance team would soon write to universities to develop a framework under which this can be done, adding that is one aspect where the bank can begin to stimulate the entrepreneurial skills in the youth.\n\nEmefiele congratulated the graduating students and urged them to take advantage of some of the bank\u2019s programmes aimed at supporting SMEs such as the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme (SMECGS); Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Fund (MSMEDF); Agri-business/Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS); Creative Industry Financing Initiative (CIFI); Targeted Credit Facility (TCF) and the Nigeria Youth Investment Fund (NYIF).\n\nHe highlighted how critical vibrant and growing small businesses are to the growth of the economy and the creation of jobs for Nigerian youth.\n\nHe stated that special consideration needed to be given to strengthening physical and ICT infrastructure to enable SMEs to perform more efficiently and become globally competitive.\n\nHe added that the potential of SMEs in enhancing economic growth was hampered by limited access to finance, inadequate infrastructure and poor digital penetration.\n\nEmefiele urged governments at all levels and the private sector to provide more support in addressing the challenges of SMEs.\n\nAccording to him, as users of new technology, policies should incentivise the adoption of innovations that will improve SMEs competitiveness and productivity.\n\n\u201cIn the 21st century, we have witnessed ground-breaking innovations and growth in several countries, stemming from significant investments in building a knowledge-based system that enables greater application of technologically driven research and innovation,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CBN governor explained that technology is not only reshaping how knowledge is shared but also how goods and services are produced and traded, adding that it is also redesigning the various modes of payments for goods and services towards systems that enable faster and more efficient settlement of payment transactions.\n\n\u201cToday, the emergence of digital platforms such as Amazon and Alibaba have provided SMEs with a significant ability to expand their operations by enabling them to sell and deliver their products to customers that are not within their immediate environment,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, a digitalised and knowledge-driven economy can accelerate the growth and development of SMEs as well as create new opportunities to strengthen productivity, especially in the services industry.\n\nHe listed countries such as India, China, Korea and Singapore as having continued to harness the benefits of the knowledge economy to accelerate economic growth, largely, through the contributions of SMEs.\n\nHe tasked all stakeholders to deepen reforms that will improve human capital development through skills enhancement and proper linkage of research to the SME sector.\n\nEmefiele charged tertiary institutions to tap into the educational trends that are drivers of productivity in advanced and emerging markets, in order to reshape the curriculum, enhance the learning experience of students and foster innovation among the faculty and staff.\n\nOn the role of the CBN in the development of SMEs, Emefiele said the bank had rolled out massive developmental interventions in some critical sectors of the Nigerian economy, especially in agriculture, manufacturing and SMEs.\n\nIn his remarks, the Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, said the lecture fell within the strategic plan of the institution, saying: \u201cThis is because we are aware that there is a need to empower our youths if we are serious about moving the economy of this nation forward.\u201d\n\nHe stated that youth development was a key consideration in the university\u2019s academic activities, adding that it is at the forefront of developing critical manpower required for building and developing the nation.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur courses and research thematic areas are focused on preparing our students for nation-building and solving societal challenges.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Chairman of the occasion, Pastor Tunde Bakare of The Citadel Global Community Church (formerly Latter Rain Assembly), had expressed excitement about the topic, saying that the country needs young entrepreneurs to create jobs.\n\n\u201cWe cannot always build the future for our youths, but we can build our youths for the future,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "A United States District Court in Maryland has ordered the founder of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, Dr Daniel Olukoya, to pay $7,320 within 30 days as part of sanctions in the suit he entered against human rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, alleging defamatory publications.\n\nThe court, in a ruling by US Magistrate Judge, Timothy Sullivan, and obtained by SaharaReporters, titled, \u201cDKT 75 Order re \u2013 Motion for Sanctions 18-cv-02922,\u201d added that Olukoya was also \u201cprohibited from (1) making any use of any documents related to the U.K. Charity Commission that he produced to the Defendants after January 2, 2021; and from (2) challenging the admissibility of these documents on any basis.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had published stories involving Olukoya in September 2017 when some church members in Maryland accused him of importing religious books without paying customs duties.\n\nIt had been revealed that the church dragged some of its former pastors and members to court over monetary and property disputes.\n\nThe sued pastor and former church members had, in turn, accused the General Overseer of engaging in fraudulent activities in the US, including evasion of duties owed to US authorities.\n\nIn an action filed in the Circuit Court for Prince Georges\u2019 County of Maryland, U.S.A., (Case No. CAL16-26532) on behalf of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries International, Lagos, and Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, USA, Nevada, the church had sought declaratory judgment and damages against Pastors Lawrence Adetunji, Ronke Adetunji, and 11 former members of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, Bowie, Maryland.

Also in contention are funds for the MFM building in Bowie.\n\nIn October 2018, Olukoya and the church had instituted a court action at the US District Court for the District of Maryland against Sowore and Sahara Reporters Media Inc. in a suitcase number, 8:18-cv-02922, which Judge Theodore D. Chuang then heard. See Also Exclusive How United Kingdom Commission Appointed Interim Manager For Mountain Of Fire And Miracles Ministries Over Fraud Case\n\nHighlighting the Sahara Reporters publication of September 27, 2017, entitled \u201cFormer Mountain Of Fire Miracles Ministries Pastors Accuse General Overseer, Olukoya, Of Illegal Importation Of Goods In US Property Dispute,\u201d Olukoya and the church lawyers had stated in its 49-paragraph complaint their three causes of action which were; \u201cdefamation, defamation per se and false light.\u201d\n\nThey, therefore, claimed an award against all defendants to compensate for all economic damages sustained as a result of their tortious conduct; an award against all defendants to compensate for all presumed actual reputational damage; an award against all defendants to compensate for all presumed actual damages resulting from mental anguish and emotional distress; an award against all defendants of punitive damages; attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\n\nSaharaReporters had, nonetheless, in August 2020 also reported that Olukoya was considering taking another legal action against the online news publication to stop it from reporting about the United Kingdom Charity Commission scandal involving his church.\n\nOlukoya, in a letter written by his lawyer, Ime Nya Asanga, had alleged that SaharaReporters levelled false allegations against him and the MFM board of trustees.\n\nSaharaReporters had earlier reported how the UK Charity Commission appointed an interim manager for the MFM in August 2019.\n\nThe commission, in a statement, said the interim manager assumes these duties at the exclusion of the charity\u2019s trustees, stating that the trustees retain control over matters relating to religious activities.\n\nThe UK charity regulator claimed it had serious concerns over MFM Chair of Trustees, Dr Daniel Olukoya, and his handling of serious incidents.\n\nIt accused Olukoya of illegally meeting a former employee of the charity alleged to have stolen between \u00a3150,000 and \u00a3190,000 of the charity\u2019s funds in Nigeria, then entered into an agreement with the individual without consulting with other trustees.\n\nOlukoya had in the past filed three libel suits against the Publisher of SaharaReporters, Omoyele Sowore, in Nigeria and another one before the District Court of Maryland, United States.\n\nWhile all the cases in Nigeria had been dismissed, the one in the US was decided only on June 24, 2021.\n\nWhile ruling on the suit, the US District Court magistrate said Olukoya should pay $7,320 within 30 days as part of sanctions in the suit he entered against Sowore while alleging defamatory publications.\n\nThe magistrate said, \u201cPlaintiff Daniel Olukoya brought this lawsuit against the Defendants to recover for purported defamatory statements that the Defendants made about him and his church in an article published on September 27, 2017.2 See ECF No. 73. During discovery, the Defendants sought information related to the U.K. Charity Commission\u2019s investigation of Olukoya\u2019s church. ECF No. 72 at 1-2. When Olukoya failed to provide the requested discovery, the Defendants filed a motion to compel (ECF No. 55). Among the discovery requests at issue was a request for \u201c[a]ll documents relating to proceedings before the U.K. Charity Commission related to Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries International.\u201d ECF No. 55-3 at 13.\n\n\u201cIn response to the motion to compel, Olukoya stated that he had responded to the discovery requests and that the motion to compel was therefore moot. ECF No. 59. Thereafter, the court held a telephone conference to address a related dispute (whether Olukoya would be required to produce discovery responses directed to a party whose claims had been dismissed), but otherwise treated the Defendants\u2019 motion to compel as moot.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Olukoya\u2019s response to the motion to compel contained a serious misrepresentation; he had not produced any \u201cdocuments relating to proceedings before the U.K. Charity Commission related to Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries International.\u201d See ECF No. 68 at 5 (noting that Olukoya produced no documents responsive to this request). And at 1 Judge Chuang referred this case to me for all discovery and related scheduling matters. ECF No. 57. 2 Other claims that Olukoya brought against the Defendants have been dismissed. ECF No. 26. Olukoya\u2019s deposition, which was held on April 23, 2021, Olukoya testified that there were \u201ctons and tons of documents in [his] possession\u201d that relate to the inquiry by the U.K. Charity Commission. ECF No. 72-8 at 34.\u201d\n\nThe magistrate added that the defendants, therefore, sought sanctions against Olukoya for his failure to produce the requested documents relating to proceedings before the U.K. Charity Commission.\n\nThe magistrate said, \u201cThe conclusion is that; for the reasons set forth above, the Defendants\u2019 Motion for Sanctions will be granted in part and denied in part. The court will enter the following sanctions against the Defendants: Olukoya is prohibited from (1) making any use of any documents related to the U.K. Charity Commission that he produced to the Defendants after January 2, 2021; and from (2) challenging the admissibility of these documents on any basis other than Fed. R. Evid. 401 and 403.\n\n\u201cOlukoya will also be required to pay the Defendants\u2019 reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred in connection with his discovery failures, which total $7,320.00, within 30 days of the date of this Order. Payment should be made directly to the Defendants\u2019 attorneys. These sanctions are entered against Olukoya pursuant to Rules 37(c) and 26(g).\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in the response of Olukoya\u2019s legal team to the court, it already admitted that the said online publications did not lead to any harm for the church.\n\nThe court papers obtained by SaharaReporters said, \u201cDefendant Omoyele Sowore\u2019s Request for Admissions. Responses 1. Admit that Plaintiff Daniel Olukoya did not suffer any economic harm due to the publication of the Challenged Statements. RESPONSE: Plaintiff denies this request. 2. Admit that no contract between Plaintiff Daniel Olukoya and any individual, corporation, or entity was terminated due to the publication of the Challenged Statements. RESPONSE: Plaintiff admits this request. 3. Admit that no member of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles church resigned from the Mountain of Fire and Miracles church due to the publication of the Challenged Statements.\n\n\u201cRESPONSE: Plaintiff denies this request. 4. Admit that Plaintiff Daniel Olukoya cannot identify a single individual who decided not to become a member of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles church due to the publication of the Challenged Statements. RESPONSE: Plaintiff denies this request. 5. Admit that Mountain of Fire and Miracles employs a public relations professional or media aide who is responsible for public relations for Mountain of Fire and Miracles. RESPONSE: Plaintiff admits this request.\n\n\u201c6. Admit that Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries employs a public relations professional or media aide who is responsible for public relations for Plaintiff Daniel Olukoya. RESPONSE: Plaintiff admits this request. 7. Admit that Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries maintains a website that provides information about its ministry to the public.\n\n\u201cRESPONSE: Plaintiff admits this request. 8. Admit that Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries maintains a YouTube page that airs Plaintiff Daniel Olukoya\u2019s sermons. RESPONSE: Plaintiff admits this request. 9. Admit that Plaintiff Daniel Olukoya\u2019s Facebook page identifies him as a public figure. RESPONSE: Plaintiff admits this request. 10. Admit that Plaintiff Daniel Olukoya is a public figure for purposes of this defamation action. RESPONSE: Plaintiff admits this request.\u201d\n\nThe lawyers representing Sowore in the suit stated that they would donate the $7,320 sanction fees to be paid by Olukoya to Sowore\u2019s ongoing court cases in Nigeria where the government dragged him to court over trumped-up charges.\n\n\u201cBased on Olukoya\u2019s gamesmanship in failing to provide relevant discovery materials (particularly has failed to timely produce any documents relating to the UK Charity Commission investigation), we filed a motion asking magistrate judge Sullivan to impose discovery sanctions on Olukoya. We\u2019re delighted to report that at the end of last week, magistrate Sullivan issued the attached decision finding that Olukoya misled the court and awarding $7,320 in attorneys\u2019 fees against Olukoya personally.\n\n\u201cOlukoya is required to pay us the $7,320 in attorneys\u2019 fees within 30 days. And Lisa and I would like to donate the $7,320 to SaharaReporters to help defray Sowore\u2019s legal defence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where things currently stand. In the next few weeks, we\u2019ll be conducting additional limited depositions of Olukoya and Grace Ugeh, which the magistrate has permitted so that we can question each of them about documents they improperly failed to produce until after they were deposed,\u201d one of the lawyers stated.",

          "title": "What telcos and banks look for in fintech partnerships",
          "text": "Fintech is growing in Africa thanks to strategic partnerships between startups, banks and diverse categories of global companies. According to McKinsey & Company, at least five models of partnerships are currently favoured.\n\nOne model is a vendor relationship: a bank that needs to quickly go to market with an innovation opts to ride on a fintech\u2019s technology, avoiding the hassle of building from scratch.\n\nIn a distribution model, a digital-only bank (say Kuda) partners with traditional banks to offer in-branch deposits, ATM withdrawals and card issuance. Chaka, the recently licensed stock trading app, has been able to provide investment options to users by working with brokerage partners.\n\nOther partnership models from McKinsey\u2019s research include strategic Investments (like Visa\u2019s 20% stake in Interswitch); joint ventures (where two entities create a common product together); and outright acquisitions \u2013 the popular example over the past year being Paystack\u2019s acquisition by Stripe.\n\nWhatever the partnership type, the aim is to win. For a startup, a long term win might be a successful exit or Initial Public Offering (IPO). Otherwise, the immediate goal is to accelerate growth at a rate they wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve if they worked alone.\n\nBut partnerships don\u2019t automatically work just because two parties have good intentions or similar ambitions.\n\nNot a piece of cake\n\n\u201cSuccess should not be taken for granted and both parties need to be well prepared,\u201d says Mayowa Kuyoro, partner at McKinsey and head of its West Africa financial services practice.\n\nAlignment on resources, culture and regulatory compliance, among other factors, is key.\n\nIt\u2019s a consideration that is always on Abubakar Suleiman\u2019s mind. As CEO of Sterling Bank, Suleiman receives partnership offers regularly and believes himself open to having many conversations.\n\nBut he has identified a problem: \u201cMore often than not, we are not clear about the problem we are trying to solve,\u201d Suleiman said. \u201cWe are trying to jump into partnerships because we think there is profit to be shared.\u201d\n\nPartnership conversations have worked better for Suleiman when the initial focus was on problems and the capacity to solve them. And so he wishes to encourage an approach that frames partnerships in terms of capabilities, not institutions.\n\nFor example, a startup that needs a partner for regulatory issues should go for the most capable and experienced firm on the subject. It should not matter whether this firm is a big bank or whatever else.\n\nWhat\u2019s on the table?\n\nThat said, the size of rewards at stake for both parties matters.\n\n\u201cIt is important to make sure the economics work out for everybody,\u201d says Tayo Oviosu, co-founder and CEO of Paga.\n\nHe cites the example of Paga\u2019s partnership with Interswitch in the 2010s which, though initially successful in terms of returns to both parties, tapered off for a while. It raised a need for a review after which Paga decided it was in its best interest to plug directly into every other billing services provider in Nigeria.\n\nRia, the money transfer service provider, operates in 43 African countries. According to Robert Kotei, operations director for Africa, startups and companies present beyond one country can be more appealing to multinational companies looking for partnerships.\n\nHowever, sometimes a startup may need to patiently prove itself before landing big partnerships.\n\nWhile getting Bankly off the ground in 2019, Tomilola Majekodunmi faced the dilemma of deciding what partners she needed for the startup\u2019s ambition to digitalise contributory savings networks known as ajo. To achieve this, Bankly planned to work with telcos.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work out, partly because the potential partners were already looking to directly offer services similar to what Bankly proposed. They did not see a unique advantage to entice them towards a partnership.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t get a fair or just partnership either because we were too young or too small for these big players,\u201d Majekodunmi said. So Bankly spent two years building an agent network which now numbers 15,000 agents across Nigeria.\n\nMinimum viable partnerships\n\nElsa Muzzolini, a general manager for MTN\u2019s mobile financial services, acknowledges the difficulty in partnering with relatively small startups. Three factors, she said, are often at play.\n\nParties may have different expectations for how long deals take to complete. They may diverge on the initially agreed scope, and finding the precise contact person who can activate decisions can be hard.\n\nWhere these factors come together, partnerships can work. But Muzzolini would like startups to seek avenues for collaboration that bypass the formal phases that a typical partnership entails.\n\n\u201cCan we do a lighter form of partnership? Get my API, run with it. Maybe at a later stage as your numbers grow, we can discuss co-branding and other things.\u201d\n\nFollow all TechCabal Live conversations on our YouTube channel.

          "title": "Tolu Michaels on how digital entrepreneurs create and sell intangible products online",
          "text": "In 2021, when you think of how best to serve people beyond physical borders, the internet comes to mind.\n\nBuilding a business on the internet could play out in two different ways. Your business can either deal with offering physical products for sale online or providing a service online. The former would be tangible while the latter would have no physical form whatsoever.\n\nTolu Michael chose to provide a service \u2013 a digital product \u2013 where she guides people on how to establish personal reputation using the internet. She\u2019s helping them gain visibility online. I had an interesting chat with her on what it\u2019s like creating services and selling to tens of thousands of people online from the comfort of her home in Lagos, Nigeria. But before we dive in, let\u2019s take a stroll through her career journey.\n\nA digital entrepreneur with an engineering background\n\nAfter studying mechanical engineering in Nigeria- something she did because of her love for cars \u2013 she took a detour into the world of investment banking. This happened after she interned at a Toyota after-sales franchise for a while and realised she didn\u2019t want to deal with the smell of petrol and engine oil every day.\n\nSomewhere in her career journey, marriage happened and she had to move cities but during that process, she lost her job so she had to rethink her career path. As a woman, changing jobs alongside starting a new family came with startling challenges.\n\nMichaels\u2019 initial obstacle being a newly wedded woman is not exactly a peculiar one. In a lot of family situations, prioritizing family over work is the number one barrier to a woman\u2019s career. This study by Harvard Business School says more than half of Gen X and Baby Boomer men expected that their careers would take priority over their partners. In the study, \u201c73 percent of men and 85 percent of women agreed that prioritizing family over work is the most difficult career decision women face.\n\nFor Michaels, being newly married came with lots of \u201cspecific rejections,\u201d where employers assume she might get carried away with building a family and leave her job to suffer. At this point, searching for new job opportunities proved abortive so she figured she could try out something on her own and that just happened to be digital entrepreneurship.\n\n\u201cInitially, I started to ask myself, what do I have to offer people, especially beyond borders, because I couldn\u2019t do something physical. I didn\u2019t have the capital to sell physical products so I needed something I could provide people in whatever location I am,\u201d she tells me on our Google Meet call.\n\nLeveraging knowledge commerce\n\nDigital products are basically online products that can\u2019t be held, touched, or tasted. They could be music, videos, ebooks, online courses or even this article you are reading. They are only created and delivered electronically.\n\nTo generate revenue, a digital entrepreneur builds their platform through personal branding, this is particularly pertinent to gain visibility and influence more sales\n\nPersonal branding is all about positioning, Michaels tells me. \u201cYou don\u2019t even need to have a very large audience, all you need is to position yourself as a valuable expert and leader. This will allow the right people and the right opportunities to be attracted to you.\u201d\n\nIn the initial stage of her digital career, Michaels picked up new skills including a degree on Disruptive Strategy from Harvard Business school. She had also helped a few friends build their personal brands so it was about time to enlarge her area of reach.\n\nFirst, she buffed up her social media presence, which she says is a major part of \u201cpositioning.\u201d Social media is free to use but to gain followers or reach a larger audience, one needs to put in the work. She got her \u201cfirst-ever client from outside her circle of friends\u201d from Instagram. One would think LinkedIn could have been at the forefront of this process but, she says, in selling digital products, entrepreneurs should have their profiles on all social media platforms and utilise each platform fully.\n\nFrom getting her first international client to building a personal platform that has trained over 20,000 people in over 12 countries of the world, what Michaels really does is teach modern entrepreneurs how \u201cto build purposeful and profitable personal brands, so that they can stand out of the crowd and sell impactful products.\u201d\n\nShe does this through branding, online courses, consultations, podcasting and through her book, Show Up. For her, work revolves around helping people get the clarity and confidence to show up online, communicate their values, and create a bigger impact with their work. How she sells is mostly by referrals from people she\u2019s worked with in the past.\n\nFor some digital entrepreneurs, online sales only provide supplementary income in addition to their main jobs but for people like her, it is a full-time job that is earning her a living.\n\nWhen Michaels made her first 1000 dollars just from putting her thoughts together and selling to her audience, she became an ardent digital product creator. What is even more important to her is positioning herself not as someone whose products are for an African audience alone but for an untapped global market.\n\nAs one who speaks candidly about juggling motherhood, selling digital products is not just helping her create impact and make money while at it, it is also enabling her to work mostly from the comfort of her home, close to her daughter.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Product partnership managers are obsessed with a product\u2019s life cycle",
          "text": "Product and partnership managers are a nascent breed of individuals who act as a bridge between external partners and their companies. While product managers are responsible for hand holding a product from conception to maturity, product and partnership managers go a step further by exposing the product to valuable collaborations.\n\nI am bringing Tide Ayeni to Centre Stage because he understands the fundamentals of building partnerships into existing products. In his role as product and partnership manager at Indicina, he is responsible for driving growth through setting up successful partnerships and working with them to launch consumer credit products.\n\nWhat is your favourite part of a product life cycle?\n\nFor people who don\u2019t know, the life cycle of a product is broken into four parts: introduction (birth), growth, maturity, and decline (or death). My favourite part has to be the growth of a product. I\u2019m obsessed with numbers \u2014 as should every product and partnership manager.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, the maturity part is great because you can kind of kick back and watch your product make money. But the growth stage keeps you on your toes.\n\nSay more, please\n\nOur tech ecosystem is designed to promote collaboration and partnership. Can you grow your product successfully without partnering with a bigger company, yes. Is that method sustainable? No. Why? Because you will end up putting you and your product into a box. If you want your product to go farther than its birthplace, you need to get creative with your partnerships. Some partners can help you figure out marketing strategies and campaigns; other collaborators can help you aggressively penetrate a new market.\n\nIn your years of experience working as a product partnership manager, have you ever experienced the death of a product?\n\nOh my goodness, yes! During my time at Interswitch, we had a product that was designed to work for a specific market. I mean we put everything we had into that product but over time, we realized that it wasn\u2019t a good fit for that market. When the product was in its ideation stage, it was built for prospective retail clients. But when we went back to the drawing board, we discovered that it would work better for government agencies and hospitals. Imagine that?\n\nHow did you handle the product\u2019s demise?\n\nMy team made an executive decision to bring the product to end of life and move into maintenance mode; which means we didn\u2019t make any code improvements or fix existing bugs. We also sent out an email to all the users letting them know our decision.\n\nCan you tell us why partnerships matter in product development?\n\nBecause you can\u2019t do everything yourself. If I want to build multiple features into one product, I have two options: I can either pressure my developers to figure out how to hack the infrastructure; or I can find a partner that has already done the work and just connect my product to their rails. Collaboration is a shorter route to making things happen for your product.\n\nHow can you tell when a product is on its way to becoming powerful?\n\nFirstly, you have to consider timing. A powerful product will enter the market at the right time. If the timing isn\u2019t right, your product will not scale and adoption rates will be low.\n\nSecondly, a powerful product is backed by a powerful team. I cannot stress enough that a good team plays an important role in a product\u2019s life cycle\u2013 particularly where growth and maturity are concerned.\n\nLastly, when your market accepts and adopts your product, it is well on its way to becoming powerful.\n\nHow do you develop yourself in your role? What are you reading, watching, or listening to?\n\nI do a lot of courses. I try my best to use that to fill whatever gaps I feel like I might have in my day to day. I\u2019m a big fan of product management and business analytics courses because they directly influence the work I do at Indicina. Prodpad is a great resource for aspiring product partnership managers \u2014 they have a great blog and also offer online courses.\n\nWhat kind of skills are required for your role?\n\nPatience. Product partnership managers have to be extremely patient people. You are dealing with different personalities, clients, departments, and stakeholders. You are constantly coordinating moving parts so you cannot afford to lose your head.\n\nThen you need to know how to articulate your thoughts and translate technical requirements into plain language. You need to be able to make your future partners understand the problem you are trying to solve with your product. Eloquence sells products.\n\nFinally you need an ownership mentality. When you successfully own a product you motivate people to step out of their comfort zones. And you know what\u2019s true? Real magic happens outside your comfort zone.\n\nWhat are some of the challenges product partnership managers face on the job?\n\nThe pricing is never right; that is something that you need to understand. Your prospective partners will negotiate pricing and terms and you have to be prepared to handle that conversation.\n\nYou might also run into challenges where value is concerned. You must ensure that you and your partner are aligned in your definition of value. This way you are forging a mutually beneficial relationship that could last for a long time.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s talk about leadership. How do you motivate your team?\n\nI listen to understand and I lead a place from understanding. That means understanding our goals, KPIs, mission, and strategies. We are working together to achieve a common goal so if we are all on the same page, we can really make magic happen.\n\nI also try my best to communicate effectively with my team and direct line managers. I leave room to receive feedback from my peers and team members. You can\u2019t just talk at people or dump information on them \u2013 you have to be open to hearing their opinions.\n\nTransparency is absolutely essential as well. When I have all the information I need then I am motivated to work hard and punch above my weight.\n\nWhat do you think about the future of technology? What are you excited about?\n\nI\u2019m really excited to see more African founders playing around with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning models. AI and machine learning will help African countries digitize their databases and information centres. When you have access to verified consumer information and data, you can offer crucial financial services like credit, debt financing, mortgages, etc.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this edition of Centre Stage, please consider sharing it in your Whatsapp, Telegram, and LinkedIn groups.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "JULY 4, 2021\n\nThis newsletter is a weekly in-depth analysis of tech and innovation in Africa that will serve as a post-pandemic guide. Subscribe here to get it directly in your inbox every Sunday at 3 pm WAT. Hello, Hi everyone, it\u2019s Koromone. Africa\u2019s creator economy is booming and everyone \u2014 from investors to entrepreneurs to the creators themselves \u2014 are looking for ways to cash in, or cash out in the case of popular African comedians with epic followings. I won\u2019t go as far as to say that content creation is the new oil but there is something to be said for how platforms like TikTok, Instagram and Triller are providing hyper-creative African creators with the bells and whistles they need to entertain their fans and keep them glued to their phones like digital zombies. This edition of Next Wave will explore the current state of Africa\u2019s creator economy and speak into the future of video-creating and sharing platforms on the continent. PARTNER MESSAGE\n\nThe Flutterwave Mobile app, the app that turns any smartphone into a mobile POS is now redefining commerce. The Flutterwave Mobile App makes it super convenient for anyone to take their business with them anywhere, anytime. Learn how you can take your business anywhere, anytime here. Now, let\u2019s dive into the story. Entertaining Africans With the Twitter ban still waxing strong in Nigeria, popular skit makers like Oli Ekun, Koye \u201cK10\u201d and Switope (aka queen of impressions) are not losing their steam. These three are part of a new crop of talented comedians who have envious social wealth and are adding incredible value to Nigeria\u2019s creator economy.\n\nBeyond providing African creators with the tools they need to entertain their fans, video-sharing and creating platforms also connect influential creators to local and international brands who are willing to spend big bucks on customer acquisition and retention. Who else is impressed by the rise of Elsa Majimbo\u2019s success story? The well-loved Kenyan comedienne, who rose to fame after posting satirical monologues on Twitter, has hung out with Naomi Campbell, collaborated with Valentino, and posed on the cover of GQ South Africa. Boluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nIf you are African then you know how opposed African parents are to their children studying anything but science subjects. But the 2020 pandemic opened the floodgates of creative juices and it looks like gifted creators are finally getting the respect they deserve. Widening the creator\u2019s pool I first discovered Cameo after Feyikemi Abudu posted a video of Amir Arison (The Blacklist) shouting her out on camera. With Cameo anyone can hire a celebrity actor, athlete or musician to make a personalized shout-out video. Cameo gives its celebrity users the freedom to decline video requests that don\u2019t suit their tastes. While Cameo has a database of celebrities from mostly the US and Europe, the app hasn\u2019t onboarded any African celebrities. Imagine being able to pay Burna Boy or Yemi Alade to make a shout-out video for you or a loved one? In 2016, IrokoTV launched IrokoX \u2013 an online network designed to help indie (independent) creators hack monetisation and distribution. The platform has since gone quiet and all that is left is a paper trail of online press releases. But all hope isn\u2019t lost yet. Last week, Minly \u2013 an Egypt-based creator platform \u2013 announced that they raised $3.6 million in a seed round to enable stars in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) to create personalized videos for their fans. Like most startups with an eye for the creator economy, Minly launched late last year during the thick of the COVID pandemic. Since their entrance into the digital ecosystem, Minly has onboard over 50,000 users and have an impressive list of regional celebrities on their platforms. Now the question on my mind is: Will Minly expand to other countries on the continent or will we see African entrepreneurs build creator platforms to cater to their home country\u2019s entertainment needs? FROM THE CABAL TeamApt closes an undisclosed amount in its recently announced Series B round. According to the company\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Tosin Eniolorunda, they have their eyes set on Francophone Africa.

          "text": "For developers of luxury residential real estate, good times are underway as market dynamics have changed demand in that sub-market with growing investment interest coming from ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWIs).\n\nFrom student accommodation to residential care homes, investing in the places people call home is a growing phenomenon. Residential real estate investment is establishing itself as a global real estate asset class, according to this year\u2019s Attitudes Survey conducted by Knight Frank.\n\nBusinessDay findings show that, increasingly, the rich in society are realigning their priorities to spend more on real estate to provide their families a sense of security, health, safety, and privacy, meaning that work, socialising and entertainment now take place in their homes.\n\nRead Also: Residential real estate offers investment opportunities amid weak Q2\u201921 outlook\n\nThis is coming as an aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had significant lifestyle changes in work, home and play.\n\nThe survey shows 59 percent of respondents saying UHNWIs are becoming more interested in investing in purpose-built student accommodation (PBSA); 60 percent cited more interest in the private rented sector (PRS), and 60 percent in senior living.\n\nJames Mannix, head of Residential Investment and Development at Knight Frank, says, \u201cInvestors are looking for assets that provide an income in a world where interest rates and bond yields are low or negative.\n\n\u201cThis sector, where performance is tied to fundamentals such as education, rising employment and the ageing population, provides an investment linked to a demographic rather than an economic cycle.\u201d\n\nIn the Nigerian market, recent property transactions have shown an impressive turnout in the luxury segment. Currently, projects undergoing construction in the Ikoyi axis of Lagos are making progress to meet completion dates.\n\nThis is evidenced in a few recently completed luxury projects like Sisi Paris and 4 Bourdillon, which are nearing full occupancy. Others in the pipeline have already recorded half uptake and may achieve full occupancy upon completion.\n\nFrank Okosun, senior partner/CEO, Knight Frank Nigeria, says the future of luxury market remains bright, explaining, \u201cAs remote working becomes the norm, the need for large-sized houses will grow in demand, necessitating developers reviving previous designs.\n\n\u201cThe high-end luxury property market in Nigeria has, however, experienced a glut, with vacancy rate averaging 40 percent at highbrow locations in Lagos and Abuja. This is largely due to the general decline in purchasing power and the continued exit of expatriates from the country, especially in the wake of the pandemic.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is still demand from the country\u2019s upper class and political elites, which has kept the segment partially active. The high residential vacancy recorded in prime areas is largely attributed to the luxury segment, as supply continues to outstrip demand.\n\nBefore now, Nigeria had a very conducive climate for investment, which attracted expatriates, foreign investors into the country. These became major occupiers of luxury market in the country, but economic sentiment and unfavourable policies have largely affected that market in recent times.\n\n\u201cStricter government regulations have resulted in eliminating economic bottlenecks like money laundering. This has further led to a slow-down of luxury transactions, as more prospective buyers take a more cautious approach,\u201d Okosun notes.\n\nBut the current state and level of demand for smaller apartments have inspired developers to redesign luxury projects to meet current emphasis.\n\nObi Nwogugu, principal at African Capital Alliance (ACA), confirms to BusinessDay that demand level for smaller unit apartments is rising because, \u201cThat is what the market wants; as investors, we offer what the market demands.\u201d\n\nThe demand for smaller-unit luxury homes is such that, according to MKO Balogun, CEO, Global PFI, about 60 percent of people looking for homes to buy or rent in the property market presently are those looking for small units such as studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments.\n\nPart of the market dynamics that will drive demand for luxury real estate, especially for those that offer larger footprints and provide more amenities, are private outdoor space, touchless technology, numerous home offices, and health perks, including air and water filtration.\n\nIt is expected that buyer-demand will also be driven by lower interest rates, low inventory levels, new wealth from sectors that benefitted from the pandemic, a millennial population that is ready to find a safe haven, and significant increase in second home buying as well as upsizing and new properties offering higher wellness standards.\n\nFor investors with patient capital and appetite for off-shore markets, James Pullan, head of Student Property at Knight Frank, says London, UK, is a good destination. He notes that while new development has been constrained by planning considerations, the number of students coming to study in the capital continues to rise.\n\nThis, according Pullan, is creating opportunities for investors in PBSA. \u201cInvestment continues to flow into the London market, with established assets in great demand,\u201d he states.",

          "text": "Nigeria recorded 4,919 oil spills between 2015 to March 2021 and lost N4.5 trillion to oil theft in four years, Minister of environment, Dr Mohammad Abubakar said.\n\nAbubakar disclosed this at a Town Hall meeting in Abuja, organised by the Ministry of Information and Culture, on protecting oil and gas infrastructure.\n\n\u201cAccording to the National Oil Spill Detection Agency (NOSDRA) data, the total number of oil spills recorded from 2015 to March 2021 was 4,919, the number of oil spills cost by collation is 308.\n\n\u201cThe operational maintenance is 106, while sabotage is 3,628 and yet to be determined 70, giving the total number of oil spills on the environment to 235,206 barrels of oil. This is very colossal to the environment.\n\n\u201cNigeria also lost approximately N4.75 trillion on oil activities in the four years between 2015 and 2018, as estimated by the Nigeria Natural Resources Charter.\n\n\u201cSeveral statistics have emphasised Nigeria as the most notorious country in the world for oil spills, losing roughly 400,000 barrels per day.\n\n\u201cThe second country is followed by Mexico that has reported only 5,000 to 10,000 barrel only per day, thus a difference of about 3, 900 per cent.\n\n\u201cNow the environmental effect, which is the major concern of the ministry of environment, is in the loss of revenue.\n\n\u201cAttack on oil facilities has become the innovation that replaced agitations in the Niger Delta region against perceived poor governance and neglect of the area.\n\n\u201cThe impacts of vandalism of oil facilities have not only caused pollution of the environment, but had consequences on the local people, the national economy and security,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAbubakar added that the activities that come with oil exploration and exploitation had similarly caused alterations to the environment and some of its effects had either been reduced or prevented.\n\nThe minister added that adequate mitigation measures had been taken, including enforcement of relevant laws, regulations and guidelines, such as the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Act.\n\nHe said the EIA process ensured that measures were put in place to assist in the reduction of the negative effects and enhancement of the positive effects on the ecology, health and social wellbeing of communities in project areas.\n\n\u201cIt is in the light of this fact that over 1,300 oil and gas projects in Nigeria have been subjected to EIA process under the supervision of the ministry\u2019\u2019.\n\nAbubakar further added that the ministry held periodic interactive sessions with oil and gas operators, focused on the continued degradation of the environment, fatalities and loss of revenue, attributable to the regular and incessant vandalism of oil facilities, particularly pipelines.\n\nThe minister stressed that the effects of the destruction of oil and gas facilities had caused huge economic losses from pipelines to plant shut downs, as well as loss of biodiversity, habitat and ecological damage.\n\nIn addition, the destruction had also caused degradation of soil quality, which drastically reduces soil fertility, thereby, affecting crop yields and food security.\n\n\u201cAlso, increase in air pollution and the attendant climate change issues, public health impacts on affected communities, social impacts and loss of livelihood, supremacy among militants, casualties, among others,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nOil pipeline vandalism over the years had been one of the major factors contributing significantly to environmental degradation in the Niger Delta region, which accounts for about 70 to 80 per cent of our oil and gas sector that drives the economy, the minister noted.\n\nHe added that the country\u2019s oil and gas production accounts for a great deal of upstream and downstream industrial activities and production frontiers were increasingly moving into deep sea operations.\n\nSimilarly, the oil sector accounts for over 90 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s total foreign exchange earnings with the bulk of it coming from the numerous producing fields, located on the land, swamp and offshore environment of the Niger Delta region, Abubakar also noted.\n\nHe, therefore, recommended increasing awareness creation on the negative consequences of vandalism of oil facilities and other illegal activities.\n\nSuch awareness should also be accompanied by increased sustainable community development programmes for host oil communities, to include skills acquisition, provision of infrastructure and basic amenities, among others, by oil companies and relevant government agencies, Abubakar said.",

It\u2019s sad because if this were to be a United Nations operation or that of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), they\u2019ll drop you even if it\u2019s only high blood pressure that you have.\n\n\u201cBut now those that have health issues are here in the bush fighting. Were it to be an operation that they feel they\u2019ll make more and get other benefits, they\u2019ll deny them. This should not be the case but what are we going to do?

          "text": "Nobel Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, has urged Nigeria\u2019s federal government to apologise to Yoruba activist, Chief Sunday Adeyemo (Igboho), as it is not criminal or illegal for anyone to express intention to leave any federation.\n\nHe also condemned what he described as the \u201cbizarre\u201d midnight raid by the Department of State Services (DSS) on the Ibadan residence of the activist.\n\nSoyinka, who spoke during an interview with BBC News Pidgin on Monday, urged the government to stop pursuing the self-determination agitator.\n\nHe said: \u201cHow can you place the will for separation as a criminal act? That kind of language doesn\u2019t exist in the constitution; it doesn\u2019t exist in law. It does not exist in the catalogue of immoralities because it is not an immoral act or position to say that you want to stop being part of an entity or you want to join an entity.\u201d\n\nHe gave examples of people who left a federation or a union to form or join another state, including the Bakassi people of Southern Nigeria seceded to Cameroon.\n\nThe DSS had raided Igboho\u2019s Ibadan home last Thursday and arrested his associates. It also told journalists that it recovered weapons from his residence.\n\nSoyinka said: \u201cMore important for me is the position of the government, saying that the \u2018existence of these weapons\u2019 proved that he (Igboho) was planning war against the state. That position, a very loaded statement, was simply deliberate to conflate issues. It was to obscure the fact that Igboho and other people, myself included, have been decrying the loss of lives of law-abiding citizens, farmers especially all over the nation.\u201d\n\nSoyinka stated that a former Minister of Defence, Lt. Gen. Theophilus Danjuma (rtd), had told the people not to trust the military anymore but to trust themselves.\n\nHe said: \u201cSome other voices like governors have made similar statements. Now, Igboho, even if he had those weapons, he is claiming that his mission is to liberate his people from the tyranny of squatters, who now become violent overlords, and he has a good cause in that sense.\n\n\u201cTestimonies of farmers who have been brutalised, dehumanised by these squatters, who have acknowledged and identified themselves as Fulani, over decades of this anomalous kind of situation in which the people did not receive the necessary, mandatory and entitled defence and protection by the security forces, in which sometimes, it is the victims who\u2019ve been jailed, the recent case in Ibarapa for instance, is a personal testimony of those who were arrested and detained by the police simply for going to challenge those who were terrorising and raping their women.\n\n\u201cSo, now, you have a situation where the government is saying the \u2018existence of these weapons\u2019 means that Igboho is planning an armed insurrection against the state. The whole thing from beginning to the end just stinks: the raid, the motivation has become very implausible.\u201d\n\nSoyinka faulted the federal government for also not describing AK-47-wielding herdsmen as terrorists waging a violent insurrection against the Nigerian state.\n\nHe advised the federal government to stop pursuing Igboho as a criminal and also accused the government of acting in a criminal fashion against him.\n\n\u201cIf and when Igboho comes to trial, I guarantee you the government will be very embarrassed,\u201d he warned.\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan in Abuja",

          "text": "About 400,000 barrels of crude oil is lost daily to theft, according to data from the federal government.\n\nThe Minister of Environment, Mr. Mohammed Abubakar, at a town hall meeting on protecting oil and gas infrastructure, organised by the Ministry of Information and Culture on Monday in Abuja, said statistics had supported Nigeria as the most notorious nation in the world for oil theft.\n\nAlso at the event, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said about N60 billion was being spent yearly by the federal government to repair vandalised pipelines\n\nHe added that between January 2019 and September 2020, 1,161 pipeline points nationwide were vandalised.\n\nThe other panellists at the meeting were the Minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio, and Group Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr. Mele Kyari.\n\nAbubakar said Mexico, the second-worst affected country, only recorded between 5,000 and 10,000 barrels per day of stolen oil.\n\nThe minister also cited a report by Nigeria Natural Resources Charter, which estimated that approximately N4.75 trillion was lost by the country to oil theft between 2015 and 2018.\n\nAccording to him, the report equated the federal government to having lost approximately three per cent of its revenue to oil theft.\n\nHe considered sustained oil pipeline vandalism as one of the major problems that has contributed to environmental degradation in the Niger Delta.\n\nHe said the attack on oil facilities had become the innovation that replaced the agitation in the Niger Delta against the perceived poor governance and neglect of the region.\n\nAbubakar said: \u201cThe effect of vandalism of oil facilities has not only caused the nation loss of oil revenue, but the money that could have been used to develop education, health, housing and road, among others.\n\n\u201cCompanies have also lost huge revenue as a result of the vandalism of the Trans Niger Pipeline, Nembe Creek Trunk Line and Trans Forcados Pipeline.\n\n\u201cNigeria has lost approximately N4.75 trillion as in the four years between 2015- 2018 according to the estimates by the Nigeria Natural Resources Charter. This equates to the federal government having lost approximately three per cent of its revenue to oil theft.\n\n\u201cThe several statistics emphasised that Nigeria is the most notorious country in the world for oil theft lost roughly 400,000 barrels per day dwarfing the second country, Mexico reported only 5,000-10,000 barrels per day. This is a difference of 3,900 per cent.\u201d\n\nHe cited data from the National Oil Spillage Reduction Monitor Agency since 2015-2021 as putting the total number of spills recorded in the Niger Delta at 4,919, while the volume of oil spilled into the environment, as a result, was 235,206 barrels.\n\nHe proposed the use of unmanned drones, enhancing the role of the joint task force on security operations and prosecution of criminals as a deterrent as measures to enhance pipeline security in the Niger Delta.\n\nKyari, who represented the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, said since 2014, an average of about 38 million barrels of crude oil were deferred annually due to incessant pipeline vandalism, while in 2020 about $1.538 billion in revenue was deferred due to 94 incidents.\n\nHe added that from January-May 2021, the NNPC pipeline segments have suffered 203 breaks with system 2B having 80 pipeline breaks and System 2E, a total of 114 pipeline breaks and a total cumulative loss of 39 million litres amounting to N.59 billion.\n\nKyari stated that pipeline vandals and criminals operating along system 2B axis have stolen about 307,994 million litres of petrol valued at N41.049 billion.\n\nAkpabio raised a poser that if the federal government could be spending about N60 billion per year to fix pipelines, the imputation is that pipeline vandalism has become an industry.\n\nHe said though sometimes the youths were blamed for pipeline vandalism, they did not have the facilities to carry out offshore vandalism.\n\nHe fingered people who get the contracts for laying of the pipelines for vandalism in order to get part of the contract.\n\nOlawale Ajimotokan in Abuja",
