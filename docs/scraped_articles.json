          "text": "By Levinus Nwabughiogu\n\nThe House of Representatives, Thursday, called on the Nigerian Army, Police and other security agencies to enforce the proscription order, which declared the activities of bandits as acts of terrorism.\n\n\n\nCalling on the security agencies to stem incidences of killings of innocent persons across Benue communities, especially on the borders with Nasarawa State, the House also urged National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA, and Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs to send relief materials to victims and displaced persons in the affected areas.\n\n\n\nThe resolutions followed the consideration of a motion of urgent national importance sponsored by Bem Mzondu.\n\n\n\nMoving the motion, Mzondu emphasized the need to stop the renewed terrorist attacks and gruesome killings by armed herdsmen and bandits in Benue communities.\n\n\n\nHe recalled the attack and gruesome killings by herdsmen in Benue communities in Guma, Markudi and Gwer West Local Government Area of the state.\n\n\n\nThe lawmaker said in the early hours of Monday, March 7, 2022, the suspected herdsmen and bandits attacked a community, killing five persons while several others sustained injuries.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cThe official gazette that any person or group of persons participating in any manner whatsoever in any form of activities concerning or involving or concerning proscription collective intention or otherwise or group referred to in paragraph one of this notice, will be violating the provision of the Terrorism Provision Act of 2011 and liable to prosecution.\n\n\u201cThe provision of section 4(2b) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), guarantees that the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government, especially the Federal Government.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe motion was later adopted by the House.\n\nWearing of facemask\n\nIn a related development, the House at plenary, rejected a call by Olufemi Adebanjo, the member representing Alimosho federal constituency of Lagos State to stop wearing of facemask.\n\nRising under a point of privilege, Adebayo said the wearing of mask was affecting the respiratory system.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to inform the National Assembly, especially the House of Representatives, concerning the masking of our faces coming to the chamber. For the past two months, I have not heard of any case of COVID-19 in Nigeria or abroad.\n\n\n\n\u2018\u2019The masking privilege, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been a very painful one and the earlier we relax the rule that compulsorily ask members to wear mask the better.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you look around, you can see how many people that are wearing mask. It affects our respiratory system and our lungs. So there is no more COVID-19 in Nigeria, there is no more COVID-19 abroad. In fact, we should relax the rules, Mr. Speaker.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn his reaction, the Deputy Speaker, Idris Wase, who presided over the session, said members were mandated to obey the rules by the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control, NCDC.\n\n\n\nHe said: \u201cI want to advise, as legislators, we are supposed to be compliant with rules, the constitution, the Act and it is by the leave of the House that we have Nigerian Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, for regulating our affairs and conduct.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, it is not for the speaker to rule on the Act of the National Assembly. I want to beg that we should continue to comply with the regulation set for our country and the world. Your point of order is noted,\u201d he said.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

So, I advised my security team that we pull them out of the community so that we could pull them along and separate them from the inhabitants.\n\n\u201cThe bandits were equipped with PSA AK-P and much heavier calibre weapons than AK-47.

          "text": "A gathering of animal and conservation experts in Calabar, the Cross River State capital, has cautioned Nigerians against the further killing of bats for food as well as seeing them as animals used for witchery.\n\nThey spoke at a training for Nigerian and other West African post-graduate students in mammal research and biodiversity.\n\nSpeaking, the workshop coordinator, Iroro Tanshi, who is a lecturer at the University of Benin, said, \u201cThere is the persecution that bats are witches. They are not witches. They are just incorporated into folklores both locally and internationally.\n\n\u201cThey are like every other wild animal in the bush. Why bats and owls are thought to be witches is because they are active at night. What you don\u2019t know you can ascribe it to some extraterrestrial thing.\u201d\n\nTanshi said the importance of bats to man is much, saying that the ecosystem services provided by bats in Nigeria, for instance, include the production of dawadawa used for foods.\n\n\u201cThe flower that produces dawadawa are only fertilised for one night and about 80 percent of those flowers are pollinated by bats.\n\n\u201cSo, if bats don\u2019t visit the flower when it opens and is fertilised, you won\u2019t have dawadawa from that particular flower.\n\n\u201cSo a large amount of dawadawa used in meals come from bat pollination.\n\n\u201cAlso we have the trees of sheer butter, they are pollinated by bats.\n\n\u201cAs they are eating them, they spread them around the forest and the species regenerate. The bats work all through the night and we didn\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cBats should be applauded and respected every day because of their services to man.\u201d\n\nShe added that research is ongoing to adapt its skills and specialities to improve man\u2019s technology.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of researches on flights that follow what bats are doing. How do we improve flights for human beings? How do we make it easier for humans to fly? Bats are teaching scientists how to make better planes.\n\n\u201cSo, we really need to start approaching bats with respect because they are not witches but go about their business,\u201d she said.\n\nShe discouraged the consumption of bats as food, cautioning that such helps to deplete their numbers even as bush burning is equally impacting against the endangered animal.\n\n\u201cThere are 100 bat species in Nigeria, and these are being threatened with extinction by man\u2019s activities like killing them for food, deforestation and bush burning,\u201d she added.\n\nTanshi said that bats, like every other wild animal, have their physiology.\n\n\u201cThey also feel hot, and do fan themselves.

          "text": "By Sunday Ani\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo has again reiterated that it would gladden his heart to see a Southeasterner emerge as president of Nigeria after President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.\n\nObasanjo who has maintained that the time has come to bring total reconciliation to Nigeria by supporting a president of Southeast extraction to emerge in 2023, repeated the sermon yesterday when the founder of New Nigeria Group (NNG) and presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa, paid him a visit in his Abeokuta, Ogun State country home.\n\nThe former president said he also believes that there are a lot of things that Southeasterners can bring on the table. \u201cBeyond bringing unity to Nigeria or being the cement that holds the country together, I believe that Southeasterners can model hard work and entrepreneurship. That will help in wealth creation and fight against poverty, which is ravaging Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nHe told Ohuabunwa that running for the office of the president of Nigeria was a tough job but expressed happiness that he (Ohuabunwa) has endured up till date and said he was looking forward to the final realisation of his vision to see Nigeria fully united and restored to a country that all Nigerians would be proud to call theirs.\n\nFielding questions from journalists after the meeting, Ohuabunwa encouraged the people of the south, particularly the southeasterners to aspire to the office of the president because that is what has been done in the past to maintain the unity of the country. \u201cWe had southern and northern protectorates, which came together to form Nigeria and since then, our founding fathers had always wanted to maintain peace by ensuring that there is rotation and that we share things. That is why the federal character principle is in the country\u2019s constitution. We are a nation of diverse ethnicities and geographies, and the only way we can maintain proper peace is to ensure that everybody is treated fairly, and rotation and power sharing are some of the methods of ensuring inclusiveness and making sure that Nigerians feel that they are part of it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted that Southeasterners had made great contributions to Nigeria, starting from the days of Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, and reminding them that they are not strangers neither are they just appendages. \u201cWhen it comes to political rights, we need to assert our rights and provide that leadership that Nigeria is lacking, and I hope that in 2023, God will offer us that opportunity and Nigerians will come behind us to take Nigeria to become the first world nation,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said his ambition is to make Nigeria a first world nation; a globally competitive nation and a nation that works like the other countries, which Nigerians admire. \u201cMost importantly, I want a nation that works for all and creates job for the young people of Nigeria to exercise their creativity and innovation; not a nation of poor, corrupt, jobless people or that of terrorists and bandits. That does not describe us; we are going to change the narrative,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that Obasanjo as a president, showed the highest level of not only detribalization but also fairness and equity as he didn\u2019t discriminate. \u201cHe believes in equity but also in merit because he took good people; I mean people like Ngozi Okonjo Iweala, the Chukwuma Soludo and the rest of them worked for him and that is what he represents. He wants Nigeria to work,\u201d he added.\n\nHe described the former president as a phenomenon and conscience of the country. \u201cHe is the conscience of this nation and we must admit it. He speaks his mind. He is not an angel and he can\u2019t be perfect, but I have never seen a man as bold, audacious, and also, with a heart of humanity as Obasanjo.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood.

          "text": "By Chinelo Obogo\n\nGovernor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State said the All Progressives Congress (APC) has been rescued from the vice grip of \u2018Yahoo Yahoo\u2019 governors following the removal of Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State as chairman of the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\nHe alleged that some \u201cYahoo Yahoo governors\u201d had backed Buni to circumvent the will of party members but noted that \u201ctrue\u201d APC governors were determined to see the party \u201cthrough these patchy parts at all cost.\u201d\n\nBecome a partner with USA companies, promote their offers and get paid in US Dollars weekly, Nigerians are earning about $465 weekly. Click here to see how you too can get paid .\n\nSalihu Lukman, former director-general of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), had alleged that Buni was working with \u201cYahoo Yahoo\u201d politicians to stop the party\u2019s convention. However, the Yobe governor was sacked as national caretaker committee of the APC over alleged plot to scuttle the party\u2019s convention fixed for March 26 and replaced with Niger Governor, Abubakar Sani Bello.\n\nIn a statement, yesterday, Akeredolu said the setting up of the CECPC was a necessity and meant to instill discipline in leadership but that the path taken lately by Governor Buni and an indivisible few was an \u2018unenviable trajectory\u2019 undeserving the party and a disdainful narrative.\n\nHe said the party survived a civilian coup largely inspired by mischief and incurable lust for power through artificial barricades but President Muhammadu Buhari salvaged the party from internal scavengers.\n\n\u201cThe installation of the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the APC was beyond a call to service. It was a child of necessity moulded to one, instill discipline in leadership and engender coherence among stakeholders and more importantly, to deepen the Rule of Law in our party.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cHowever, the insidious and appalling happenings within our party in the last few months, especially under the immediate-past leadership clearly posit a huge embarrassment. Without necessarily dwelling on details that are known to critical stakeholders, the path taken lately by Governor Mai Mala Buni, the immediate past head of the CECPC and an indivisible few, is an unenviable trajectory undeserving of our dear party. It is a disdainful narrative.\n\nSmall Manhood & P.E 7days Solution... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the courage and determination as well as shrewd sincerity of purpose demonstrated by most of the APC Governors remain a delight. Significantly, the swift response and prompt action taken by President Muhammadu Buhari, has salvaged our great party from internal scavengers. We indeed, survived a civilian coup largely inspired by mischief and incurable lust for power through artificial barricades,\u201d he said.\n\nAkeredolu said he and other APC governors were in support of Governor Bello dared governors who reportedly threatened to leave the party if Buni was removed to fulfil their threat.\n\n\u201c\u2026.Progressive Governors in the true name are determined to see our party through these patchy parts at all cost.\n\n\u201cNone of the scanty number has the guts to carry out their imaginary threats as reported in sponsored stories. We dare them to leave the party. Their short-lived antics in arm twisting Governor Buni and probably, some pocket filling elements within the corridors of power to supplant the president\u2019s will through fake letters, endorsements as well as \u2018Black Market\u2019 injunction (procured since November, 2021) are despicable.\n\n\u201cNow that the clear motive aimed at frustrating our national convention has been botched, our party is on the track to greatness. Gov. Bello has the backing of the majority of us and he shall see our full backing come Thursday, March 17, 2022 at the National Executive Committee meeting,\u201d Akeredolu said.",

          "text": "\n\n*Low crude production volume, oil theft also major factors *Minister of Finance laments widening budget deficit, says subsidy a huge problem *Experts: Petrol subsidy unsustainable, road to bankruptcy, identify local refining as ultimate solution *NLC: Over 74% of petrol subsidy comprises insurance, freight charges, levies\n\n*Jet fuel hits N670 per litre as NNPC promises to intervene *We may shutdown aviation sector soon, NCAA warns\n\nEmmanuel Addeh, Udora Orizu in Abuja; Chinedu Eze, Nume Ekeghe and Dike Onwuamaeze in Lagos\n\nAs oil prices soar to record levels, many Nigerians, ordinarily, would expect that their country would be raking in billions of dollars and realising accretion in external reserves, as was the case in the past, especially during the Gulf War and some other international emergencies. Unfortunately, this is not the case.\n\n\n\nCrude oil price hit $139 per barrel on Monday, but Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, said recently that the country would be comfortable with the price range of between $70 and $80 per barrel.\n\nAnalysts say the reason for this odd wish is the country\u2019s huge fuel subsidy payment and its complete dependence on imported petrol to meet domestic consumption.\n\n\n\nIn addition, there is the problem of waning investment in the oil sector as well as massive oil theft that has gone unabated in the last few years and drastically reduced Nigeria\u2019s crude oil export, leading to inability to meet the country\u2019s OPEC quota. These factors have combined to ensure that the country does not benefit from the current soaring crude oil prices, buoyed by the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n\n\nFor instance, in terms of rig growth, Nigeria\u2019s count had fallen from 11 in September to nine in October 2021, according to data released by OPEC. This got worse after Nigeria began shutting down many of its offshore platforms as oil prices took a downward slope and the producers\u2019 group embarked on production curbs to stabilise the market.\n\n\n\nHistoric rig count figures earlier obtained by THISDAY showed that in May 2020, the country\u2019s producing oil rigs fell from 16 to eight and two months later, in July, it fell further to six.\n\nIn January 2021, only six rigs produced while in February, it was seven; in March, it fell to six again, while in April 2021, total rig count was just five.\n\n\n\nIn the oil industry, the rig count is a major index for measuring activities in the upstream sector.\n\nRecently, a THISDAY review showed that Nigeria was producing far less oil than it did 25 years ago when the estimated population was lesser than what it is today and government spending was far below what it is in 2022.\n\nA comparison of the country\u2019s average oil production per day in 1997, as indicated in the NNPC yearly statistical bulletin, showed that while Nigeria pumped 2.344 million barrels per day, plus condensates, over two and a half decades ago, it can hardly produce 1.4 million as of this year.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, while 26 rigs were in operation, on both onshore and offshore terrains, in 1997, Nigeria as at January this year had just about 12 active oilrigs, with about half of them not in use.\n\n\n\nTo underscore the gravity of the problem, just yesterday, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, lamented that the rise in crude oil price had further widened the country\u2019s budget deficit.\n\nBrent crude price stood at $112.43 a barrel yesterday, while the US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 63 cents to $109.33 a barrel.\n\n\n\nConcerned by the scarcity and high cost of aviation fuel, which has exacerbated flight delays and cancellations in the aviation sector, Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mr Mele Kyari, yesterday assured Nigerians that the company would work with relevant authorities to ensure that the current crisis in the aviation sector was resolved. Aviation fuel, which presently sells for N670 per litre, far higher than the N190 per litre sold about a month ago, is also imported 100 per cent.\n\n\n\nHowever, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) yesterday faulted the claim by the federal government that it would spend N3 trillion on petrol subsidy this year. NLC described the claim as bogus, unreal, insisting that the real government subsidy component in petrol consumed in Nigeria was N19 per litre.\n\n\n\nBut President Muhammadu Buhari recently requested the National Assembly to approve a total of N2.557 trillion for the federal government to fund fuel subsidy in 2022 after the current administration suspended its plan to remove the monthly under-recovery. This may be exceeded with the skyrocketing international crude prices.\n\n\n\nThe lack of funding for major upstream infrastructure has ensured incessant breakdown of existing assets. This has led to the highest single-month crude oil loss in a long time, as a result of disruptions due to maintenance and declaration of force majeure at the Forcados terminal and others in January.\n\n\n\nCountry Director of World Bank, Shubham Chaudhuri, recently said Nigeria\u2019s decision to postpone the full deregulation of the downstream sector of the petroleum industry by 18 months might cost the country over N4 trillion in subsidy payments on petrol in 2022. Chaudhuri argued that for a purely economic phenomenon, Nigeria was not meant to make a political decision, adding that the decision to defer the subsidy removal will cost the country in fiscal terms.\n\n\n\nIt is estimated that with the current surging price of crude oil, Nigeria could be paying as high as N300 as subsidy per litre of petrol supplied at the pumps.\n\n\n\nNNPC Limited recently disclosed that it spent N173.488 billion in excess of the budgeted N36.893 billion on petrol subsidy in January.\n\n\n\nA document detailing the company\u2019s presentation before the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) showed that instead of the projected under-recovery for the month, NNPC paid N210.382 billion for the purpose. During the month, NNPC had also failed to make any contribution to the Federation Account, although its forecast payment for January topped N122.7 billion.\n\n\n\nTo underscore the severity of the problem, in 2021, NNPC recorded a whopping deficit of approximately N2 trillion out of its projected N2.511 trillion remittances and was unable to pay roughly 80 per cent of its contribution to the Federation Account for the year.\n\nRising Crude Oil Price Has Widened Budget Deficit, Ahmed Laments\n\nMinister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, stressed that rising crude oil prices had widened the country\u2019s budget deficit. Ahmed pointed out that the federal government was presently in the process of amending the budget to accommodate fuel subsidy.\n\n\n\nThe minister spoke yesterday at the 10th African Fiscal Forum titled, \u201cThe Political Economy of Fiscal Reforms,\u201d organised virtually by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\n\n\nShe said, \u201cWe are cleaning up our subsidies; we had a setback as we were to remove subsidy by July this year, but there was a lot of pushbacks. We have elections coming and also because of the hardship that companies and citizens faced due to the COVID and we were told that the timing was not right, so we pulled back.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut we have been able to quietly implement subsidy in the electricity sector and as it is, as we speak, we don\u2019t have subsidies in the electricity sector.\n\n\n\n\u201cFuel subsidy is a huge problem for us. It has thrown up our deficit much higher than we planned. What is happening to the global oil prices is also going to, perhaps, worsen matters. But the current review we are doing is to say we will hold the subsidy at the level in which it is planned.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking on how much global prices would affect subsidy payment, Ahmed said, \u201cWe are currently doing a budgetary amendment to accommodate the incremental subsidy as a result of the reversed decision and we want to cap it at that.\n\n\n\n\u201cHopefully, the parliament will agree with us and also at least contain the subsidies; otherwise, the way things are going now, we will not be able to predict where the deficit will be as a result of the fluctuation in the global markets.\u201d\n\n\n\nCommenting on increased revenue generation recorded by the country, she explained, \u201cWe have also enhanced our budget process. Three years ago, we had no government enterprise on the national budget, just the government itself. We started with 10, three years ago.\n\n\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, we brought in 40 and now we have all the government-owned enterprises, which is about 61 agencies, in the national budget. So, we are able to see the whole of the revenue and the whole of the expenditure.\n\n\u201cThis is enhanced also by automation in terms of the public financial management. As a result of that, we have been able to see the need to refine our fiscal laws.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have seen revenue from government-owned enterprises increase by 100 per cent within a 12-month period just by being able to pull everything together, put monitoring mechanisms, and being able to track and also put regulations and laws in the finance bill that caps the expenditure to revenue ratio of these government enterprises to 50 per cent. \u201cSo, we saw our revenue double and we are seeing the potential revenue from these enterprises again doubling in this current year as we speak.\u201d\n\nNLC: Over 74% of Petrol Subsidy Comprises Insurance, Freight Charges, Levies\n\nNLC faulted a claim by the federal government that it would spend N3 trillion on petrol subsidy, describing it as bogus and unreal. The congress insisted that the real government subsidy component in petrol consumed in Nigeria was N19 per litre.\n\n\n\nIt alleged that over 74 per cent of what the federal government purported as subsidy comprised of insurance, freight charges, and levies imposed by government agencies, such as the Nigerian Port Authority (NPA), the Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), and the defunct Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR).\n\n\n\nPresident of NLC, Mr. Ayuba Wabba, said these during the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG) webinar on \u201cImpact Assessment of the 2021 Finance Act.\u201d\n\n\n\nWabba, who was represented by the Head, Research Department, NLC, Dr. Onoho\u2019Omhen Ebhohimhen, stated that NLC was not averse to privatisation of the country\u2019s moribund refineries as long as it would follow the Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) model.\n\n\n\nThe NLC president said, \u201cFor the purpose of clarity, what our government propagates as fuel subsidy does not fit into the logic, theory or the practice of subsidy. Subsidy, in macroeconomic theory, is provided to companies to help reduce production cost so that products can be passed on at lower cost in order to encourage consumption.\n\n\u201cWhat obtains in Nigeria about PMS are oligopolistic practices by agencies of the government of our country.\u201d\n\nNLC disclosed that Nigeria imported petrol largely from North West Europe.\n\n\n\nIt identified other components of the petrol price as insurance on vessels that bring in the product and insurance on the goods in transit, as well as the freight charges.\n\n\n\nWabba stated, \u201cThese three items I have mentioned are about 74 per cent of the petrol prices in our country. This is from government data that it spent 74 per cent on cost, insurance and freight of imported PMS.\n\n\u201cWhen the oil tanker comes into Nigeria it does not dock in our ports. It stays in the high sea while smaller vessels, called barges, are hired to offload the products from the ship to the storage facilities.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe pay the tank farm owners for the storage. We pay the NPA, NIMASA, and DPR for market regulation. We pay NNPC for the cost of finance on the basis of opportunity cost model.\n\n\u201cAll these are costs that are passed over to the consumers. But if you consider all these charges, you can then ask: where is the subsidy?\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat government calls subsidy is the landing cost of PMS, which comprised insurance, freight and local levies, taxes and its administrative charges. That is what they talk about as subsidy.\n\n\u201cIf they are the subsidy, it means that the Nigerian government and Nigerian people are subsidising foreign countries and foreign businesses. That is not subsidy.\u201d\n\n\n\nNLC said the real subsidy component was about N19 a litre of petrol, made up of the bridging cost, retailers margin, and transport cost to different parts of the country.\n\n\n\nThe labour union leader said, \u201cWe pay transporters, we pay retailers margin, and we pay bridging cost. This may be considered as subsidies. But why are they there? We must understand their implications before we remove them. One fundamental implication is that the cost of production will go up.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you remove these subsidy elements, a manufacturer in Kano will not be able to compete with the one in Lagos. It will compound the uneven industrialisation we have in our country. If that is what the government wants to do, they should be honest and come forward to say so.\u201d\n\n\n\nWabba believed the best solution to the fuel crisis is local refining of the product.\n\n\u201cLet us refine our products locally,\u201d he stated, adding, \u201cWarri and Kaduna refineries were established as refinery and petrochemical companies. But the petrochemical segment is dead because we are exporting our crude oil.\n\n\u201cNigeria has experience in the construction and management of refineries. Buhari signed two agreements in 1977 to construct the Warri and Kaduna refineries. Warri was delivered in the middle of 1979. So, nobody can tell us that it is impossible to build refinery in two years. We have done it before. So, what has changed? Is it our capacity or vision that is lower now? Or has our government become different now?\n\n\n\n\u201cWe as a labour congress are agreeable and committed to the privatisation of government\u2019s refineries. But we give only one condition: let us prioritise based on a model that has worked for our country.\n\n\n\n\u201cLate Ernest Shonekan sorted the problem with NLNG within three months that his administration lasted in 1993. He ceded Nigeria\u2019s interest in the NLNG to the private sector that have 51 per cent. Since then the NLNG has functioned well.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have said let us try that model in the refineries, but government drags its feet. Government is unwilling to do that.\u201d\n\nPetrol Subsidy Unsustainable, Road to Bankruptcy, Experts Insist\n\nEconomic experts and opinion leaders in the private sector said the current reliance on importation of refined petroleum products and subsidy on the pump price of petrol (PMS) had become clearly unsustainable and could plunge the country into bankruptcy.\n\nThey pointed out that Nigeria could only sustain the current subsidised consumption of petrol at a high cost of public borrowing.\n\n\n\nThey advised the government to accelerate domestic production of crude oil to enable the country satisfy its OPEC quota and earn more foreign currency to build its foreign reserves.\n\nEconomist and Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), Dr. Muda Yusuf, told THISDAY yesterday that subsidy was clearly no longer sustainable with the current development in the crude oil market, unless the intention was to plunge the nation into bankruptcy.\n\n\n\nYusuf projected that the subsidy budget might climb up to N5 trillion, while the expected revenue of the federal government is about N10 trillion, out of which N4 trillion would be devoted to debt servicing.\n\nYusuf said, \u201cWe are faced with a situation where the combination of debt service and subsidy payments would consume the entire revenue. Yet we have to fund personnel cost, overhead expenditure and capital projects. Where will the money come from?\n\n\n\n\u201cAre we going to depend on borrowing to fund these major line items? Are we going to continue to print money to fill these financing gaps, with the profound inflationary effects?\n\n\u201cWe have some difficult choices to make if we must save the country from bankruptcy. And we need to do so very quickly.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need to quickly revisit the conversation on the liberalisation of the downstream oil sector. We need to urgently create a private sector window for the supply of petroleum products. Clearly, NNPC cannot do this alone.\u201d\n\nFormer Professor of Economics, University of Benin, and Chairman, Goldmark Education Academy, Professor Mike Idi Obadan, told THISDAY yesterday that the issue of sustainability of subsidy on refined imported petroleum products would continue to elicit more concerns under this circumstance as oil prices rise.\n\n\n\nObadan, who is also a non-executive director of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and a member of the Monetary Policy Committee said, \u201cSubsidy payment may become unsustainable, except it has to be financed with more borrowing, which in itself the country should be wary of. The opportunity cost of increased subsidy payments is on the high side. However, if the government is able to do the needful to step up crude oil export, it will minimise the negative impact on the economy of increased subsidy payment implied by rising crude oil prices\n\n\u201cIf Nigeria were to be able to raise oil production and export to take advantage of the rising crude oil prices, the undesired impact of the subsidy payments would have been mitigated. But this tends not to be so.\n\n\n\n\u201cFinally, there is need to fast-track the repairs of the public refineries to provide a basis for deregulation of fuel prices and, hence, elimination of subsidies.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn this same direction, whatever support that could be given by the government to the Dangote refinery to fast-track its debut in the refined petroleum products market should be considered. All these actions will result in the early stoppage of fuel subsidy payments while the earmarked resources are freed for commitment to other sectors of the economy.\u201d\n\n\n\nProfessor of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Uyo, Professor Akpan Ekpo, said the issue of sustainability of oil subsidy was a problem created by the government. Ekpo told THISDAY yesterday that the removal of fuel subsidies could only be initiated properly and effectively after the domestic refineries were made to work. He said it did not make economic sense for a country to export crude petroleum and import refined products.\n\n\n\nEkpo said, \u201cWhy are the refineries not working? First things first, get the refineries working so that Nigerians can be sure of refined products. Thereafter revisit the subsidy issue cautiously.\n\n\n\n\u201cOnce the domestic supply is guaranteed, then subsidy can be phased out while providing succour to the poor through a kind of targeted subsidy. But let us not forget that most of what we call subsidy is corruption.\u201d\n\nHe noted that there would be structural inflation once the subsidy was removed, and more untold hardship for Nigerians.\n\n\n\nPresident of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Michael Olawale-Cole, who spoke to THISDAY, recently, stressed the need for the government to get the refineries working again.\n\n\n\nOlawale-Cole said, \u201cThe answer to all these problems is to ensure that we are adding value to our crude oil here and stop depending on imported refined products. That is the solution and it can be met by government showing commitment to ensure that our existing refineries are maintained and made to work.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is agonising that we are producing crude and exporting them abroad for refining and later import them at prices that we cannot afford. Naturally, this is going to affect inflation and add to the suffering of the people.\u201d\n\nThe Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) said the organisation supported subsidy removal. But he said certain measures must be put in place before it could be implemented.\n\n\n\nPublic Relations Officer of IPMAN, Chief Chinedu Ukadike, stated that for the sector to work optimally, it should be deregulated. However, Ukadike stressed that in-country refining must be achieved while pipelines should be fixed.\n\nHe stated that the current practice of going cap in hand when there was need to allow the forces of demand and supply take effect was not helping the sector.\n\n\n\nUkadike stated, \u201cAs it is now, we are not making any margin because it is regulated. Even when it is expensive, our margin remains N9.70. It has not moved. We do not want a regulated system.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut local refineries, pipelines must be put to work. Government should encourage the establishment of modular refineries. We should be able to purchase products directly from our refineries.\n\n\u201cIf the pipelines are good, you won\u2019t see many trucks on the road, bridging gap will not be there. If the trains work, pipelines work, these issues may reduce.\u201d\n\n\n\nNational President, Nigerian Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO), Mr. Yusuf Othman, stressed that in a deregulated downstream sector, stakeholders would not need government consent before taking economic decisions.\n\n\n\nOthman explained that when the forces of demand and supply were allowed to take firm root, the sector would flourish, because freight rate, for instance, will ordinarily increase with cost of transport across the country. \u201cSo I can tell you that we will do better under a deregulated system,\u201d he said.\n\nNNPC Promises End to Aviation Fuel Crisis, Says Price Reduction to N200 Per Litre Not Feasible\n\nGroup Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mr. Mele Kyari, yesterday assured Nigerians that the company would work with relevant authorities to ensure that the present crisis in the aviation sector was resolved.\n\n\n\nThat was as Director General of Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Musa Shuaibu Nuhu, warned that the aviation industry might soon be shutdown, saying with the current jet fuel scarcity, it is not safe to fly anymore.\n\nKyari gave the assurance while addressing the leadership of the House of Representatives, who were investigating the sudden scarcity and high cost of aviation fuel.\n\n\n\nAt the meeting well attended by members of the House Committees on Petroleum Downstream and Upstream, Jet A1 marketers, and airline operators, the NNPC GMD regretted the late intervention, saying all the supply data showed there was sufficient Aviation Turbine Kerosene (ATK) in the country.\n\nGiven the current situation, Kyari advised airline operators to have the right commercial arrangement with their support petroleum products, particularly ATK.\n\n\n\nKyari said, \u201cWhy we didn\u2019t act was that all the supply data we have showed sufficient ATK in the country. This means that it may be in the wrong hands. There\u2019s frenzy in the market today, no one knows what the price will be tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s still not an excuse for escalation of prices, we will work with the relevant authority to ensure that if there\u2019s any such thing, we will deal with it jointly as an industry. We will work together to ensure that this is resolved.\u201d\n\nAddressing the demand by airline operators and lawmakers that the fuel price should be reduced to at least N200 per litre, Kyari said it was not feasible, as they had no control over it. He said the price was determined internationally price.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible; today the landing cost of ATK is N480, the price, we have no control on that.\u201d\n\nResponding to concerns raised by the lawmakers regarding the crisis in the energy sector, despite the passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), the NNPC GMD said PIA passage was not a mistake. He said the company would work with other stakeholders to ensure gaps in the sector are closed.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhenever there\u2019s supply gap it is our role to ensure that supply gap is closed, we will work with the authority and other stakeholders to ensure that if there\u2019s any gap that\u2019s existing we fill it,\u201d Kyari added\n\nIn his presentation, Director General, Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Musa Shuaibu Nuhu, warned that they might shutdown aviation industry soon as it\u2019s not safe to fly anymore.\n\n\n\nNuhu said, \u201cOver the last couple of weeks we have seen a significant rise in the cost of aviation fuel. One year ago it was selling at N190 per litre and as of this afternoon it has gone for N670 per litre, what this has done is that it has increased the cost of operations.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a significant safety concern to us, if airlines cannot have enough financial margin to comply with all the mandatory requirement then we really have to look at, God forbid I don\u2019t want to come before this committee to explain why something happened.\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery day it increases. I won\u2019t be surprised tomorrow if it sells for N700 per litre. Considering the ticket price now, the airline industry cannot survive. The option is we shutdown, because they cannot generate enough revenues to operate safely.\u201d\n\n\n\nEarlier, Chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyema, who spoke on behalf of the airline operators appealed to NNPC to ensure that in the coming days, the price of aviation fuel dropped to N200 per litre.\n\nOnyema said, \u201cThat\u2019s the only time we will be able to operate safely and ensure some running of the schedule operations in this country. I don\u2019t know how they will do it but they should, it will be good because even at N200 it\u2019s a lot for the airlines. Not N400 or any other higher price, as we are talking now it will soon hit N700 and possibly N1000.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened in the last two weeks is alarming. From a price of N190 per litre two weeks ago, the price is now N670 as at today and we don\u2019t know what it is going to happen.\n\n\u201cThe government has done so much for us in this industry with the president granting us waivers. We held a meeting and decided to shut down our operations because of the cost of operation. We are owing so much money and we don\u2019t want AMCON to come after us.\u201d\n\n\n\nOnyema added, \u201cWe cannot survive like this for another three days. We had to reduce our operations to 30 per cent because the product is not even available. So, I am surprised that the Executive Director said they have supplies to last 34 days. We are making so much sacrifice here.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am evacuating Nigerians from Poland and I had to pay three times the usual amount and I am not asking for a refund. So, something needs to be done and done fast.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn his part, Executive Director, Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), Ogbugo Ukoha, noted the role of the agency in regulating the industry, and issuing licenses to importers of the product. Ukoha said from his records, there was enough aviation fuel to last the country for 34 days. He also said that aviation fuel was one of the petroleum products that had been fully deregulated and was, therefore, controlled by market forces, adding that the authority has issued licenses to about 28 companies to import the product into the country.\n\n\n\nBut his explanation did not go down well with Deputy Speaker, Hon. Idris Wase, and other lawmakers.\n\nWase questioned why there should be scarcity of the product if there was enough supply to last for 34 days, alleging that there must be a cartel working hard to sabotage the efforts of the government.\n\n\n\nFormer CEO of Aero Contractors, Captain Ado Sanusi, told THISDAY on Wednesday that due to the scarcity and high cost of aviation fuel, fuel marketers now gave airlines new conditions for selling the product.\n\nThe marketers insisted that airlines must pay before the product was supplied to them, an aberration in an industry globally known for payment after purchase of the product.\n\n\n\nSanusi said, \u201cYou pay for fuel in advance, which is not done in the aviation industry. It will make operations very difficult and lead to more delays and cancellations. You cannot deposit money before you buy fuel.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf nothing is done urgently, this may lead to the beginning of airlines going down because they cannot continue operating like this. The federal government should urgently look for solution to the problem.\u201d\n\nSanusi said government must intervene by doing away with the middlemen, but allowing marketers to import the product and sell directly to the airlines.\n\n\n\nHe said, \u201cThese middle men don\u2019t understand aviation. The marketers are part of the industry whose operations are approved by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). Ideally, the airlines can buy from the marketers who will issue them invoice and they pay in 24 to 48 hours.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the way it is done. You cannot even deposit money with the marketers because if you do, they may not even have the product at the time you want it because of uncertainty and volatility in the supply of the product. If care is not taken, Nigerian airlines may go down.\u201d\n\n\n\nTHISDAY also spoke with Managing Director of Clean Serve Energy Limited, Chris Ndulue, who explained the challenge the aviation fuel marketers were facing.\n\n\n\nNdulue stated, \u201cThere are three basic things: the cost of crude oil in the international market and the price of the dollar. We have failed to refine fuel locally, so we have to import. The price of crude oil has been rising and the price of dollar has been rising. Supply of the product has been facing disruptions because there is war in Europe. There is scarcity because people have not been producing, so price is rising. We need to start producing refined product here.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe price of diesel has risen, that it is over N600. We need to refine crude oil here so that we end these disruptions and high prices,\u201d Ndulue said.\n\n\n\nTHISDAY findings show that airlines spend huge operating fund on purchase of aviation fuel. A Boeing 737 Classic, for instance, consumes about 2, 300 -2, 500 litres of aviation fuel for one-hour flight. Airbus A320-200 consumes about 3, 125 litres of aviation fuel or 2,500kg per hour.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Fayemi: We Use Security Votes to Fund Police, Military, Civil Defence, Buy Ammunitions, Vehicles",
          "text": "\n\n*Explains why governors are against local government autonomy\n\nChuks Okocha in Abuja\n\nGovernor of Ekiti State and Chairman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF), Dr. Kayode Fayemi yesterday defended governors\u2019 spending of security votes, saying the fund was being utilised to fund the police, military, civil defence and other security outfits in the country.\n\n\n\nFayemi also gave reasons why state governors were against local government autonomy.\n\nHe said these during a panel discussion on the overview of security situation across the states at a two-day multi-stakeholders meeting on Peace and Inclusive Security Initiative organised by the NGF in partnership with the Center for Democracy & Development (CDD).\n\n\n\nSpeaking on what state governors do with security votes, the chairman of the NGF said: \u201cThere is hardly any of these institutions we speak that you are talking about that we don\u2019t fund. We fund the police and we fund the police more than the federal government, quote me.\n\n\n\n\u201cState governors fund police more than the federal government. We buy them vehicles and we pay them allowances. In some cases, we even buy ammunitions, of course under the same federal system.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd if we are to engage our military in aid to civil authority, which you will find, actually in 36 states in this country today, the military is involved in internal security operations, which really is a problem. Now, when you inflate the role of the security institution beyond its primary responsibility, you also have consequences that will come with that. That may not be palatable. But that\u2019s where we are, because most Nigerians don\u2019t trust the police.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey will still come and beg governor, \u2018Governor, please, can you ask the brigade commander to put a roadblock in my area.\u2019 And this, right from the bottom up you are talking about, ordinary citizens insist that we should fund and you can\u2019t put military roadblocks everywhere,\u201d he explained to the cheering of the crowd.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Ekiti State governor pointed out that the National Police Council does not operate maximally as the National Judicial Council, explaining that so far, the Police Council only meet to approve the appointment of the Inspector General of Police, already appointed by the President.\n\n\n\nOn governors\u2019 funding of the military, he said: \u201cBut if you engage the military in a civil authority, your state is only responsible if you are to pay for the number of men engaged.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve taken them out of their primary responsibility, you have to pay for it. So, we pay for that, we pay for civil defense, there is no security institution that you have that states are not responsible for more than the federal government that has primary responsibility for them.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the imperatives of state police, the Ekiti state governor said it was a constitutional issue.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis is a perennial excuse that we get. I\u2019m not going to sit here and make an excuse that such powers in the hands of some local actors may not be abused. The federal police that we all know abuses the rights of citizens, including the rights of governors, even with immunity, you may not know that. I was abused by a federal police in 2014, during my election and I had immunity.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnybody could be abused. It could happen, even if you devolve security to the local level. However, what we need to be talking about is what institutional frameworks should we put in place to ensure that such powers are not abused, not to use it as an excuse not to do the right thing. Because at the end of the day, there are mechanisms in our constitution to protect citizens\u2019 rights.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking further, Fayemi said: \u201cIn relation to the police, we have a body in the Constitution, a statutory body known as the National Police Council. The National Police Council is presided over by the president as chairman and he has over 36 governors as members. Unfortunately, unlike the National Judicial Council, that is very effective in meting out punishments, sanctions, promotions, appointments for judicial officers across the length and breadth of the country, the National Police Council has only succeeded since the 1999 constitution to ratify appointment of Inspector General of Police.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are only summoned to National Police Council and this is a constitutional body by the way, check your constitution you find it there. It only meets when a new or acting Inspector General of Police is to be confirmed and ratified.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat meeting is summoned and it meets for 10 or 30 minutes and then we look at the CV of the acting IG, and we approve. You\u2019re not expected to disapprove anyway; the president has already appointed him. But that body actually has powers beyond that,\u201d he explained. .\n\n\n\nThe Ekiti State Governor noted that in most countries where there are multi-level policing, there is a regulatory authority that is responsible for punishment and for sanctioning those who go beyond their own responsibilities.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what we should be talking about. Rather than talking about the possibility of abuse, there would always be possibility of abuse; we can\u2019t run away from that. But do we have effective policing now that is federal?\n\n\u201cI said multi-level policing; which means local police, state police and federal police and arguing for multi-level policing does not suggest that we want the federal police to go because there are federal crimes.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are also crimes that are within the borders of our states in accordance with the statute that\u2019s been promulgated or enacted by our local state assemblies. And there are also crimes that are local, because they are local jurisdictions by local governments.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you have not paid tenement rate, the local police should deal with you, it shouldn\u2019t be state police, because tenement rate is the responsibility of the local authority, not the responsibility of the state. So that\u2019s my take on that,\u201d the governor explained.\n\n\n\nFayemi said he has no objection to local authority playing a role in local security.\n\n\u201cBut the debate about local government autonomy is a totally different debate. The principle of federalism is very clear about federating unit. Local government as a federating unit is a unique innovation in Nigeria. I don\u2019t see it in any research work, in any book on federalism. Local government autonomy is the business of the state, because the state is the federating unit.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, those who are clamoring for local government autonomy, it is a populist demand and is very exciting to talk about it. But I don\u2019t think ultimately it serves the purpose that they want it to serve because we have capacity challenges at that level just as we have at the state level. But the result is what matters,\u201d Fayemi said.\n\n\n\nCommenting on State Independent Electoral Commission (SIEC), he said: \u201cAgain, it\u2019s a popular discussion, but I will tell you it is a surreptitious way of undermining Nigeria\u2019s federalism.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn his comments, the Deputy Governor of Plateau State, Sonni Tyoden, traced the crisis in Jos to ownership struggle between the Birom and the Hausa Fulani, saying it was gradually being addressed.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\n\n*Worried about state of APC, Bello, Malami, others meet president in London this weekend *Akeredolu: No black market court order can stop party convention *Dismisses Buni\u2019s action as disdainful, embarrassing *Memo reveals Yobe gov handed over to Bello before traveling\n\nEmmanuel Addeh, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Fidelis David in Akure\n\nFormer Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to allow him continue as the chairman of the committee until after the national convention of the party which holds in the next two weeks, THISDAY gathered yesterday.\n\n\n\nEssentially, it was learnt that Buni has reached out to Buhari to forgive him of any perceived wrongdoing and allow him to return and conclude the convention in order to forestall any form of legal interpretation of his dramatic removal.\n\n\n\nIn addition, some of the Yobe State governor\u2019s supporters who are mainly first term governors have also pleaded with Buhari to allow the CECPC chairman to finish his assignment, hand over to the new executive that would be constituted at the national convention and go away. They reason that allowing Buni to conduct the convention which is just two weeks away rather than create unnecessary problems and all sorts of legal complications.\n\nAccording to his supporters, this option is far less complicated than if he doesn\u2019t resign and then resorting to legal challenge of his removal. It is however not certain how disposed the president is to Buni and his supporters\u2019 plea.\n\nHowever, apparently worried by some of the developments in the ruling APC, some governors and other stakeholders of the party, who are concerned about the state of the party, are jetting out to meet with Buhari in London this weekend, to clarify issues and put closure to the lingering leadership drama.\n\n\n\nThis is as the Ondo State Governor and Chairman of the South-west Governors\u2019 Forum, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), yesterday, vowed that no black market court order procured against the party\u2019s national convention would prevent the exercise from holding.\n\n\n\nAkeredolu, who did not hide his disdain for Buni\u2019s style of leadership of the CECPC, described his actions as both disdainful and embarrassing.\n\nBut while the fireworks appear not ceasing anytime soon, a leaked memo written by Buni, has revealed that he actually handed over the leadership of the party to the current acting chairman and Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Bello, before embarking on medical treatment.\n\n\n\nHowever, disturbed about how things have turned out in the party, especially the way the coup that ousted Buni was executed, some of the aggrieved governors, have established the need to see the president in person and address some of the grey areas.\n\n\n\nThis, a source among the governors claimed, had become imperative because everything that was done was achieved because they dropped the name of the president all the way, even when there was no communication to that effect to the best of their knowledge.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important we see the president to seek closure to this whole drama and we are seeing him this weekend. They made up too many stories just so their plan works, especially, a deliberate effort to demonise Buni, which is not true,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThe source, who hinted that things would become clearer by Monday, explained that, \u201cSome people went to go and say certain things to the president, which made him angry and reacted immediately. The truth of the matter is that certain things the president said are not implementable.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut what really angered the president is the court thing, because they made him believe Buni knew about it, but that is not true. There is no record for the injunction and yet, no one is even taking ownership of the court injunction.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, the governors are going to see Buhari this weekend in London and that includes the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami; the acting chairman, Bello and some other stakeholders. The issues must be understood properly and a closure brought to be,\u201d the sources explained.\n\n\n\nBut Akeredolu, while singling out Buni and those he characterised as pocket-filling black legs in the corridors of power, for allegedly trying to supplant President Buhari\u2019s will, claimed that the APC did not deserve the kind of antics Yobe governor subjected it to.\n\n\n\n\u201cHowever, the insidious and appalling happenings within our party in the last few months, especially, under the immediate-past leadership clearly posit a huge embarrassment.\n\n\u201cWithout necessarily dwelling on details that are known to critical stakeholders, the path taken lately by Governor Mai Mala Buni, the immediate past head of the CECPC and an indivisible few, is an unenviable trajectory undeserving of our dear party. It is a disdainful narrative,\u201d Akeredolu said in a statement.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, he stated that the courage and determination as well as shrewd sincerity of purpose demonstrated by most of the APC governors remained a delight and should be commended.\n\nThe governor said the swift response and prompt action taken by the president had, in no small measures, salvaged the party from \u201cinternal scavengers\u201d.\n\n\n\nHe insisted that the APC indeed survived a civilian coup largely inspired by people he said were mischievous and had incurable lust for power through artificial barricades.\n\nThe Ondo governor explained that aside feeling very delighted as a major stakeholder in the latest \u201csuccessful rescue mission,\u201d his confidence in the ability and capacity of the new party chair, Bello, remained unflinching.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe, the governors are for the party, except for the few \u2018yahoo, yahoo\u2019 governors (apologies to Salihu, former DG of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum), who were hand in glove with Buni to circumvent the will of majority of our party (APC) members.\n\n\n\n\u201cProgressive governors in the true name, mostly all of us, are determined to see our party through these patchy parts at all cost. None of the scanty number has the guts to carry out their imaginary threats as reported in sponsored stories.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe dare them to leave the party. Their short-lived antics in arm-twisting Buni and probably, some pocket-filling elements within the corridors of power to supplant the president\u2019s will through fake letters, endorsements as well as \u2018black market\u2019 injunction (procured since November, 2021) are despicable,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHe recalled that the moments of the struggle as compatriots from all walks of life enunciated and had berthed Nigeria\u2019s most ingeniously successful political network, the APC, adding that without being immodest, APC\u2019s birth was a novel instance as the party\u2019s philosophical beacon woven around its ideological leaning was alluring.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, the firm leadership, candour and honesty exemplified by Mr President, who heads the administration that is the product of the APC, deserve no less of support and complimentary responsibilities from all stakeholders,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the installation of CECPC of the APC was beyond a call to service, but was a child of necessity moulded to, one, instill discipline in leadership and engender coherence among stakeholders and more importantly, deepen the rule of law in the party.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow that the clear motive aimed at frustrating our national convention has been botched, our dear party is on the track to greatness. Governor Sanni Bello, carry on; you have the backing of the majority of us.\n\n\u201cYou shall see our full backing come Thursday, 17th March, 2022, at the National Executive Committee meeting. But as you know, this is only for the conduct of the national convention,\u201d Akeredolu concluded.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Buni had in the leaked letter to Bello, informed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) that he would be embarking on a medical trip to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and that he would assume his duty as the party chairman as soon as he returned from Dubai.\n\n\n\nThe letter read: \u201cThis is to please inform you that I will be embarking on a medical trip to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from today, 28th February, 2022. I will resume office upon my discharge from the hospital.\n\n\u201cIn my absence, I hereby transmit the functions of my office as the National Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) to you.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is to enable the committee conclude all arrangements leading to the National Convention slated for March 26th, 2022 and other duties that may be required of the office.\n\n\u201cI invite all members to cooperate with Governor Abubakar Sani Bello, by extending to him all the support that I have enjoyed from you.

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria has stopped the payment of $418 million to Linas International Ltd, a company belonging to Prince Ned Nwoko, a former House of Representatives member and other consultants over the Paris Club refund.\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters had reported how President Muhammadu Buhari re-approved the payment of the controversial millions of dollars in Paris Club refund to some creditors after being manipulated by the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami.\n\nNed Nwoko\n\nDocuments seen by SaharaReporters had shown that the Debt Management Office (DMO) on September 27, 2021, issued 10 promissory notes valued at $4,783,192.00 each to the creditors.\n\n\n\nThey were asked to submit the original promissory notes to the CBN for dematerialisation.\n\nOne of those who stand to gain if the money is paid is Nwoko. The businessman is laying claim to $142,028,941 via a consent judgment he obtained from the Federal High Court in Abuja in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/148/2017.\n\nA firm, Panic Alert Security System Limited, owned by George Uboh, is also laying claim to $47,831,920.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria by this Promissory Note, which is governed by the Laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, hereby unconditionally and irrevocable promises to pay to the order of: PANIC ALERT SECURITY SYSTEM LIMITED, the sum of four million, seven hundred and eighty-three thousand, one hundred and ninety-two dollars only on the 15th day of October 2022 (\u201cMaturity Date\u201d).\n\n\n\n\u201cThis Promissory Note is backed by the full faith and credit of the Federal Government of Nigeria and charged upon the general assets of Nigeria. The Promissory Note also qualifies as an Instrument for Tax Exemption in line with the Tax Waivers approved for Bonds and Short-Term Federal Government of Nigeria Securities.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis Promissory Note qualifies as a Liquid Asset for liquidity ratio calculation for banks. This Promissory Note is negotiable and transferable, subject to the submission of this original Note to the Central Bank of Nigeria. Holders are also required to submit this original Promissory Note to the Central Bank of Nigeria for dematerialization. In any case, this Promissory Note must be submitted to the Central Bank of Nigeria for payment at least two (2) working days before the Maturity Date,\u201d one of the documents read.\n\n\n\nHowever, the apex bank in a letter to some banks said the promissory notes \u201care not admissible or registrable on the scrip-less securities settlement system.\u201d\n\n\n\nA letter dated November 19, 2021, signed by CBN\u2019s Director of Banking Service, Josephine Ajala and addressed to one of the financial institutions, Keystone Bank, read, \u201cWe are in receipt of two letters dated November 17, 2021, from your office, requesting for dematerialization of various FGN promissory notes for Prince Orji Nwafor-Orizu totalling $1,219,440:00 and Barrister Olaitan Bello totalling $215,195:00.\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease be informed that we are unable to accede to your request because currently, Foreign Currency Denominated Promissory Notes are not admissible or registrable on the scrip-less securities settlement system (54) and as such, only Promissory Notes issued in Naira are registered and dematerialized on 54.\u201d\n\n\n\nBackground\n\nSaharaReporters had in a series of reports exposed wide-ranging legitimacy issues, including non-execution of agreed contracts and backdoor deals raised against the indebtedness from various quarters.\n\n\n\nOne of the beneficiaries is Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards, who was indicted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\n\n\nDocuments seen by SaharaReporters showed that Edwards did not represent the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) as claimed.\n\n\n\nA letter dated August 1, 2018, by former EFCC Chairman, Ibrahim Magu, to the Ministry of Justice/Attorney General Office, indicted him of an attempt to defraud the Nigerian government.\n\n\n\nIt said, \u201cThe suspects had filed applications in court to be joined as one of the judgement creditors during the garnishee proceedings and the applications were refused by the Federal High Court. The judge in a ruling delivered on the 27th of June 2016 frowned on Dr Ted Edward for brandishing a judgment purportedly delivered by the Federal Capital Territory on 30th October, 2015 and in fact, took a swipe at it.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy the Motion Ex parte filed on the 30th of March, 2015, the judgement creditors applied for a Garnishee Order Nisi which was granted on 1st April, 2015 and fixed the return date for 16th April for the Garnishee to show cause why the Order Nisi should not be made absolute.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Honorable Judge in his ruling stated unequivocally that let me state right away that the substantive matter was commenced by me until I entered judgement on the 3rd of December, 2013. I have searched my records up to the date I entered judgement. I could not find the name of Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards as representing the judgement creditors even for one day nor did I find any process filed by his law firm. How then was that judgement prosecuted?\n\n\n\n\u201cAnother point to highlight is the fact that according to the purported letter of engagement being bandied by Dr Ted Edwards, he was engaged on September 15, 2011, long before the matter was filed in court quoting the exact judgment sum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat this throws up is the fact that the said letter of engagement was done after 3rd December, 2013 and backdated to make it look as if the suspect had been engaged before the case started. There is no evidence to prove that the suspect did any work in relation to the recovery process.\n\n\n\n\u201cA careful look at the memorandum of settlement Dr Ted Iseghohi Edwards and Hon Odunayo Ategbero betrays the conspiracy and an attempt to defraud the Federal Government by the suspects.\n\n\n\n\u201cPending Actions; Invitation and/or Arrest of the suspect, Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards with a view of confronting him with all the issues raised in the evaluation above. Tracing and filing interim forfeiture order on any property or asset acquired with proceeds of fraud by Dr. Ted Iseghahi Edwards.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that despite the report, Malami persuaded Buhari to approve $159 million as legal fees to Edward.\n\n\n\nThey also directed the DMO and the Ministry of Finance to release the promissory notes to Edwards and others so that they could take their shares, a source had said.\n\n\n\n\u201cEdward was the Secretary-General of ALGON when the Paris Club refund case FHC/ABJ/CS/130/2013 was done by Joe Agi (SAN) and his colleagues before Justice Ademola. It is clear that he was not the lawyer to ALGON and this much ALGON has said in writing to Malami and the Chief of Staff, Gambari,\u201d the source had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe EFCC in its report to Malami and (Ibrahim) Gambari also established that Ted Edwards did not represent ALGON and that Ted Edward in his own handwriting admitted that Joe Agi was the lead counsel for ALGON. He went to one Judge, Baba Yusuf and procured a judgement that he was the lawyer to ALGON in the Paris Club refund case.\n\n\n\n\u201cYet, Malami who knows this is recommending that Ted Edwards be paid $159,000,000 as fees from ALGON instead of the actual lawyer. Will this not amount to double payment whenever Mr Joe Agi demands to be paid? From my investigation, Mr Joe Agi, ALGON and the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum have all gone back to court to challenge the payment of the $418 million including that of Edward through promissory notes.\n\n\n\n\u201cShould Malami not take a second look at the suit and see if really there is any fraud as being widely alleged? Instead, he and the Chief of Staff tricked the President and subsequently directed the Debt Management Office and the Finance Office to release the promissory notes to Edward and others so that they can take their shares.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe total sum of $418 million promissory note suggested by Malami to be paid is just a tip of the iceberg of what is coming unless he is stopped. Nigeria will become bankrupt before President Buhari leaves office. The anti-corruption war of Buhari has been effectively clipped by Malami and Gambari using their powerful offices to trick the President who really trusted them.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll (that is) needed to be done is to allow independent people to go through the whole cases concocted on the advice of Malami and the truth will be seen and Nigeria saved of all these massive stealing.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy is Malami not challenging any of these court judgements? If I may ask; in most of all these claims, the EFCC had investigated, taken statements and established that none of the contracts was executed. The report was submitted to Malami and former Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun by Magu-led EFCC suggested the arrest and interrogation of Ted Edward and one Prince Nicolas Ukachukwu but he and Gambari suppressed the report.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe same man suggested to be arrested is who Malami said should be given $159,000,000. ALGON had written several letters to him and (Kayode) Fayemi, who is the Chairman of Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum that all the jobs executed by Edwards and others were fake, not executed. Yet Malami in the face of this clear case of fraud tricked the President in a memo and said judgement was given against them.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe also negotiated the debt to 50 percent and convinced the President to pay to avoid more damages. It\u2019s high time President Buhari save his anti-corruption war by causing a thorough investigation of his appointees involved in this massive fraud.\u201d\n\n\n\nOthers who stand to benefit if the money is paid include Ned Nwoko, who is laying claim to $142,028,941 via a consent judgment he obtained from the Federal High Court in Abuja in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/148/2017.\n\n\n\nThree beneficiaries laying claim to $143,463,577.76 via a judgment of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court in the suit marked FCT/HC/CV/2129/2014 are: Riok Nigeria Ltd, Orji Nwafor Orizu, and Olaitan Bello.\n\n\n\nFrom the total money, Riok Nigeria Limited has a share of $142,028,941.95 (about 54 billion), Mr Nwafor is entitled to $1,219,440.45 and Mr Bello has a share of $215,159.36.\n\n\n\nA firm, Panic Alert Security System Limited, owned by George Uboh, is also laying claim to $47,831,920 based on another \u201cconsent judgment\u201d it obtained in suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/123/2018, which was filed as recently as 2018.",

There is no evidence to prove that the suspect did any work in relation to the recovery process.\n\n\n\n\u201cA careful look at the memorandum of settlement Dr Ted Iseghohi Edwards and Hon Odunayo Ategbero betrays the conspiracy and an attempt to defraud the Federal Government by the suspects.\n\n\n\n\u201cPending Actions; Invitation and/or Arrest of the suspect, Dr Ted Iseghahi Edwards with a view of confronting him with all the issues raised in the evaluation above. Tracing and filing interim forfeiture order on any property or asset acquired with proceeds of fraud by Dr. Ted Iseghahi Edwards.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that despite the report, Malami persuaded Buhari to approve $159 million as legal fees to Edward.\n\n\n\nThey also directed the DMO and the Ministry of Finance to release the promissory notes to Edwards and others so that they could take their shares, a source had said.\n\n\n\n\u201cEdward was the Secretary-General of ALGON when the Paris Club refund case FHC/ABJ/CS/130/2013 was done by Joe Agi (SAN) and his colleagues before Justice Ademola. It is clear that he was not the lawyer to ALGON and this much ALGON has said in writing to Malami and the Chief of Staff, Gambari,\u201d the source had told SaharaReporters.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe EFCC in its report to Malami and (Ibrahim) Gambari also established that Ted Edwards did not represent ALGON and that Ted Edward in his own handwriting admitted that Joe Agi was the lead counsel for ALGON. He went to one Judge, Baba Yusuf and procured a judgement that he was the lawyer to ALGON in the Paris Club refund case.\n\n\n\n\u201cYet, Malami who knows this is recommending that Ted Edwards be paid $159,000,000 as fees from ALGON instead of the actual lawyer. Will this not amount to double payment whenever Mr Joe Agi demands to be paid? From my investigation, Mr Joe Agi, ALGON and the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum have all gone back to court to challenge the payment of the $418 million including that of Edward through promissory notes.\n\n\n\n\u201cShould Malami not take a second look at the suit and see if really there is any fraud as being widely alleged? Instead, he and the Chief of Staff tricked the President and subsequently directed the Debt Management Office and the Finance Office to release the promissory notes to Edward and others so that they can take their shares.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe total sum of $418 million promissory note suggested by Malami to be paid is just a tip of the iceberg of what is coming unless he is stopped. Nigeria will become bankrupt before President Buhari leaves office. The anti-corruption war of Buhari has been effectively clipped by Malami and Gambari using their powerful offices to trick the President who really trusted them.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll (that is) needed to be done is to allow independent people to go through the whole cases concocted on the advice of Malami and the truth will be seen and Nigeria saved of all these massive stealing.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhy is Malami not challenging any of these court judgements? If I may ask; in most of all these claims, the EFCC had investigated, taken statements and established that none of the contracts was executed. The report was submitted to Malami and former Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun by Magu-led EFCC suggested the arrest and interrogation of Ted Edward and one Prince Nicolas Ukachukwu but he and Gambari suppressed the report.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe same man suggested to be arrested is who Malami said should be given $159,000,000. ALGON had written several letters to him and (Kayode) Fayemi, who is the Chairman of Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum that all the jobs executed by Edwards and others were fake, not executed. Yet Malami in the face of this clear case of fraud tricked the President in a memo and said judgement was given against them.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe also negotiated the debt to 50 percent and convinced the President to pay to avoid more damages. It\u2019s high time President Buhari save his anti-corruption war by causing a thorough investigation of his appointees involved in this massive fraud.\u201d\n\n\n\nOthers who stand to benefit if the money is paid include Ned Nwoko, who is laying claim to $142,028,941 via a consent judgment he obtained from the Federal High Court in Abuja in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/148/2017.\n\n\n\nThree beneficiaries laying claim to $143,463,577.76 via a judgment of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court in the suit marked FCT/HC/CV/2129/2014 are: Riok Nigeria Ltd, Orji Nwafor Orizu, and Olaitan Bello.\n\n\n\nFrom the total money, Riok Nigeria Limited has a share of $142,028,941.95 (about 54 billion), Mr Nwafor is entitled to $1,219,440.45 and Mr Bello has a share of $215,159.36.\n\n\n\nA firm, Panic Alert Security System Limited, owned by George Uboh, is also laying claim to $47,831,920 based on another \u201cconsent judgment\u201d it obtained in suit number FHC/ABJ/CS/123/2018, which was filed as recently as 2018.",
          "summary": "Ned NwokoDocuments seen by SaharaReporters had shown that the Debt Management Office (DMO) on September 27, 2021, issued 10 promissory notes valued at $4,783,192.00 each to the creditors.\nThey were asked to submit the original promissory notes to the CBN for dematerialisation.\n\u201cThis Promissory Note qualifies as a Liquid Asset for liquidity ratio calculation for banks.\nThis Promissory Note is negotiable and transferable, subject to the submission of this original Note to the Central Bank of Nigeria.\nHolders are also required to submit this original Promissory Note to the Central Bank of Nigeria for dematerialization.",

He refused to adopt the statement he made to FBI in court.\n\nVincenzo Armanna, a former ENI manager who is also on trial, told the same court that, in fact, Adoke threatened to arrest and prosecute ENI officials for negotiating kickbacks.\n\nBut Nigeria is pressing ahead with claims against JP Morgan in the UK, alleging \u201ca corrupt and fraudulent scheme\u201d and accusing the bank of being negligent in effecting payments to Malabu Oil & Gas Ltd, the original owners of OPL 245 who sold the oil block to Shell and Eni via a deal brokered by FRN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNigeria is asking for $1.7bn as compensation from JP Morgan, but the bank has told the UK Court that Nigeria has suffered no loss as a result of transactions.\n\nResponding to the allegations before the court, JP Morgan said it was only carrying out instructions given by Goodluck Jonathan, the Nigerian president at the time.\n\nThe bank explained further that \u201cwhile [Nigeria] still seems to maintain its case as regards President Jonathan, it has now accepted (as was always obvious) that \u2018it is impossible to demonstrate conclusively that President Jonathan benefitted from the OPL 245 transaction\u2019\u201d.\n\nCiting proceedings from Nigerian courts, JP Morgan said on April 13, 2018, \u201cthe Nigerian Federal High Court granted declarations to the effect that Mr Adoke could not be held personally liable in respect of the payments to Malabu (and the giving of instructions to JPMC to make them) because he was merely carrying out the lawful directives and approvals of the President\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018No evidence that Adoke took bribes\u2019\n\nThe bank said for the claimant to make a case, it must prove that \u201cMr Adoke caused the Resolution Agreements to be concluded and the payment instructions to be issued; and that he did so in exchange for bribes\u201d.\n\nIt went on to say that the conclusion of the agreements was a substantial piece of government business which involved dozens of ministers and officials who are not alleged to have done anything wrong, hence Adoke was not personally responsible for the agreement.\n\nSpeaking to the allegations of bribery against Adoke, the bank said Nigeria\u2019s case \u201ccontains no particulars at all of any agreement or understanding pursuant to which he is alleged to have taken, or agreed to take, bribes\u201d.\n\nJP Morgan said \u201cthere is, in fact, a wealth of evidence which is inconsistent with the argument\u201d that Nigeria is making that Adoke brokered the agreement to assist Dan Etete as part of a conspiracy in exchange for bribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe bank concluded that all that Nigerian side has provided \u201cis plainly insufficient to justify a finding that Mr Adoke was involved in any fraudulent and corrupt scheme\u201d.\n\n\u2018No evidence of fraud\u2019\n\nThe bank, through its lawyers, said Nigeria has made very serious allegations of fraud and corruption and has the responsibility of proving its claims with cogent evidence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe FRN bears the burden of proving the facts on which its claim depends,\u201d the bank said, adding that \u201cwhen pleading fraud, full and specific details of the allegation must be clearly set out.\n\n\u201cAs to the evidence required to prove such allegations, the standard of proof is the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probabilities. However, the more serious an allegation, the more convincing is the evidence required to prove it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt further argued that \u201cthe courts have repeatedly emphasised that cogent evidence is required to justify a finding of fraud or other discreditable conduct\u201d but Nigeria \u201chas no direct evidence in support of its case that there was a fraudulent and corrupt scheme as alleged\u201d.\n\nIt noted that the Nigerian side has also refused to call forth any witnesses before the court, and has not \u201cprovided any proper explanation of its failure to do so\u201d.\n\nThe defendant said: \u201cNo court \u2013 civil or criminal \u2013 in any jurisdiction has ever found that there was a fraudulent and corrupt scheme as now alleged.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, the Italian criminal proceedings \u2013 in which the defendants included many of the alleged participants in the scheme, including Mr Etete, Shell, Eni, and various current or former employees of Shell and Eni \u2013 resulted in all of the accused being acquitted of all.\n\n\u201cWhen criminal proceedings were launched against Mr Adoke in 2016 in Nigeria, he was successful in obtaining an order from the Federal High Court declaring that his involvement in the negotiation, execution and implementation of the Resolution Agreements \u201cwas in furtherance of the lawful directives/approvals of the President in the exercise of his executive powers\u201d and that he could not therefore be held personally liable in respect of the same. As noted above, some of the major participants in the alleged scheme, such as former President Jonathan and former Attorney-General (Bayo) Ojo, have never been charged with any crime.\n\n\u201cDespite the fact that the FRN accuses Shell and Eni of participating in the alleged fraudulent and corrupt scheme, the FGN has never taken any steps to revoke the grant of OPL 245 to SNEPCO and NAE, or to rescind the Block 245 Resolution Agreement pursuant to which the grant was made. It has also advanced arguments in multiple proceedings, including before this Court, which either rely on, or are predicated on the validity of, the Resolution Agreements.\u201d\n\nEvidence shows Adoke\u2019s move was official\n\nAccording to JP Morgan, Nigeria claimed the resolution agreements were concluded pursuant to a \u201cfurther\u201d fraudulent and corrupt scheme, creating the impression that the agreements and the payments were somehow secretive.\n\nNigeria seems to be advancing a position that the resolution was a result of a clandestine arrangement involving only the small number of people now alleged to have accepted or agreed to accept bribes.\n\nThe bank argues that the evidence proves that the instruction received from Adoke, a senior minister and most senior law officer in the Nigerian government at the time was as a result of a well scrutinised federal policy.\n\nCiting a detailed record kept by Jonah Otunla, the accountant-general of the federation at the time, JP Morgan said the negotiation took place over several months and involved meeting between Shell, Eni, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Justice, Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), and Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nAs a result of the many meetings, Adoke wrote to the DPR to comment on the draft resolution which came out of those meetings. The bank said it is also on record that Adoke wrote to the managing director of NNPC \u201cto nominate a technical expert, legal adviser, and corporate secretary to participate in the negotiations regarding OPL 245\u201d.\n\nThe evidence also shows that on February 3, 2011, Adoke told Eni and Shell that \u201cwithout the endorsement of NNPC, or at least agreement with them on the terms of the Resolution Agreement, he is ready to disengage with the negotiation\u201d and put the block out for tender.\n\nJP Morgan made it clear that \u201con a number of occasions the Attorney-General sent detailed, formal letters to President Jonathan explaining the terms of the proposed settlements and seeking his approval, which was subsequently provided\u201d.\n\nThe bank said \u201cthese would be odd letters to have exchanged if they were co-conspirators in a fraudulent scheme\u201d.",

          "title": "How Helium Health assembled a star founding team",
          "text": "Finding co-founders and hiring employees in the early days of a startup is integral to its survival and growth. Nigerian healthtech startup, Helium Health, navigated this challenge in its early days by putting together a team of first employees that got the job done.\n\nHelium Health was co-founded by Adegoke Olubisi, Dimeji Sofowora, and Tito Ovia in 2016 to use technology to provide better healthcare services for Africans. Today, it optimises medical records by storing them electronically; and provides a payment system and healthcare financing solution for clinics, and a telemedicine feature. In 2020, Helium Health raised $10 million in Series A funding to expand its offering across African countries. Last November, it expanded to the MENA region when it acquired a Qatar-headquartered and UAE-based doctor booking platform, Meddy.\n\nTo understand the role having a star team plays in a startup\u2019s early days, Daniel Adeyemi, Senior Reporter at TechCabal, spoke with Tito Ovia, co\u2013founder and current Head of Public Sector Growth at Helium Health, on the fifth episode of Building From Ground Up, Season 2, by the UK-Nigeria Tech Hub.\n\nOvia was named a Forbes 30 under 30 recipient and a winner of the Future Africa Award for Disruption for her work on African healthcare through Helium Health. When Ovia is not fixing healthcare in Africa, she is occupied with the Feminist Coalition, a globally-acclaimed women\u2019s rights advocacy group promoting equality for women in the Nigerian society with a core focus on education, financial freedom, and representation in public office.\n\nFinding co-founders\n\nOvia\u2019s childhood dream was to provide healthcare services across Africa, but that dream did not materialise until she quit her job at the Lagos State AIDS Control Agency. Ovia, at the time, was trying to figure out what to do next in the healthcare space. She also wanted to leave the country. A friend of hers, who attended law school with her co-founder, Demiji, told her about a small group of people trying to build a tech and healthcare company, but none of the co-founders were in the healthcare space. The friend advised Ovia to have a talk with them because they needed directions and would need the help of someone like her.\n\nSo, Ovia met with Goke and Dimeji for the first time for a chat intended to last an hour but stretched to 7 hours. During the conversation, it was clear that they were all connected by a similar drive and interest. \u201cWe connected on a deeper level of wanting to be able to provide value and fix our country,\u201d Ovia said.\n\nConvincing your first set of customers\n\nOvia said that it was challenging to convince people, that they knew what they were doing. When they tried to get their first 10\u201315 customers, they were required to present other people that could vouch for them.\n\nOvia said that another challenge Helium Health faced in its early days was identifying the strength of each of its team members and only assigning related tasks to them. \u201cIf you are a small team of 5, everybody does everything. It was a scramble, and all hands were on deck to get things done.\u201d\n\nWhen Ovia was asked about how she managed conflict and managing relationships with her co-founders, she explained that she likes good conflict and doesn\u2019t see it as a horrible thing because it means that \u201cnobody is a sheep\u2014it means everybody is thinking and invested in the growth of the organisation\u201d. \u201d\n\nShe sees conflict as a pitch: \u201cIf you can\u2019t convince co-founders on a particular direction, how do you want to convince the outside world, your investors, and board?\u201d\n\nOvia also noted that she and her co-founders take management and leadership courses and have mediators who step in during their conflicts. She also revealed they have advisors and neutral parties who are invested in the growth of the company and provide their opinions on important issues.\n\nWhat makes good co-founders?\n\nOvia believes trust is one of the things that makes a good co-founder. \u201cI have to be able to close my eyes and believe that you are not going to throw me off a cliff.\u201d This should be coupled with openness, she noted.\n\nOvia believes it is important that co-founders be at the right place in their lives. \u201cWhat this means is that, if you decide to be a high growth startup, everybody must have the time and bandwidth to build it,\u201d she said. This is because she explained, personal responsibilities might stop some people from committing to such gruelling work. \u201cSometimes, you have a co-founder slacking because they have other priorities in their life.\u201d\n\nShe also believes co-founders must have similar values. \u201cEverybody has to be able to align on how and where they want to end up.\u201d Ovia doesn\u2019t believe there is an ideal number of co-founders but also does not believe in gathering people just for the sake of it.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t believe that every entrepreneur needs a co-founder. Although, she believes every founder needs a strong executive team: a chief financial officer (CFO), chief operating officer (COO), and chief technical officer (CTO) \u201cThis is because, if anything goes wrong, the strong executive team that you\u2019ve built can do the heavy lifting.\u201d\n\nThis is important, she explains because building in a startup\u2019s early days is a lonely process. \u201cThere are so many trials and tribulations that we\u2019ve gone through at Helium Health that I\u2019m so grateful I\u2019ve had co-founders to cry to when it feels like everything is over.\u201d\n\nOvia recalled that in Helium Health\u2019s early days, they couldn\u2019t even afford to schedule a meeting with the kind of talent that they have now. \u201cThen, it was just an idea, a couple of hospitals, and we were not sure if we would make it past the year.\u201d So, Helium Health had to forgo talent and opt for talent that were fresh out of the university and had a few years\u2019 of experience.\n\n\u201cWe targeted dreamers, people who are committed to the idea and who believe that someday the startup would be big. We sold the promise of a tomorrow to our early staff. Some people didn\u2019t buy it, some people did.\u201d\n\nBut as they grew, post-Series A, they needed people with more advanced skills\u2014chief product officer (CPO), head of HR, head of finance, and CFO\u2014so, they started selling good working conditions: early closing time, working from home, and employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) to their employees. \u201cBy doing that, we were able to attract the sort of amazing talent we have now.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ovia didn\u2019t find looking for a technical co-founder difficult because Helium Health\u2019s CEO was a technical person, she advised them to get an executive or senior manager on board instead of a technical co-founder. \u201cWhen you see that there is a working relationship between you and the person, you can then bring them on board as a co-founder.\u201d She advised against rushing into a co-founder relationship because it is like a marriage.\n\nWatch the full conversation here:\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Why e-commerce is king in Egypt",
          "text": "When Syrian entrepreneur Ronaldo Mouchawar founded Souq.com in 2005, buying things by clicking a picture on a clunky computer was unheard of in the Middle East. Somehow, Souq managed to quickly become the leading online retailer in the Middle East. And in 2017, twelve years after it launched, Amazon bought it for $580 million to expand operations in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nToday Egyptian sales make up more than half of Souq\u2019s revenues.\n\nSouq\u2019s $580 million buyout underscored Amazon\u2019s online retail expectations in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, where e-commerce continues to grow at 25% every year. Bain and Company say the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and Egypt, with its 103+ million residents, make up roughly 80% of the e-commerce market in the MENA region.\n\nFurthermore, a Disrupt Africa report released in January shows that 20% of Egyptian startups are decidedly pursuing opportunities in the e-commerce and retail-tech space. That is roughly two times the number of fintech startups operating in the country and a sharp contrast to the rest of the continent\u2019s startup profile. Last year, Egyptian e-commerce startups received USD$ 131.27 million; according to Africa: The Big Deal, which is 1.4 times the e-commerce funding Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa received in the same period.\n\nClearly, retail tech and e-commerce rule Egypt\u2019s tech scene; and this is why.\n\nGovernment policy is pushing informal SME retail online.\n\nFacing a budget deficit of $27.8 billion in May 2018, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi offered five-year tax exemptions while urging informal workers to legalise their status. The government had hoped to raise an additional $51.9 billion in taxes from the informal sector. At a parliamentary session, Mohamed Badrawi, a member of the Economic Affairs Committee, declared that \u201cIncorporating all these economic activities into the formal sector is becoming an urgent matter.\u201d\n\nThe informal sector in Egypt accounts for more than half of Egypt\u2019s economy. In 2020, the government issued a new law that offered incentives for small businesses to incorporate as formal entities. Beyond creating incentives for informal traders to formalise operations, Egypt\u2019s Central Bank imposed daily limits on cash deposits and withdrawals while asking banks to remove similar daily limits on digital transactions. The bank says this will help support financial inclusion goals. In reality, however, this push saw informal traders who generate bulk sales in cash struggle to deposit and withdraw cash, as a result, pushing them to formalise their businesses. When these traders incorporate and begin to accept digital transactions, it also makes sense to take their business online.\n\nA market scene in Cairo. Egypt\u2019s informal economy constitutes up to 50% of the country\u2019s GDP, provides more than 60% of new jobs and is growing by 1% every year.\n\nPhoto: Alex Azabache/Unsplash\n\nThe functioning belief on the part of the government was that e-commerce would aid a transition away from cash dependency, which will, in turn, reduce the size of the informal sector and increase tax revenue.\n\nCovid-related restrictions accelerated consumer trust in digital commerce channels.\n\nThe social and economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital transformation globally. Egypt was not an exception.\n\nDespite the government\u2019s best-strong-armed efforts (it mandated the use of cashless systems to pay for government services and imposed fines on defaulters), Egyptian shoppers remained reluctant to use digital channels for shopping or payments \u2013 until the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThis was also partly driven by the reforms mentioned earlier which the Egyptian government used to encourage informal retailers to formalise their operations. At the time, Egypt\u2019s Central Bank waived several bank transaction fees for 6 months which it later extended to the middle of 2021. As a result, despite predictions about slowing digital commerce growth in Egypt, Jumia and Noon reported a 940% increase in online sales as the pandemic hit. 72% of participants in a Mastercard survey claimed to have shopped online during the pandemic.\n\nThe trend appears to have sustained beyond COVID-19 as more people than ever use smartphones to access services. Today Egyptian e-commerce is expected to grow at least 30% this year, buoyed by younger shoppers and rising incomes from Egypt\u2019s expanding middle class.\n\nGood infrastructure is good business.\n\nAn omnibus whizzes past in Alexandria, Egypt. 74% of Egypt\u2019s 65,050km road network are paved more than double the continental average.\n\nPhoto: Fady Fouad/Unsplash\n\nAs e-commerce accelerated in Egypt, it created a ripple effect on the logistics sector. People who buy things online need to get their goods delivered somehow. While infrastructure in Egypt is not the best globally, Egyptian infrastructure is second only to that of the island nation of Seychelles on the Africa Infrastructure Development Index (AIDI).\n\nA combination of a reasonably good road network and increased investment in transport and telecoms infrastructure is proving beneficial to the handful of logistics-tech startups that are helping to make shopping online easier.\n\nStill, as with online retail anywhere, last-mile logistics remains an issue. According to Waya Media, 40% of online orders in Egypt do not reach their customers the first time they are shipped. So while Egypt\u2019s 4000 post offices make up the backbone of its distribution network, a good number of online retailers who need to deliver items to their customers\u2019 doorsteps partner with full-service logistics companies or use smaller specialized delivery units that stitch together end-to-end services to patch delivery gaps.\n\nAggressive infrastructure investments by the Egyptian government has seen it rise to second place, only behind Seychelles on the African Infrastructure Development Index (AIDI).\n\nSource: Open Data for Africa\n\nOther startups like Appetito are pioneering franchised pickup centres similar to what Getir does in Europe to bring grocery deliveries closer to their customers. More prominent players like Amazon opened a 28,000 square meter warehouse in the 10th of Ramadan City in August last year. The new hub and 15 delivery stations across Cairo, Alexandria, Tanta, Ismailia, and Assiut are part of Amazon\u2019s growing MENA distribution network.\n\nEgypt\u2019s last-mile delivery startups are the API connectors in a very fragmented supply chain. Image source: Wamda.\n\n\u201c[BNPL will] accelerate moving from cash-on-delivery to paying by cards\u201d \u2013 Sherif Nessim, Founding General Partner, Jedar Capital\n\nThe e-commerce boom is also creating ripple effects for fintech in Egypt. While cash-on-delivery is very much alive, the value of card transactions is growing at an impressive pace. The Egyptian central bank is playing a leading role in facilitating this shift. For example, it allows banks operating in the Egyptian market to own unlimited shares in payment service providers and payment systems operators as part of the country\u2019s push towards cashless payments.\n\nSherif Nessim, Founding General Partner at Jedar Capital, believes that Buy Now Pay Later offerings can help accelerate the transition to digital payments. \u201cEvery year, we find that the balance is moving from cash-on-delivery to cards, cash to cards. People are putting more trust in online payment methods,\u201d BNPL solutions, he adds, \u201c[will] accelerate moving from cash-on-delivery to paying by cards because if I pay with this credit card, I can pay in 6 months, interest-free.\u201d When you think about it, it makes sense for a market where younger and relatively more impulsive shoppers are the drivers of e-commerce growth.\n\nAccording to Nessim, all of these plays are part of why he expects growth to continue for traditional e-commerce and q-commerce companies.\n\nAttractive growth prospects lure VC money.\n\n2021 was a record-setting year for venture-backed companies globally. Venture capitalists invested more than USD$ 675 billion into startups globally, and Africa outdid its 2019 record with more than $5 billion invested in African startups. Venture funds were themselves swamped with cash, partly a fall out of fiscal (stimulus) policies for the pandemic and partly as a result of more people being willing to bet on risky \u201ccompanies of the future\u201d than ever before.\n\nAll of this activity has set the perfect stage for venture capital funds in Egypt. Last year and led by funding into e-commerce and retail tech companies, Egyptian startups raised $403.5 million, according to data from Disrupt Africa.\n\nWith more cash to spend, investor packs are hunting for growth and returns in emerging and frontier markets. Post-revolution Egypt happens to be one of the latest such frontier markets. Naturally, investors have their eyes on it. \u201cThey realise that the next ten years are the years for emerging and frontier markets,\u201d Sherif Nessim says. He adds that some VC firms he knows are creating dedicated funds \u201cthat only invest in emerging markets rather than invest out of their global funds.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, like Amazon and Souq illustrate, bigger growth-hungry companies in the United States and Europe prefer to acquire local companies in emerging markets instead of building from scratch.\n\nEgypt\u2019s unique combination of growing venture capital interest, growth prospects, and a government determined to shore up revenues by including more informal businesses means digital commerce will continue to grow as more retailers become formal and come online. At the same time, it also signals significant growth prospects for affordable business-to-business software and services to help these newly formal businesses manage their processes and access credit.\n\nCritics have slammed MENA investors for mostly backing e-commerce and marketplace startups. However, by helping buying and selling thrive online, those investments may be responsible for accelerating digital adoption in other areas in a region as conservative as the MENA. After all, since commerce is the backbone of the world\u2019s economic systems, it only makes sense for the digital version of the bazaars and souks that line Egyptian streets to lead the way for her technology ecosystem.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Fintech innovations on the rise in DR Congo\u2019s nascent startup landscape",
          "text": "As with most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, access to basic financial services is significantly limited in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Just 14% of the population have an actual bank account and only 25% have an account with either banking or any other financial institution.\n\nMore so, there is less than 35 kilometre of paved road for every 1 million inhabitants in the French-speaking country, making traditional branch-based banking unfeasible for most of its 90 million residents and the bid for financial inclusion arduous.\n\nThe digital finance revolution that\u2019s played out in the rest of Africa over the past decade thus cannot come soon enough for people in the central African nation, especially given it has a 47% mobile phone penetration rate, with the figure likely to grow further.\n\nA number of startups have sprung up over the past 5 years, which, through fintech innovations, have brought financial services closer to where people live and work. One such is Flash International, the largest fintech and payments aggregator in the country.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFlash operates a network of agents that allows people to do their banking on its mobile platform (FlashApp), putting financial services\u2014including remittance, payments, and other value-added services\u2014within easy reach.\n\nThe startup currently has roughly 3,500 agents and 90 branches, through which it serves more than 2 million customers. And instead of opening individual accounts with multiple banks or mobile money operators, Flash gives its users a card with which they can accept all payments.\n\nChief executive Jonathan Johannesen, whose 25 years of professional experience cuts across roles in financial institutions like Citi and mobile finance firms Moneytrans and TigoCash, started the company in 2018.\n\nSince its launch, Flash has recorded stellar growth and is currently integrated with several banks, mobile money, and telecom operators. It claims to process nearly 1 million transactions valued at over $50 million per month through its payment services and also facilitates more than 40,000 satellite TV subscription transactions, one of its value-added products.\n\nAccording to the CEO, the mission was to build the first Congolese fintech that would aggregate as many financial and value-added services as possible. \u201cWhat we currently have is an application with up to 27 different products and services, through which thousands of agents make a living out of,\u201d Johannesen recalled in a recent interview with TechCabal.\n\nA screenshot of the Flash web platform. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nUnlike Flash, Okapi Finance was launched out of Sweden by founder Gis\u00e8le Mwepu, with DRC being one of the company\u2019s four markets across all the regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The startup rolled out its services in the country last year and currently has 170,000 customers. Its goal, according to Mwepu, is to reach up to 25 million people in the country in less than 10 years.\n\n\u201cDRC has over 90 million people and still there aren\u2019t many financial services solutions available. The opportunity is very huge. And the unbanked people aren\u2019t just individuals, they can be traders, merchants, or informal employees,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Okapi platform allows both individual and enterprise customers carry out daily financial transactions like deposits, money transfers, and salary disbursements through its web and mobile platforms, USSD, and physical agents.\n\nOkapi has a special focus on getting more women included in the country\u2019s financial services ecosystem. Per Mwepu, up to 80% of the company\u2019s DRC users and 95% of the 17,000 merchants it\u2019s onboarded are women. For the latter, the company extends a line of credit\u2014weekly loans of around $50\u2014to help power their businesses.\n\n\u201cFinancial inclusion cannot be achieved by only allowing people to carry out payment transactions,\u201d Mwepu noted. \u201cWe need to increase their accessibility to a wide array of financial services.\u201d\n\nThrough the Okapi platform, microfinance banks and insurance providers can distribute their products, enabling them penetrate the informal sector and reach the unbanked population. In addition, users don\u2019t need a bank account to access these services and after signing up can apply for the Okapi Visa card.\n\nA screenshot of the Okapi Finance web platform. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nWhereas Flash focuses on urban areas like Kinshasa with most of its agents in DRC\u2019s major cities, Faysal Axam\u2019s startup targets the unbanked population in rural areas, where more than half of the population resides.\n\nIn Goma, the capital and business hub of North Kivu province in the eastern DRC, Faysal Company offers a \u201cTap and Pay\u201d solution\u2014a magnetic card that interacts with POS machines and interfaces with a virtual wallet.\n\n\u201cFinancial flows are mostly in DRC\u2019s urban areas, not so much in peri-urban areas, and nearly not at all in rural areas,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile mobile money penetration rate is 72% in cities, it\u2019s only 28% in rural areas.\u201d\n\nCircumventing fintech challenges in DRC\n\nIn a country like DRC where road and internet infrastructure is below par, agents are especially effective at reaching rural dwellers and reducing deployment costs for providers.\n\nFor customers, agent networks reduce travelling time and security risks as they historically had to locate one of the only 500 bank branches available in the country\u2014which is ironically Africa\u2019s second-largest country by land area and the fourth most populous.\n\n\u201cMost transactions are done over the counter in DRC as there\u2019s still a very low penetration in terms of smartphones and internet access is not affordable. Also, the prevalent habit of the population is mainly to visit an agent for a transaction or service,\u201d Johannesen said.\n\nA high capital barrier for entry in the financial services space preserves the dominance of big banks like Ecobank and UBA as well as network operators (such as Vodacom Congo, Orange RDC, and Bharti Airtel who collectively control 35-40 million subscribers).\n\nFintech startups looking to partner with banks and telcos have had to deal with skepticism and aversion from the industry giants. Axam recalled it took Faysal almost a year and a half to get its first mobile money integration license in 2020 after the startup was rebuffed by banks and local mobile network operators for partnerships.\n\nA screenshot of the Faysal Company web platform. Image credit: TechCabal\n\nMultipay Congo, DRC\u2019s first inter-banking platform, was launched in 2015 to create interoperability between payment platforms like ATMs and point of sale machines.\n\nBut the framework doesn\u2019t make integrating with banks and telcos any easier for fintechs, according to Mwepu. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to achieve financial inclusion without interoperability of solutions from other stakeholders like banks and telcos. We have to work together,\u201d the Okapi Finance founder said.\n\nOn the back of a successful partnership with Orange, Faysal\u2019s customer base has exceeded 10,000. Although that\u2019s a small number, it\u2019s significant nonetheless in a country where more than 70% of the population live on less than $1.90 a day and most have no immediate incentives to open financial accounts.\n\nAxam added that Faysal\u2019s growth is also because the solution can be used offline, even in areas without internet connectivity.\n\nWith internet access at around 17%, feature phones \u2013 which retail at about $20 \u2013 play a huge role in enabling Congolese to access digital finance services. Faysal, for instance, gets most of its traction from the USSD feature as Goma dwellers often must seek a mountaintop just to access 2G cell phone coverage.\n\nIn addition, while banks and telcos boast sufficient financial muscle to build and scale their products, startups lack access to sufficient finance. \u201cWe don\u2019t have finance, investors, incubators, and accelerators, especially in Goma,\u201d Axam said, citing security issues as a challenge that makes it hard for investors to trust the ecosystem. \u201cMany excellent solutions here can\u2019t get continental or international exposure because of this.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important, however, to note that the DRC\u2019s fintech landscape is practically nascent with only 12 startups playing in the space as of 2018, per a report from Microsave and MasterCard. But the digital finance seeds are clearly beginning to take root and there are concrete reasons to be bullish about the opportunities in DRC for fintech and its prospect to attract investors.\n\nWith startups like Flash, Okapi, Faysal, alongside remittance fintechs, partnerships like the Mastercard and Billetera deal targeting the millions of financially excluded residents, as well as the government\u2019s increasing shift towards virtual payments for its over thousands of civil servants, one can anticipate a radical digital finance expansion in the coming years as DRC moves to replicate other African countries\u2019 successes, slowly but surely.\n\n\u201cFintechs in DRC are beginning to thrive. It\u2019s definitely promising but a better infrastructural coverage is crucial to realising full potential,\u201d said Noel K. Tshiani founder of Congo Business Network, an international network of Congolese professionals and entrepreneurs. \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic about the vision of the DRC government under President Felix Tshisekedi and its ambitious digitisation program aligned with the country\u2019s National Digital Plan.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "When Nkiru Amadi-Emina and Ijeoma Akwiwu met at a birthday party in Abuja, Nigeria, they knew they\u2019d make good friends; what they didn\u2019t know was, they would make good co-founders as well. But 8 years into their friendship, they have built and run a couple of projects and businesses together and, now, they are focused on building Pivo, a startup they envision will be the neobank for trade in Africa. Like AfreximBank but faster and digitally operated.\n\nThe big picture is to be the go-to neobank for trade in Africa by the end of this year, or next.\n\nPivo entered the market with Pivo Capital, a credit-focused financial services platform for supply chain small and medium businesses (SMEs), because of the co-founders\u2019 track record in the supply chain industry, especially the logistics aspect.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nLong before Pivo, Amadi-Emina, a software engineer, worked as a tech consultant for Nigeria\u2019s electoral body, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), for over 2 years. She left INEC in 2017 to found her first startup Jalo, a venture-backed on-demand delivery company that focused on Nigeria\u2019s North-Central market and served e-commerce platforms like Jumia and Konga in that region.\n\nIn August 2018, Amadi-Emina joined Kobo360 after the logistic startup acquired Jalo in an acquihire deal. She remained at Kobo360 for a little over 3 years before leaving last year to focus on Pivo.\n\nFor Akwiwu, a trained lawyer who claimed to have stumbled on tech by chance and the influence of friends like Amadi-Emina, her law career, which started officially in 2013, spanned across law firms and companies like Gilmor Engineering, one of the biggest engineering firms in Nigeria, where she worked for over 6 years.\n\nBut, along the line, she started playing with project and product management and operations, monitoring projects, and product development lifecycles on the side. Last year, she decided to transition fully into tech. She left law to focus on building Pivo and getting a master\u2019s degree in software development while at it.\n\nWith Amadi-Emina\u2019s experience in the logistics side of the supply chain, having worked and led the port operation effort at Kobo360, Akwiwu\u2019s experience in law, and their collective knowledge of running an exportation business, building a business that serves the logistics arm of the supply chain was a no-brainer.\n\nLogistics supply chain is Pivo\u2019s first stop\n\nIn Africa, access to credit is still one of the biggest challenges small businesses deal with, especially small supply chain businesses. Supply chain businesses usually have a short time to execute a contract, and due to the excessive bureaucracy and numerous requirements, acquiring credit from traditional financial institutions takes a long time, therefore these businesses are automatically at a disadvantage.\n\nThis is where Pivo comes in.\n\nA truck loading at the port. Image source: Lori\n\nLaunched in September last year, Pivo provides flexible and quick financing options for supply chain businesses like logistics service providers, clearing and forwarding businesses, and FMCG distributors. Pivo is like a third-party partner in a transaction between a buyer and a seller. But to understand what Pivo does, one must first understand how supply chain financing works.\n\nSupply chain finance is a type of cash advance suppliers receive from lenders to fulfill a transaction or contract before the buyer pays them.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: a merchant wants to supply a buyer with goods but needs some working capital to see the transaction through before the buyer pays them. So the merchant approaches the lender (that would be Pivo, in this case) for a credit. The lender then collects all required information to check for the legitimacy of their transaction or contract claim with the buyer, then disburses the credit once the buyer confirms the contract.\n\nThe above illustration explains Pivo at its core. Once a business finishes their KYC and asks for credit, Pivo prompts them to supply all the information about the transaction they need financing for. After that, Pivo profiles the business seeking credit for worthiness, runs a risk assessment on the transaction, and then profiles the businesses they are doing the transaction with, to ascertain whether they are credible and good for the money.\n\nOnce everything checks out and the buyer agrees to pay into the supplier\u2019s Pivo account, Pivo then disburses the loan. In partnership with Providus Bank, Pivo provides its customers with a business account that facilitates remittance. So, after the money lands in the supplier\u2019s Pivo account, the startup takes its dues.\n\nAll these checks and assessments help Pivo to finance only creditworthy customers and less-risky transactions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re able to ensure 98% recovery on every single capital we deploy to our customers,\u201d Amadi-Emina told TechCabal.\n\nAmadi-Emina also mentioned that the average capital requests they\u2019ve received per customer is about $10,000. And while they cater for credits within the range of $5,000 from the company\u2019s balance sheet, requests above $5,000 are passed to their credit partners.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nFor now, the startup is still building in a stealth mode and according to the CEO Amadi-Emina, Pivo currently has about 250 direct SMEs customers and 5 ecosystem leads, which are the larger corporations that Pivo serve the SMEs within their value chain through embedded finance. Each ecosystem lead is reported to have about 500 to 1,000 SMEs.\n\nThe startup lists some of the top logistic companies in Africa as its ecosystem lead customers including Jetstream Africa, SabiRoad, Vee Logistics, and MVx.\n\nOn the side of its loan book, the co-founders said they have disbursed $1 million worth of credit out of over $2 million worth of applications that they have received since launch.\n\nThe company makes money from the interest charged on the credit disbursed, management fees, and the one-off charges from account creation. Akwiwu believes that as they continue to add more offerings, they will have more sources of revenue.\n\nThe startup has also raised a 6-figure preseed from Microtraction, FirstCheck Africa, Ventures Platform, Mercy Corps Venture, Rally Cap Ventures, Metis Capital Partner, Bold Angel Fund, and recently just got into the ODX accelerator programme where it\u2019s entitled to $125,000 for a 7% equity stake.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nFor Akwiwu and Amadi-Emma, the roadmap is clear and they already have new products that will help them become a full-fledged neobank for trade in the works. For example, products like Invoice Factoring and Pivo Plus, which includes insurance and corporate compliance offerings, are already in the testing phase.\n\nThe company is currently only operational in Nigeria with the plan to expand into Ghana before the end of the year.\n\nThe competition in the credit market in Africa is heating up and it\u2019s good for SMEs. While there are new upstarts springing up to provide credit for businesses, the bigger ones are also making a fray into the scene. For instance, Flutterwave, the unicorn fintech, has joined the credit space with the recent announcement of Flutterwave Capital.\n\nWhile other startups like Payhippo, Lendigo, Float, and even Brass have successfully built a digital financial institution that provides credit for African SMEs, Pivo is the only one playing strictly in the supply chain sector, at least that we know of at the moment.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The total worth of disbursed credit has been changed from $980,000 to $1 million. Between the time we interviewed the founders and the date this article was published, Pivo disbursed another $20,000 in credit.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nRecently, my mental health has taken some heavy hits, and this week has been extremely stressful for me. Enough about me, though. What comes to mind when you hear the term \u201cmental health\u201d? A mad person?\n\nSide bar: It\u2019s encouraging to see how people are coming forward to test for mental illnesses and accept treatment. While this is still a long way off in Africa, it\u2019s certain we\u2019re getting there. So, thanks to the Internet for bringing it to light!\n\nBack to the matter. Is mental health only related to mental illnesses? Is it limited to schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, anxiety, eating disorder, depression, insomnia, alcohol and substance abuse, and other similar conditions?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s your answer: Mental health encompasses more than just mental illnesses. It is related to how a person feels, thinks, and acts.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) describes it as a state of well-being in which an individual recognises his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and can contribute to his or her community.\n\nThis means that someone may have good mental health, no mental illness or be somewhere in between. This refers to the mental health spectrum.\n\nFor instance, Ayo, a 27-year-old graduate, may not exhibit any signs of mental illness but is unemployed, with a negative attitude toward himself and his relationships, or may not have a strong sense of purpose. Can you say Ayo is mentally healthy? Of course not!\n\nHaving good mental health and no mental illness is at the top of the spectrum, while having poor mental health and a mental illness is at the bottom. While the people who are somewhere in the middle may have good mental health but a mental illness, they may also have poor mental health but no mental illness.\n\nConsequently, we must all strive to be at the top of the mental health spectrum which begins with prioritising your mental health as much as you do your physical and sexual health.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nThe Nigeria Data Protection Bureau\n\nAntler East Africa\u2019s oversubscribed fund\n\nThe Nigeria Data Protection Bureau\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know that the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (CFRN) 1999 guarantees Nigerian citizens the fundamental right to privacy?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis means that under Section 37 of the CFRN, citizens have the right to privacy in their homes, correspondence, phone conversations, and telegraphic communications.\n\nThe Constitution, however, does not define \u201cprivacy\u201d or contain detailed privacy provisions. So, it is unclear how far Nigerian codified law protects data privacy.\n\nBut, personal data is becoming increasingly valuable, and it is constantly sought after by nefarious individuals who intend to exploit it to the detriment of the data subjects.\n\nThe current state of our laws demonstrates the need for Nigeria to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for data protection, don\u2019t you think?\n\nThis, among other reasons, could be why the Nigerian government announced that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved the establishment of a new agency, the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau (NDPB), to focus on data protection and privacy in the country.\n\nOgheneruemu, a non-practising lawyer and Techpoint Africa Reporter, provided us with additional information about this new data protection enforcing body. What effect will this new agency have on your privacy rights?\n\nCheck it out here: Nigeria has a new data protection enforcing body; here\u2019s why you should care\n\nAntler East Africa\u2019s oversubscribed fund\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntler East Africa, a venture capital firm based in Nairobi, has closed a $13.5 million fund to invest in early-stage tech startups in an oversubscribed round.\n\nInitially, the VC intended to raise $10 million but ended up with $13.5 million. Do the math: they received an additional $3.5 million.\n\nThe round\u2019s limited partners include Baillie Gifford, Canica, and other institutional investors like the International Finance Corporation.\n\nAntler East Africa launched in August 2019, two years after Antler \u2013 its parent company \u2013 was founded by Magnus Grimeland. Every year, the VC firm employs a full venture building model with two cohorts.\n\nThe company uses a hybrid model acting as both a venture builder and a venture capital firm. From its $300 million fund, the firm has invested in over 250 companies ranging from pre-seed to Series C.\n\nSo far, five cohorts of 153 founders have graduated from the accelerator programs, and the firm has made 14 investments. AIfluence, Marketforce-subsidiary Digiduka, Honeycoin, Uncover Skincare, Try Cooked, and Vybe are some examples.\n\nAntler East Africa\u2019s new fund will allow it to invest in founders who want to build their startups from the ground up and already formed teams that require capital to scale.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nUnderstanding others\u2019 feelings: what is empathy and why do we need it?.

          "title": "Nigeria has a new data protection enforcing body; here\u2019s why you should care",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February 2022, the Nigerian government announced that President Muhammadu Buhari had approved a new agency, the Nigeria Data Protection Bureau (NDPB)\n\nThe statement was signed by Uwa Suleiman, Media Aide to the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Isa Pantami.\n\nAccording to Suleiman, the NDPB was established in line with global best practices and would focus on data protection and privacy for the country.\n\nAmong other things, the statement credits the introduction of the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) and the National Digital Economy Policy and Strategy (NDEPS) with creating more awareness about data protection and resulting in the \u201cdatafication\u201d of the Nigerian economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough we are not sure of the specifics of the agency\u2019s duties, Suleiman says the NDPB will consolidate the gains of the NDPR and support the process for the development of a primary legislation for data protection and privacy.\n\nFor now, we can say with certainty that Vincent Olatunji will head the NDPB as National Commissioner/CEO.\n\nOlatunji served as the Acting DG of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) until October 2016 before handing over to Pantami, nine months after his appointment.\n\nDoes Nigeria have a new Data Protection Authority?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe short answer to this is no.\n\nThe long answer, which requires some explaining, is maybe.\n\nWhen NITDA introduced the NDPR, the agency handed itself some oversight functions, effectively becoming Nigeria\u2019s default Data Protection Authority (DPA).\n\nBut what are DPAs? According to the European Commission, \u201cDPAs are independent public authorities that supervise, through investigative and corrective powers, the application of the data protection law. They provide expert advice on data protection issues and handle complaints lodged against violations of the General Data Protection Regulation and the relevant national laws.\u201d\n\nSo think of a DPA as a bodyguard to ensure your data rights are protected, and companies don\u2019t get away with anything.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nigeria\u2019s case, this would apply to the NDPR\n\nHowever, unlike Europe and other countries \u2014 including some countries in Africa \u2014 NITDA did not create a separate entity to act as a DPA. A scenario that some have argued goes beyond the powers assigned in the NITDA Act.\n\nEssentially, one could argue that NITDA appointing itself DPA is unlawful or, in legal terms, void.\n\nThe NITDA Act empowers the Agency to \u201cdevelop guidelines for electronic governance and monitor the use of electronic data interchange and other forms of electronic communication transactions as an alternative to paper-based methods in government, commerce, education, the private and public sectors, labour, and other fields, where the use of electronic communication may improve the exchange of data and information.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the NITDA Act does not appear to give the Agency the power to issue the NDPR in itself. But that\u2019s a discussion for another day.\n\nGoing by this new development, though, it appears that four years into the NDPR\u2019s regime, we might be getting a DPA in the true sense of the word. Let\u2019s not get too far ahead of ourselves, though, because there\u2019s still the pesky problem of an establishing law.\n\nIn most countries, DPAs are created through a governing law or regulation. A presidential approval does not a DPA make, but this is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, for which we are cautiously optimistic.\n\nFor now, however, our earlier answers are still valid. Until NITDA or the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy confirms whether the NDPB is a DPA, we can only speculate.\n\nOlumide Babalola, Managing Partner at Olumide Babalola LP, believes that \u201cThe statement is silent on what form the Bureau would take. It reportedly currently shares an office with the National Information Technology Development Agency (\u2018NITDA\u2019).\n\n\u201cHence, as things stand, the Bureau is no more than a department under NITDA as it currently has no separate identity, not even a website where information on its operations can be accessed.\u201d\n\nWhat happens to the Data Protection Bill?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Suleiman\u2019s statement, the NDPB would \u201csupport the process for the development of a primary legislation for data protection and privacy.\u201d\n\nThe race to a dedicated data protection and privacy law has taken several turns. Filled with false starts, the closest Nigeria has come to a law passed by the National Assembly was in 2018 with the Nigeria Data Protection Bill 2018. Although both houses passed it in 2019, President Buhari withheld his assent.\n\nThe most successful attempt remains the NDPR, a guideline at best.\n\nThe Data Protection Bill 2020 (PDF) is currently before the National Assembly, but nothing much has been heard since a stakeholder session held in September 2020.\n\nThe Bill provides a much more robust approach to data protection, providing for more categories of data than the NDPR, which appears to deal more with electronic data. It also creates a Data Protection Commission, which should act as Nigeria\u2019s DPA.\n\nInterestingly, there are rumours that the Bill has been abandoned, and the federal government is seeking a consultant to draft a new one.\n\nWhat this means\n\nBusiness as usual for now.\n\nAlthough the uncertainty surrounding the NDPR and NITDA\u2019s power to appoint itself DPA are still dark areas, it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve got for now.\n\nThe introduction of the NDPB raises a little wave of dust over Nigeria\u2019s data protection and privacy crate. It raises questions that cannot be adequately answered until we see appropriate legislation or more guidelines and perhaps a \u201cdedicated website.\u201d\n\nWhat follows should make for interesting times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOgheneruemu Oneyibo Writer, Humanoid, Forever she/her, Lover of words.

I did, but I saw a recap and the best way to describe my reaction is mind blown \ud83e\udd2f.\n\nThe event had some boring announcements, like the new iPhone colours and the underwhelmingly designed iPhone SE. To be fair, the SE comes with an impressive spec upgrade, but the design is a total replica of the 2020 SE.\n\nMy guess is that Apple wants you to buy their more high-end products rather than their budget (a $430 phone is not a budget phone ) products. So if you cannot afford the flagships, you should be able to buy the SE. Keyword being should.\n\nThe mind-blowing part of the event for me was when the Mac Studio was announced. A machine the size of a bowl of nkwobi, but with beastly specs. It runs on Apple\u2019s new chip \u2014 M1 Ultra \u2014 eight times faster than last year\u2019s M1 Max.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has a 20 core CPU, up to 8 terabytes of solid-state drive (SSD), and 128 gigabytes of unified memory or RAM. While the specs sound incredible, how it handles third-party software will decide its power.\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nThe creation of Ozi with no-code tools\n\nOkHi\u2019s $1.5m raise\n\n$1.5m pre-seed by Yep!\n\nBuilding a startup with no-code tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross section of Ozi team. L-R: Israel Akpan, Co-founder and COO; Azeez Adejumo, Co-founder and CEO; Olukayaode Amusu, CMO. Source: Supplied.\n\nTwo University of Lagos (UNILAG) graduates \u2014 Adejumo Azeez and Israel Akpan \u2014 are building a tech startup without writing one line of code.\n\nHow did it begin? After spending months looking for a developer to build their product, the duo resorted to no-code tools. They found exciting products that didn\u2019t require any coding expertise. But even a startup built with no-code tools still has challenges.\n\nTheir startup, Ozi, can be described as a Communications as a Service product that Azeez and Akpan started in the university. But as their clientele grew in number and quality, privacy concerns they didn\u2019t consider rose, and they lost a considerable amount of clients.\n\nOzi provides chatbots and helps send bulk messages on WhatsApp. Although other platforms like SMS and email can be leveraged, the startup is doubling down on WhatsApp for several reasons. One of them is open rates.\n\nThe startup has recently closed a $10,000 angel round and has increased its user-base from 100 to 10,000\n\nOne thing I find interesting about Ozi is the different iterations and the challenges the founders have gone through in putting a startup together with no-code tools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you have a startup idea and have zero coding skills, you should read Ogheneruemu\u2019s conversation with Azeez and Akpan: How no-code tools helped two UNILAG graduates build omni-channel messaging platform, Ozi\n\nSmart addressing with OkHi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can find your home address easily on Google Maps, you are one of the very few Africans with a verifiable address. Getting packages delivered to your doorsteps would be hassle-free \u2014 for the most part.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re like me and your house doesn\u2019t even have a number, then we\u2019re among the 400 million Africans who do not have verifiable addresses. This makes getting deliveries or even opening bank accounts hard.\n\nInterestingly, OkHi, a smart-addressing startup, wants to solve this problem. The startup was built by Timbo Drayson when he noticed Google Maps doesn\u2019t work perfectly in Africa. In 2014, he launched the address verification startup in Kenya, verifying over 300,000 addresses so far.\n\nOkHi expanded into Nigeria after a $1.5 million seed and a partnership with Interswitch. Yesterday, it also announced another $1.5 million seed extension from investors, including Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga Agboola and Interswitch.\n\nOkHi had a conversation with Chimgozorim, and they discussed how the startup is providing address verification services for businesses, including eCommerce and ride-hailing startups. Please read it here: After verifying over 300,000 addresses in Kenya, OkHi secures $1.5 million to expand across Nigeria\n\nA $1.5m pre-seed by Yep!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoS user\n\nYep! is another neobank out of Africa but with an interesting mission. The fintech startup isn\u2019t just offering financial services to the digitally savvy but to every African without an Internet connection.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Yep!\u2019s Co-founder, Olaoluwa Awojoodu, said, \u201cWe want to bank the guys in Lagos as well as bank the guys in a village at Ikot Ekpene.\u201d\n\nHow? Yep! isn\u2019t Awojoodu\u2019s first rodeo in the finance world. He is the Founder of E-Settlement, a holding company for different financial entities; its agent banking platform, PayCentre Africa, has over 5 million customers.\n\nYep! will leverage this massive customer base to bring the underbanked among them into the \u201cdigital fold.\u201d\n\nExplaining, Awojoodu said, \u201cnot just the guys that are digitally enabled, but even the guys that are off the digital channels, we are going to bring everybody into the digital environment using both digital tools and agent networks.\u201d\n\nYep! has raised a $1.5 million pre-seed in a round led by Greenhouse Capital. While other fintechs, for example, OPay, have a similar model, its competitive advantage lies in how easily it can provide credit facilities for its agents.\n\nThe pre-seed fund will go into doubling its agent network to over 200,000 by the end of 2022.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nWhat Happens When a Child Gets COVID?

          "title": "Nigeria should expect food scarcity by June \u2013 Dangote",
          "text": "Nigeria should expect an outbreak of food scarcity in the next three months as adverse consequences of the Russian-Ukraine war begin to come home to roost, Aliko Dangote, chairman, and chief executive of Dangote Group has said.\n\nThe war impact which has begun with the sporadic rise in wheat pricing may soon spread to other foods including maize and other components of input for industrial food production, triggering low production and low supply, the business mogul said.\n\nWith Russia and Ukraine controlling about 30 percent of the world\u2019s urea production and 26 percent of the world\u2019s potassium supply, access to these input components will increasingly stifle for as long as the war persists and could cripple the goal to fortify staples from source.\n\n\u201cNot only wheat or maize will be affected but a lot of components because as we speak, potash and urea supply are held largely by Russia and Ukraine. There will be a scarcity of food because people will not be able to access fertilisers going forward. But we may not see the effects now but in the next two to three months, it will reflect,\u201d Dangote said, speaking at the 4th annual food processing and nutrition leadership forum in Lagos.\n\n\u201cWe need to sit with the government to look at what to do. We need to make sure we grow more. It is about food security,\u201d Dangote said.\n\nIn Africa\u2019s biggest oil-producing country, flour millers believe a shortage of wheat supplies from Russia would affect the price of products like bread, a common food in Africa\u2019s most populous country.\n\nThe ripple effect will be faced by Nigerian firms operating in the food industry that are currently facing an uptick in production costs from exchange range volatility and supply chain disruptions.\n\nData gleaned from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed wheat is Nigeria\u2019s third most consumed grain.\n\nFor instance, Nigeria imported N898.2 billion worth of wheat in nine months that ended September 2021.\n\nThe top origins of wheat in Nigeria in 2021 included the USA, N194.2 billion; Canada, N136.4 billion, Russia, N124 billion, Lithuania, N122.3 billion and Latvia, N115.9 billion.\n\nRead also: Gold rallies as Russian-Ukraine crisis stoke anxiety\n\nThe ripple effect will be faced by Nigerian firms operating in the food industry that are currently facing an uptick in production costs from exchange range volatility amid Covid-19 induced supply chain disruptions.\n\nIn the last twelve months, wheat-based products such as the popular pre-packed wheat flour and bread (sliced and unsliced) have witnessed a steady price increase across the country.\n\nIn January 2022, a 500g sliced bread was sold for N418.65, representing a 28 percent increase on a year-on-year basis. The 500g unsliced bread rose by 25 percent from N306.74 in January 2021 to N383.51 in January 2022, NBS data stated.\n\nAccording to Boye Olusanya, chief executive officer, Honeywell Flour Mills, the reality is that Russia and Ukraine are first and fifth in wheat and if that volume which is almost one-third of the total wheat production in the world is taken out, there will be an immediate impact on pricing.\n\nAs of today, prices of wheat have gone down, he said, noting there is a lag in the system because of inventory control and inventory management.\n\nAlso, he explained that the impact of the war will not only reflect in the short term but could snowball lasting effect on production over a year to 18 months.\n\n\u201cIt is something that we need to be sitting with the government to make discourse about what measures can we put in place to alleviate what is coming. If we don\u2019t manage this well, there will be significant volume compression in terms of input materials that come in and then for the volume of food that is sold and if we realise how much we are a source of fortification, then there is a huge impact on health,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Like Nigeria\u2019s situation in the 1990s, Vietnam\u2019s per generation capacity was only around 8,700 megawatts (MW) in 1990. 17 years after a major policy rethink, Vietnam\u2019s power sector has risen to around 48,000MW while Nigeria is still struggling with a long list of excuses and billion-dollar losses to show for it.\n\nVietnam, a country with a population less than half of Nigeria generates over 20,000 GWh due to a major policy rethink that revolutionised its power sector. This resulted in the commercialisation and introduction of independent power producers, with a commitment to renewable sources where possible.\n\nNigeria on the other hand has nothing but an additional 800 megawatts despite billion dollar investments and an eight-year-old privatisation exercise.\n\nUnlike Nigeria\u2019s power sector which involved changing the structure of the sector to separate generation, distribution and transmission units, Vietnam was able to effectively create investment competition in its electricity market, a development that allowed the Southeast Asian country to attract needed investments to boost generation.\n\nVietnam adopted a major policy turnaround in 2005 that provided the framework to develop a competitive power market, unbundle Electricity Vietnam, set prices that better reflect costs, promote private investment, and establish a regulatory authority.\n\n\u201cVietnam\u2019s lesson story shows Nigeria\u2019s state-centric institutions can develop the power sector with top-level government commitment, highly-qualified staff, and consensus among sector institutions,\u201d Pedro Omontuemhen, partner and energy, utilities and resources leader at PwC Nigeria said.\n\nVietnam\u2019s installed generation capacity grew from 11,578MW in 2005 to 24,500MW in 2016 with transmission and distribution losses reducing by an annual average of 0.6percent in the same period.\n\nRead also: NNPC mulls buying government-owned power plants\n\n\u201cA key strategy used in the initial stages of the electricity expansion program was the deployment of rural electrification to commercial and productive sectors of the economy,\u201d says FBNQuest, a merchant banking and asset management group in Sub-Saharan Africa\n\nIt added, \u201cGiven the importance of rice exports to the country, the earliest electrification programmes focused on connecting rice-producing regions of the country, thereby industrialising the rice production process.\u201d\n\nFindings showed Vietnamese electricity laws require national power development master plans to be adopted every ten-year period. These electricity Laws formalise the shift of the electricity sector to a market economy and diversify forms of ownership and management of electricity generation, wholesale and retail.\n\nAccording to Vietnam Electricity (EVN), a state-owned enterprise, the objective of the electricity law is to encourage the participation of all economic entities in electricity development, development of electricity sources using renewable energy, development of smart power grid and establishing grid links with neighbouring countries.\n\nIn addition, current Vietnamese regulations also provide special incentives for solar energy projects, which are entitled to an import duty exemption.\n\nFor instance, a certain Act 2068 provides incentives such as zero import duty for fixed assets of a renewable energy project, corporate income tax exemption or reduction, land rental exemption or reduction and government funding for research and technology of pilot projects.\n\n\u201cVietnam\u2019s policies are to liberalise the electricity market and encourage foreign investors to invest in the market,\u201d Omontuemhen explained.\n\nData from EVN showed most foreign investment takes the form of build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects, where a foreign investor builds a power generation project, operates it for a certain period of time to gain profits, and then transfers it to the Vietnamese Government.\n\nIt also showed as of February 2020, there were 19 BOT thermal power plant projects, with a total capacity of about 27,000 MW.\n\nAccording to Vietnam\u2019s Ministry of Industry and Trade, the government has adopted various policies to encourage the development of nuclear power.\n\nSpecifically, nuclear power stations were included in the national power development strategy for the period 2012 to 2020, according to which five nuclear power stations will be put into operation from 2020 to 2030.\n\nWhile Vietnam\u2019s forward-thinking policies seem to be yielding more fruits, Nigeria\u2019s policy formation and economic choices leave less to be desired.\n\nBusinessDay analysis shows that although Nigeria\u2019s transmission capacity has increased by 20 percent to an average of 4,200mw in the last eight years, Nigeria\u2019s population has soared by 57 percent in the last eight years from 131 million people to 206, according to the latest World Bank estimates.\n\nDespite prevailing challenges, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has in the past seven years spent over N2 trillion to keep the nation\u2019s power sector from collapse.\n\nThe interventions include Power and Aviation Intervention Fund (PAIF), hovering at about N300 billion, Nigerian Electricity Market Stabilisation Facility (NEMSF) at about N213 billion, N140 billion Solar Connection Intervention Facility, over N600 billion tariff shortfall interventions and another N120 billion intervention designed for mass metering, among others.\n\n\u201cDespite this level of intervention, the generating companies had estimated receivables of over N400 billion in 2020 alone. While the interventions have been central in ensuring the profitability of operators along the industry\u2019s value chain, they remain insufficient and unsustainable,\u201d noted Augusto & Co.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund estimates that Nigeria\u2019s economy loses about $29 billion a year because of electricity supply problems. Ninety percent of the industry provides its own power. The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria says that roughly 40 percent of the cost of production goes to power.",

          "text": "The old saying among foreign investors that \u201cif you are not in Nigeria, you are not in Africa\u201d is increasingly being confined to the past.\n\nPerhaps some government officials are the only ones still in denial that Nigeria\u2019s stature in the foreign investor community is shrinking.\n\nThe many challenges with doing business in Nigeria is responsible for spooking foreign investors away from Africa\u2019s most populous nation. That has coincided with the race by other African countries to attract investment. These smaller countries relative to Nigeria are offering investors more than Nigeria is willing to and are therefore stealing a march on the \u201cgiant of Africa\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s still unthinkable that the Japanese car maker, Toyota, chose Ghana over Nigeria in 2021 to set up its first and only West African assembly plant. For context, Nigeria is about 10 times the size of Ghana, yet it was the small country that got the nod for the plant. Never mind that Nigeria will be the prime target market for the Ghanaian operations.\n\nTo be fair, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari also did ask Ichiro Kashitani, president and chief executive officer of Toyota Tsusho Corporation, at the 7th Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD 7) in Japan, to establish an assembling plant in Nigeria.\n\nBuhari has however found out that it takes more than simply asking to get an investor to commit to an unstable economy that has been in and out of two recessions in five years (an unforced one in 2016 and a rather predictable one in 2020 due to COVID) and is unable to keep policies stable enough to ensure predictability.\n\nThis minute, you are in business in Nigeria, and the next minute you could be out by the stroke of the pen of a clueless government official who seeks to protect his ego more than the jobs of thousands of people.\n\nRead also: Investors book N41bn gain as equities market maintains positive close\n\nOther times a government policy is enough to frustrate foreign investors and send them packing. The upside for these investors is that there are growing options in other African markets.\n\nTake the case of Shoprite, Africa\u2019s largest grocer, which packed its bags from Nigeria to double down on its home market in South Africa last year after 16 years of operations in Nigeria.\n\nExiting Nigeria would have been unthinkable for a company keen on building a brand as the biggest supermarket chain on the continent. How do you achieve that without being in the continent\u2019s largest economy? Its home market is afterall only about a third of the entire population of Nigeria. These days it is very possible.\n\nThis week, the grocer published its first financial statement since exiting Nigeria, where trading profit rose by 14 percent to 5.4 billion rand ($358 million) in the six months through January 2, 2022, with trading margin improving to 6.0 percent from 5.7 percent six months prior.\n\nTrading profit at its South African supermarket business rose 16 percent to 4.9 billion rand ($319 million) in the period, which means it contributed 90.7 percent to the total profit reported by the group.\n\nHeadline earnings per share also jumped 25 percent to 519.3 cents while sales increased by 10 percent to R91 billion rand ($6 billion), with its South African supermarket business, which accounted for 80 percent of the group\u2019s sales, leading the charge with an 11 percent jump. Safe to say Shoprite is not missing Nigeria as some would have expected.\n\nEven the traditional oil and gas firms from ExxonMobil to Shell that have flocked into Nigeria for its oil are gradually pulling back on account of the various challenges in the country whether it\u2019s insecurity or the allure of other markets with better fiscal terms than Nigeria.\n\nThere\u2019s compelling evidence that a Nigerian play is no longer as vital to doing business in Africa and investors are taking note. The African Continental FreeTrade Agreement (AfCFTA) also reduces the importance of being physically present in Nigeria to succeed in Africa.\n\nNigerians will pay the ultimate price of the country becoming less of an investment destination particularly in the form of jobs. For a country whose population will surpass that of the United States by 2050 to become the third most populous nation globally, jobs are critically needed.\n\nThe current numbers make for ugly reading. An unemployment rate of 33 percent ranks Nigeria as the country with the second highest unemployment rate after Namibia. As unemployment surges, foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country is shrinking.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics reported that FDI fell to the lowest level since it started collating the data last year with a total of $698.78 million. Even Ghana now comfortably attracts three times that amount.\n\nA lack of reforms which has culminated in weak economic growth, foreign exchange volatility and a harsh business environment, are some of the reasons Nigeria has struggled to attract sufficient foreign investments since 2015.\n\nThe next government sure has its work cut out on how to make Nigeria a top investment destination not only in Africa but in emerging markets for foreign investors.",
          "summary": "The old saying among foreign investors that \u201cif you are not in Nigeria, you are not in Africa\u201d is increasingly being confined to the past.\nPerhaps some government officials are the only ones still in denial that Nigeria\u2019s stature in the foreign investor community is shrinking.\nThe many challenges with doing business in Nigeria is responsible for spooking foreign investors away from Africa\u2019s most populous nation.\nRead also: Investors book N41bn gain as equities market maintains positive closeOther times a government policy is enough to frustrate foreign investors and send them packing.\nThe next government sure has its work cut out on how to make Nigeria a top investment destination not only in Africa but in emerging markets for foreign investors.",

          "title": "INTERVIEW WITH PROFESSOR ABHUERE ON 2023 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND THE WAY FORWARD FOR EDO STATE. \u2013 Nigerian Observer",
          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nCan you tell us about yourself?\n\nOnce again, thank you. Welcome to my world. I\u2019m Professor John Abhuere currently professor of development and management. I retired, as many persons know, as director of NYSC after which I went into writing, management consultancy and lately into academics. I set up a foundation which is called Centre for Child Care and Youth development where we try to put some of the ideas we believe in into practice. We have an office in Abuja and the headquarters in Uromi. It is for that reason I\u2019m in Benin City, Edo state to see how the one in Uromi is faring.\n\nProfessor you are welcome to this interview. There are some burning issues we want you to vent your ideas on. First, it is about power rotation or zoning which ever one it is called in the political sphere of Nigeria bearing in mind the upcoming 2023 general elections. What do you have to say about power rotation in Nigeria?\n\nI\u2019m happy you raised this issue if you\u2019ve been following my writing, I\u2019m a sincere advocate of zoning and power rotation as a basis of making reasonable progress in this country, as a basis of having stability in this country, as a basis of promoting participating democracy of all citizens of this country. But for you to know why we are really passionate about zoning you, first of all know the evolution of democracy how it came about, the development so far within the democratic world e.t.c. If you remember or cast your mind back to the relevant literature we were told that democracy started in the Greek city state and the idea really was that every person should have an opportunity to participate in the development or political process of the community so that every person should gather in a community or square for them to take decision on issues that affect them but the city-states were small and people were few. So it wasn\u2019t really possible as the world continues to develop to congregate in one place. We have a situation where in the 5bc to 17th or 18th century. Lets take that big gap, you find America coming up reviewing the whole thing to have a representative democracy as opposed to monarchy which means what they are working against is the advent of dictatorship. So everyone that has been very democratic wants as much as possible, people\u2019s representation. So you find America came up with a novelty approach very different from what the Greek had about representative democracy where you will have your own representative in government making laws on your behalf.\n\nMany parts of the world have seen this variance of democracy today but the point I\u2019m trying to say is that democracy has never been static. It has been expanding, changing in definition or scope. One thing has however remained the need for people to participate. The more the better. I should correct a thing. Even when people like Abraham Lincoln defined democracy as a government of the people, by the people and for the people something of that nature. You, find out that not everyone in America was given the chance to participate. Blacks and slaves initially were not allowed to participate. Even in Greece when it started, it were the citizens that were allowed to vote.\n\nYou find out democracy as a system is where people have been struggling to participate. It took some time for the black man in America to vote. Also it took time for the woman in America and many part of the world to vote. So if you apply this theoretical background in Nigeria we find out that the British helped in establishing the kind of democracy we have with Nigerians participating in bringing it about. But you find from the beginning the democratic space was dominated by a few people the big tribe. If you look at it, again because the minority group wanted a place to participate, it saw them struggling. All this talk on Niger-delta has been there also, the tiv movement.\n\nThey were all about attempt to participate in the democratic space. We find a situation where Nigeria was moving and we began to see the need to balance up. That was why during the military administration then, take back to when Tafawa Balewa was the prime minister Nnamdi Azikiwe was the governor general, the power was being tried to balance up. Then in the military, somebody from the North trying to balance up being the head of government then Chief of staff position to South. We now came to 1993 election, the best ever conducted election that was annulled by the then military administration. Then between 1993 and 1999 there were series of conflict in this country until the same military that created the problem sat and handover. But they made sure the two most popular political parties presidential candidates end up being presented to the people from the same zone. That is why we have Abiola vs Falashe and Abiola eventually won. That alone, trying to zone the political process to the West brought enormous stability to the Yorubas to be brought to the fold and we achieve some reasonable level of development.\n\nNow, if you look at the arithmetic, we have a section of the country with evidence that for a long time they\u2019ve not been allowed to participate seriously at the highest political level in the country and that region continue to boil and what affects one region affects the other and you cannot rule that one out. Power, in a multi- cultural country like Nigeria, you cannot afford to say politics or power must go to the highest winner, no it has to be divided, it has to be zoned so that every region will have a fraction of it. In fact, the whole process of the winner takes all is wrong as power has to be proportional to the vote you won in an election. That\u2019s a matter for another day.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that if we really want stability, cooperation, development and also collective responsibility of every person to the development and promotion of national unity in this country, zoning is the answer, it is the solution to minority neglect whether at the state level or not. It is about proper power-sharing and assurance that once upon a time it will come down to your turn in many states including ours. If you don\u2019t zone power there are some minority groups that will never smell power and they belong to the same country. So do you think they will be happy?\n\nSo my own commitment to the idea of zoning or rotation of power is that it is imbibed, it is what democracy is all out to achieve. Without people trying to recognize it, if you exclude any group from power, democracy itself is being threatened. This is my submission. We may really need to sit down. This is the year we really need to think about it. 2022 is the year that will bring about 2023. So my appeal is that the people and political parties need to sit down and zone presidential candidate to the South-East. I say it again they should zone their presidential ticket to the South-East because every zone in this country has presidential material and when you really look at it again it is unfair. Injustice is the beginning of conflict in any society. A group that feels unjustly treated will always seek a way out to seek for justice. If from 1960 the great Zik can be regarded, in modern times, as the father of Nigeria nationalism, he didn\u2019t cling to political executive power. We had Ironsi he stayed in power briefly and when you look at the history of this country, if you talk about those who made their own selfless contribution to the building of this country the Ibo people come first. We can not afford to exclude them from the political process and expect peace. We can never have it.\n\nThis is not to say that there will be no competition. There will still be competition. The only thing is that it\u2019s limited to a zone such that one person will come and if somebody comes from the southeast as the president another person comes from the North or anywhere, the country will be better off. Development will have trust. These have all been destroyed because of present system of saying a dominant group must take power. It doesn\u2019t work out that way and I think I\u2019m saying this in the interest of national unity, national development and in the interest of peace in this country that is where zoning and rotation of power comes in.\n\nSo you are in variably asking that it should be entrenched in the Constitution?\n\nYeah, it is not there as a chapter but the idea of zoning is there. We are told that the federal government and the state government should ensure, in the appointment of people to offices, that the different geographical zones are represented. That is the federal character. So when you have it in structure, why is there no application in the political arena? So it is there. So the concept of citizens, participation is very germane to the success of any democratic process otherwise it\u2019s not democracy.\n\nAlright, let us look at the call by some state governors for clamp down on illegal refineries. Wike of Rivers State has been very vocal on this area asking for it to be closed down, what is your take on this sir?\n\nWell, I have looked at what people are saying on this issue. We have to be very careful. Before you embark on the pursuit of certain policies, you have to look at the context (circumstances) that led to certain things. First of all, let me clear the fact that I don\u2019t support any form of illegality. That is the point. We need to know what we are trying to do. This is an oil rich country that has consistently imported refined products into this country. We export crude oil out. There are assumptions here. How will we say we don\u2019t have the technical know-how to refine? That is why we send crude oil out or we lack the resources to do so. That is financial capital. It is very evident government has given out licences that were not utilized which means it is expensive to do or it could be an ideological reason also for saying it is cheaper to export crude oil and to import refined products. All these reasons did not allow us to have what I will call meeting the supply and demand of the country. The meaning is that there is a huge gap to be filled in economics of development. The moment there is a demand, there will be supply. It is natural. What we are having in Nigeria is a gap that allow the growth of illegal refineries but the question you have to ask yourself is in an economy that there is hopeless unemployment, is it the correct thing to actually be closing so-called refineries. The wrong impression is given you know.\n\nThat reminds me of the illicit gin of those days. They say the gin produce in sapele is raw. No, the point is this we need to produce to have more employment, we need to produce to have more to consume at home. We give the false impression that we cannot actually produce oil but we have seen from all memos that during the Biafra war, families were producing petroleum from their backyard. So the technology is there. What I expect us to do is this rather than clamping them down, it is to invite them to a meeting, take census, give them conditions and study what can be done.\n\nI think the government promised modular refineries, where are they? So we are crying in this country that we lack technical know how, we lack the capacity and we are seeing a group. Whether they like it or not am more interested in trying to know something about the quality. Is the product they are coming out with useable and how could government tax them and tap them into the economic mainstream. These are the issues I think Governor Wike and co should sit down also with the federal government and see that these people have it. Do we actually need to carry out over \u2013 regimented regulation of the sector? No! If this people really have the technology and it is as simple and they can produce, it will be better for the country to tap into it and help them improve their system, empower them if our borders were well-manned, smuggling itself will go down, the market for illegal refineries will not be there. We have to, first of all, do our home work. I know that people are burning some of their houses. They are being driven underground and I\u2019m saying the more you do this one, the more they go underground, so they become more dangerous. I don\u2019t see or encourage sabotage but I do think that they have some technology, some knowledge, you know, to sell and that the best thing is for the government to tap unto the existing technology to see what can be done to improve the sector.\n\nProfessor thank you so much for dwelling on the usefulness of bringing operators of illegal refineries together. That is harmonise, rather than destroying them or chasing them out of existence. We want to look at another issue very important in Nigeria. The youths. The number is increasing and they have challenges. The country is blessed with a lot of human resources among them are youths. As it is today, how do you perceive the Nigerian youth vis a vis the prospect of the country?\n\nWell this is a very important question. In my book the \u201cPower of Youth\u201d I try to explain why we must invest in the youth. Let\u2019s take a simple theoretical perspective of the youth. They can be defined as an idealistic human being who aspires for the best of a society and the meaning of this is that the youth can easily be bought into something that is good and could also easily rebel when what you have told them is the standard is being deviated from. Almost every protest we\u2019ve had take this nature. They are idealistic and they now express disappointment.\n\nAnother aspect is that youths can actually be always educated to be positive. In other words, we have two aspects or sides of the youth; positive side and the negative side. Negative side is when you don\u2019t give them opportunity to create or participate, to beat their own knowledge e.t.c. and the positive comes out when you create opportunities. So you find out that the easiest ways to really mobilize youths are through education, employment. Education which can\u2019t come from the family could come from the government, also the school. But you must find them employment to engage themselves because as they say the idle man is the devil\u2019s workshop. The youths also need empowerment in the direction the society wants to go.\n\nThis means creating opportunities. Take for instance, government can\u2019t do it alone. We do know that. Look at Nollywood, opportunities it has created for young people. So if government can even, in each of the states, build three or four stadia for people to learn how to play tennis, golf, cricket and engage in other sports it is already empowering them. So coming back now, what I\u2019m trying to say is that unless there\u2019s a deliberate policy to improve the youth in nation-building activities in a very creative way, many of them will be doomed.\n\nOkay now, the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) is a very good example of what you can do with young people and how best to utilize young people. They are there serving under the sun and in the rain also because they have been made to behave that way. They see the benefit towards it.\n\nSo in 2022, we are looking at 2023 facing the role of young people in election most especially, members of NYSC who go to serve as officials during elections. Many have been recruited as thugs. Many recruited for bad purposes by the elite. So the first thing is to focus on each party to ensure that in 2022 the mind of the youths should be addressed to play more positive roles. They should be addressed to support the party they feel will win. What even stops the youths supporting one party heavily in order to secure some positions within that party and see if and when the candidate wins, the candidate will be friendly with youth-beneficial programs.\n\nI\u2019m trying to say that the zoning system I mentioned before, if the youth can be made to see the benefit of it, if the youth can made to see that democracy pays also if the youth are made to participate in campaign against corruption during election and development program that can make society grow like promotion of positive value and discipline in the society, it will be better off.\n\nThere is no doubt at all government must be ready to spend or to invest much more in the youth than they are presently doing and you cannot ask somebody that is hungry to go to the moon when there is nothing on ground. If you don\u2019t provide employment, for example, the temptation of the youth falling for anything available is very, very high. They can be recruited into banditry, terrorism, fraud because at that particular time what is available to them is better than what they have which becomes more attractive and if you have bothered to know what happens in terrorist camp you will know that they spend so much money in trying to win their heart.\n\nIt takes real ideological conviction or faithful belief when you go throw a missile and die that there\u2019s heaven waiting for you, which is a kind of brain-washing. I\u2019m not saying that the Nigerian youth should be so brainwashed, I\u2019m saying if you give employment to the Nigerian youth and proper empowerment to do certain things like we are talking about illegal refineries, you call them together and give proper supervision to the youth. If done, this year they will be better even in 2023 especially during the conduct of the general election.\n\nSir, we have to digress a little from the issues of youths to the intervention of state in the economic process of the Nigerian state. What do you have to say about it?\n\nNigeria, in my view, is a victim of wrong ideological position. You see, the state during Obasanjo\u2019s administration, people will tell you the government has no business with the states, marketing. The government investment in business failed all over. It lost a foundation.\n\nThe state was formed for two primary purpose. Firstly, to give you protection. Secondly, security of life and property, then to create an atmosphere for you to realize your objective in life in terms of welfare. Now when you take it from that position you find out that the state, even from the beginning, was supposed to sit people down to say okay let\u2019s surrender these powers to one strong person that will ensure that they will be free trade, security and others.\n\nAlso, let somebody tell me the state that has developed in this world without government intervention. America is a very good model because it sat down and say look we want to form a country and if you look at the first hundred years of America, even till this moment, America government laid the foundation of railway, telecommunication, city-building and others. So now, the meaning of this is that if there is infrastructure, you just have to make sure that this is a community. There is water, there is electricity, there are good roads and when these are already done, individuals can come and tap into this and ensure the development of that community.\n\nWe cannot in a way run state determination. However, what happened was that around the 1970s, because the argument of whether the state should intervene or not was there when Adams Smith said the wealth of nation is dependent on the free trade across borders. He was projecting an ideological position and if you look at the literature of that period too you will find people who opposed to Adams Smith\u2019s thesis saying that it was wrong and that the state has a role to play and you cannot afford open all your borders to free trade. We see it today. America still controls its borders. Now in the 1970\u2019s, especially Margaret Thatcher in England stated that her father has always been a conservative all her life. She had groceries, her economic outlook contrilled by a private person she never ever liked, so she came up with the idea that it\u2019s very wrong for the economic activities to be in government hand and that government is too inefficient. Now Reagan came up in America supported the idea of free trade and they were able to buy the press and use the western press to support the idea that free market-base approach is really worth it.\n\nTake Nigeria, where are the private men the rich men? Count them they are there and even the rich private men, they got the money from the government in the first instance. So we really have not got the capital base to say we should do our things ourselves at this level. When government gave licenses for, at least, I think 11 and later 20 refineries, did Nigeria have the capital to establish? No they didn\u2019t and those licenses were there so we have to have the capital.\n\nSecondly, historically, when you tell the state not to participate, who will do the infrastructure development that bring, about other development. Thirdly, if you take the census of private people who had invested and loss compare it to the government own is inconsequential. Everyday people invest and loose their own capital. They are not told not to invest again, or why not sit down say why did government firms fail in Nigeria. I have personally looked at it I found out that the reason is politics you set up a multi-million or multi-billion naira enterprise instead of you to go out to look for the best hand whether it\u2019s in Jerusalem to help you run it you say no it must be an Esan man that Esan man doesn\u2019t have it, or it must be a Kanuri person who doesn\u2019t have it, no thinking of competence or about the investment being made. It doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\nThe person has to know it. That\u2019s why me, I\u2019m very crazy about capacity- building. If you don\u2019t have it you don\u2019t have it. Okay take a pen write with your left hand if you will be able to write with it. You won\u2019t be able but the person who can will take the pen and write with the left hand. Capacity building is there. That was the secret of Awolowo, that\u2019s the secret of America, that\u2019s the secret of China.\n\nWhat are we talking about here. We had a kind of ideological mis-step especially in the 1980\u2019s when Babaginda came into power. He started experimenting market economy, it just didn\u2019t work out so why don\u2019t we have the courage. When this administration came, I wrote. Then Obey Ezekwesili suggested government shouldn\u2019t set up a national airways I said government should set it up even if that can give job to three people alone, it is enough but we will keep on developing ourselves. Eight years almost gone. We\u2019ve not been able to establish one whereas nothing stops a local government from investing or having a small refinery or from conquering the bush and making a huge agricultural land and engage competent youths to work.\n\nThe train has come now. What stop the state government from constructing a railway from Benin City to Uromi, Benin City to warri, Benin City to Asaba then you see the ease of movement of goods and services. We have killed the best instrument or regulated the instrument we had in development by saying the state has no role to play. The state\u2019s major role is development. It has a duty to lead development. This doesn\u2019t mean that it should not allow private sector.\n\nThe China that is developed today there are companies that are government- owned operated under the private sector skills. Take one Kobo in China and see if you will not be executed, you will! For financial crimes they send messages to your family for you to commit suicide and if you fail they execute you.\n\nThese are issues we should really think about, what should we do and this is the message whether the federal or state government, it must be prepared to invest in the infrastructure development of this country and as much as possible in areas they think are critical to economic survival and development of this country, that\u2019s number one.\n\nTwo, we need a system where the economy is free and open to both the private sector and the government, in other words, to all that are willing and capable without any hindrance. In other words, if Mr. A is capable of going into this office let him do it, if the government has the capability let it go and do it. Absence of such arrangements or understanding is what is killing the economy.\n\nThree, development should be seeing as a deliberate act to enhance the wealth of an individual and the community he lives. So if my community is so far away and there is no lucky person that is rich, my community should be develop, the local government should ensure development. We can\u2019t fold the hands of the state government and expect development to come.\n\nThe private sector all over the world has no business other than trying to make profit for itself. In economics, when you teach you say they create value. What value are they creating. Value that enhances their personality. That is why America talks about individualism which is about you having a right to produce and get the whole world to yourself. Throw it back to the ocean it doesn\u2019t matter anymore because it\u2019s your own. We are now saying yes you can create all these things let the state also create it\u2019s own. If you like, you may decide to throw this away whereas the state will like its own production given to the human being.\n\nSo what I\u2019m trying to say by my constant preaching on state intervention is that the state should wake up to its responsibility, first and foremost, in protecting people and producing condition for them to develop. You don\u2019t run away from your responsibility under the pretense of one ideological reasoning. So when you say the state shouldn\u2019t, they are all deceiving themselves. We are saying time has come if we say, vote you for a position, if you know unemployment of 20% this year you should allow it go down to 5% and you can\u2019t do anything without investing in the country. So the truth is that the state has a responsibility.\n\nLong before the internet do you know how much America invested in the development of internet. So what it means is the state must not go to sleep with the pretense that it has no business. That idea is just the imagination of some people in Europe who have no idea on how societies in Africa are run. True, we are so poor that the real instrument we have is the state. Yet the government is to bring about the centre of activities and raise money to carry out projects. We need to sit down and look for competent hands, the right hand. There\u2019s nothing stopping the government from investing. For instance, what is it doing in NNPC, is it not a public establishment, why are they carrying our mineral exploration? So government should be asked to do the needful for us.\n\nYou have exhaustively dealt with the issue of state intervention. Lastly sir, we also want you to give a piece or two advice to the Edo state government in its effort to redefine governance and introduce reforms into the state civil service?\n\nI will say this one without any bias. Every person knows me and my development approach of Obaseki. This explains why I wrote and supported him during the election. One thing visible you can\u2019t take from him is that he has a kind of architectural taste, the new buildings. Like the John Odigie Oyegun Civil Service Academy building, it\u2019s a very beautiful piece of work. But then as for the reforms in the civil service, we need to be very careful when we are talking about reforms. What I think we need is general agenda where people say, okay thirty years time, non of us will be around but we know an agenda has been set towards which every person will be walking to and the reform that I will want is a reform that is based on capacity-building that will be about the skills of the civil and public servant to enable him deliver.\n\nTwo, to actually create a sense of pride. What I want call \u2018ideological orientation\u2019 of the average Edolite such that they see themselves as belonging to the same entity. I remember in the days of Bendel, we were Bendelites, There was that pride whether you are in Warri, Asaba. When it comes to sport we were always winning, so we need to create that sense of pride and loyalty to Edo state by it\u2019s citizens.\n\nThen three, the environment of work needs to be made conducive you know because, why I\u2019m always suspicious of reform is that it is always a disguise way of down-sizing. We may down-size the houses but it has many implications. It could create disaffection within the family, it could make sure that people, who hitherto were supportive, are alienated and it could lead to no result, no gainful result. If you enhance the environment in which an individual works, you enhance his skills, knowledge, competence and you promote his sense of fulfillment in terms of pride and belonging.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that for me, the little I have seen, I like his development approach, his strategies that try to reach every corners of the state but this reform is easy, it easier to say reform than to actually get the benefit of reform for a number of reasons; cultural resistance, lack of funds to do the right thing, lack of the vision and ability to carry out or drive it. These are issues but result can be achieved, like I said, through capacity-building (training the individual.).\n\nWhen we can now train dog to catch thief, to catch criminals then you can think of what human beings can do if given decent training, training is it, Like I usually say if you don\u2019t know how to write with your left hand you have to be trained on how to write with your left, if you are right hand person that is my basic example. So you have to train.\n\nThen the condition in which you work if it is not conducive you can\u2019t produce any change. The tools to work are very, very critical. If the tools are not there you cannot perform magic. This is the thing. Then, my advice infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure. the aim should be that each community in Edo-State should have at least water, should have electricity, should have roads. How this is going to be done is a subject for another day. If he consults me I will tell him what should be done because that\u2019s my area of interest, I wish the state luck and a prosperous 2022.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nTHE stage is gradually set for the ultimate senatorial slot for 2023 general election as Ehia Olu Akhabue stages pragmatic stake for Edo Central Senatorial District.\n\nThe uniqueness of his ideas for equitable representation, his seminal thoughts on prodigious community development, his forthrightnesss in articulation of our collective aspiration and the tellingly magnificent road map for actualising it is more than enough to endear the humane people of Esanland to his vision.\n\nHis experiences, spanning over two decades in management of human and industries, home and abroad signposted him as the \u2018primus inter pares\u2019 and clearly a shining star in the political wilderness of the Nigerian State.\n\nInterestingly, history has been magnanimous with the Esan people, having endowed them with the best and brightest as demonstrated by the likes of Chief Anthony Enahoro, Ambrose Alli, Chief Tony Anenih, Christopher Abebe, Comrade Elijah Okougbo of blessed memory and many more.\n\nWithout a doubt, his senatorial aspiration has changed the dynamics of the political superstructure of Edo Central Senatorial District where in recent past, our sons and daughters have been hoisting themselves up for political offices without integrity, required principles and solid agenda for viable and enduring community development.\n\nFor Akhabue, he has resolved to pursue and prosecute the objectives contained in his evergreen Manifesto of Service which is critically built on four fundamental pillars, namely; provision of Water Supply In Edo Central Senatorial District, Formidable Security Architecture to meet the challenges posed by criminal elements, Investment in manpower development/Skills Acquisition, lastly, linking Rural Communities to Urban Centres thereby promoting rural \u2013 urban Integration.\n\nMany of the rural communities in Edo Central have no good roads, infact, they are such in a terrible state of disrepair that farmers face serious difficulties in getting their produce out of the communities to market places in urban areas. The implication of this is that the communities are almost cut off from cities. Akhabue\u2019s mission in the Senate is clear on this, which includes but not limited to ensuring that many roads across Esanland are rehabilitated and reconstructed with the allocations for the constituency projects across board.\n\nIn the past, part of the drawbacks have been that meagre resources allocated for projects are not equitably and fairly distributed in all the five local government areas and this has somewhat created apathy and mistrust between the electorate and the politicians. That is part of what Engr Akhabue is out to restructure to the utmost benefits of everyone in Esanland. Once that is done, in addition to the water project, the people would have achieved a reasonable level of rural \u2013 urban fusion.\n\nInterestingly, Engr Akhabue thorough study of every inch of Esanland has laid bare the factors militating against rural growth and peace and stability as there can\u2019t be peace in the midst of chaos and poverty. He has mapped out development strategies for the district to be better managed as soon as he\u2019s elected into the Senate, using data to aggregate the numbers of households, streets, communities and the cities put together, comprehensively.\n\nThis is where Engr Akhabue\u2019s mandate is a collective one and truly altruistic. Having used data for several organisations to improve community planning and delivery of public and private services, as well as help measure progress toward Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) elsewhere, domesticating same for our people in Esanland has become his primary objective as we progress gradually towards 2023 general election. And for Esan people \u2013 baring our history \u2013 can\u2019t ask for less.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

We have a security information database where we record security incidents in the state.\n\n\u201cFrom it, we discovered that there is a correlation between drug use and the incidence of insecurity. The local government where we have the highest incidence of drug use also has the highest incidence of criminality and insecurity.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe must tackle illicit drugs by firming up regulations and strengthening structures and institutions within government and the profession to have more control over the use of drugs in the country. We must begin to work together to achieve this great task over the use of drugs.\u201d\n\nReassuring the government\u2019s commitment to ensuring quality and efficient healthcare delivery to Edo people, the governor said, \u201cWe can no longer centralize healthcare services in the state as our strategy and plan is now to decentralize the healthcare system.\n\n\u201cWe cannot have a central hospital anymore. We must have primary healthcare hospitals across the state to enable our citizens to easily reach healthcare services. Secondary care would be ensured by collaborating and investing in specialist care through specialist hospitals that will be referral centres for our primary healthcare network.\u201d\n\nCalling for the collaboration of pharmacists to provide quality primary healthcare to Edo people, the governor noted that pharmacists are the first port of call for citizens, adding, \u201cIf we have a well-established network of care, we would be able to deal with the issue of adulterated medicine as it will help checkmate illicit drugs. Edo wants to become the nation\u2019s healthcare hub.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the President of PSN, Pharm. Cyril Usifoh commended the governor for prioritizing the health sector, noting, \u201cI thank you for taking healthcare issues seriously by establishing the Edo Health Insurance Scheme to take care of the health of the people of the state. We urge you to reactivate the task force for counterfeit drugs and medicines to check illicit drugs and save the people from abusing drugs.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Managing Director of Edo Health Insurance, Mr. Rock Amegor said the state is working on how to improve drugs supply chain system in Primary Healthcare Centres (PHCs) and integrate it into the state\u2019s health insurance system.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "Constitution Amendment: Plot to make settlers indigenes of host communities ill thought \u2013 Group",
          "text": "Leading advocacy group, the Gravitas Group for Good Governance, otherwise known as 4G, has kicked against a proposal in the constitutional amendment bill making settlers indigenes of host communities after five of settlement.\n\nThe group also rejected what it identified as a similar provision in the proposed law, currently being considered in the national assembly, ceding control of local government areas to the federal government.\n\nThe Gravitas Group, which made its position known in a statement on Thursday by High Chief Tola Adeniyi, its convener, described as \u201cill-digested thought,\u201d the idea that all that is needed to become a Nigerian citizen and by extension an indigene of a \u201cfraudulently created local government\u201d is the possession of a \u201cuseless paper devised through an equally fraudulently devised NIN number.\u201d\n\nThe group argued that the provision was another evident that the \u201cfaceless Cabal and its insidious Think-Tank have reared their poisonous heads again, this time striking at the very jugular of the Nigerian ramshackle unification.\u201d\n\nIn the statement titled \u201cThe Senate, the Local Governments and Booby-traps\u201d High Chief Adeniyi, a veteran columnist, author and former managing director of the Daily Times of Nigeria, said the group \u201creceived with rude shock the release of the Rubber-Stamp Nigerian Senate on the outcome of the charade called Constitution Amendment.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIn the said Release the fraudulently created 774 Local Governments in Nigeria will now be reporting directly to the Unitary Government headquarters in Abuja. Councillors and Chairmen will henceforth be \u2018elected\u2019 by agents of the Dictatorship at the Centre. Chairmen of Local Governments will henceforth carry their beggar-bowls like the state governors to collect monthly allocation from Abuja.\u201d\n\nThe statement further noted that, \u201cThe release also for curious, but obvious reasons confers \u2018indigeneship\u2019 of any state on anyone who has spent 5 years in a state\u2026so that such a person can vote and be voted for, and for any position, in the adopted state.\n\n\u201cWe have always held a strong view that knives can\u2019t carve their own handles. The Senate or indeed the National and State Assemblies, and the entire 4 Estates of the Realm are creations of the Constitution. They are direct beneficiaries of a Constitution. A child can\u2019t create or recreate his own father. Constitution Amendments must pass through the rigours of a Plebiscite. Besides, Nigeria does not have a Peoples\u2019 Constitution at the moment. What the country is operating with is a Military Government Decree! And it was a decree seriously screwed and shamelessly self-serving.\n\n\u201cNigeria is the only federation in the world where the Centre creates or controls local governments! Local governments/councils/counties are created by State/Provincial Governments all over the world. The Prime Minister of the Federation of Canada has no control whatsoever over the Toronto Metropolitan Council. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has no control over the London City Council. They derive their independence from the powers granted them by the State or Provincial Government.\n\n\u201cNigerians cannot be deceived any longer. The hidden Agenda behind this Local Government booby-trap is to have the Unitary Government, which is the Paymaster, to dictate the tune for piper-Chairmen of Local Governments. More dangerous than that is the long-held desire to weaken all the constituents of the so-called federation and sustain a Monster at the Centre. Creation of many unviable states has already weakened indigenous nationalities while the creation of 774 mushroom local governments has nailed the coffin of any opposition to arbitrary unitarism and fiendish oligarchy.\n\n\u201cThe most ridiculous part of this Local Government trick is like asking all departmental heads in the federal Universities to by-pass their Vice Chancellors and march to the Finance Minister for disbursements to their departments!\n\n\u201cWhat the terribly flawed Local government amendment seeks to achieve is brutal destruction of nationality demography of Nigerian space. Egypt, our proud cradle of Civilization used to be peopled by \u2018black\u2019 people practicing their Sun-based religion\u2026then Christians from Roman Empire invaded the place and turned the country to nearly 100% Christians. The Arabs invaded the place, occupied it, and irreparably changed the demography and turned the country to almost 100% Muslims!\n\n\u201cIn no distant future, if Rugarites achieve their objective, and if the madmen toying with nuclear bombs have not destroyed the world, those allocated free citizenships and indigene status to will overrun original indigenous nationalities and one would begin to see Sultan of Ile-Ife, Emir of Owerri, Emir of Ijebu-Ode, Emir of Oturkpo, and maybe Obi of Sokoto and Awujale of Kano. And Alhaji Gwandu Batagarawa will be Governor of Akwa Ibom.\n\n\u201cIt is very important, urgent, and imperative to challenge the composition of the Senate and the House of Representatives if credibility were ever to be attached to any vote taken in those chambers. Sokoto state used to have 3 Senatorial seats. Kano state used to have 3 Senatorial seats while Lagos also had 3. With the carving of Sokoto and Kano to 6 states, those 2 states, as amended, now have18 seats, And Lagos with its verified 25 million human populations is starved with just 3 seats! Just imagine the incredible disproportion.\n\n\u201cWe have said it times without number that the insults, humiliation, impunity and the nauseating arrogance of the cabal which had unduly put a clog on Nigeria\u2019 march to civilization, development and modernity could only thrive and succeed with the active connivance of collaborators and beneficiaries from across the country. The moment the 95% oppressed and repressed people of this country say \u2018enough is enough\u2019, the less than 5% would jump into the sea! History is our witness.\n\n\u201cIt is worth repeating for the umpteenth time that while the whole country, as evidenced by public pronouncements of all the state Governors, the National Assembly, State Assemblies, monarchs and even the Vice President that State Police should be instituted without delay to combat unprecedented terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, ritual killings and allied vices, a tiny, block-headed cabal simply killed the prospect! What a country!!\n\n\u201cGravitas Group for Good Governess calls on all those whose conscience is against this march to total domination and ruination of indigenous nationalities to rise up with courage and undo this calamitous Bill. There is no sense in postponing the doomsday.\u201d",

          "title": "Ebonyi: Declare Me Gov, PDP\u2019s Nominee, Igariwey, Tells INEC",
          "text": "Following the judgement of a Federal High Court in Abuja, which sacked the Ebonyi State governor, David Unahi, for defecting from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC), the replacement put forward by the PDP, Hon Iduma Igariwey has asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to immediately declare him the governor of Ebonyi State.\n\nIgariwey, a member of the House of Representatives while addressing journalists on Thursday in Abuja, said the judgment expressly directed INEC to receive names of candidates from the PDP to replace Umahi and his deputy, Kelechi Igwe, as the governor and deputy governor of Ebonyi State, respectively.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe lauded the PDP for swftly submitting his name and Fred Udogu to INEC, as governor and deputy governor respectively, to replace Governor Umahi and his deputy, in compliance with the order of court.\n\nThe lawmaker, who represents Afiko North/Afikpo South federal constituency, said without a stay of execution of the judgment from a court of competent jurisdiction, Umahi should step down immediately as going to appeal does not stop obeying the court order.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said Umahi\u2019s continued occupation of the office of governor two days after the judgment was in contempt of the court.\n\nIgariwey said, \u201cTwo days ago, specifically on the 8th day of March 2022, His Lordship Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court Abuja, delivered two judgements concerning Ebonyi State. One is suit No FHC/ABJ/CS/920/2021: The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) v. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and 3 others. The other is suit No FHC/ABJ/CS/1041/2021: The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) v. INEC and 20 others.\n\n\u201cIn the first suit, whose crux is the defection of Governor Umahi and his Deputy from the PDP to the APC, the Court ordered Umahi and his deputy to vacate their seats, and restrained both of them from further parading themselves as Governor and Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State, respectively.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIn the other suit, the Court sacked and declared the seats of 15 of the 24 member Ebonyi State House of Assembly vacant, on the same grounds the Governor was removed.\n\n\u201cAt this point, let me thank our party, the Peoples Democratic Party, for the expeditious manner they have taken steps to give effect to the judgment of Justice Inyang Ekwo. This important first step was taken by the party when they submitted the names of Hon. Iduma Igariwey and Fred Udogu to INEC, as Governor and Deputy Governor respectively, to replace Governor Umahi and his deputy, in compliance with the order of Court.\n\n\u201cApart from the order directing Governor Umahi and his deputy to vacate their offices, the court, inter alia, also directed INEC to immediately receive from the PDP the names of its candidates to replace Governor David Umahi and his Deputy, and to declare those names submitted by the PDP, as the Governor and Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State.\n\n\u201cWhile we acknowledge that INEC is in receipt of the communication from the National Chairman of the PDP, we call on INEC as a critical pillar of our constitutional democracy, to comply expeditiously with all the consequential orders of the court, particularly, by declaring the names submitted by the PDP as Governor and Deputy Governor. This, the INEC is expected to do, by issuing Certificates of Return.\n\n\u201cFrom the clear and unambiguous order made by Justice Inyang Ekwo, it is an incontrovertible fact that Governor Umahi ceased to be Governor of Ebonyi State on the 8th day of March 2022. Two days after this judgment, Mr Umahi and his deputy still parade themselves as if they still occupy those offices. This is, to say the very least, contemptuous of the clear orders of a court of competent jurisdiction. We recognise the fact that former Governor David Umahi has a right of appeal.\n\n\u201cHowever, until the entire appeal process is exhausted, and in the absence of any order staying the operation of Justice Ekwo\u2019s Judgment, Mr Umahi remains sacked, a former Governor, who should desist from any conduct that threatens the peace of Ebonyi State, or diminishes over constitutional democracy.\n\n\u201cIn the eye of the law, therefore, I, Rt Hon. Iduma Enwo Igariwey and Chief Fred Udogu, are the recognised Governor and Deputy Governor of Ebonyi State, respectively, effective the 8th day of March 2022.\n\n\u201cAt this point, let me take liberty and address some of the very disturbing comments credited to Mr Umahi in his official reaction to Justice Ekwo\u2019s twin Judgments. Umahi\u2019s reaction, by way of a speech titled \u2018I am still the Governor of Ebonyi State\u2019 was, true to Umahi\u2019s imperial character, a cocktail of attacks, insults, intemperate and highly incendiary expletives, against a judge of competent jurisdiction and the Judiciary as an institution.\n\n\u201cUmahi had described Justice Inyang Ekwo\u2019s judgment as \u2018purchased\u2019, vowed not to obey the judgment, called on his supporters to disregard the judgment, to \u2018laugh over the judgment\u2019, a \u2018useless judgment\u2019 by a \u2018hatchet man\u2019.\n\n\u201cAlthough many well-meaning and patriotic Nigerians have called out Umahi to condemn his wild and incomprehensible incivility, yet, to us Ebonyians, we understand too well that imperial Umahi was only being himself. Have Nigerians suddenly forgotten Umahi\u2019s many battles with the press in Ebonyi State? Just about a year ago, Umahi \u2018banished for life from Ebonyi Government House\u2019, a number of journalists \u2013 Peter Okutu, Chijoke Agwu and others \u2013 for writing stories he did not like.\n\n\u201cIn 2021, Umahi sent thugs to attack a sitting court in Abakaliki and chase away other judges from their court rooms, for delivering a judgment he considered not favourable. It stands to reason that geographical distance is probably what is saving Justice Ekwo from Umahi\u2019s physical assault and harm. This is unacceptable and disgraceful, to say the very least.\n\n\u201cYesterday and today, former Governor Umahi, in continuing contempt of Justice Inyang Ekwo\u2019s judgment which had since removed him from office, is further depleting the scarce resources of Ebonyi people by bossing poverty stricken Ebonyi people from their villages to the state capital, to demonstrate against Justice Ekwo\u2019s judgment. For Ebonyians who know him very well, this is vintage David Umahi.\n\n\u201cHe will deploy all manner of subterfuge and blackmail, to hang onto power, in clear contempt of the order of court that has since removed him from office. To Ebonyi people, your joy and jubilation across the length and breadth of the state upon news that David Umahi has been sacked came to me as no surprise. It is, indeed, a new dawn! You have suffocated enough, and your freedom is near. I assure you that the Party will deploy every legal means to actualise your freedom as symbolised by Justice Inyang Ekwo\u2019s judgment. The era of running Ebonyi State as Umahi, sons and brothers Nigeria Ltd, is soon over. The days of indiscriminate arrests, kidnappings, disappearances and murder in secret detention facilities in Ebonyi State Government House, will soon be a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cI urge Ebonyi people to remain calm and peaceful, and go about their normal livelihoods, while civil servants are encouraged to remain vigilant. Security Agencies, the Police, DSS and NSCDC are urged to secure the state by protecting lives and property. This also includes government Property and assets.\n\n\u201cFinally, on a personal note, I and my Deputy would like to thank our great party, the PDP, and our stakeholders from Ebonyi State, for the honour of submitting our names to INEC. We feel honoured, and assure the party and Ebonyians, that the task of redeeming and rescuing Ebonyi State from former Governor Dave Umahi\u2019s brigandage and misrule, is a mission that must be quickly accomplished.\u201d",

He must resign.\u201d\n\nHe called on NANS not to relent in its struggle until the Federal Government and ASUU live up to their obligations to keep public universities open and functional.",

The publicity this time derives from the revelation made by popular Nollywood actress Kemi Afolabi.\n\nThe actress said her doctor told her she will only live for five years after being diagnosed with the incurable disease.\n\nThis made it necessary for PM News to do some findings and educate our readers on Lupus.\n\nWhat is Lupus?\n\nLupus is a disease that occurs when your body\u2019s immune system attacks your own tissues and organs (autoimmune disease).\n\nThe disease is more common in Africans, African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans.\n\nIt is common in women, affects people of all ages but is mostly diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 45.\n\nInflammation caused by lupus can affect many different body systems \u2014 including joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, brain, heart, and lungs.\n\nThe sad part is that the disease has no cure but treatments can help control symptoms.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of Lupus?\n\nThe common signs and symptoms include Fatigue, Fever, Joint pain, stiffness, and swelling.\n\nOthers include a butterfly-shaped rash on the face that covers the cheeks and bridge of the nose or rashes elsewhere on the body, skin lesions that appear or worsen with sun exposure, fingers and toes that turn white or blue when exposed to cold or during stressful periods, Shortness of breath, Chest pain, Dry eyes, Headaches, confusion, memory loss, and hair loss.\n\nLupus can be difficult to diagnose because its signs and symptoms often mimic those of other ailments.\n\nHowever, it is better to quickly see the doctor when there is unexplained rash, ongoing fever, persistent aching, or fatigue.\n\nCauses\n\nIt appears that people with an inherited predisposition for lupus may develop the disease when they come into contact with something in the environment that can trigger lupus.\n\nThe cause of lupus in most cases, however, is unknown. Some potential triggers include:\n\nSunlight: Exposure to the sun may bring on lupus skin lesions or trigger an internal response in susceptible people.\n\nInfections: Having an infection can initiate lupus or cause a relapse in some people.\n\nMedications: Lupus can be triggered by certain types of blood pressure medications, anti-seizure medications, and antibiotics.\n\nPeople who have drug-induced lupus usually get better when they stop taking the medication. Rarely, symptoms may persist even after the drug is stopped.\n\nHaving lupus also increases your risk of\n\nInfection: People with lupus are more vulnerable to infection because both the disease and its treatments can weaken the immune system.\n\nCancer: Having lupus appears to increase your risk of cancer; however, the risk is small.\n\nBone tissue death: This occurs when the blood supply to a bone declines, often leading to tiny breaks in the bone and eventually to the bone\u2019s collapse.\n\nPregnancy complications: Women with lupus have an increased risk of miscarriage.\n\nLupus increases the risk of high blood pressure during pregnancy and preterm birth. To reduce the risk of these complications, doctors often recommend delaying pregnancy until your disease has been under control for at least six months.\n\nSource: Mayo Clinic",

It is the duty of the Commission to properly guide the party, just as it will do to any of the opposition parties\u201d, the Source further stressed.",

          "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House of Representatives has charged Nigeria\u2019s security agencies to ensure the enforcement of the banditry proscription order of the federal government.\n\nThe September 2021 Proscription Order published in the official gazette 108, declared the activities of bandits and similar groups as terrorism and proscribed in any part of Nigeria.\n\n\n\nThe House also mandated the security agencies to rise up and curb the rising killing of innocent persons across Benue communities, especially those on the border with Nasarawa state.\n\n\n\nThe resolution came Thursday following adoption of a motion on: \u201cNeed to stop the renewed increasing terrorist attacks and gruesome killings by armed herdsmen and bandits in Benue communities,\u201d sponsored by Hon. Benjamin Mzondu.\n\nThe lawmaker stated that suspected herdsmen and bandits unleashed terror on a community in his Constituency Monday, killing five persons and leaving several others with different degrees of injuries.\n\nHe further disclosed that the suspected herdsmen and bandits attacked settlements in Guma local government area of the state in the early hours of Thursday (today) and killed six persons and injured 20 people.\n\n\n\nThe lawmaker expressed concern about \u201cthe suspicious collusion of Army and other security agencies in the attacks, as an Army unit is stationed less than five kilometers from the location of the where the herdsmen and bandits operated for more than two hours without any intervention from security agencies.\u201d\n\nThe attacks\n\nBlueprint reports that the latest attack claimed four lives at River Ake in Ye village, along Daudu-Gbajimba road and two others at Branch Udei in Guma local government area of the state.\n\n\n\nThe council chairman of Guma local government, Caleb Abba, said the people killed at Ake fish pond, usually occupy the banks of the fish pond during the dry season.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey go there and make temporary tents where they fish and process it to dry,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nHe said the assailants also attacked branch Udei, killed two people and injured many who had been taken to a nearby health centre.\n\n\n\nThe suspected herders, who invaded the villages in the early hours, were believed to have crossed over from a neighbouring state into Benue to wreck the havoc on the innocent villagers.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Fulani terrorists according to residents had earlier issued a threat to the Tse Torkula community, asking them to leave the village or face dire consequences.\n\n\u201cThey came on motorcycles and without any herd of cattle.\n\n\n\n\u201cTorkula is the ancestral home of the late Tor Tiv IV, HRM Alfred Akawe Torkula\n\n\n\n\u201cThe invaders who attacked Branch Udei and Ake fish Pond were said to have first of all shot sporadically into the air before breaking into the houses of their victims who were already fast asleep,\u201d the council chair added.\n\nThere were renewed Fulani terrorist attacks on border communities in Benue state with heavy casualties on the Benue side.\n\n\n\nThe suspected killer-herdsmen Tuesday, March 8th, 2022, killed over five persons in the Ahentse, Nzorov council ward of the state and wounded others now receiving treatment in nearby hospitals.\n\nOrtom calls on FG\n\nGovernor Samuel Ortom, while reacting to the recent attack, reiterated his call on the federal government to step up security operations along the crises areas of the state.\n\n\n\nHe cautioned that \u201cthe patience of the people who are now victims and rendered homeless by the murderous activities of the Fulani militia should not be tested any longer.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe should not push the victims into looking for self-help because this will not be good for the unity of this country.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI have repeatedly called on the federal government to convoke a national security summit of all ethnic nationalities to find lasting solutions to the increasing wave of terrorism that is gradually tearing up the bond in our nation. And I repeat that this is the time,\u201d he added.\n\nArmy loses 18 in Kebbi attack\n\nIn a related development, the Nigerian Army Thursday confirmed that 18 soldiers were killed, eight injured and two others still missing in the attack by bandits in Kanya community of Danko Wasagu local government area of Kebbi state, which occurred Tuesday evening.\n\nPremium Times reported that the attack occurred while the deputy governor, Samaila Yombe, and the army commanding officer in Kebbi were visiting the community.\n\nSources had told the newspaper that 13 soldiers were killed during the attack.\n\nBut in an internal communication to the Defence Headquarters, seen by Premium Times, the Joint Task Force of Operation Hadarin Daji stated that 18 soldiers lost their lives in the gun battle with the bandits.\n\nThe soldiers involved were from the 223 Battalion stationed in Zuru, Kebbi state.\n\nAccording to the official brief, titled \u201cSpecial situation report\u201d, the officers involved were from Team 10 of the battalion.\n\n\u201cTroops engaged bandits/terrorists with deliberate fire but outnumbered by bandits. Troops\u2019 casualties: 18 soldiers killed in action, 8 soldiers wounded in action and two soldiers missing in action. Equipment casualties: one gun truck burnt, one AA Dushka gun 18 AK-47 rifles carted away,\u201d it stated.\n\nThe communication, however, noted that troops\u2019 morale and fighting efficiency remained high.\n\nBandits have been perpetrating atrocities across the Nigerian North-west and Niger State in the North-central, defying a military onslaught targeted at flushing them out of their hideouts in forests across the regions.\n\nTwo days before the attack on the soldiers, bandits on Sunday massacred 63 vigilantes also in the state.\n\n220 bandits, robbery suspects in Kaduna\n\nAlso, Kaduna state Police command has arrested 200 suspected bandits, and 20 suspected armed robbers terrorising residents, including the prime murder suspect of Air Vice Marshal Maisaka (retd), and suspected bandits who allegedly killed over 15 abducted persons.\n\nKaduna start Commissioner of Police Mudasiru Abdullahi said this while parading the suspects at the Command\u2019s headquarters in Kaduna Wednesday.\n\nHe said 18 AK47 rifles, 2,000 live ammunitions of different calibers, 11 pump action guns, 10 locally fabricated pistols, 140 shotgun, 12-guage cartridges, seven different motor vehicles and nine motorcycles were recovered from the suspects arrested between January and March 2022.\n\nThe CP, who was represented by the command\u2019s spokesman, ASP Muhammad Jalige, said the state had enjoyed relative serene security atmosphere since CP Mudassiru assumed office.\n\nHe said: \u201cKaduna state was witnessing some daunting security challenges bedeviling the state; banditry, kidnappings, armed robbery and farmers/herders clashes just to mention but a few.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding, having support from the Inspector General of Police IGP Alkali Baba Usman in terms of manpower and logistics as well as the unwavering assistance from the state government. Remarkable efforts were not spared in addressing the situation which culminates into the relative peace currently being enjoyed by law abiding citizens in the state.\n\n\u201cThe sum of these approaches resulted in the successes we are showcasing today with the arrest of over 200 armed bandits, 20 armed robbery suspects and the recovery of 18 AK47 rifles, 2,000 live ammunitions of different calibers, 11 pump action guns, 10 locally fabricated pistols, 140 shotgun 12-gauge cartridges, seven motor vehicles of different brand and nine motorcycles.\n\n\u201cThe relentless efforts of the Command in investigating the culpable homicide case involving late Air Vice Marshal Mohammed Musa Umar Maisaka of No. A27 Makarfi Road Rigasa, Kaduna, who was assassinated on the 8th November, 2021 at the above address has yielded a positive result with the arrest of the principal suspect Muhammed Muhammed Giwa.\u201d",

          "text": "The leadership crisis rocking the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) continued Thursday with a leaked letter revealing that the embattled Yobe state Governor Mai Mala Buni actually transmitted a letter to his Niger state counterpart, Abubakar Sani-Bello as acting chair of the party\u2019s Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC).\n\nel-Rufai\u2019s narratives\n\nThis runs contrary to narratives in some quarters, including that by Kaduna state Governor Nasir el-Rufai that Buni was sacked on Buhari\u2019s directive.\n\nel-Rufai, had while featuring on Channels Television Wednesday said the embattled CECPC chair was given the boot on the order of President Muhammadu Buhari, consequent upon which 19 governors elected on the party\u2019s platform, endorsed the action.\n\nGovernor el-Rufai had said: \u201cThe president held a meeting with us (APC governors) and gave us a clear directive and responsibilities and went into his waiting chopper at the airport. The president in his wisdom knew that we have the capacity.\n\n\u201cIt is just that some of us decided to take the back seat and allow things to even get to this point because we believe that once we were elected, we should focus on governance, and leave the party administration to those who are better at it.\n\n\u201cBut clearly, it got to a point that something was going to go wrong. The party was being placed at great risk, and we had to do something. I\u2019m happy that the caretaker committee headed by Abubakar Sani Bello has issued a notice for an emergency National Executive Committee meeting.\u201d\n\nThe letter\n\nBut in a leaked letter personally signed by Governor Buni, the embattled CECPC chair transmitted a letter to Bello in acting capacity.\n\nThe letter, dated February 28, 20022, reads: \u201cThis is to please inform you that I will be embarking on a medical trip to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from today, 28th February, 2022.\n\n\u201cIn my absence, I hereby transmit the functions of my office as the National Chairman of the Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) to you.\n\n\u201cThis is to enable the committee conclude all arrangements leading to the National Convention slated for March 26th, 2022 and other duties that may be required of the office.\n\n\u201cI invite all members to cooperate with Governor Abubakar Sani Bello by extending to him all the support that I have enjoyed from you.\n\n\u201cPlease do accept the assurances of my best regards.\u201d\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was put in copy of Buni\u2019s letter to Bello.\n\nBello denies\n\nBut Governor Sani-Bello denied seeing such letter when reporters pointedly asked him Thursday.\n\nHe, however, confirmed that a notification letter to the INEC on the forthcoming \u201cnational convention has been sent.\u201d\n\nOn Buni\u2019s letter, the acting party chair told journalists after the committee\u2019s meeting that he was not in receipt of the said letter.\n\n\u201cThe letter? I haven\u2019t seen it. Did you say on social media? I have not seen it,\u201d Sani-Bello said.\n\nOn whether the CECPC had appointed another national secretary, the governor said: \u201cIt has not been discussed. It wasn\u2019t on the agenda in today\u2019s meeting.\u201d\n\nProbed further on whether another national secretary would be appointed, the Governor Sani-Bello said: \u201cProbably. But it has not been discussed yet.\u201d\n\nBuni\u2019s confidant\n\nFaulting el-Rufai\u2019s position, a close associate of Buni who spoke under anonymity said: \u201cThe governors, who were part of this plot should watch it. Yes, they may not want him as the party chair, but should they descend so low to the level of telling the world half truth about their meeting with Mr President? Full disclosure is key here, and I think Governor el-Rufai who featured on Channels Television should have just opened up on that.\n\n\u201cI mean, the letter says it all. Why the disinformation that the man was sacked even after there is a record that he transmitted power to one of his colleagues who is also a member of the committee. The truth is gradually coming to the limelight. This is a wrong way to engage in politicking.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu\n\nIn a related development, Ondo state Governor and Chairman South-west Governors Forum Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN) has challenged the pro-Buni governors to leave the party if aggrieved.\n\nAlthough the governor did not name the said governors, he described them as \u201cYahoo, Yahoo governors.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu asked Governor Sani-Bello to carry on as the party\u2019s acting chairman of the CECPC.\n\nIn a statement he personally signed Thursday in Akure, Governor Akeredolu assured Sani-Bello of full support during the forthcoming national convention.\n\nThe statement said: \u201cNone of the scanty number has the guts to carry out their imaginary threats as reported in sponsored stories. We dare them to leave the party. Their short-lived antics in arm-twisting Governor Buni and probably, some pocket filling elements within the corridors of power to supplant the President\u2019s will through fake letters, endorsements as well as \u2018Black Market\u2019 injunction (procured since November, 2021) are despicable.\n\n\u201cNow that the clear motive aimed at frustrating our national convention has been botched, our dear party is on the track to greatness. Gov. Sani Bello, ABU LOLO, carry on; you have the backing of the majority of us. You shall see our FULL backing come Thursday, 17th March, 2022 at the National Executive Committee meeting.\u201d\n\nWhile applauding some APC governors for being courageous, Akeredolu said: \u201cHowever, the insidious and appalling happenings within our party in the last few months, especially under the immediate-past leadership clearly posit a huge embarrassment. Without necessarily dwelling on details that are known to critical stakeholders, the path taken !lately by Governor Mai Mala Buni, the immediate past head of the CECPC and an indivisible few, is an unenviable trajectory undeserving of our dear party. It is a disdainful narrative.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the courage and determination as well as shrewd sincerity of purpose demonstrated by most of the APC Governors remain a delight. Significantly, the swift response and prompt action taken by Mr President have, in no small means, salvaged our great party from internal scavengers. We indeed, survived a Civilian Coup largely inspired by mischief and incurable lust for power through artificial barricades.\n\n\u201cSuccinctly, aside feeling very delighted as a major stakeholder in the latest successful Rescue Mission, I express my confidence in the ability and capacity of Governor Sani Bello (ABU LOLO) to take APC through. We, the Governors are for the party except for the few \u201cYahoo, Yahoo\u201d Governors (apologies to Salihu, former DG of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum) who were hand in glove with Buni to circumvent the Will of majority of our Party (APC) members. Progressive Governors in the true name, mostly all of us, are determined to see our Party through these patchy parts at all cost.\u201d\n\nMusa lauds Bello\n\nMeanwhile, a front line APC national chairmanship aspirant, Senator Mohammed Sani Musa has congratulated Sani-Bello on his choice to lead the party ahead of its national convention.\n\novernments at all levels ahead of its March 26 national convention and the 2023 general elections.\u201d\n\nMusa, who promised a re-engineering of the party if given the mantle of leadership, solicited Governor Sani-Bello\u2019s support on his aspiration for the party\u2019s top job.\n\nHe maintained \u201chis ambition is not a do-or-die affair, but to reposition the party to a political institution that will groom leaders and win elections, stating that he will abide by any decision taken in the interest of the party.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn his response, Governor Bello thanked Senator Sani Musa and appreciated him for the visit and affirmed his commitment to the success of the APC as a party.\n\n\u201cThe Governor emphasized on the need for all party members to work together for a successful national convention of the party and maintained that his doors will remain open for advise and constructive engagements geared towards moving the party forward as a special purpose vehicle that will transform Nigeria and enhance the well-being of the citizenry,\u201d the statement further said.\n\nTinubu cautions\n\nAnd amidst all this, APC national leader and presidential aspirant, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has hailed President Buhari\u2019s optimism about the capacity and future of the ruling party.\n\nHe saluted the president\u2019s understanding and concern for the perfection of the party\u2019s internal processes to keep faith with progressive tendencies.\n\nThe eminent politician said in a statement in Lagos that \u201cthere is much work to do in the party,\u201d urging members to unite in upholding progressive and democratic practices.\n\nThe statement reads: \u201cRecently, President Buhari made a characteristically concise and important statement regarding the strength and purpose of our political party, All Progressives Congress.\n\n\u201cHe underscored the need for the party to perfect its internal processes so that it keeps faith to the progressive purpose for which it was founded: to bring forth a better society through just and compassionate good governance.\n\n\u201cWhile the election season is upon us and politics begins to acquire a heavy intensity, we must never lose sight of this higher purpose, this greater good. Like the president said, we all must recall how progressive forces forged an alliance that produced the APC.\n\n\u201cOur party came into being to answer the call of reform so that progressive governance for the good of all Nigerians could be established in the land. President Buhari won the 2015 election and was re-elected.\n\n\u201cBut the essential task of fundamental reform and improvement of society has not been completed.\n\n\u201cWe still have vital work to do. But the work can only be done by a party which is democratic and fair in governing itself as well as in governing the nation. This means that while people pursue their political goals they must also and always kept the greater collective purpose in mind.\n\n\u201cLet us be guided by the progressive and enlightened reason for the party. If we do so, the party shall not go astray or be driven by personal agendas and competition that becomes so heated that it turns into animus.\n\n\u201cLet us be more united in democratic purpose and practice. In this way we shall surmount the challenges, and complications inherent in any electoral cycle. The party can then gird itself for its finer purpose, giving the people the chance at better lives in a better society.\n\n\u201cAgain, we all should thank the president for the Sunday remarks which he made. We should take full notice of the enduring import of what he said, his eyes on his legacy, on leaving behind a worthy legacy. Let us keep the APC on its rightful path and reject any ruse or artifice that would cause the party to betray its great calling.\n\n\u201cMany progressive leaders had invested time, energy, ideas and resources in forming the APC with a view to providing a better Nigeria. The president is a founder of this party. I too have lent my humble bit. As founding fathers of this party, we must continue to guard its purpose.\n\n\u201cLet not the APC descend into the ways and rank of the other parties. Instead, may we strive to be an exemplar for a caring and democratic society. Only in this manner can we ensure the legacy of the party while leading our nation to its greater improvement.\n\n\u201cWe must also commend our president for assenting to the 2022 amendments to the Electoral Act. The new law will hopefully aid in the national pursuit of the fairest elections possible. As such, the act may prove to be a historic milestone on our nation\u2019s democratic journey.\u201d",

          "text": "Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Thursday, led leaders and members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state to receive the National Chairman of the party, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, declaring that only the PDP could rescue Nigeria from its current socio-economic woes.\n\nObaseki, who spoke at a grand rally in honour of the national chairman in Benin City, expressed confidence that the party would produce the country\u2019s next president, even as Ayu promised that the issues in the Edo PDP would be resolved.\n\nBut the deputy governor of the state, Comrade Philip Shaibu, protested the exclusion of new members from the party, and urged Ayu to help resolve the crisis in the state chapter of the PDP.\n\nAccording to Obaseki, \u201cI want to thank you for coming with members of the National Board of Trustees (BOT) of the party. PDP is the party of Edo; PDP is in the DNA of Edo, and we do not want that to change. The deputy governor said something and I want to restate it: wherever Edo goes, Nigeria will go.\n\n\u201cOur chairman has what it takes to produce the next president, because Nigerians are suffering too much. How can diesel be sold for over N700? You have all it takes to help us. Only PDP can rescue Nigeria from these sufferings.\n\n\u201cThe only issue is the small quarrel in Edo PDP. Once you can solve the quarrel in Edo and other states, we will take over power in 2023,\u201d the governor said.\n\nAyu, while speaking, said the party would set up a team to resolve the crisis in Edo PDP, and ensure that the governor did not leave.\n\n\u201cLet no one deceive you that he (Obaseki) is leaving PDP. Nigerians will see how we will receive all those from other parties. In 2023, we shall be back in power; we have started working towards that.\n\n\u201cEdo people, learn from my own state, Benue. If you fight, you will lose the election. I am going to bring a team that will settle the issue in Edo.\n\n\u201cI have been working from behind. I am happy that the Deputy Governor, Shaibu said the truth that the leadership of the party in the state is not working. We are very close to solving the crisis in Edo.\n\n\u201cOnce the leadership is divided, you won\u2019t get a good result. All our emphasis is on unity. We cannot talk about taking over power in 2023 if our state leadership is not on good terms.\n\n\u201cEdo is going to produce the highest number of votes in the next general election. We shall win all the Senatorial and House of Representatives seats. I want to assure you that by next week, all the issues in Edo PDP will be resolved. All the leaders in Edo should help to resolve the problem, not to fire it more. We will engineer the process and they will conclude the process,\u201d he stated.\n\nEarlier, Shaibu, who alleged exclusion of new members from the party, stated: \u201cSir, people are saying that the governor will not leave the PDP, but he will only remain if his soldiers remain in the party.\n\n\u201cWe want you to resolve this problem in our party. We have what it takes to take over the national position in the next election. Wherever Edo goes, is where Nigeria will go. If you solve the problem in Edo, you have solved the problem in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAmong those at the event were the Secretary to the State Government, Osarodion Ogie Esq; Chief of Staff to the Governor, Hon. Osaigbovo Iyoha; Speaker, Edo House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Marcus Onobun and State Chairman of the PDP, Tony Aziegbemi.\n\nOthers were former governor of Gombe State, Ibrahim Dankwambo; Chairman, PDP Board of Trustees (BOT), Senator Walid Jubril; Senator Matthew Urhoghide, Senator Clifford Odia, Chief Tom Ikimi and PDP National Women Leader, Josephine Anenih.\n\nMeanwhile, the Deputy National Chairman, South-south zone of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Dan Orbih was absent at the unity rally, later held in Benin City, Edo State, to honour Ayu.\n\nWhile Orbih was of the view that there was nothing like harmonisation of party positions because a congress had been held before Obaseki joined the party with some factional member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and as such, the State Working Committee (SWC) should be allowed to serve out its tenure; Obaseki supported the ideas of harmonisation of the SWC positions to accommodate his people.\n\nThe disagreement took a new dimension last week when Obaseki told Orbih off and branded his position as \u201cirresponsible\u201d.\n\n\u201cI heard that Chief Dan Orbih went around, saying there is no harmonisation in Edo PDP. This is really irresponsible to say and an insult to members of the party, as the party has truly harmonised in the state.\n\n\u201cPDP in Edo State is harmonised, because before we made any appointments in any ward, we made sure the party at that level was harmonised. We are gathered here now as election timetable is out; harmonisation has been done, appointments made and we are ready to win any election before us.\u201d\n\nDwelling on this at the rally, Ayu stayed away from harmonisation and opted for peace and unity by urging all and sundry in the party to tow the path of peace just as he noted that unity remained the only key to election victory.\n\nAyu, who said he was married to an Edo woman, who also was once a PDP national women leader, declared that he would not allow anything that would bring division in the party.\n\nHe said as one of those who formed the party out of the G-34 group, he would not fail to ensure unity, recalling that PDP lost Edo in 2007 governorship election to then Action Congress (AC) in the state as a result of disunity and infighting between former Governor Lucky Igbinedion and Chief Tony Anenih of blessed memory.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva, on Thursday called on the United States Government to provide funding support for Nigeria to develop its natural gas resources.\n\nThe call by Sylva is coming on the heels of the Russian war with Ukraine, which currently threatens the disruption of gas supplies from Russia to the entire European continent.\n\nSpeaking during a meeting with the US Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, on the sidelines of the ongoing CERAweek, in Houston Texas, Sylva said the collaboration between the US and Nigeria in this area would be of immense benefits to both countries as well as the entire globe.\n\n\u201cIt is in the interests of the global community that there is alternative supply of gas to Europe. The challenge for us to achieve this feat has been lack of infrastructure and we need funding to development infrastructure for our gas and we believe that the US can provide that funding,\u201d Sylva stated.\n\nStating that the natural gas could serve as an alternative source of energy for Europe, Sylva told Granholm that Nigeria has abundance of the commodity that can meet European gas demands, but said that the problem has been access to funding.\n\nHe explained that as part of efforts to boost gas supplies across the African continent, Nigeria has embarked upon the construction of 600 kilometres of the Ajaokuta- Kaduna- Kano (AKK) gas pipeline designed to take gas to Europe via North Africa.\n\nSylva therefore called on the US to provide the needed funding for infrastructure for the exploitation of the huge natural gas in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe have access to gas but access to funding has been the problem. Our desire is to be able to take gas from Nigeria through Algeria to Europe. We have already kick-started the AKK gas pipeline project and if we have the required funding we can complete that project in two years.\n\n\u201cNigeria has over 206 tcf of natural gas reserve and unproven reserve of 600 tcf and we believe that if we target exploitation of natural gas in Nigeria, we will be able to get up to 600 tcf. We need to have the needed funding to develop our gas and the US can provide us this funding,\u201d he added.\n\nThe minister said the crisis between Russia and Ukraine was a wake-up call to have alternative sources of gas to Europe, stressing that in situations like this, it is always good to have alternatives.\n\nSpeaking on the issue of global energy transition, Sylva said for the energy transition programme to be meaningful, the peculiar problems of Africa must be factored into the entire energy transition arrangement.\n\n\u201cWe have to be given some special considerations. I am excited that the world has started listening to us. I was particularly happy that John Kerry echoed our position when he spoke at a panel session.\n\n\u201cInasmuch as we want to be part of the new economy, we can not move at the same pace. We still have people without clean cooking fuels, so we want to achieve our energy base load through a multi pronged approach. The reality check is that we cannot move at the same pace. There is gap between expectations,\u201d he noted.\n\nSylva however cautioned that such funding and technological supports must be made accessible to interested countries.\n\n\u201cWe have to work out a structured way to access the funding. We must create that understanding to make the loans accessible. The issue of sovereign guarantee must be removed so that interested countries can easily access the funding. \u201cthe minister further stated.\n\nCiting the case of the African Growth Opportunity Act (AGOA), Sylva said since the programme came into force so many years ago, no African country has been able to successfully key into the project for maximum benefits.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt has not been easy for Africa to access AGOA. so the type of funding we are looking at is the one that Nigeria will be able to access\u201d.\n\nIn her remarks, Granholm expressed the readiness of the US to cooperate with Nigeria to develop her renewable energy sector, noting that her government was not against the development of gas or other sources of energy.\n\nShe therefore called for a coordinated strategy to pin down specific areas of focus where funding and other supports would be required.\n\n\u201cInvestors are interested in funding renewable energy in Nigeria but they are interested in knowing possible areas of focus. We have to work out a structured way to access the fund\u201d Granholm said.\n\nIn an earlier meeting with the US Assistant Secretary of State, Harry Karman, Sylva expressed Nigeria\u2019s willingness to develop the different sources of renewable energy such as wind, solar and hydrogen.\n\nHe spoke also about the need to streamline targeted financing adding that \u201cthere must be a framework of accessing the funding\u201d.\n\nKarman in his remarks assured the minister of the US government\u2019s readiness to support Nigeria in finding sustainable energy sources for the millions of Nigerians without access to power.",

Nigeria is the biggest economy in Africa, so it should be Korea\u2019s number trading partner among Africa\u2019s countries,\u201d Kim said.\n\nPresently, Nigeria is Korea\u2019s third biggest trading partner in Africa.\n\nThe ambassador said the balance of trade between both countries was driven mainly by Korea\u2019s manufactured goods, like plastic and aluminum related products and Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas.\n\n\u201cWe are importing a lot of Nigerian gas to further increase our bilateral trade. Of course oil and gas is very important, but we want to see some agricultural products from Nigeria and manufactured goods in order to penetrate into Korean market.\n\n\u201cI hope more Nigerian companies will study Korean markets and Korean consumers. For example, we import a lot of sesame seed and I know that Nigeria produces a lot of sesame seed. There is a huge potential for Nigeria\u2019s sesame seed or sesame oil,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also stated that his country wants Nigeria to back the candidacy of Korean Foreign Affairs Minister, Kyung-wha Kang for the Director-General of the International Labour Organization (ILO) at the election scheduled for Geneva on March 25.\n\nKim said Kang had met the Chief of Staff to President, Prof Ibrahim Gambari, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama and NLC President Mr. Ayuba Waba during her visit to the country to campaign and seek Nigeria\u2019s backing for her candidacy.\n\nMeanwhile, the Republic of Korea has called on Nigeria to fulfill her commitments and support the set objectives of the $13 million Digital Governance Programme.\n\nSpeaking during the recently conducted two-week pre-kick-off survey for the project titled: \u201cProject for Building Foundations Towards Digital Governance in Nigeria (2021~2026),\u201d the KOICA Nigeria Country Director, Mr. Sungil Son said engagements with government stakeholders was focused on the need to have all commitments from the Nigerian government.\n\nThe Republic of Korea through its grant aid agency, Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) Office in Nigeria in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy (FMCDE) recently conducted a 2-week pre-kick-off survey for the project.\n\nThe project is expected to enhance Nigeria\u2019s e-Government implementation system through the update of the current Nigeria\u2019s e-Government Master Plan (NeGMP), upgrade of Nigeria\u2019s Enterprise Architecture and development of a 10-year eGovernment Implementation Plan.\n\nOther objectives of the project includes improvement in competencies for e-Government service delivery through capacity building programs designed for policy makers and technical officers at both federal and state levels of government, enhancement of the quality of government digital services through the activation of the Government Service Portal www.services.gov.ng and create increased access for NIN enrolment through the establishment of additional NIN enrolment units.\n\nA statement from KOICA yesterday, disclosed that during the survey, an initial 3-member Project Management Consultant (PMC) team led by the Project Manager, Prof. Hung-Kook Park from Sangmyung University and KOICA Nigeria Country Director, Mr. Sungil Son, had detailed technical and high-level engagements with representatives of key project stakeholders namely; Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy (FMCDE), National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Galaxy Backbone (GBB), National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), United Nations Children\u2019s Education Fund (UNICEF), and National Population Commission (NPC).\n\nA major highlight of the survey activity was the hosting of the wrap-up meeting with project stakeholders at the e-Government Training Centre (eGTC) in Abuja.",

          "text": "The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kristalina Georgieva, has warned that the war in Ukraine threatens to undo Africa\u2019s progress in recovering from the damage of the COVID-19 pandemic and presents new challenges for the continent.\n\nShe, however, expressed IMF\u2019s readiness to help African countries reduce the cost of any needed policy adjustments through policy advice, capacity development, and lending, adding that recent reforms to the Fund\u2019s lending toolkit provide greater flexibility to help meet financing needs.\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, the IMF chief said policy makers at a meeting of African finance ministers and central bankers expressed concerns about their domestic policy space to address the ongoing crisis.\n\nAccording to her, Africa was particularly vulnerable to the impact of the Ukraine war through four main channels \u2013 increased food prices, higher fuel costs, lower tourism revenues, and potentially more difficult access to international capital markets.\n\nShe said: \u201cA recalibration of policies appears inevitable in many countries. At this difficult moment, the fund stands ready to help African countries reduce the cost of any needed policy adjustments through policy advice, capacity development, and lending.\n\n\u201cRecent reforms to the fund\u2019s lending toolkit provide greater flexibility to help meet financing needs.\u201d\n\nThe IMF in 2020 provided 13 times its average annual lending to sub-Saharan Africa and increased access limits to its zero-interest lending that comes mostly without the fund\u2019s traditional conditions.\n\nThe IMF also disclosed that its executive board has approved $1.4 billion in emergency financing to support Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia.\n\nThe Bretton Wood institution, in a statement, said the executive board gave its approval on Wednesday night.\n\nAccording to the IMF, the support comes from its rapid financing instrument (RFI).\n\nThe RFI provides rapid financial assistance available to all IMF member countries facing an urgent balance of payments need.\n\nExpressing its strong support for the Ukrainian people, the IMF said the economic consequences of the war are already very serious, with refugee flows of over two million persons in just 13 days and large-scale destruction of key infrastructure in Ukraine.\n\nIt said: \u201cThis disbursement under the RFI, equivalent to 50 percent of Ukraine\u2019s quota in the IMF, will help meet urgent balance of payment needs arising from the impacts of the ongoing war and will provide critical support in the short term while playing a catalytic role for financing from other partners.\u201d\n\nAccording to the global lender, Ukrainian authorities had cancelled an existing stand-by lending arrangement with the IMF but would work with the fund to design an appropriate economic program focused on rehabilitation and growth when conditions permit.\n\nThe IMF chief executive, Kristalina Georgieva said the Russian military invasion of Ukraine had been responsible for a massive humanitarian and economic crisis.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe tragic loss of life, huge refugee flows, and immense destruction of infrastructure and productive capacity is causing severe human suffering and will lead to a deep recession this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinancing needs are large, urgent, and could rise significantly as the war continues.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the financial support should help fill the financing gap and mitigate the economic impacts of the war, adding that \u201conce the war is over and a proper damage assessment can be performed, additional large support is likely to be needed to support reconstruction efforts.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank had also on Monday approved a $723 million package of loans and grants for Ukraine.",

          "text": "The de-facto leaders of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have declined to arrange calls with US president Joe Biden in recent weeks as the US and its allies have sought to contain a surge in energy prices caused by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. According to the Wall Street Journal, citing Middle East and US officials, both Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman and the UAE\u2019s Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan have been unavailable to Biden after US requests were made for discussions.\n\n\u201cThere was some expectation of a phone call, but it didn\u2019t happen,\u201c London-based Guardian Newspaper quoted a US official to have said.\n\n\u201cIt was part of turning on the spigot [of Saudi oil].\u201d\n\nLast week, OPEC+, which includes Russia, declined to increase oil production despite western entreaties.\n\nBut reports of frigid communications with Saudi Arabia come as the Biden administration seeks to increase oil supply after formally banning Russian oil imports on Tuesday, pushing oil prices to $130 a barrel, the highest level in 14 years.\n\nHowever, the US has for the first time in years opened up diplomatic channels with Venezuela, a Russian ally and which has the world\u2019s largest oil reserves. Venezuela has now released at least two Americans from jail in an apparent goodwill gesture toward the Biden administration in a possible prelude to increasing production to ease the price surge.\n\nRelations between the US and Saudi Arabia have chilled during the Biden administration over American policy in the Gulf region.\n\nIssues include the revival of the Iran nuclear deal; lack of US support for Saudi intervention in Yemen\u2019s civil war and its refusal to add Houthis to its list of terrorist groups; US help with a Saudi civilian nuclear program; and legal immunity for Prince Mohammed, who is facing lawsuits over the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by a Saudi hit-team in its Istanbul consulate four years ago.\n\nDuring Biden\u2019s election campaign he had vowed to treat the kingdom as a \u201cpariah\u201d state, saying there is \u201cvery little social redeeming value in the present government in Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said there were no plans for the Biden and Prince Mohammed to talk soon, and no plans for the president to travel to Riyadh.\n\nYousef Al Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to the US, confirmed strained relations between the two countries. \u201cToday, we\u2019re going through a stress test, but I am confident that we will get out of it and get to a better place,\u201d Al Otaiba predicted.\n\nThe two Gulf nations are regarded as the only global suppliers with capacity to pump more oil to ease the price surge.\n\nSenior US officials with the national security council and state department had reported travelled to Riyadh and Abu Dhabi in recent weeks to make direct US representations.",
