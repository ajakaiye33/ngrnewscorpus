          "text": "Dr Anthony Fauci called Kansas Senator Roger Marshall a \u201cmoron\u201d on Tuesday after a tense exchange over Fauci\u2019s financial disclosures, a sign of the increasing hostility between conservatives and one of the nation\u2019s top COVID-19 experts.\n\nToward the end of a more-than-three-hour Senate Health Committee meeting, Marshall pointed to Fauci\u2019s government salary of more than 400,000 dollars and asked whether he would make his financial disclosure available to the public.\n\nFauci is a government employee and his financial disclosure forms are available to the public and can be accessed through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t you agree with me that you see things before members of Congress would see them, so that there\u2019s an air of appearance that maybe some shenanigans are going on?\n\n\u201cI assume that\u2019s not the case,\u201d Marshall said.\n\nWhen Fauci called Marshall \u201cmisinformed\u201d and said his financial disclosure was public information and available upon request, Marshall said his office had been unable to find the information.\n\nAs Kansas Senator Jerry Moran prepared to ask a question, Fauci was caught on the microphone saying \u201cwhat a moron\u201d and \u201cJesus Christ.\u201d\n\nIn a press release after the hearing, Marshall doubled down and said Fauci was \u201cclearly distraught by the line of questioning.\u201d\n\n\u201cCalling me a moron during a Senate hearing may have alleviated the stress of the least trusted bureaucrat in America, but it didn\u2019t take away from the facts,\u201d Marshall said.\n\nThe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which was headed by Fauci, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFauci was testifying with Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centres for Disease Control, and Janet Woodcock, acting commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nHe said about the current surge of COVID-19 cases spreading through the country as a result of the Omicron variant.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, Fauci has been a target of conservatives who have chafed at the way the government has handled health restrictions.\n\nBut nearly two years into the pandemic, tension has ratcheted up between Fauci and conservatives in Congress, where there was a partisan divide over who wore masks in the hallways and in the chamber.\n\nSenator Rand Paul, who has been a frequent critic, has called Fauci \u201ca lead architect\u201d of the government\u2019s response to the virus, from shutting down businesses at the beginning of the pandemic to urging people to wear a mask and get vaccinated.\n\nEarlier in the committee hearing, Marshall, an obstetrician and gynaecologist, questioned Fauci about his role in authorising \u201cgain of function\u201d research, a type of experiment where scientists change a virus to make it more potent as a way to study its effects.\n\nMarshall has said he would like a ban on a gain of function research and has made investigating the origins of COVID-19 a core platform for his first year in office.\n\nFauci also clashed with Paul over an email exchange between him and former director of the National Institutes of Health Francis Collins.\n\nIn which Collins and Fauci discussed how to combat what they called a \u201cfringe\u201d narrative about the pandemic raised by epidemiologists at prestigious universities.\n\nIn response, Fauci held up a print-out of Paul\u2019s Senate campaign website, where there was a picture of Fauci next to the text \u201cFire Dr Fauci\u201d and several buttons where people can make donations to the campaign.\n\nFauci talked about how he has gotten death threats after similar exchanges with Paul and said a man who was arrested driving from Sacramento to Washington, D.C. with an AR-15 and ammunition said he was going there to kill Fauci.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing this for political reasons,\u201d Fauci said.\n\nFauci has often drawn the ire of activists.\n\nIn the 1980s, he was among those criticised for the government\u2019s slow response to the AIDS epidemic.\n\nMembers of ACT UP burned him in effigy outside of the NIH building during one protest.\n\nBut Fauci, who later became friends with some ACT UP leaders, has drawn a distinction between activists fighting for more resources for people with the disease.\n\nBut also those who have criticised him for public health measures intended to decrease the spread of the virus.\n\n(dpa/NAN)",

Gen. Dahiru Abdulsalam (rtd) gave the charge while fielding questions from newsmen at the 241 Recce Battalion Nguru, venue for the 82 Regular Recruitment Intake screening exercise for the state.\n\nHe said it is important for the journalists and other relevant stakeholders to sensitize parents across the 17 local government areas of the state to encourage their daughters to join the Army.\n\n\u201cYou know, because of cultural and religious issues it is very difficult for females from this part of the country to join the army\u201d, he lamented.\n\nOn the current screen exercise for the 82RRI which commenced on the 2nd of January, Brig. Gen. Abdulsalam noted that based on the principle of Federal Character, the Nigerian Army has shortlisted 1,500 candidates for Yobe State where, after the exercise, only 140 are expected to make the final list.\n\nTalking about the transparency of the recruitment exercise, Abdulsalam said, \u201cthe Nigerian Army recruitment is the most transparent of all recruitment exercises. Anybody that is not shortlisted will not take part and the result will be announced here on the ground\u201d.\n\nWhen also asked whether there is political interference in the recruitment screening exercise, the Chairman denied any political interference in the exercise.\n\n\u201cNo politician has any influence on this recruitment exercise, because this is not the final, if we take anybody that is not competent Yobe state would lose because when it gets to Falgore, they will drop unfit candidates and use other available candidates to fill the slot. So, there is no interference as far as Nigerian Army recruitment exercise is a concern\u201d, he stressed.\n\nIt was gathered that among the 1,500 candidates shortlisted from the state, only four female candidates made it to the current stage as the screening exercise continues. The exercise is expected to end on the 16th of January, 2022.",

          "text": "The Federation Government has directed that the national flag be flown at half-mast as a mark of respect for the former Head of State, Ernest Shonekan, who died, yesterday at the age of 85.\n\nSecretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha in a statement said President Muhammadu Buhari, gave the directive which is to be effective from Wednesday 12th \u2013 Friday 14th, January, 2022.\n\nDeath of the British-trained lawyer, industrialist, statesmen and former head of the Interim National Government (ING) that governed Nigeria between the military governments of General Ibrahim Babangida (retd) and the late General Sani Abacha was confirmed in a terse statement released on behalf of the family by Adeboye Shonekan.\n\nIt read: \u201cTo the glory of the Almighty, the Shonekan family announces the passing of our patriarch, loving husband to Margaret, dutiful father to us all and former Head of State, Chief Ernest, Adegunle, Oladeinde Shonekan, GCFR, CBE, the Baba Sale of Egbaland.\n\n\u201cHe passed this morning of natural causes at the age of 85.\n\n\u201cThe family will release further details in due course.\u201d\n\nThe death has elicited reactions from every section of the country cutting across politics and the economy.\n\nPresident Buhari in a statement by his media aide said he received the news of Shonekan\u2019s death, who he described as a great statesman with profound sadness and condoled with his wife, Margaret, loved ones as well as the government and people of Ogun State.\n\nHe said the internationally-respected statesman, demonstrated to all that the love for country and commitment to her development, peace and unity transcend the trappings of office and the transient nature of political power.\n\n\u2022Jonathan, Atiku, Ayu mourn\n\nFormer president Goodluck Jonathan said Shonekan would be remembered for his great wisdom, peaceful disposition, as well as his significant contribution to the growth of the country\u2019s economy .\n\n\u201cAs a leader, Chief Shonekan was well respected because of the enormous goodwill he brought into governance. He was a compassionate and determined administrator, a peacemaker and bridge builder who stepped in to lead the nation at a very difficult time in the history of its political evolution\u2026.\n\n\u201cHe left enduring legacies, part of which was his considerable effort towards mainstreaming the private sector in the development drive of the nation, especially with the institutionalisation of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), which he founded.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction, former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, said Shonekan died at a time the country needed his skills and global connection in finding solution to national challenges.\n\n\u201cEither as a politician or a boardroom guru, Chief Shonekan possessed a unique set skill of bringing stability to a tumultuous situation.\n\n\u201cThat obviously was the consideration that made him become Head of the Interim National Government following the crises that greeted the events after the June 12 presidential election.\n\n\u201cAlthough his reign as Head of State was interim, Chief Shonekan\u2019s contribution to the peace and development of Nigeria in those days and latter years, remain enduring.\u201d\n\nThe National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Iyorchia Ayu, described the late UAC helmsman as a detribalised Nigerian and elder statesman who gave Nigeria his best.\n\n\u201cHis death is a sunset on an illustrious career that straddled both the corporate sector and the public service. We are consoled that he lived a fulfilled life, and that his legacy of public service will outlive him,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022National loss\n\n\u2013Kalu\n\nFormer governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr. Orji Kalu described his demise as a huge loss to Nigeria.\n\nHe acknowledged his accomplishments and stressed that he was a patriotic statesman, industrialist, boardroom guru and philanthropist.\n\nKalu noted that his contributions to nation building in various positions in the private and public sectors were worthy of commendation and emulation, adding that the country would miss his wise counsel.\n\nIn a condolence message, the Chief Whip of the Senate, extended his condolences to the Federal Government, adding he would be remembered for his good deeds.\n\n\u201cThe late former president played noble roles in the social, economic and political development of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe deceased created a niche for himself in the private and public sectors. He was selfless, patriotic, forthright compassionate and professional in his endeavours.\n\n\u201cThe late Chief Shonekan left behind worthy legacies for leaders at all levels to emulate.\u201d\n\nKalu prayed for the repose of the soul of Chief Shonekan, and urged the Shonekan family to uphold the remarkable attributes of their late patriarch.\n\n\u2022Govs Abiodun, Wike, Akeredolu, Obaseki, Ortom\n\nChairman of the South West Governors\u2019 Forum and Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu described his death as a huge loss to the country.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nHe maintained that his service would never be forgotten in the annals of history of the country.\n\n\u201cChief Ernest Shonekan was a nationalist par excellence. His belief in a united and peaceful Nigeria was unparalleled. He was dedicated to the progress and development of the county. He will be sorely missed.\n\n\u201cHis historic and patriotic role in maintaining the unity of the country was one of the many things that endeared him to many. He was indeed, an asset and his counsels were useful for national cohesion and progress,\u201d he added.\n\nOgun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, also described the death as a colossal loss to Nigeria in general and Ogun State in particular as he expressed grief that the former chairman chairman of the UAC Nigeria Plc., passed on at a period Nigeria needed his experience most as a technocrat.\n\n\u201cChief Shonekan was a first-class administrator, boardroom guru and astute leader whose imprint in the business and political firmaments can not be erased. His commitment to peaceful resolution and patriotic fervour will live after him.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, said Shonekan was a dedicated Nigerian, who was committed to the peace and stability to the country.\n\nHe noted that Shonekan\u2019s strong credentials as an astute administrator, enabled him to steadfastly steer the country through one of its most turbulent times.\n\nGovernor Wike said Nigeria has lost an elder statesman whose wisdom, foresight, and steadfast commitment to the country will always be remembered.\n\nImo State Governor Hope Uzodimma Shonekan was one of Nigeria\u2019s statesmen and legal luminary who believed in the unity, progress and development of the country and actually worked hard in private and public sector for the realisation of that dream.\n\nGovernor Uzodimma said his legacy in UAC would always speak volume and that Nigerians would not forget in a hurry the reason he founded the Nigerian Economic Summit Group in 1994, an advocacy body and think tank for private sector-driven development of the Nigerian economy.\n\nReacting, Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, said: \u201cShonekan was an unassuming leader and a cerebral lawyer, who helped to steady our nation during the turbulent years of Nigeria\u2019s Third Republic\u2026\n\n\u201cAs the founder of the Nigeria Economic Summit Group, his commitment to private and free enterprise remains indelible in the annals of our history.\n\n\u201cIt is heartbreaking that Chief Shonekan will not be available to offer his priceless advice and guidance as we approach another election season.\u201d\n\nBenue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, described him as an outstanding role model who stood to be counted when it mattered.\n\n\u201cChief Shonekan was a great nationalist. It is sad to lose him at a time like this when Nigeria needed his wealth of experience and wise counsel to navigate through the murky political waters,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Uncommon patriot \u2013IBB\n\nFormer military president, Gen. Babangida hailed him as an engaging personality whose sense of patriotism was total.\n\n\u201cThe shocking news of the death of one of Nigeria\u2019s finest brains and patriots came to me this morning with a helpless awe. I hadn\u2019t the faintest idea that Chief Ernest Shonekan would depart this sinful world too soon, even at 85. He was a man, a leader and an uncommon patriot who had a presence of mind and whose understanding of Nigeria was profound and remarkable. It is indeed a personal loss to me.\n\nChief Ernest Shonekan was one of our cerebral minds during our time in government. He was the architect of our principle of free market economy which helped to open up the system for a robust participation by the private sector. The liberalisation of the economy, the investment and boost in the agricultural sector and budget management approach were part of his brain child. I recollect very vividly how he used to give us tutorials on budget, planning and management of national resources, each time he was invited to our session. At each budget year, Chief Shonekan would be invited to critique our budget proposals, and gave us further input to enrich the final budget. He was a man of ideas and ideals. He was prudent and preached so much about fiscal discipline.\n\n\u201cIt was therefore timely for us to appoint him as Head of the Interim Government to help stabilize the polity at a most trying period of our country\u2019s political evolution. He was a calm personality whose managerial skills were foretold in the way and manner he managed a lot of blue chip companies. As Head of the Interim Government, he was able to consult with a broad spectrum of the Nigerian populace in charting a roadmap out of the political impasse at that time.\u201d\n\n\u2022Tinubu, Ayim: Man of character, comitted patriot\n\nThe All Progressives Congress National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, in a condolence message by his Media Office issued said: \u201cWith his passing, the country has lost another important elder-statesman; a man of peace who tried to bring unity and concord during one of the nation\u2019s most trying moments.\n\n\u201cHe had the character, competence, capability and the technical background to undertake the job. In his brief time as Head of State, Chief Shonekan tried his best to advance peace, stability and development in Nigeria. Chief Shonekan will be remembered as a peacemaker and head of state who took office at a most difficult time. I commiserate with his immediate family, most especially his loving wife, Mrs. Margret, Governor Dapo Abiodun and all the people of Ogun State and Nigeria,\u201d the former Lagos State governor eulogised.\n\nReacting, Chief Anyim Pius Anyim, former SGF and PDP presidential aspirant, hailed Chief Shonekan as an outstanding leader and statesman and said Nigeria would sorely miss his expertise, wise counsel and moderating voice of reason on national issues, especially now that our country is going through difficult times.\n\n\u201cHis record of service both in the corporate world and in political leadership are unblemished and enviable\u2026\n\n\u201cChief Shonekan remained committed to the unity, peace and development of Nigeria. In 1994 Chief Shonekan founded the Nigerian Economic Summit Group NESG, a private sector led think-tank and policy advocacy group that has continued to promote the development of the Nigerian economy. By his death, Nigeria has lost a committed patriot who did everything he could for the good of the country and her citizens.\u201d\n\n\u2022LCCI, NACCIMA\n\nPresident of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Dr. Michael Olawale-Cole said his death would leave a huge gap.\n\n\u201cThough he was not active in a last couple of years due to old age before he passed on, his contributions to the boardroom on the economy we cannot but mention it. He served as UAC chairman after which he became an interim president of this country. So, he is one of the top models we will be looking at as role models. There are very few Shonekans left behind. Nigerians should tap from the few Shonekans who are still alive. We should tap into their knowledge. We need to find out how they ran Nigeria in those days and there was peace. How did they run the country and the economy was more enterprising and promising than now. We need to find out their boardroom ingredients that were used those days to run those major companies as Nigerians as against being run by expartrates. Unfortunately now most expertrates are now back to run the multinationals as against the time of Shonekans and co.\n\nAlso reacting, John Udeagbala, president of the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce said: \u201cChief Shonekan was well known for playing a critical role at the critical period in the history of our nation as Head of the Interim National Government. This was at a period the nation was searching for stability, end to military and to reposition to the path to true democracy.\u201d",

Shonekan died yesterday in Lagos of natural causes, his family said. He was aged 85 years.\n\nA statement by the family, signed by one of his children, Adeboye Shonekan, said, \u201cTo the glory of the Almighty, the Shonekan family announces the passing of our patriarch, loving husband to Margaret, dutiful father to us all and former Head of State, Chief Ernest Adegunle Oladeinde Shonekan, GCFR, CBE, the Baba Sale of Egbaland.\n\n\u201cHe passed this morning of natural causes at the age of 85. The family will release further details in due course.\u201d\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari said he received the news of Shonekan\u2019s passing with sadness. In a release by his media adviser, Femi Adesina, on behalf of the federal government, Buhari extended deepest condolences to Shonekan\u2019s wife, Margaret, loved ones, as well as the government and people of Ogun State.\n\nThe president paid tribute to Shonekan, saying though an internationally respected statesman, with courageous wisdom, he left his flourishing business to become the Head of Government at a delicate time, when the country needed someone of his calm mien and pedigree to save the ship of state from sinking.\n\nFormer President Olusegun Obasanjo said Shonekan was a unifying force that helped to bind the country together at a time of great uncertainty.\n\nFormer military president Ibrahim Babangida, who had appointed Shonekan head of the interim government, extolled his sterling qualities, saying they qualified him for the tough job.\n\nEx-President Goodluck Jonathan, Senate President Ahmed Lawan, and All Progressives Congress (APC) national leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, were also among prominent Nigerians who paid tribute to the departed leader.\n\nBuhari said Shonekan demonstrated to all that his love for country and commitment to its development, peace, and unity transcended the trappings of office and the transient nature of political power.\n\n\u201cBuhari believed that Nigeria owes a great debt to Chief Shonekan, the peacemaker, who even at the twilight of his life time never stopped believing and working for a prosperous and democratic country,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe president prayed that the memory of the departed would remain a blessing to Nigeria even as he finds perfect peace with the Almighty God.\n\nBuhari Directs National Flag to Fly Half-Mast for Shonekan\n\nThe president directed that the national flag should be flown at half mast from January 12 to 14 as a mark of respect for the former Head of State. Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr Boss Mustapha, announced the directive in a statement last night.\n\nObasanjo: He Was a Unifying Force for Nigeria\n\nObasanjo, yesterday, described Shonekan, as a unifying force for the nation.\n\nObasanjo, who was on an international assignment as the High Representative of the African Union for the Horn of Africa, said he received with great shock the news of the death of one of Africa\u2019s illustrious sons. He declared that Shonekan\u2019s contribution to the growth and development of democracy in Nigeria could not be forgotten in a hurry.\n\nObasanjo sent a condolence letter to the wife of the deceased, Mrs. Margaret Shonekan, copy of which was made available to newsmen in Abeokuta by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Akinyemi. In the letter, the former president said the late business mogul was \u201ca role model and an epitome of the good in the nation\u2019s business firmament of mixed blessings.\n\n\u201cHe would be remembered as a man of sustained strong will to succeed. Coming from humble background, rising, stepping and peaking at the topmost plum in corporate management, and the very top of the giant United Africa Company (UAC) ladder, attest to his sagacity, tenacity and steadfastness.\n\n\u201cHe founded, in 1994, the Economic Summit Group, an advocacy group and think tank for private sector-led development of the Nigerian economy, and it remains, till today, sustaining the legacy of helping to support stakeholders in the execution of policies, programmes and strategies in response to any emerging trends in national and global economies.\u201d\n\nOn the political scene, Obasanjo noted that Shonekan, as head of the ING in 1993, which was short-lived for three months through the palace coup orchestrated by General Sani Abacha, \u201crendered outstanding service to our country, and we will never forget that.\n\n\u201cIt is also worthy of note that as Special Envoy on the Implementation of the Abuja Agreement on Zimbabwe in 2001 under my administration as the President of Nigeria; and Chairman, Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission (ICRC) under Yar\u2019Adua\u2019s administration in 2008, he was forthright, dedicated and showed great patriotism in the discharge of his duties.\n\n\u201cHe was a unifying force for the nation and his contribution to the growth and development of democracy in Nigeria cannot be forgotten in a hurry. In all situations, he lived nobly and he died in nobility. He was an achiever.\n\n\u201cIndeed, Chief Shonekan died at a time the country is in dire need of his leadership, wealth of experience and wisdom to tackle the multifaceted challenges facing the nation.\u201d\n\nIBB: Why I Made Shonekan Head of Interim Government\n\nFormer military president Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, while mourning the passing of Shonekan, also explained why he appointed him head of the interim national government, when he stepped aside as military president.\n\nIBB, as Babangida is called, said Shonekan was a man of ideas and ideals, who was prudent and preached a lot about fiscal discipline. \u201cIt was, therefore, timely for us to appoint him as Head of the Interim Government to help stabilise the polity at a most trying period of our country\u2019s political evolution.,\u201d Babangida stated\n\nIn a condolence message, Babangida expressed shock over the news of Shonekan\u2019s death and described him as one of Nigeria\u2019s finest brains and patriots.\n\nBabangida said, in a statement, \u201cI hadn\u2019t the faintest idea that Chief Ernest Shonekan would depart this sinful world too soon, even at 85. He was a man, a leader and an uncommon patriot, who had a presence of mind and whose understanding of Nigeria was profound and remarkable. It is, indeed, a personal loss to me.\n\n\u201cChief Ernest Shonekan was one of our cerebral minds during our time in government. He was the architect of our principle of free market economy, which helped to open up the system for a robust participation by the private sector. The liberalisation of the economy, the investment and boost in the agricultural sector and budget management approach were part of his brainchild.\n\n\u201cI recollect very vividly how he used to give us tutorials on budget, planning and management of national resources, each time he was invited to our session. At each budget year, Chief Shonekan would be invited to critique our budget proposals, and gave us further input to enrich the final budget. He was a man of ideas and ideals. He was prudent and preached so much about fiscal discipline.\n\n\u201cIt was, therefore, timely for us to appoint him as Head of the Interim Government to help stabilise the polity at a most trying period of our country\u2019s political evolution. He was a calm personality, whose managerial skills were foretold in the way and manner he managed a lot of blue chip companies.\n\n\u201cAs Head of the Interim Government, he was able to consult with a broad spectrum of the Nigerian populace in charting a roadmap out of the political impasse at that time. His brilliance and meticulous interrogation of situations helped in large measure to forge ahead during the period.\n\n\u201cI owe a personal gratitude to him throughout his sojourn on earth as we maintained very robust mutual relationship after his exit from the corridors of power.\u201d\n\nThe former military president added regarding Shonekan, \u201cGiven the achievements we recorded during our time in government in the area of infrastructure, economy and social rebirth, I owe a word of gratitude to him for his experienced intervention in helping to dissect our policy frameworks each time we called upon him to do so.\n\n\u201cHe was an engaging personality, whose sense of patriotism was total. He was friendly and sociable. He understood economy and made so many projections that helped us to bail the country out of economic conundrum. We benefited from his immense knowledge, experience and brilliance.\u201d\n\nJonathan, Atiku, Ayu Mourn, Pay Tributes\n\nFormer President Goodluck Jonathan, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, and National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, joined other Nigerians to mourn the passing of Chief Ernest Shonekan.\n\nJonathan, in a condolence message to his family and the government of Ogun State, described Shonekan as \u201can elder statesman, well-loved for his sincerity and sense of purpose.\n\n\u201cAs a leader, Chief Shonekan was well-respected, because of the enormous goodwill he brought into governance. He was a compassionate and determined administrator, a peacemaker and bridge builder, who stepped in to lead the nation at a very difficult time in the history of its political evolution.\n\n\u201cBefore he assumed office as the head of the Interim National Government in 1993, Chief Shonekan had become a boardroom guru, having established himself as a foremost industrialist and one of the leaders of the business world.\n\n\u201cHe left enduring legacies, part of which was his considerable effort towards mainstreaming the private sector in the development drive of the nation, especially, with the institutionalisation of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), which he founded.\u201d\n\nJonathan said Shonekan would be remembered for his great wisdom, peaceful disposition, the goodwill he extended to all, as well as his significant contributions to the growth of the economy of the nation.\n\nAtiku said, in his own message, \u201cIt is with a sad heart that I received the news of the death of the former Head of State and Chairman of the defunct Interim National Government, Chief Earnest Shonekan.\u201d\n\nIn the statement he personally signed, Atiku stated, \u201cMy grief is predicated, not just on the demise of the elder statesman, because he died at a prime age,\u201d but on his exit at a time, when the country needed his skills and global connections find solution to its multifarious challenges.\n\nThe former vice president stated, \u201cEither as a politician or a boardroom guru, Chief Shonekan possessed a unique set skill of bringing stability to a tumultuous situation. That obviously was the consideration that made him become Head of the Interim National Government following the crises that greeted the events after the June 12 presidential election.\n\n\u201cAlthough his reign as Head of State was interim, Chief Shonekan\u2019s contribution to the peace and development of Nigeria in those days and latter years, remains enduring.\n\n\u201cMy condolences go to his immediate family, the people and government of Ogun State and the entire nation for the loss of a man of industry and intellect, who lived a life of service to the country and humanity. It is my prayer that God Almighty receives his soul in a peaceful repose.\u201d\n\nAyu, while condoling with the federal government, the government of Ogun State, and the family of the departed corporate giant, described Shonekan as \u201ca detribalised Nigerian and elder statesman, who gave Nigeria his best.\u201d\n\nThe PDP chairman also said of Shonekan, \u201cHis death is a sunset on an illustrious career that straddled both the corporate sector and the public service. We are consoled that he lived a fulfilled life, and that his legacy of public service will outlive him.\u201d\n\nLawan: He\u2019ll be Remembered for Heeding Nigeria\u2019s Call to Duty\n\nPresident of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan, yesterday, said Shonekan would be remembered for heeding the nation\u2019s call to duty at a critical time.\n\nLawan, in a statement, condoled with Shonekan\u2019s family and the government and people of Ogun State over the death of the former Nigerian leader.\n\nThe senate president\u2019s message read, \u201cMy condolences go to the family of Chief Shonekan, the government and people of Ogun State and entire Nigeria over this great loss. Chief Shonekan was a lawyer, business captain, boardroom guru and statesman.\n\n\u201cBut he will be most remembered for heeding the nation\u2019s call to duty at a very turbulent period in the history of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cChief Shonekan\u2019s services as Chairman of the Transitional Council and later as Head of the Interim National Government were selfless and contributed greatly to saving the Nigerian ship from hitting the rock\u201d.\n\nAbiodun: His Death is a Colossal Loss\n\nOgun State Governor Dapo Abiodun, described the death of Shonekan as a huge loss. Abiodun, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, lamented that Shonekan, a former chairman of UAC Nigeria Plc., passed on at a period Nigeria needed his experience most as a technocrat.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cChief Shonekan was a first-class administrator, boardroom guru and astute leader, whose imprint in the business and political firmaments cannot be erased. His commitment to peaceful resolution and patriotic fervour will live after him.\n\n\u201cChief Shonekan, an Egba traditional chief (Babasale of Egbaland), was a true Nigerian, who spent most of his life for the betterment of the country.\u201d\n\nThe governor lamented the huge vacuum created by Shonekan\u2019s death.\n\nTinubu: He\u2019d Have Led Nigeria Same Way He Led UAC\n\nNational leader of APC, Bola Tinubu, yesterday, said were the circumstances of his ascension to power different, Shonekan would have led Nigeria the same way he led the United Africa Company (UAC).\n\nTinubu, in his condolence message, released by his media office and signed by Mr. Tunde Rahman, commiserated with Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun, Shonekan\u2019s widow, Mrs. Magret Shonekan, and the people of Ogun State over his passing.\n\nThe APC leader stated, \u201cI received with great sadness the news of the passing of the former Head of the Interim National Government, Chief Shonekan, at the advanced age of 85. I join his immediate family in mourning his passing, but also in celebrating his lifelong contributions to our great nation.\n\n\u201cWith his passing, the country has lost another important elder-statesman; a man of peace, who tried to bring unity and concord during one of the nation\u2019s most trying moments.\n\n\u201cChief Ernest was a technocrat and boardroom guru. He performed excellently as Chairman of United African Company, a vast Nigerian conglomerate. Indeed, were the circumstances of his ascension to the top position in our country different, I have little doubt that Chief Shonekan would have led Nigeria with the same vision and skill with which he guided UAC.\n\n\u201cHe had the character, competence, capability and the technical background to undertake the job. In his brief time as Head of State, Chief Shonekan tried his best to advance peace, stability and development in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cChief Shonekan will be remembered as a peacemaker and Head of State, who took office at a most difficult time. I commiserate with his immediate family, most especially, his loving wife, Mrs. Margret, Governor Dapo Abiodun, and all the people of Ogun State and Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAkeredolu: He was Committed to Nigeria\u2019s Peace, Unity\n\nChairman of the South-west Governors\u2019 Forum and Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, SAN, called Shonekan a nationalist, who was committed to the nation\u2019s peace and unity. in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary Richard Olatunde, Akeredolu described Shonekan\u2019s death as a huge loss to the country, noting that the vast experience of the elder statesman was an asset to the country, particularly, with the array of challenges confronting Nigeria.\n\nThe governor said Shonekan was committed to the peace and unity of the country, and pursued it with vigour and dedication as a patriot. He said the service of the former Head of Interim National Government would never be forgotten in the country\u2019s history.\n\nAkeredolu stated, \u201cChief Ernest Shonekan was a nationalist per excellence. His belief in a united and peaceful Nigeria was unparalleled. He was dedicated to the progress and development of the county. He will be sorely missed.\n\n\u201cHis historic and patriotic role in maintaining the unity of the country was one of the many things that endeared him to many. He was, indeed, an asset; his counsels were useful for national cohesion and progress.\u201d\n\nWike: Shonekan Boasted Topnotch Administrative Credentials\n\nRivers State Governor, Mr. Nyesom Wike, while mourning the passing of Shonekan, said his excellent administrative credentials helped in steering the ship of the country at a very critical time.\n\nIn his condolence massage, signed by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, Wike also described Shonekan as a dedicated Nigerian, who was committed to the peace and stability of the country. He said Shonekan\u2019s strong credentials as an astute administrator enabled him to steadfastly steer the country through one of its most turbulent times.\n\nWike said in the message, \u201cOn behalf of the government and good people of Rivers State, I offer our deepest condolences to the family, relatives of the former Chairman, Interim National Government and the people of Nigeria.\u201d The governor said Nigeria had lost an elder statesman whose wisdom, foresight, and steadfast commitment would always be remembered.\n\nUzodimma: in Shonekan, Nigeria Lost a Patriot\n\nImo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma, said the death of Shonekan was painful, stressing that the country has lost a great patriot.\n\nIn a statement by his Chief Press Secretary and Media Adviser, Oguwike Nwachuku, Uzodimma said Shonekan was one of Nigeria\u2019s statesmen and legal luminaries, who believed in the unity, progress and development of the country and actually worked hard in private and public sectors for the realisation of that dream.\n\nUzodimma added that Shonekan\u2019s legacy at the United African Company (UAC) would always speak volumes. He said Nigerians would not forget his contributions in a hurry.\n\nWhile regretting that the country had lost a boardroom icon, when his fatherly and statesman pieces of advice were highly needed, Uzodimma specifically commiserated with his widow, Mrs Margaret Shonekan, the entire Shonekan family, his friends, and the government and people of Ogun State over the loss.\n\nOn behalf of his family and the people of Imo State, the governor also condoled with President Muhammadu Buhari and Nigerians over Shonekan\u2019s death, and prayed God Almighty to grant the soul of the deceased a peaceful repose, and those he left behind him, the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.\n\nPDP: Shonekan, a Bridge-builder; His Death, a National Tragedy\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), yesterday, mourned the death of Shonekan, describing him as a bridge-builder, and his passing, as a national tragedy.\n\nIn a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Shonekan, PDP said Shonekan was a courageous, humble and patriotic leader. The opposition party said the departed leader was a bridge builder and an extraordinary statesman, who dedicated his life and made immense sacrifices to ensure the unity and stability of the country in the heat of the political crisis that threatened the corporate existence of the country following the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential election.\n\nThe main opposition party said Shonekan was an accomplished personality and a visionary leader, whose efforts in applying his vast experience as a consummate lawyer and businessman to reposition the nation, despite the daunting challenges faced by his three-month regime between August and November 1993, could not be forgotten.\n\nPDP said, \u201cChief Shonekan\u2019s commitment to the entrenchment of democracy was evident in his determination to restore the rule of law and transparency in governance.\n\n\u201cEven outside office, Chief Shonekan remained committed to the unity, stability and development of our nation. Our party grieves that he left the stage at the time the nation needed his wealth of experience and wise counsel the most.\u201d\n\nPDP commiserated with the federal government, the government and people of Ogun State, and the Shonekan family, praying God to grant the nation and the bereaved family the fortitude to bear the huge national loss.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s One of Last Generation of Pioneer Business Leaders\u2019\n\nStakeholders in the private sector, yesterday, reacted to the passage of Chief Earnest Shonekan and described him as one of the last generation of pioneer business leaders in Nigeria, who contributed immensely to the growth of the various sectors of the economy.\n\nPresident, Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI), Dr. Al-Mujtaba Abubakar, said Shonekan\u2019s demise was a \u201cbig loss to the private sector.\n\n\u201cHis was a life well spent; a life of extraordinary achievements from the boardroom to the highest office in the land.\u201d\n\nExecutive Director, Nigeria Private Sector Alliance (NiPSA), Mr. Nwiabu Legborsi Nuka, said, \u201cNigeria has lost a leader of repute and builder of businesses\u201d.\n\nIn the same vein, former Director General, ACCI, Dr. Chijioke Ekechukwu, described Shonekan as an enigma in the corporate world, having served on the boards of many blue chip companies as chairman.\n\nEkechukwu said, \u201cChief Ernest Shonekan was an enigma in the corporate world, as he served on the boards of many blue chip companies as Chairman. He distinguished himself as a role model for directors of companies on what running private sector boards should look like.\n\n\u201cIt was on the strength of these leadership qualities that he was appointed an Interim Head of State in Nigeria. Some of the board structures set out by him are still in place today. He will be missed by the corporate world. May his soul rest in peace.

          "title": "INTELS Responds to FG, Says Process of Awarding Pilotage Contract Not Closed",
          "text": "Eromosele Abiodun\n\nThe battle to retain its service boat contract in the pilotage district of Lagos, Warri, Bonny, Port-Harcourt and Calabar, which expired on August 8, 2020, may not be over yet as INTELS Nigeria Limited yesterday said it does not consider the process of awarding the Pilotage contract closed.\n\nIn a strongly worded statement in reaction to THISDAY exclusive report, which revealed that President Muhammadu Buhari has cancelled the restoration of INTELS service boat contract with the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), the company stated that it was yet to receive any form of communication from any quarters on the matter.\n\nINLTELS argued the service boat contract was being carried out by it for over a decade with excellent results both in terms of the service rendered and the revenue generated in favour of the NPA and by extension, Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThe reasons for this position are based on three fundamental points: the first is that INTELS is relying on a freezing order issued by the Federal High Court, which confirmed the continuity of operations of the pilotage activity even after the date of 8 August 2020, based on the clear wording of the agreement between the parties. It is also the subject of a pending arbitration.\n\n\u201cThis continuation is in the best interest of the country, the NPA and the managed clientele, especially given the ability of INTELS to oversee the pilotage districts/revenue centres for the NPA, thus guaranteeing the certainty of monitoring all the movements generated. This has resulted in a significant and constant financial benefit for the NPA.\u201d\n\nThe second point, the statement added, was about the debt ratio between IINTELS/affiliate and the NPA.\n\n\u201cAs is well known, INTELS/affiliate is owed over $700 million by the NPA, the repayment of which is guaranteed by the pilotage agreement through a mechanism of repayment of part of the revenues received by INTELS as agent and paid to the NPA.\n\n\u201cThis mechanism has worked perfectly well even after August 2020 and therefore it is not clear why it should be discontinued, to the benefit of other competitors that have no claim on the NPA, placing the NPA itself in a state of default that is difficult to sustain before international markets, economic operators and stakeholders, \u201cINTELS said.\n\nIt added, \u201cThe third, and perhaps most important point is that the NPA would receive an immediate benefit of $100 million from the proposed settlement by INTELS, a very substantial amount, as a result of the debt write-off that INTELS is prepared to grant to the NPA if the proposal is accepted.\n\n\u201cTo this amount would be added approximately a further $300 million, representing a change in the current contractual debt interest rate of 6.5 per cent to 3 per cent per annum. That is, approximately $20 million per year for the 15 years set out in the settlement proposal.\n\n\u201cAt this point the question arises, who takes responsibility at whichever level to waive an economic benefit of such magnitude that would provide an enormous boost to the NPA\u2019s budget and resolve years-long dispute with costs and expenses that could be allocated to other initiatives? It remains to be seen whether common sense and the country\u2019s interests will prevail in this case as well.\u201d\n\nTHISDAY had exclusively reported yesterday that President Muhammadu Buhari had upon receiving communication from the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Director General Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP), and Acting Director-General, Infrastructure Concession and Regulatory Commission (ICRC), who unanimously advised the president against the restoration of the contract, reversed his January 2021 directive to restore the contract.\n\nThe president, in a letter addressed to the AGF and the Minister of Transportation, with reference number: SH/COS/23/A/229, dated January 7, 2022, and singed by the Chief of Staff (COS) to the President, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, seen by THISDAY, had directed that the procurement process initiated by the procuring entity, NPA, that was submitted to the Federal Ministry of Transportation be forwarded immediately to the BPP for action.\n\nThe COS in the letter had stated: \u201cThe president has also directed that upon receipt of the No-objection approval from the BPP, a memorandum be presented by the Ministry of Transportation to the Federal Executive Council for consideration, that the Ministry of Transportation should ensure that the process is concluded within 60 days of the president\u2019s directive to avoid further loss of revenue by the federal government.\n\n\u201cThat NPA should ensure that the sanctity of the agreements with respect to Onne 4 (Berths 9, 10 & 11) be maintained, as there is no subsisting contract with INTELS for their utilisation.\u201d\n\nBuhari had also directed the AGF to ensure quick determination of the cases in court in view of their economic importance, stressing that the above set of directives prior approval dated January 22, 2021 granted on the matter.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Nigerian startup SeamlessHR, which provides payroll and HR software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions for medium to large-sized companies in several African countries, has closed a new $10 million Series A round.\n\nAfrica-focused VC firm, TLcom Capital led the round while some of SeamlessHR\u2019s existing investors participated once again, such as Lateral Capital and Enza Capital. Other investors in this round include Capria, Ingressive Capital, and a number of strategic private investors. The new funding brings total investments secured by the startup to $12.2 million, having previously raised $2.2 million seed in October 2020.\n\nWith the funding, SeamlessHR plans to further grow its team of 130 as it eyes a pan-African expansion with new South Africa and Kenya offices being mulled. The company also plans to add new product functionalities around artificial intelligence and HR data analytics, it said, in addition to a new embedded finance product currently being piloted.\n\nSeamlessHR started in 2013 as Insidify.com, a jobs aggregator with a recruitment management system that matched employers to job seekers. That was until its co-founders Emmanuel Okeleji and Deji Lana realised job sites could \u201cdo little to address the fundamental causes of unemployment in Africa,\u201d the former told TechCabal in an interview.\n\nAfter several iterations, the founders made a strategic pivot, relaunching in 2018 as an enterprise-grade, cloud-based HR and payroll management SaaS. SeamlessHR is currently used by hundreds of companies in Nigeria, Ghana, and Tunisia, including renowned brands like PwC, Flutterwave, Sterling Bank, TGI Group, Lagos Business School, AXA, and Chapel Hill Denham, according to the company. More than 100,000 employees from these organisations use SeamlessHR monthly.\n\n\u201cThanks to our customers, we have become the leading cloud HR and Payroll SaaS in Africa in such a short time,\u201d CEO Okeleji said. \u201cWe currently serve most of the medium to large-sized businesses [including ten Nigerian banks and five insurance companies] in countries where we\u2019re concentrated, with Nigeria being our focus market.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSeamlessHR is part of a cohort of startups that are reinventing the administrative stack in organisations. Others include YC-backed Workpay and Bento. But the company has some product advantages compared to other solutions and appears to be a market leader.\n\nFirstly, companies in some cases typically install \u201ccore HR\u201d software while they run payroll using another package or in-house. Switching from one siloed solution to the other can be incredibly hard. SeamlessHR\u2019s holistic solutions prevent this as its cloud platform enables client organisations and their people to automate and optimise the entire HR process, from recruitment to retirement. In addition to the core HR management system, it offers different tools to track analytics as well as manage performance and competency, employee recruitment, leave, and payroll.\n\nOkeleji also pointed out the user-friendliness of SeamlessHR, which has enabled it to capture some market share from other HR management SaaS providers, particularly foreign players Oracle and SAP. \u201cSome systems are so complex to use that you need to be certified. For SeamlessHR, it\u2019s user-friendly enough to understand with just one training during the onboarding,\u201d he said.\n\nWill Poole, Managing Partner at Capria notes that SeamlessHR is addressing the needs of African enterprises in \u201cways that the global giants can\u2019t compete with by building customer-centric SaaS designed from the ground-up to address complexity unique to the continent.\u201d\n\nIn Africa, SeamlessHR has a big market opportunity as every large company needs an HR and payroll solution. There\u2019s also a growing appetite for cloud computing solutions by organisations that wish to digitise their workplaces. From an estimated market size of $14.2 billion in 2021, the Middle East and Africa\u2019s cloud computing industry is expected to grow to $31.4 billion by 2026. \u201cFor a company that has 20 employees, HR software is a nice to have. But if you have 600 employees, then you have a pain that we solve,\u201d the CEO said.\n\nAfter capturing the Nigerian market to a significant extent and growing headline revenue 3x year-on-year (except in 2020 due to the pandemic-induced economic slowdown), the startup has now set its sights on companies in other African countries.\n\nBut finding the right talent remains a key problem. In addition, the size and readiness of the African economy for software services is relatively small and nascent, according to Okeleji. \u201cIf we were an American company, we\u2019d probably be doing 6x growth for the efforts we put in because the economy is bigger and we\u2019d have a lot more customers and can charge higher prices.\u201d\n\nTo expand its client base, the CEO does not rule out expanding SeamlessHR to markets outside of Africa but notes that for now, the focus is on Africa and the team isn\u2019t \u201cdistracted\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is only the beginning. We are committed to customer success and this funding will enable us to invest in the continuous optimisation of customer experience across all touchpoints, adding new features and functionalities starting from Q2 this year,\u201d Okeleji said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Unchecked ambition, lax regulations: The genesis of predatory digital lenders in Nigeria",
          "text": "Ebuka Anyaeji thought he had seen it all, so when he first received a threat message about being a guarantor to a debtor on the run, he dismissed it as a joke, a message sent by an angry creditor to the wrong phone number. But the messages (WhatsApp and text) kept coming in; then Anyaeji found out his friends were also getting the same.\n\nLater on, the harassment moved from messages to phone calls\u2014real-time and pre-recorded calls. The content of the messages transitioned from just informing him that someone was owing the creditor money to threatening to embarrass him if he didn\u2019t get the defaulting debtor in question to pay.\n\n\u201cThe messages typically went along this line: \u2018This person is owing us money, and you\u2019re one of his guarantors. Tell him to pay or else we\u2019ll embarrass both of you\u2019,\u201d Anyaeji told TechCabal. \u201cIn some instances, they mentioned the amount of money owed, which was surprisingly low\u2014about \u20a610,000 ($17.8) or \u20a630,000 ($53.6)\u2014or in other cases they just referred to the debtor as a chronic debtor or fraudulent individual.\u201d\n\nOut of the numerous messages he\u2019s gotten, there\u2019s been only one occasion where he knew the debtor being referred to\u2014a university mate. What did he do about this case? He didn\u2019t bother informing the person, because they weren\u2019t close.\n\nA screenshot of Anyaeji\u2019s Whatsapp chat.\n\nFor Anyaeji, who now occasionally dishes out witty responses to the senders of these messages just for fun, he wonders why the debt collection practices of digital lenders like Soko Loan, LCash, 9Jacash among others use shaming tactics and, more importantly, whether this new trend would continue unchecked.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always like this\n\nThere is no doubt that Africans have embraced taking loans through digital-lending apps. They are discreet, quick to access, and require no collateral. But this also means lenders who use the repayment habits of users to gauge their creditworthiness\u2014and never physically meet their customers\u2014often struggle with loan repayment.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t always been like this in Nigeria. Loans were primarily issued out by traditional banks, who rarely ever gave out loans without the backing of collateral or guarantors.\n\nIn the case of a loan default, before it ever gets to the point where a defaulting debtor\u2019s collateral is seized, there are a number of checks put in place. First, loans are given only after credit checks have been run and the account relationship manager can vouch for a potential borrower. When a borrower defaults, the account relationship manager first reaches out to the lender to find out the reason, and even visits to confirm. Guarantors and referees are also contacted, if need be.\n\n\u201cAs long as both parties are open and transparent, penalty charges don\u2019t come in yet. Until when they\u2019re past due obligations, which is typically over 90 days,\u201d an employee of a Nigerian bank, who spoke under anonymity, told TechCabal.\n\nOftentimes, while the account officer is following up with the defaulting customer, the monitoring team and even bank directors can also check up on the defaulting customer. The conversations typically revolve around ascertaining the repayment ability of the customer, restructuring the loan to extend the tenure and possibly waiving off penalty charges.\n\nIf all efforts to reach a reasonable agreement or recover the debt fail, the bank reverts to possessing the item\u2014usually a house or car\u2014used as collateral. This is a last resort that the bank isn\u2019t keen on exercising, another banker told TechCabal. \u201cWe detest having to possess people\u2019s lands or houses, which serve as collateral; the bank is not into real estate,\u201d he said.\n\nHow did lending apps come into the picture?\n\nFor a long time, Nigerian banks preferred to lend to businesses and not individuals. This led to the rise of new lenders like Carbon (formerly Paylater), Renmoney, and Branch that have filled the gap by offering quick loans through smartphone apps.\n\nTemi Sodipo, a credit risk analyst recalls the early days when there were only a few prominent Nigerian digital lenders like Renmoney and Paylater. But, as the years went by, new digital lenders popped up at different corners. People were at first skeptical but, over time, consumer confidence grew.\n\n\u201cI remember in late 2017 when we disbursed \u20a61 billion ($1.8m) in loans at Renmoney, we had a party to celebrate. In early 2019, when we issued \u20a64 billion ($7.3m) loans, it was just a normal month,\u201d he said.\n\nWith more digital lenders coming into the space, Sodipo believes that, despite the fact that many claim they\u2019re getting more people financially included, most digital lenders serve the same set of people because the terms for accessing the loans are similar. The terms include a six-month-long bank statement, verifiable government ID, employment letter, or work email verification.\n\nHe believes this has created an avenue for a few ambitious players who wanted a slice of the market to become lax with their rules. Some digital lenders even started giving out loans to people with bad ratings on credit bureau\u2014an obvious red flag.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder why they turn to desperate debt collection measures as they contend with a high rate of default. It\u2019s simply bad underwriting and not paying attention to basic credit risk principles,\u201d Sodipo said.\n\nCommercial banks also started dishing out instant loans\n\nIn 2020, at least half of the 22 existing Nigerian commercial banks started offering instant loan products without collaterals, something that was unheard of years ago. What was the driver of this move? A new directive by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).\n\nIn July 2019, the CBN announced an increase in the required minimum Loan-Deposit Ratio (LDR) of commercial banks to 60% from 57.64%. At the end of September, it further increased the LDR to 65%. LDR stipulates the volume of loans a bank must give out as a percentage of its total deposit. In the case of 65% LDR, it meant that if, for instance, a bank has \u20a6100 billion of customer deposits, it must have at least \u20a665 billion issued as loans. The increase was done to encourage commercial banks to issue more loans to individuals and businesses in order to stimulate the economy.\n\nTo avoid the sanctions that came with not meeting the LDR, these commercial banks began offering instant loan products without collaterals at risk of high repayment default rate. When debtors defaulted, the banks, however, unlike digital lenders, responded differently to the defaults.\n\nA source familiar with this incident told TechCabal that, unlike the digital lenders, these big commercial banks can afford to introduce these types of loans and make a loss on them, considering that they make tens and hundreds of billions of naira in profit.\n\nIn addition to being able to absorb the loss, the CBN issued a directive\u2014the Global Standing Instructions (GSI) policy\u2014that gave banks the right to deduct the amount owed from the bank account of the loan defaulters in other banks, in order to reduce the amount of non-performing loans\u2014a move that reduced the chances of defaulting customers owing while having money with other banks.\n\nOptions available to digital lenders\n\nCurrently, digital lenders don\u2019t have the right to debit the accounts of loan defaulters in other banks via GSI, so they rely on automated card debits, repayment reminders, and reporting customers to the credit bureau as a last resort. But do these methods work?\n\nJulian Flosbach, CEO of BFree, an ethical debt recovery company, believes they do if they consider the reasons customers default as well as their current financial situation. According to flosbach a majority of borrowers default because they lose their jobs, their business fails, or due to health emergencies that change the financial affordability of customers. He believes that assessing the new financial abilities of a customer and offering new repayments plans via convenient communication channels can then increase the repayment rates from these customers significantly.\n\nAn employee at a digital lending company explained that reporting to the credit bureau could be effective at times. She cited a case of a defaulting debtor whose application visa was denied because he failed to repay his loan for over a year. Credit checks are a prerequisite for issuing visas in some countries.\n\nShe also affirms Sodipo\u2019s point about an influx of lenders with lax rules by saying, \u201cIt\u2019s typically companies not registered with the credit bureau that use unethical debt collection practices.\u201d\n\nSlow and steady doesn\u2019t win this race\n\nIt\u2019s clear that digital lenders involved in unethical debt collection practices do so because of their unchecked ambition and the convenience of operating outside the law.\n\nFortunately, a number of governing bodies are beginning to do something about these digital lenders. In August 2021, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) imposed a \u20a610 million naira ($18,000) fine (a questionable small amount) on Soko Lending Company, one of the digital lenders which repeatedly contacted Anyaeji.\n\nA few months later, in October, Google took down a number of predatory loan apps from its Play Store for violating its policies. Despite these actions, the pace of the response from Nigerian regulators is slow when compared to Kenya, where in December a new law was put in place to curtail the excesses of digital lenders.\n\nIf victims like Anyaeji and his friends would ever be free from the disturbance and intimidation from these predatory digital lenders, Nigeria\u2019s regulators would have to increase the pace of their response.\n\nShare this article",
          "summary": "But, as the years went by, new digital lenders popped up at different corners.\nSome digital lenders even started giving out loans to people with bad ratings on credit bureau\u2014an obvious red flag.\nWhen debtors defaulted, the banks, however, unlike digital lenders, responded differently to the defaults.\nFortunately, a number of governing bodies are beginning to do something about these digital lenders.\nIf victims like Anyaeji and his friends would ever be free from the disturbance and intimidation from these predatory digital lenders, Nigeria\u2019s regulators would have to increase the pace of their response.",

          "title": "On the making of King of Boys, Netflix\u2019s first original Nigerian series",
          "text": "2021 was a year that came with many pleasant surprises, top of which was the release of the sequel to the 2018 thriller, King of Boys.\n\nUnlike the first movie, which was released in the cinemas and raked in a whopping \u20a6245 million at the box office (second highest-grossing Nollywood movie in 2018), the sequel\u2013King of Boys: The return of the King\u2014was released on Netflix as its first original Nigerian series.\n\nThe King of Boys sequel (KOB 2) picks up five years after the events of the first film, with the protagonist, Eniola Salami, returning to Nigeria after a five-year exile and diving straight into fierce competition for the seat of the Governor of Lagos State. Directed by Kemi Adetiba, the sequel retained some lead acts from the first King of Boys movie, with refreshing additions like musician Charly Boy, and veteran actor Richard Mofe-Damijo.\n\nKOB 2 was well received by movie lovers as it topped Netflix\u2019s top-ten movie charts for many weeks. Considered by many as a great addition to Netflix\u2019s expansive library of TV series and films, it helped the streaming giant gain more subscribers in the African region.\n\nAhead of the release of a documentary about the making of the King of Boys franchise, TechCabal spoke to Michael \u201cAMA psalmist\u201d Akinrogunde, the director of the documentary, who was also the production coordinator and one of the second unit directors of KOB 2. Akinrogunde is notably the director of Ghost and the Tout 2, one of Nollywood\u2019s highest-grossing movies in 2021, and a 2018 Africa Magic Viewers Choice Award (AMVCA) winner.\n\nMichael \u201cAMA psalmist\u201d Akinrogunde\n\nDaniel Adeyemi: So, I\u2019m going to start with a plot-related question that everyone\u2019s been asking. When did Makanaki and Eniola Salami meet to settle their differences?\n\nMichael Akinrogunde: Well, it depends on how you watched the movie.\n\nDA: But I watched it more than twice.\n\nMA: I can only say what has been shown. (laughs)\n\nDA: Okay, fair enough. What was different about creating this movie in partnership with Netflix?\n\nMA: Interestingly, as at the time we started shooting KOB 2, I don\u2019t think it was confirmed as a Netflix original. However, it didn\u2019t affect the way we shot it or how professional it was, as that\u2019s always been Kemi Adetiba\u2019s style. The production was already set to be a world-class one, whether Netflix was going to be on board or not.\n\nDA: Considering that this was Netflix\u2019s first Nigerian original series, how much technical support did Netflix bring in?\n\nMA: I wouldn\u2019t say there was much of that because Kemi already approached the movie with the mindset that she\u2019s making it to international standards. So, we were using the best cameras and lenses available to achieve the shots we needed. We also worked with some of the most talented crew and cast.\n\nDA: What was the difference between shooting a regular movie and a 7-part series?\n\nMA: Another thing that\u2019s noteworthy is that, when we finished shooting King of Boys, nobody knew we had shot a series. On the script, it was a regular movie and, as you will see in the documentary, it was converted into a series because the movie was too long and there was no part we felt we could cut. Even after it was converted to a series, at the end of the first cut edit, the whole series, according to the editor, was about nine hours long, not the seven hours that was released.\n\nDA: Wow! Nine hours. Maybe that\u2019s where you cut out Makani and Eniola Salami settling their differences?\n\nMA: I don\u2019t know. (laughs)\n\nDA: Fair enough. What\u2019s something that was subtle in the movie but impacted its perception by the audience?\n\nMA: Personally, it was the brilliant lacing of drama with action. The movie was structured in a way that gave an action movie feel, with few stunts and fighting scenes. Having a lot of guards, guns, and machetes shown in different scenes made viewers feel like they were watching an action movie.\n\nDA: Looking at the action scenes, how did the crew achieve the sequences?\n\nMA: I saw first-hand how incredible Kemi is with blocking. I also think the crew found creative ways to make it work. If there\u2019s anything Hollywood has, it\u2019s probably more stuntmen who can do more flips; and more robotic equipment, which we didn\u2019t necessarily \u201cneed\u201d in this movie. The explosion scene was computer-generated imagery. In the scene where young and old Eniola were speaking at the same time after the elders had been shot, we used a welding machine to create the sparks-of-light effect which we fine-tuned in post-production. The explosion on the table was done with a type of safe bomb that explodes with colours. The stunt experts marked out safe areas; we would do a few rehearsals, and then shoot the scenes.\n\nDA: Were there other scenes where you had to improvise?\n\nMA: Yes, sure. Shooting in the middle of the pandemic meant we had to improvise. For example, the scene where Makanaki goes to meet the babalawo, that wasn\u2019t shot in a forest; it was in a hotel hall. Also, the snake that was on Odogwu Malay\u2019s car wasn\u2019t real.\n\nDA: What was it like shooting around Lagos?\n\nMA: It almost felt like a Lagos tour, which isn\u2019t typical for a Nollywood movie because you\u2019d usually try to keep the production cost low by limiting movement. With KOB, it was whatever was needed to make the scene happen. We shot for about 63 days, with the exception of a few days when we couldn\u2019t shoot because of the #EndSARs protests and the weather.\n\nWe shot on the mainland and the island\u2014Lekki, Ajah, Ijora. We shot in places I didn\u2019t even know people were allowed to shoot, but the team, being resilient, got the necessary permit to shoot.\n\nDA: How did technology help in the coordination and production of the movie?\n\nMA: The KOB 2 set was a large set. We had about 60\u201390 crew members, depending on the production needs on a particular day. On some days we needed more people because of the scenes we were shooting. Most of the communication was done via walkie-talkie because of the need to communicate changes and general updates to team leads. For example, say we planned to shoot set scenes 1, 3, 4, 5, and then there\u2019s a traffic delay for the cast coming in, or there\u2019s a wardrobe malfunction, you can\u2019t just keep production waiting. You might need to shoot a scene that wasn\u2019t planned before. We also used WhatsApp and Cloud storage. We had to do a lot of collaborative work across different time zones, because one of the key producers, Remi Adetiba, wasn\u2019t in the country. So, we had to share the videos shot via Google Drive and do some video calls to keep the show running smoothly.\n\nDA: What was surprising about the response from the audience to KOB 2?\n\nMA: I don\u2019t think there was anything that was necessarily surprising. I was more blown away when we started topping the charts on Netflix before it was released. That blew me away; it meant that people were waiting for this.\n\nPersonally, I had a small fear that people might not open their hearts to it because there\u2019s a general fear that people have about movie sequels that come with a different storyline or characters. Fans tend to personalise things that they love. They say things like, \u201cDon\u2019t spoil our movie; leave it the way it is.\u201d\n\nI was skeptical that people might not understand some things I saw in the private screening with other crew members, but then to see people go even deeper into analysing the movie is exciting to see.\n\nDA: Are we getting another KOB sequel?\n\nMA: This is entirely up to the creators of the show! However, I think most people are anticipating a sequel because of how KOB 2 ended. Just like the first part, the movie ends in a way that hints at a follow-up. However, for now, let\u2019s all just enjoy the magic of the moment!\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Cameroon risks stunting mobile money growth with new transaction levy",
          "text": "Among Cameroonians, new year celebrations have so far coincided with pushback against a new tax on mobile money transactions introduced by the Paul Biya administration.\n\nFrom January 1, 2022, a 0.2% tax on the transfer and withdrawal of money via mobile wallets came into force, as required by the newly enacted 2022 Finance Bill signed by President Biya last November.\n\nThe tax applies to all transactions made through traceable platforms, including mobile telephony and the internet, with the exception of bank transfers and electronic transactions carried out to pay tax and customs duties.\n\nIn other words, people using money transfer platforms will incur additional fees of 0.2% when sending and 0.2% when withdrawing. That means a total of 4,000 XAF ($7) will be charged in taxes on the transfer of 1 million XAF ($1,725) between two Cameroonians.\n\nThese taxes, expected to add more liquidity to state coffers, are in addition to existing charges on mobile money transactions in Cameroon which users already complain about.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMobile money is hugely popular among Cameroon\u2019s 26.5 million people, particularly used by the unbanked, middle- and lower-class citizens as well as small business owners.\n\nIn Cameroon, only a third, or 35%, of adults are estimated to have bank accounts whereas mobile phone penetration has increased over the years. Network operators, led by MTN and Orange, have thus tapped into the existing mobile infrastructure to offer financial services to their subscribers.\n\nAs of 2020, Cameroon accounted for 65% (19.5 million) of the overall active mobile wallets in the CEMAC regional zone, per data from the Bank of Central African States (BEAC).\n\nIn line with growing adoption, transaction costs have increased over the past few years. To send or withdraw 100,000 XAF ($172), for instance, a user has to pay close to 2% (1,800 XAF, $3) in fees to the operator, which in turn remits part of that to the government as value-added tax.\n\nMany Cameroonians thus consider yet another mobile money tax unfair, especially to the poorest, unbanked segments of the population, and have taken to social media to express their discontent. A trendy hashtag #endmobilemoneytax has been making the rounds on Twitter over the past week.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine being charged a tax to withdraw your own cash out of your account?\u201d Rebecca Enonchong, a leader in the African tech ecosystem and one of the key voices against the new tax wrote in a tweet on January 2. \u201cThis tax is regressive and will slow financial inclusion. #EndMobileMoneyTax. #WeSayNo.\u201d\n\nThe new mobile money tax will especially hit the poorest, unbanked segments of Cameroon society. There is no such tax on wire transfers through banks. And it's paid twice. Once to send. Once to receive.\n\n\n\nAnd all for what? To pay for government excesses and corruption. \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) January 1, 2022\n\nI want to send 100,000 F (+ withdrawal fees); that's 101,800 F.\n\n\n\nA. Sender\n\nMTN fees = 300 F\n\nTax = 0.2% = 203.6 F\n\n\n\nTOT = 102,303.6 F\n\n\n\nB. Receiver\n\nGets 101,800 F and is taxed 0.2% AGAIN.\n\n\n\nMTN Fees = 1,800 F\n\nTax = 203.6 F\n\n\n\nWithdrawable = 99,796.4 F#EndMobileMoneyTax \u2014 Sahyuo BAD (@Sahyuo_) January 1, 2022\n\nA Douala-based entrepreneur, who asked to be anonymous, considers the tax an additional cost burden on the ordinary person in Cameroon and thinks it could discourage the use of mobile money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially double taxation and means the average person will incur more cost when sending and/or withdrawing money,\u201d she said. \u201cThe impact will be even more severe on business owners like me. I might just have to seek other options.\u201d\n\nAcross Africa, the success of mobile money services has attracted the attention of authorities looking to expand their revenue base and new taxes are often imposed without assessing their full impact.\n\nIn countries where such taxes have been implemented, a GSMA report found that taxation was harming the uptake of mobile money services and businesses. A later study also points out that many mobile money users belong to \u201cmarginalised societal groups\u201d hence the negative impact on financial inclusion and broader development goals of mobile money taxes is significant.\n\nFor the wider economy and government coffers, these taxes cause a contraction in mobile money transaction values and their growth trajectory reduces, with negative implications for wider corporate income and value-added taxes.\n\nWithin the region, a plan by Ghana\u2019s finance ministry to introduce a 1.75% levy on electronic transactions in the 2022 budget is still being debated by lawmakers. That\u2019s in addition to an earlier move to increase taxes on mobile money agents. Similarly, a 1% tax on mobile money transactions in Uganda was cut in half after protests.\n\nUnlike Ghana\u2019s case, however, citizens were barely informed of the details before Cameroon\u2019s government implemented the new mobile money tax in November, according to local media reports.\n\nThe government has so far ignored the outrage, but some Cameroonians hope authorities will hear their complaints and review the decision, similar to Tanzania, where the state slashed a new mobile money tax by 30% after protests by citizens. \u201cKnowing our government, a review of the law is all we can hope for now,\u201d the entrepreneur said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Formerly called Afrikrea, the startup will now be called ANKA. With the fresh injection of capital, it will be focusing on building the mobile infrastructure of ANKA\u2019s eCommerce SaaS, hiring more talent, and product development.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpeaking on the raise, Moulaye Taboure, CEO and Co-founder of ANKA, said, \u201cAs our vision and clients\u2019 needs had outgrown the singular purpose of the Afrikrea marketplace, operating under ANKA provides a more holistic description of our mission as a pan-African company.\u201d\n\nWhile there are numerous eCommerce companies in Africa, only a few enable Africans to sell to customers outside the continent. ANKA was founded in 2016 to fill that gap. Since its inception, the startup has reportedly completed over $35 million in transactions, with over 80% of its retailers being women.\n\nCyberattacks in Africa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Dan Nelson on Unsplash\n\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, you don\u2019t lose any sleep over potential cyberattacks.

Their data for 2021 shows that the number of cyberattacks per week increased by 50% compared to 2020.\n\nThe sectors that saw the most attacks were the education/research sector, with government/military second. Of all regions surveyed, Africa had the highest volume of attacks, with organisations on the continent facing 1353 attacks weekly.\n\nAfrica is no stranger to cybersecurity attacks. In June 2020, Life Healthcare Group, a private hospital operator in South Africa was forced to switch to manual systems following an attack on its digital infrastructure.

          "title": "Crypto made it to AFCON! Aren\u2019t African governments wary?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood day\n\nOluwanifemi, here\n\nToday, I\u2019m discussing:\n\nCrypto at AFCON\n\nTouch and Pay (TAP)\u2019s Cowry card\n\nCrypto ads at AFCON\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Sky Sports\n\nThe African Cup of Nations (AFCON) 2022 kicked off on Sunday, January 9, in Cameroon. Although there have been multiple postponements, anticipation didn\u2019t quite wane. So far, four matches have been played, and many more are to come before the finale on February 6.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t know a lot about sports, but I\u2019ve grown a liking for football, and I\u2019ve been conveniently drawn to foreign leagues, especially the Premier League and UEFA Champions League. Following the buzz around AFCON, I asked Emmanuel Paul if players were on an international break. \u201cApparently not,\u201d he replied.\n\nAfrica is a great exporter of talents, and this includes football. This means some foreign clubs would have to miss their players for some weeks. Well, my real worry was Chelsea having Kepa Arrizabalaga man the nets for its upcoming major matches\ud83d\ude10, instead of Mendy, who is off to make Senegal proud. Anyways, the entire situation was surprising since AFCON is one of the world\u2019s major continental tournaments, like Euros and Copa America.\n\nWant to know something even more surprising? Binance is a major sponsor for AFCON. Before expressing my main concern, I also found that Nigerian-founded payments startup, Flutterwave partnered with Afrosport TV, the cable channel that acquired AFCON broadcast rights. Cool, isn\u2019t it?\n\nSo, back to Binance. Getting the global crypto-trading platform on AFCON basically translates to legitimately allowing millions of Africans to see crypto ads on every matchday. The terms of the partnership involve having Binance adverts placed on the perimeter boards on all the stadiums hosting AFCON matches. 52 live matches!\n\nOh, the irony. I hope we\u2019re not quick to forget the hostility of African central banks and regulatory agencies toward digital currencies. One that readily comes to mind is the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) restricting cryptocurrency in Nigeria. Despite all that, Africa still tops the chart regarding peer-to-peer (P2P) payment platforms in terms of transaction volume globally. Source? 2020 and 2021 stats.\n\nRecall? Nigeria continues to lead crypto peer-to-peer transactions\n\nIt might not be convenient to argue that the football governing body for Africa, the Confederation of Africa Football (CAF), isn\u2019t aware of this apathy. Does this further confirm the suspicion that African governments, like many other countries, are comfortable with leaving the cryptocurrency sector unregulated only to clamp down on it occasionally?\n\nIt\u2019s not new. Between 2018 and now, more cryptocurrency and blockchain companies have gotten into sports worldwide. A crypto-trading platform, eToro is one of Europe\u2019s biggest football sponsors. Clubs like Tottenham Hotspur FC, Brighton & Hove Albion FC, Cardiff City FC, Crystal Palace FC, Leicester City FC, Newcastle United FC, and Southampton FC make the list. In fact, in 2021, Binance became the main jersey sponsor for S.S. Lazio, an Italian football club.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCrypto.com sponsored the US Superbowl for $700 million, and FTX has shelled out almost $150 million for the NBA\u2019s Miami Heat.\n\nBolu, our reporter covering cryptocurrency and blockchain, can enlighten you, our esteemed readers, about crypto use cases in sports. Only if you ask. Leave your request in the comment section.\n\nWhether this was an oversight or the sports body chose to look away from the hostility instead of losing investor funds, it seems sports is playing a good role here in supporting digital currencies in Africa. Well\u2026\n\nCashless bus rides with Cowry card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaying for bus fares with TAP\u2019s Cowry card\n\nHave you ever thought about paying for your bus fare with a bank card or transferring money to your bus conductor?\n\nWell, if you\u2019ve lived in Lagos for long enough, you\u2019ll know that\u2019s something that might never happen. Conductors like speed; they want transactions to be done on time and will even ask you to \u201center with your change.\u201d\n\nBut what if you don\u2019t have change or worse, you forget your wallet at home? Scenarios like this propelled Micheal Oluwole and Olamide Afolabi to start the company, Touch and Pay (TAP).\n\nTAP is the company behind the Cowry cards used to pay for bus fares on BRT buses. The cards are Near Field Communication (NFC) enabled, so payment can be made with a single touch.\n\nAccording to Oluwole and Afolabi, the idea behind TAP is to create something close to cash transactions as this is the best way to digitise transactions in the informal sector where cash reigns supreme.\n\nThey spoke to Bolu about how they got the Lagos deal, their ups and downs and some of the big plans they have for the future.\n\nRead all about it here: How Touch and Pay (TAP) got 1.5 million Lagosians to adopt cashless bus rides\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading\n\nY Combinator will now invest $500,000 in accelerated companies.

          "title": "2023 Guber Polls: Could the return of Austin Igwe Edeze to PDP alter Ebonyi State political equation?",
          "text": "By Chris Nwanze\n\nThe recent detection of Chief Austin Igwe Edeze from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in Ebonyi State has jolted the prevalent political equation, vis-a-vis the 2023 political permutations in the state. Already, speculations are rife that Chief Edeze, a charismatic and populist political figure from Izzi LGA in Ebonyi North Senatorial District, may be the man to beat as preparations for the Guber race gathers momentum.\n\nAt a recent meeting of the Ebonyi North Caucus of the PDP during the Yuletide, held at The Retreat, Umuebe home of their leader, Sen. Sam Ominyi Egwu, Edeze reportedly presented himself to the leaders of the zone. As a member of the APC Board of Trustees before his detection, his exit must have created a long night for Gov. David Umahi whose political fortunes have nose-dived since he joined the ruling APC in October, 2020. The Ebonyi APC has witnessed a steady decline in quality membership since then.\n\nA Member of the Order of the Niger (MON), Edeze is perceived in some quarters as moving into PDP in order to hijack the Guber ticket. He is Sen. Sam Egwu\u2019s right hand man. He was a dedicated and loyal disciple to Egwu during his days as Governor of Ebonyi State. He occupied the sensitive post of Executive Chairman of Universal Basic Education Board (UBEB) and gave a good account of himself. He built the the imposing and massive UBEB Headquarters structure located along Enugu-Abakaliki Expressway. Edeze\u2019s populist administrative style has made him a popular figure in Ebonyi politics. He is seen as a hero amongst primary and secondary School teachers in the state. Edeze is also an influential sportsman. He was the President of Nigeria Amateur Wrestling Federation from 1994-2009 and currently an Executive Member of African Wrestling Council.\n\nEdeze is also seen as a good party man. A top PDP Chieftain who spoke to this writer on condition of anonymity said that if Sen. Egwu buys into the Guber project of Edeze, it would not be difficult for the leader of the party in the state, Sen. Anyim Pius Anyim(former Senate President and former Secretary to the Government of the Federation), to lend his support for Edeze. Moreover, Edeze is highly committed to the Presidential aspiration of Anyim and has the national network required to contribute effectively to the presidential project. A random opinion survey conducted among PDP members across the state revealed that members are quite jubilant about Edeze\u2019s return to the PDP and the prospects of his joining the 2023 Guber race. There are others who believe that Edeze\u2019s coming may resolve the logjam over the Guber primaries billed to come up around July, 2022. \u201cThere had been a search for a popular grassroot politician who will ignite the political scene in the state. Edeze could be the man they were waiting for\u201d, one party man narrated.\n\nBut in Izzi clan, Edeze\u2019s emergence has been received with a measure of calmness and cold-calculations. Some forces in Izzi who joined the Guber race earlier have been forced to go back to the drawing board. Frontline Guber aspirants from Izzi clan include Sylvester Ogbaga, a four-term House of Reps member and former Chairman of Abakaliki LGA. Others are: Engr Fidelis Nwankwo, a former Minister of State for Health and former Chairman of Izzi LGA and Chukwuma Nwazunku, a two-term House of Reps member and former Speaker of Ebonyi House of Assembly.\n\nEdeze has to contend with these aspirants within Izzi Clan-an area generally believed to be favoured to clinch the Guber ticket on account of the zoning/rotation principle. But politics is neither a straight game nor a mathematical exercise.\n\nIn Ebonyi Central District, two political gladiators are equally in the race for the 2023 Guber race. They are Sen. Obinna Ogba, two-term Senator representing the zone in the National Assembly and Edwin Anayo Nwonu, a two-term House of Reps member representing Ezza North and Ishielu Federal Constituency. Sen. Ogba was a former State Chairman of PDP. Edwin Anayo Nwonu, himself is not a push over. A successful business tycoon and industrialist, he is popular amongst Ezza elements in the state. He was Special Adviser to former Bayelsa Governor, Seriake Dickson on Non-Indigenes Affairs.\n\nOn the 1st of January, 2022, Sen. Ogba officially declared his intention to run for the Governorship race. In the course of his declaration, the Senator stirred the honet\u2019s nest. He stated that, \u201d there is nothing like Charter of Equity in Ebonyi State\u201d. He argued that \u201csince all the three zones have produced Governorship positions, the race should be thrown open and not restricted to Ebonyi North Senatorial zone\u201d, where the Izzi clan holds sway. The first democratically elected Governor (1999-2007), Dr. Sam Egwu came from Ohaukwu LGA in Ebonyi North zone. He was followed by Chief Martin Ekechi from Ikwo in Ebonyi Central Zone(2007-2015). The incumbent Governor, Engr. Davis Umahi, from Ohaozara LGA in Ebonyi South zone would complete his 8-year tenure in May 29, 2023. Sen. Ogba had challenged those making a case for Charter of Equity or Rotational Principle to produce the document on the Charter, if anything like that ever existed.\n\nThere is no doubt that Sen Ogba has succeeded in setting up a major debate on which zone should produce the next Governor of Ebonyi state.\n\nBy the time the dust settles, the PDP would have used it\u2019s internal machinery to decide which candidate would fly its flag for the 2023 race- a very crucial decision for that matter. All said and done, and from all indications, an Izzi candidate for the PDP is most likely to be the most popular and dominant option. The search is for an Izzi clan candidate with a liberal character and exposure to accommodate other groups in the state, including Non-Indigenes who form a bulk of the business class in Abakaliki, the state capital. In this regard, Austin Igwe Edeze stands tall amongst the Izzi aspirants.\n\nBorn in Ndiogbu Ndieze, Inyimagu in Izzi LGA on 1st January, 1960, Edeze attended Inyimagu Central School, Iboko and obtained the First School Leaving Certificate in 1974. He proceeded to Abakaliki High School(Presco) same year and obtained the West African School Certificate in 1979. He later bagged a Diploma in Cooperative Studies from the Federal Cooperative College, Awgu in present day Enugu State. He also attended the Anambra State College of Education, Awka from where he obtained the National Certificate in Education( NCE) in 1984 before launching out to the University of Nigeria, Nsukka where he obtained his BSc( Hons) degree in Agriculture(Education).\n\nEdeze is a consumate administrator, teacher and technocrat who grew through the ranks. He held many strategic positions at the national level and in the public service in the old Enugu and Ebonyi states. From 1994-97, he was the Secretary-General of the Association of Education Secretaries of Nigeria. From 2003-2008, he was the Dean/Chairman of Executive Chairmen of Universal Basic Education Boards of Nigeria. He was also elected the President of Nigeria Amateur Wrestling Federation of Nigeria in 1994 and in 2006 was elected the Deputy Secretary-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo. He is currently an Executive Member of African Wrestling Council with Headquarters in Morocco.\n\nEdeze\u2019s grassroot popularity can be gleaned from his profile, which marks him out as a man of many parts, always into many things at the same time. In 1981, he was an Instructor at the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in old Anambra State. He was a Classroom Teacher at Army Day Secondary School, Abakaliki in 1988 and by 1992 became the Deputy Executive Secretary of Izzi Local Government Education Authority(LGEA). By 1994, he had become the substantive Executive Secretary of Izzi LGEA. In 1999, Edeze was appointed the Chairman of Ohaozara Local Government Area by the former Military Administrator of Ebonyi State, Navy Commander, Walter Aye Feghabor.\n\nIn 1999-2002, Edeze was appointed Member of the Governing Council of Ebonyi State University. He was later appointed into the powerful office as Executive Chairman of Ebonyi State Universal Basic Education Board(2002-2007) by former Governor of Ebonyi State, Dr. Sam Egwu. In 2008, he returned back to the Ministry of Education as Assistant Chief Education Officer and in 2009 was appointed a Consultant in the Education Sector Support Programme of the Nigerian Federal Government, Abuja.\n\nIn 2017, Edeze was appointed Chairman of the Governing Council, Federal Polytechnic, Ado- Ekiti, a position he held for three years.\n\nIn the field of partisan politics, Edeze has held sway and garnered some variegated experiences. In 2015, Edeze was in the APC where he fought for the party\u2019s Guber ticket and lost.He was thereafter appointed as Member of the APC Board if Trustees. In 2015, he was the Ebonyi State Coordinator of the Buhari Campaign Organization. In 2018, he returned as APC Governorship aspirant. In 2019, he was once appointed as the State Coordinator of Buhari Support Organization,(,BSO). He later served as a Member of the APC National Convention Committee. He is a Fellow of the Nigerian Institute of Education Planning and Administration.\n\nEdeze was honoured with Chieftaincy titles- Nwa Eji Aga MBA 1 of Izzi, Nna Ji Oha of Izzi and Ekwueme 1 of Ohaozara.",

          "text": "A political support group \u2018Got Your Back Nigeria\u2019 said Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi state has the support of even the opposition party to run for the presidency come 2023.\n\nNational coordinator of the group, Prof Chris Mustapha Nwaokobia Jnr, stated this in a press statement on Tuesday.\n\nProf. Nwaokobia Jnr was reacting to a recent debate on Channels TV\u2019s \u2018Politics Today\u2019.\n\nHe said Segun Sowunmi, a former spokesperson of Atiku Abubakar Campaign Organisation in the 2019 presidential election and Chief Femi Fani-Kayode, both profound speakers had their turns as the anchor grilled them on the politics of 2023 and the chances of presidential aspirants seeking to emerge as candidates of the two leading political parties.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe said: \u201cThe names listed on the PDP side were Atiku Abubakar, Aminu Tambuwal, Bukola Saraki, Bala Mohammed, Peter Obi, Sam Ohuabunwa, Goodluck Jonathan and Pius Anyim. And on the APC side were names like Bola Tinubu, Prof Yemi Osinbajo, Governor Yahaya Bello, Rochas Okorocha, Rotimi Amaechi, Godswill Akpabio, Kayode Fayemi and Babatunde Fashola. And Kingsley Moghalu, Akinwunmi Adesina, Jack Rich Tein, Oby Ezekwesili, and Tunde Bakare were those mentioned outside of the two major parties.\n\nProf. Nwaokobia Jnr said the guest from the PDP, Segun Sowunmi, was seen clearly in admitting that besides his boss, Atiku Abubakar, Governor Yahaya Bello (GYB) was perhaps the most prepared to take Nigeria to the next level.\n\n\u201cHe admitted that GYB is broad minded (can carry along Nigerians of different tendencies), sagacious (creative and has the capacity to generate the ideas needed to make Nigeria work), youthful (has age and fitness), is competent, and can unite Nigerians. He practically craved and called on GYB to move over to the PDP to make real his ambition. It was an endorsement beyond Partisanship, and a testimony of the competency and the capacity of the phenomenon called GYB\n\n\u201cGYB is a pan Nigerian political and social vehicle, GYB is young, fit, active and vivacious, GYB has the ideas and is 21st century compliant, GYB is passionate about the Nigeria of our dreams, GYB is an apostle of human capital development, and GYB in so many ways have proven that the call to berth a new Nigeria is his unalterable commitment and destiny.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cFinally on the program in reference, the Guests and the Anchor of that didactic show on politics (Politics Today), were unanimous in the chances of the name that stole the show. It was Governor Yahaya Bello (GYB) everywhere throughout the duration of the show.

Aliyu Aziz, said as the custodian of the foundational identity database for Africa\u2019s most populous nation, NIMC has gone to great lengths to ensure the nation\u2019s database is adequately secured and protected especially given the spate of cyber-attacks on networks across the world.\n\n\u201cOver the years, through painstaking efforts, NIMC has built a robust and credible system for Nigeria\u2019s identity database. The Commission and its infrastructure are certified to the ISO 27001:2013 Information Security Management System Standard which are revalidated annually.\n\n\u201cNIMC has ensured maximum security of its systems and database because of the critical nature of the identity data which the Commission collects, manages and maintains as critical assets for the country,\u201d the statement said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Commission assured the public that it will continue to uphold the highest ethical standards in data security on behalf of the Federal Government and ensure compliance with data protection and privacy regulations.\n\nThe NIMC director-general added that the Commission does not use nor store information on the AWS cloud platform or any public cloud despite the usefulness of the NIMC Mobile App available to the public for accessing their national identification number (NIN) on-the-go.\n\nHe further stated that the NIMC MobileID application has no database within the App, nor does it store information in flat files, noting that the Commission has made this app available to the public to reduce and eliminate any delay or challenge(s) in accessing one\u2019s NIN.\n\nHe said that the public should be aware that the possession of a NIN slip does not amount to access to the\n\nNational Identity Database, but that the NIN slip is just a physical assertion of a person\u2019s identity.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cUnder the data protection regulations, no licensed partner/vendor is authorized to scan and store copies of individuals NIN slips but rather authenticate the NIN using the approved and authorised verification platforms/channels provided.\n\n\u201cAs part of its policies to protect personally identifiable information stored in the National Identity Database, the public may recall that the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy through NIMC launched the Tokenization features of the NIN verification service. This solution is to safeguard the personal data of individuals and ensure continuous user rights and privacy,\u201d the statement said.\n\nIn compliance with the mandatory use of NIN for government services, the Commission also hailed the concerted efforts of several Federal Government agencies such as Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board (JAMB), the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Nigeria Immigration Services, Pension Commission (PenCom), the Nigeria Police Force, the Nigeria Correctional Service, the Nigeria Customs, and a host of others, who have streamlined their services in line with the use of National Identification Number (NIN) as the valid means of identification.\n\nEngr Aziz also appealed to all stakeholders to embrace the identity, enrol and receive their NINs.

          "text": "In the last two years that Evelyn Owolabi, a teacher, has lived in Adeyefa Estate, Iyana Ipaja, she said she has never witnessed the influx of visitors that now throng her neighbourhood in recent times.\n\nShe would later discover that Mummy G. O.\u2019s Rapture Proclaimer Evangelical Church of God Church, located in the estate, is responsible for the sudden increase in strange faces.\n\n\u2018\u2018It\u2019s shocking. I don\u2019t even understand what\u2019s going on and why people are rushing here. I don\u2019t attend the church,\u2019\u2019 she told PREMIUM TIMES on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe church, the most impressive building in the estate, is sandwiched between two uncompleted buildings. Victor, an usher, said both buildings belong to the church.\n\nWhen a PREMIUM TIMES reporter visited the estate on Monday afternoon, something was different.\n\nFirst was the presence of \u2018holy\u2019 police stationed at different estate points to frisk new faces and prevent nosy strangers from gaining access into the church.\n\nThey made it extremely difficult to photograph the street and the church building itself. When our reporter attempted to pull a fast one, the holy police temporarily seized his phone and deleted the photos and videos.\n\nThankfully, he was able to secure a few on his backup.\n\nEvangelist Adebayo Funmilayo, popularly called Mummy G. O. by social media fans and critics alike, has trended for months for her unorthodox, questionable, and sometimes humorous sermons. PREMIUM TIMES featured her on the \u2018interesting\u2019 Nigerian preachers that trended in 2021.\n\n\u24d8\n\nMissing in action\n\nThis Newspaper partook in the church\u2019s Solution Monday prayers hoping to see the church\u2019s founder, but alas, she was missing in action.\n\nSince videos of her preaching went viral, the firebrand evangelist has carefully avoided the public\u2019s prying eyes by staying away from recent church activities.\n\nAlthough the reason for her absence is unknown, many believe that \u2018Mummy G.O.\u2019 fears for her safety.\n\nDuring her infamous interview with the BBC, Mummy G.O., who feigned ignorance of her viral sermons, stated that people threatened her because of her end-time preaching. She also inferred that the videos making the rounds on social media are fake.\n\nAdeyefa Estate\n\n\u201cEven Satan will not say all those things talk less of someone that calls herself a \u2018holiness preacher.\u201d\n\nAccording to the evangelist, the perpetrators of those viral videos sought after her life. She said they had started eight years ago through a magazine, but it did not result in much. Thus, they resorted to social media.\n\nThe famous preacher also stated that she received death threats and strange calls for her kind of preaching.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been receiving some strange calls at times. They said, \u2018you are driving away from people from our kingdom\u2019; at times, they use guns to threaten my life.\u201d\n\n\u24d8\n\nHer remarks perhaps explain why she has been absent from church in the last week.\n\nSolution Monday\n\nSolution Monday, as the name implies, holds every Monday morning from 9 am till \u201cwhenever the Holy Spirit releases us\u201d this was according to the preacher, Pastor Sam, who simply introduced himself as Mummy G.O.\u2019s assistant.\n\nGifts for first-time visitors to Mummy GMO\u2019s church\n\nAlthough the reporter joined the service at 10:30 am (an hour, 30 minutes late), the service had begun with an intensive praise and worship session.\n\nAfter ensuring that the congregants were \u2018properly\u2019 dressed and had no jewelry and bangles, the reporter was allowed to join the service in the company of other visitors.\n\nAfter the service, newcomers were invited to the altar while the pastor prayed for them and gave them audio recordings of previous Mummy GO\u2019s messages and gospel tracts.\n\nThe service featured an intensive sermon about the \u2018end time\u2019 and \u2018how God plans to destroy the world.\u2019\n\nPastor Sam, a dark-complexioned stern-looking man, dressed in white Senator attire, delivered the sermon in English. A Yoruba language translator stationed at the church entrance assisted him.\n\nThe pastor claimed the wrath of God would begin in any Nigerian state surrounded by water. He asked the congregation: \u201cWhat surrounds Lagos State? How far is the bar beach from Iyana Ipaja?\u201d\n\nThe congregants, who were roughly 80 in number, were mainly middle-aged.\n\nThere were a series of prayer sections in between the sermons. The prayer points were repetitive.\n\n\u201cThe Lord said I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy on; Lord have mercy on me and save my soul,\u201d the congregation would often shout and fall to the ground while praying.\n\n\u24d8\n\nCongregants praying near the altar\n\nOur reporter was undercover, but Mr Victor was still sceptical about sharing any relevant information about the church because of the undue attention lately.\n\nHe said they also had to intensify security measures.\n\n\u201cPeople on social media have given my mummy in the lord a nickname \u2018mummy G. O.\u2019 They think we are illiterate and dumb, but the truth would always remain the truth regardless,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn passing, he revealed that the church has existed for over 20 years in the exact location and that the founder\u2019s husband is not a pastor.\n\nTen things you must know before visiting Mummy G.O.\u2019s church\n\nIf, after reading this article, you are still keen on attending Rapture Proclaimer Evangelical Church of God to see things for yourself, here are ten things you must know\n\nNo chains, jewellery, bangles, or beads are allowed\n\nIf you plan to wear jewellery to Mummy G.O.\u2019s church, get ready to be stopped by the holy police at the entrance.\n\nNo jeans allowed\n\nGet your long plain skirts and trousers ready. Mummy G.O. and her holy police won\u2019t take it likely with those who wear short dresses and jeans trousers.\n\nYou must cover your hair\n\nNo coloured hair is allowed, and you must not visit Mummy G.O.\u2019s church with your hair uncovered.\n\nGet your giant bibles ready\n\nThey gave our reporter a brand new Bible. You must not come to Mummy G.O.\u2019s church without a bible. According to the preacher, you must hold the bible firmly.\n\nNo phones allowed\n\nThe holy police would ensure that all phones are switched off from the gate when asked why they explained that phones are distractions to the angels of God.\n\nMake-up Is prohibited\n\nIf you visit Mummy G.O.\u2019s church, ensure that you do not wear make-up. During the Solution Monday sermon, the preacher asked the congregation: \u201d I don\u2019t think God is making mistakes by making us the way we are. So why are we adding things to our face?\u201d\n\nGet ready to shake your head while you pray\n\nIf you do not want to look odd or out of place, be prepared to shake your head and clap your hands while you pray. The bell on the altar regulates the prayers.\n\nBlessings of pure water sachet\n\nAfter every sermon, pure water sachets are blessed and shared, but you cannot eat on the church premises.\n\nDo not breastfeed your child in the church\n\nBoldly written at the church entrance is a warning that nobody should breastfeed a child. Otherwise, mummy G.O. and her police would come for you.\n\nNewcomers should get ready to collect tracts\n\nMummy G.O. would be delighted to see you, as, her holy police, having ensured that you meet the requirements to be allowed into the church, would warmly welcome you with newcomers\u2019 forms, gospel tracts, and the audio recording as souvenirs.

          "text": "In the last two years that Evelyn Owolabi, a teacher, has lived in Adeyefa Estate, Iyana Ipaja, she said she has never witnessed the influx of visitors that now throng her neighbourhood in recent times.\n\nShe would later discover that Mummy G. O.\u2019s Rapture Proclaimer Evangelical Church of God Church, located in the estate, is responsible for the sudden increase in strange faces.\n\n\u2018\u2018It\u2019s shocking. I don\u2019t even understand what\u2019s going on and why people are rushing here. I don\u2019t attend the church,\u2019\u2019 she told PREMIUM TIMES on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe church, the most impressive building in the estate, is sandwiched between two uncompleted buildings. Victor, an usher, said both buildings belong to the church.\n\nWhen a PREMIUM TIMES reporter visited the estate on Monday afternoon, something was different.\n\nFirst was the presence of \u2018holy\u2019 police stationed at different estate points to frisk new faces and prevent nosy strangers from gaining access into the church.\n\nThey made it extremely difficult to photograph the street and the church building itself. When our reporter attempted to pull a fast one, the holy police temporarily seized his phone and deleted the photos and videos.\n\nThankfully, he was able to secure a few on his backup.\n\nEvangelist Adebayo Funmilayo, popularly called Mummy G. O. by social media fans and critics alike, has trended for months for her unorthodox, questionable, and sometimes humorous sermons. PREMIUM TIMES featured her on the \u2018interesting\u2019 Nigerian preachers that trended in 2021.\n\n\u24d8\n\nMissing in action\n\nThis Newspaper partook in the church\u2019s Solution Monday prayers hoping to see the church\u2019s founder, but alas, she was missing in action.\n\nSince videos of her preaching went viral, the firebrand evangelist has carefully avoided the public\u2019s prying eyes by staying away from recent church activities.\n\nAlthough the reason for her absence is unknown, many believe that \u2018Mummy G.O.\u2019 fears for her safety.\n\nDuring her infamous interview with the BBC, Mummy G.O., who feigned ignorance of her viral sermons, stated that people threatened her because of her end-time preaching. She also inferred that the videos making the rounds on social media are fake.\n\nAdeyefa Estate\n\n\u201cEven Satan will not say all those things talk less of someone that calls herself a \u2018holiness preacher.\u201d\n\nAccording to the evangelist, the perpetrators of those viral videos sought after her life. She said they had started eight years ago through a magazine, but it did not result in much. Thus, they resorted to social media.\n\nThe famous preacher also stated that she received death threats and strange calls for her kind of preaching.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been receiving some strange calls at times. They said, \u2018you are driving away from people from our kingdom\u2019; at times, they use guns to threaten my life.\u201d\n\n\u24d8\n\nHer remarks perhaps explain why she has been absent from church in the last week.\n\nSolution Monday\n\nSolution Monday, as the name implies, holds every Monday morning from 9 am till \u201cwhenever the Holy Spirit releases us\u201d this was according to the preacher, Pastor Sam, who simply introduced himself as Mummy G.O.\u2019s assistant.\n\nGifts for first-time visitors to Mummy GMO\u2019s church\n\nAlthough the reporter joined the service at 10:30 am (an hour, 30 minutes late), the service had begun with an intensive praise and worship session.\n\nAfter ensuring that the congregants were \u2018properly\u2019 dressed and had no jewelry and bangles, the reporter was allowed to join the service in the company of other visitors.\n\nAfter the service, newcomers were invited to the altar while the pastor prayed for them and gave them audio recordings of previous Mummy GO\u2019s messages and gospel tracts.\n\nThe service featured an intensive sermon about the \u2018end time\u2019 and \u2018how God plans to destroy the world.\u2019\n\nPastor Sam, a dark-complexioned stern-looking man, dressed in white Senator attire, delivered the sermon in English. A Yoruba language translator stationed at the church entrance assisted him.\n\nThe pastor claimed the wrath of God would begin in any Nigerian state surrounded by water. He asked the congregation: \u201cWhat surrounds Lagos State? How far is the bar beach from Iyana Ipaja?\u201d\n\nThe congregants, who were roughly 80 in number, were mainly middle-aged.\n\nThere were a series of prayer sections in between the sermons. The prayer points were repetitive.\n\n\u201cThe Lord said I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy on; Lord have mercy on me and save my soul,\u201d the congregation would often shout and fall to the ground while praying.\n\n\u24d8\n\nCongregants praying near the altar\n\nOur reporter was undercover, but Mr Victor was still sceptical about sharing any relevant information about the church because of the undue attention lately.\n\nHe said they also had to intensify security measures.\n\n\u201cPeople on social media have given my mummy in the lord a nickname \u2018mummy G. O.\u2019 They think we are illiterate and dumb, but the truth would always remain the truth regardless,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn passing, he revealed that the church has existed for over 20 years in the exact location and that the founder\u2019s husband is not a pastor.\n\nTen things you must know before visiting Mummy G.O.\u2019s church\n\nIf, after reading this article, you are still keen on attending Rapture Proclaimer Evangelical Church of God to see things for yourself, here are ten things you must know\n\nNo chains, jewellery, bangles, or beads are allowed\n\nIf you plan to wear jewellery to Mummy G.O.\u2019s church, get ready to be stopped by the holy police at the entrance.\n\nNo jeans allowed\n\nGet your long plain skirts and trousers ready. Mummy G.O. and her holy police won\u2019t take it likely with those who wear short dresses and jeans trousers.\n\nYou must cover your hair\n\nNo coloured hair is allowed, and you must not visit Mummy G.O.\u2019s church with your hair uncovered.\n\nGet your giant bibles ready\n\nThey gave our reporter a brand new Bible. You must not come to Mummy G.O.\u2019s church without a bible. According to the preacher, you must hold the bible firmly.\n\nNo phones allowed\n\nThe holy police would ensure that all phones are switched off from the gate when asked why they explained that phones are distractions to the angels of God.\n\nMake-up Is prohibited\n\nIf you visit Mummy G.O.\u2019s church, ensure that you do not wear make-up. During the Solution Monday sermon, the preacher asked the congregation: \u201d I don\u2019t think God is making mistakes by making us the way we are. So why are we adding things to our face?\u201d\n\nGet ready to shake your head while you pray\n\nIf you do not want to look odd or out of place, be prepared to shake your head and clap your hands while you pray. The bell on the altar regulates the prayers.\n\nBlessings of pure water sachet\n\nAfter every sermon, pure water sachets are blessed and shared, but you cannot eat on the church premises.\n\nDo not breastfeed your child in the church\n\nBoldly written at the church entrance is a warning that nobody should breastfeed a child. Otherwise, mummy G.O. and her police would come for you.\n\nNewcomers should get ready to collect tracts\n\nMummy G.O. would be delighted to see you, as, her holy police, having ensured that you meet the requirements to be allowed into the church, would warmly welcome you with newcomers\u2019 forms, gospel tracts, and the audio recording as souvenirs.

Rather, other people will tend to capitalise on the few bad eggs and characterise us in their own narratives, narratives that seek to characterise us in bad light. We must not allow that to happen.\n\n\u2018\u2018As we launch the compendium of excellent Nigerians today, we are also celebrating some of our best, nationally and globally.\n\n\u2018\u2018I call on every Nigerian, irrespective of where they may be, to continue to be of exemplary behaviour and with determination to offer quality services that contribute to the progress of humanity.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhile congratulating those whose names made it to this first edition, President Buhari encouraged others to work more conscientiously to make the list in the subsequent editions.\n\nRecounting his engagements with Nigerians in the Diaspora during his official travels abroad, the President said his Diaspora threefold agenda remains unchanged.\n\n\u2018\u2018Nigerians in the Diaspora are our Ambassadors-at-large by their character, comportment and daily actions.\n\n\u2018\u2018They should be the best and excel in all their endeavours and they should \u2018give back\u2019 by contributing to the development of Nigeria.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President commended the Diaspora Commission led by Hon.

          "title": "2023 Presidency: Like Tinubu, Umahi meets Buhari, opens up on ambition",
          "text": "Ebonyi state Governor Dave Umahi has formally informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his 2023 presidential ambition on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThis is coming barely 24 hours after a chieftain of the party and APC national leader, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu similarly told the president of his ambition to contest for the party\u2019s presidential ticket.\n\nTinubu had while speaking to journalists after a closed-door meeting with Buhari in Abuja, Monday, said it\u2019s been his age-long ambition to lead the country one day.\n\n\u201cI have informed the President of my ambition but I have not informed Nigerians yet, I am still consulting. And I have no problem consulting. And I\u2019ve not set a parameter of limitation to the extent of how many people I will consult. You will soon hear. All you want to hear is the categorical declaration,\u201d the former governor had said.\n\nUmahi follows\n\nFielding questions from State House correspondents after a meeting with Buhari in his office in Abuja, Tuesday, the governor said the president advised him to consult widely.\n\nThe governor said he was not perturbed by Tinubu\u2019s entry into the race, pointing out that the contest is not about might.\n\nUmahi said if he gets the opportunity, his presidency would replicate the current effort in Ebonyi state at the national level, stressing that he has a lot to show in running governance as business.\n\n\u201cI told Mr. President that without prejudice to whatever will be the decision of the party, which we shall abide by, that if the party throws the ticket open or zoned to southern part of Nigeria that I believe that with what I have put in place in the past six years plus, that I\u2019ll be running for presidency on the platform of APC.\n\n\u201cSo, I told him and, of course, he believes that whoever wants to run for president of this country must have to consult widely, go to all the leaders and that we must do everything to remove ethnicity and religion in our politics so that this country can grow,\u201d he said.\n\nOn APC convention\n\nOn the forthcoming national convention of the party, the governor said: \u201cI\u2019m not Mr. President who must have the final say on the date for convention. And I don\u2019t believe that the governor you mentioned should have spoken for the party because if it is APC governors\u2019 forum, we have a leader, the chairman who is His Excellency, the governor of Kebbi state.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t even aware of the meeting when I called him. And if it is the party administration, we have His Excellency, the governor of Yobe state. And I think these two would have been able to speak to the press, if we\u2019re going to have such a meeting on Sunday. So I was not aware but I had to inquire from the chairman of APC Governors Forum who wasn\u2019t also aware. So I\u2019m not sure the meeting held.\n\n\u201cBut I read on a newspaper sometimes when the party leadership came to brief Mr. President, and they told him February convention. Mr. President said yes. He is not a man that says yes and says no, at the same time, he is a man of integrity, he is a man of his words. So I believe that if he ever said February that is going to stick to that February. I am very sure of that. But it is for him to speak or for the party leadership to speak. I speak for my state.\u201d\n\nOn Ohanaeze Ndigbo\n\nCommenting on the Ohanaeze Ndigbo and their expected roles ahead of the 2023 polls, the governor said: \u201cOhanaeze leadership should not play politics. Yes, they can speak for the interest of the South-East, they can speak for fair treatment to South-East as people and as a matter of equity, justice and fairness, and leaving a level playing field for all the political parties and the aspirants.\n\n\u201cThey should not dabble into politics or whom to support or whom not to support. I think that they hear it just like they heard other the political parties\u2019 aspirants. We will also write them to notify them that yes, they have capable sons and daughters that if God wills, that could do this job.\u201d\n\nKalu also\u2026\n\nIn a related development, a former Governor of Abia state and Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, Tuesday declared that he would contest for the APC presidential ticket if the party zones the position to the south.\n\n\u201cI have all it takes to throw my hat into the ring and contest with anybody from the southern axis of the country if our party zones its presidential ticket to the area.\n\n\u201cTinubu like any other qualified Nigerian is eligible to run for the nation\u2019s number one position but those of us from the South East feel the zone should be considered in terms of zoning.\n\n\u201cIf however its left open, I will square it up with Tinubu and any other contender grit for grit,\u201d he said.\n\nTinubu had last November visited Kalu in his villa mansion where he intimated the federal lawmaker about his presidential ambition.\n\nPro-Osinbajo group\n\nMeanwhile, a group, Progressive Opinion Leaders under the auspices of the Progressive Project Osinbajo 2023, Tuesday, disclosed that the declaration of Asiwaju Tinubu to run for the 2023 presidency did not concern its members.\n\nRather, the group, led by Shettima Umar Abba Gana, called on Vice President Professor Yemi Osinbajo to run for the 2023 presidency, describing him as an able lieutenant that would deliver if given the mandate.\n\nThe group stated this during a courtesy visit to the corporate headquarters of Blueprint in Abuja.\n\nAbba Gana said the group was rooting for the Osinbajo presidency even though the vice president was yet to make his intention known.\n\nHe said: \u201c\u2026The issue (declaration) of one of the leaders of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has been in the news since yesterday that he declared. We in this group are not concerned simply because like I had said earlier, democracy requires multi-parties, multiple candidates. That is what democracy is.\n\n\u201cWe have a candidate that we are selling, others should also come out. It is not only Tinubu, we are encouraging others who think they have something to offer to also come out, then we will go to the public and display everybody\u2019s character and gradually the truth will prevail.\n\n\u201cDemocracy requires active engagement of a lot of people and the exposure to test each of the candidates to the level to know this is the best. We have confidence in us that we have the best candidate with us and that is why we are committed to this project.\n\n\u201cWe are not properly concerned because we know their antecedents, we know who the persons are, we know them.

          "text": "Russia and China have blocked the United Nations Security Council from supporting a decision by the West African economic bloc ECOWAS to impose new sanctions on Mali, after its military leaders proposed staying in power for up to five years before staging elections.\n\nA French-drafted council statement endorsing the sanctions failed to be approved in closed-door consultations on Tuesday, prompting three African council members \u2013 Kenya, Ghana and Gabon \u2013 to speak to reporters to back the regional bloc\u2019s position.\n\nKenya\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Martin Kimani, said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that the council could not agree on what he called a \u201crelatively mild\u201d press statement and expressed support for the \u201cimposition of sanctions on the military authorities in Mali to ensure an expedited transition to constitutional rule\u201d.\n\nOn Sunday, leaders from the Economic Community of West African States suspended most commerce and financial aid to Mali, closed land and air borders \u201cwith the states concerned\u201d and activated the bloc\u2019s standby force, saying it \u201cwill have to be ready for any eventuality\u201d.\n\nThe move came after last month, Mali\u2019s interim government proposed staying in power for up to five years before staging elections, despite international demands that it respect a promise to hold elections on February 27 this year.\n\nFrance, Mali\u2019s former colonial power which also holds the European Union\u2019s rotating presidency, and the United States, have underlined their support for the ECOWAS sanctions.\n\n\u201cWe are in complete solidarity with the region and with this very courageous and clear stance\u201d by ECOWAS, French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nWashington also supported the \u201cstrong actions\u201d by the 15-member bloc and urged the Mali regime to honour its pledge to return to democracy.\n\n\u201cA five-year transition is not in their interest and extends the pain of the people,\u201d US ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told a Security Council meeting.\n\nThe presidency of Algeria, which shares a long border with Mali, also called on the military to negotiate with ECOWAS and \u201creach a plan to end the crisis, taking into account international demands and the legitimate demands of the Malian people\u201d.\n\nChinese ambassador Dai Bing noted that Mali is in the middle of a critical transition period and said outside forces must refrain from exerting excess pressure on the West African country.\n\nTaking note of recent measures by ECOWAS, as well as the response of the transitional authorities, he encouraged both sides to strengthen dialogue and resolve regional issues.\n\nRussia rejected the proposed council statement as unbalanced and expressed sympathy to the government.\n\n\u201cWe understand and are cognisant of the difficulties encountered by the Malian authorities in preparing for general elections,\u201d Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said.\n\n\u201cWe concur with the fact that absent restoration of government control in many parts, regions of the country, it will be difficult to view the vote as legitimate.\u201d\n\nFrench ambassador Nicolas de Riviere reiterated his country\u2019s condemnation of the deployment of mercenaries from Russia\u2019s Wagner Group, who he said \u201care known to threaten civilians, loot resources, violate international law and the sovereignty of states\u201d.\n\nHe expressed regret that Mali\u2019s transitional authorities \u201care using already limited public funds to pay foreign mercenaries instead of supporting the national forces and public services for the benefit of the Malian people\u201d.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has denied that the Russian government is involved and said the company has a \u201clegitimate\u201d right to be in the West African nation because it was invited by the transitional government.\n\nMali\u2019s UN ambassador Issa Konfourou told the Security Council there are no mercenaries on Malian soil. He said Russian trainers are in Mali to advise and train its military on the use of military equipment acquired by the government from Russia.\n\nKonfourou said his government was \u201cshocked\u201d by ECOWAS\u2019s economic and financial sanctions and \u201cemphatically condemned these illegal and illegitimate\u201d measures.\n\nIn an address to the nation on Monday, military leader Colonel Assimi Goita called the sanctions \u201cinhumane\u201d while also stating that Mali remains open to dialogue.\n\nGoita led a coup in August 2020 that toppled President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita.\n\nUnder threat of sanctions following the coup, he had promised to hold presidential and legislative elections, and to restore civilian rule by February 2022.\n\nBut he staged a de facto second coup in May 2021, forcing out an interim civilian government and disrupting the timetable to restore democracy.\n\nGoita declared himself interim president and in December his government proposed staying in power for up to an additional five years.",
