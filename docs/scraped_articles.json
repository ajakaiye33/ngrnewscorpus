          "text": "Source: BBC\n\nA deal aimed at staving off dangerous climate change has been struck at the COP26 summit in Glasgow.\n\nThe Glasgow Climate Pact is the first ever climate deal to explicitly plan to reduce coal, the worst fossil fuel for greenhouse gases.\n\nThe deal also presses for more urgent emission cuts and promises more money for developing countries \u2013 to help them adapt to climate impacts.\n\nBut the pledges don\u2019t go far enough to limit temperature rise to 1.5C.\n\nA commitment to phase out coal that was included in earlier negotiation drafts led to a dramatic finish after India led opposition to it.\n\nIndia\u2019s climate minister Bhupender Yadav asked how developing countries could promise to phase out coal and fossil fuel subsidies when they \u201chave still to deal with their development agendas and poverty eradication\u201d.\n\nIn the end countries agreed to \u201cphase down\u201d rather than \u201cphase out\u201d coal, amid expressions of disappointment by some. COP26 President Alok Sharma said he was \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for how events had unfolded.\n\nHe fought back tears as he told delegates that it was vital to protect the agreement as a whole.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he hoped the world would \u201clook back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change\u201d, promising to \u201ccontinue to work tirelessly towards that goal\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere is still a huge amount more to do in the coming years. But today\u2019s agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said: \u201cOur fragile planet is hanging by a thread. We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe.\n\n\u201cIt is time to go into emergency mode \u2013 or our chance of reaching net zero will itself be zero.\u201d\n\nAs part of the agreement, countries have pledged to meet next year to pledge further major carbon cuts so that the goal of 1.5C can be reached. Current pledges, if fulfilled, are only though to limit global warming to 2.4C.\n\nIf global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, scientists say the Earth is likely to experience severe effects such as millions more people being exposed to extreme heat.\n\nMain achievements of the deal:\n\nRe-visiting emissions-cutting plans next year to try to keep 1.5C target reachable\n\nThe first ever inclusion of a commitment to limit coal use\n\nIncreased financial help for developing countries\n\nSwiss environment minister Simonetta Sommaruga said: \u201cWe would like to express our profound disappointment that the language we agreed on, on coal and fossil fuels subsidies has been further watered down as a result of an untransparent process.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThis will not bring us closer to 1.5C, but make it more difficult to reach it.\u201d\n\nDespite the weakening of language around coal, some observers will still see the final deal as a victory, underlining that it is the first time coal is explicitly mentioned in UN documents of this type.\n\nCoal is responsible for about 40% of CO2 emissions each year, making it central in efforts to keep within the 1.5C target. To meet this goal, agreed in Paris in 2015, global emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and to nearly zero by mid-century.\n\nActivists\n\n\u201cThey changed a word but they can\u2019t change the signal coming out of this COP, that the era of coal is ending,\u201d said Greenpeace international executive director Jennifer Morgan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the interests of all countries, including those who still burn coal, to transition to clean renewable energy.\u201d\n\nHowever Lars Koch, a policy director for charity ActionAid, said it was disappointing that only coal was mentioned.\n\n\u201cThis gives a free pass to the rich countries who have been extracting and polluting for over a century to continue producing oil and gas,\u201d he said.\n\nSara Shaw, from Friends of the Earth International, said the outcome was \u201cnothing less than a scandal\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cJust saying the words 1.5 degrees is meaningless if there is nothing in the agreement to deliver it. COP26 will be remembered as a betrayal of global South countries.\u201d\n\nDeveloping countries\n\nFinance was a contentious issue during the conference. A pledge by developed nations to provide $100bn per year to emerging economies, made in 2009, was supposed to have been delivered by 2020. However, the date was missed.\n\nIt\u2019s designed to help developing nations adapt to climate effects and make the transition to clean energy. In an effort to mollify delegates, Mr Sharma said around $500bn would be mobilised by 2025.\n\nBut poorer countries had been calling throughout the meeting for funding through the principle of loss and damage \u2013 the idea that richer countries should compensate poorer ones for climate change effects they can\u2019t adapt to.\n\nThis was one of the big disappointments of the conference for many delegations.\n\nThough several of those countries that stood to benefit backed the agreement on the basis that talks on loss and damage would continue.

It further calls on the Federal Government to do all it can to release the abducted innocent people in captivity unconditionally without further loss of lives.\n\n\u201cOn the need for prompt action by security agencies, CAN also wish to advise the Federal, States and Local Government Areas to immediately initiate an all-inclusive security dialogue with all stakeholders. This will help towards finding a lasting solution to the security challenges.\u201d\n\nThe communique which was signed by CAN\u2019s General Secretary, Joseph Daramola, said other issues affecting the body of Christ deliberated upon by the Council include the economy, the 2023 election, and the alleged extortion of Nigerians returning to the country from abroad by the government officials.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nIt added, \u201cCAN acknowledges the resilience of Nigerians in view of the prevailing economic hardships and insecurities in the country and advises the Federal Government to not worsen the situation with increasing electricity tariffs, prices of cooking gas, and merely allocating funds for maintenance of roads without corresponding visible impacts.\n\n\u201cAs the nation prepares for the electioneering campaigns towards the 2023 General Elections, CAN urges all Christians and citizens that are of age to without delay take advantage of INEC\u2019s revalidation of voters\u2019 cards exercise and register to get their voters\u2019 cards.\n\n\u201cPoliticians should conduct themselves in a manner that will bring peace and unity. Youths should not allow any selfish office-seeker to use them to cause violence before, during and after the politicking exercise.\n\n\u201cCAN advises the Federal Government to put in place a better administration of the QR Barcode reader payment required for returning to Nigeria from overseas. A situation where Nigerians are subjected to intimidation abroad because of the negligence of the duty of the officials is very embarrassing.\n\n\u201cAlso, the ugly practice by some Government officials extorting money from citizens coming back home without remitting same to government coffers must be checked.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

The perpetrators are mostly male.\n\n\u201cIn September, a number of sexual harassment cases reported stands at 18 while in October, 8 cases were reported with 56% decline. Furthermore, Sexual Harassment still remains the case with the highest number of perpetrations.\n\n\u201cFor sexual abuse, we had 14 cases in September and 4 cases in October with 71% decline. Other cases like wife battering and social media GBV have no reported cases in October.\n\n\u201cAlthough there is a visible decline in reported cases of all forms of GBV, we still observe perpetration of GBV within the state. This shows that there is still a need for actions to be taken in terms of Gender-Based Violence in the state in order to eliminate/curb GBV.\n\n\u201cGender-Based violence is a harmful act being inflicted at individuals based on their gender. GBV is a serious violation of human rights and a life-threatening health and protection issue.\n\n\u201cAs part of its continuing effort to curb GBV in the society and to promote the wellbeing of women and girl child, including creating a safe and secure educational environment, the Centre for Information Technology and Development (CITAD) with support from Ford Foundation has been implementing a project titled \u201cStrengthening Citizens Response and Protection Against Gender-Based Violence in Kano, Nigeria\u201d whose aim is to achieve a safe society for women and girls, free from gender violence and discrimination to bridge the gender gap in girl child education, allowing for the attainment of gender parity in educational accomplishments.\n\n\u201cWe recommend that the Kano State Government and House of Assembly domesticate the Child Rights Act and VAPP Act at the state level because if implemented, will contribute in curbing this (GBV) menace.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, religious and traditional leaders both at state and local levels should continuously intensify efforts in creating awareness and to work with different authorities in curtailing the menace of GBV in the state. We also call on Institutions of higher learning in the state to all develop and implement gender policy and create appropriate mechanisms for victims and others to report such incidences to the authorities.\n\n\u201cEqually, the state government should not only adopt laws to protect women and girls, but also establish Referral Centers and Forensic Centers for victims.\n\n\u201cWe also urged the Media houses to continue to use their platforms in creating awareness against GBV and be reporting punishments done to perpetrators of GBV instead of focusing on the victims of GBV cases,\u201d Aminu however stated.",

We must always affirm our fates in our armed forces, while the armed forces must remain up and doing. We must always recognize what we already know, that insurgents are always plotting with the elements of surprise.

Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Works and Infrastructure, Mrs Aramide Adeyoye, on Saturday called on engineers to flush out quacks in the construction industry.\n\nAdeyoye said that quacks caused building collapse.\n\nShe was the guest of honour at the maiden Hamed Lawal Distinguished Public Lecture organised by the Lagos Chapter of the Nigerian Institution of Civil Engineers (NICE) in Ogba, Lagos State.\n\nThe lecture was entitled \u201cNational Local Content Policies in the Construction Industry \u2013 Strategies for Optimal Deployment for Engineering Professionals\u201d.\n\nAdeyoye said that the collapse of a 21-storey in Ikoyi, Lagos, recently, called for soul-searching on the part of professionals, who had left a vacuum for quackry to thrive in the construction sector.\n\nShe advised engineers to take up roles to become licenced construction inspectors.\n\nAdeyoye, a Fellow of NICE and the Nigerian Society of Engineers, shared experiences on how she unbundled the ministry for efficiency.\n\nShe gave insights on how local engineers could benefit from the National Local Content Policies.\n\n\u201cThe building collapse (Ikoyi) portends a very good opportunity for us to go back again to the basics. Where did we go wrong?\u201d she asked.\n\nShe called for decisive actions and implementation of recommendations from the lecture and previous seminars to correct anomalies in the construction sector.\n\n\u201cThe elders in the profession must sit down, even the builders. It is time for the building professionals to know what the local content policy says.\n\n\u201cIt starts with, do we even have a building code? If we do not have a building code, what are the timelines that we give ourselves to get these passed?\n\n\u201cThe moment we say that one, who are the professionals for different levels of developments? Who and who can practise?\n\n\u201cWe must never give our food to dogs.If we have done that, it is never too late to take it from them and then decide that we will do things professionally,\u201d Adeyoye said.\n\nThe guest speaker, Mr Robbie Owivry, advised local engineers to upgrade their skills and grow capacities to qualify for opportunities created by the Local Content Policies.\n\nOwivry said that the Executive Order 5 signed in February 2018 by President Muhammadu Buhari created an enabling environment for local engineers and local suppliers to thrive in bidding for projects in the construction industry.\n\n\u201cThe National Content Policies enhance economic growth, physical infrastructure development, avenues for improvement of education and talent of local workforce, and creation of a better community for all involved on one hand, and to serve as gateways for the Nigerian engineering professional to take prominence in the construction industry, on the other hand,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Tunde Olatunji who represented NICE National Chairman, Dr Jang Tanko, narrated impacts made by Mr Hamed Lawal in engineering, saying that he deserved honour by the association.\n\n\u201cThe honour is long overdue,\u201d he said.\n\nResponding, Lawal, the first NICE National Chairman and Fellow of the Nigerian Society of Engineers, shared experience and knowledge he gained abroad.\n\nHe called for local and foreign expertise to coexist for sharing technology and skills for quality assurance in the construction sector.\n\nThe Chairman of NICE, Lagos State Chapter, Mr Olawale Bolarinwa, in his opening speech, had said that the theme of the lecture was chosen for experts to give directions in moving Nigeria to the next positive level.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Lawal was honoured for birthing NICE and growing it.

Gen. Collins R.U Ihekire.\n\nIt called on the government of Imo State to begin a healing process by halting the trend and reaching out to families of the victims.\n\nThe group, while appreciating that the status of a state capital comes at a cost, noted with dismay that there seems to be a deliberate policy to render Owerri people homeless by the wanton grabbing of lands by successive administrations since 1976, which reached a crescendo between 2011 and 2019 and has also reared its ugly head in Uzodinma\u2019s administration.\n\nIt said,\u201dMost worrisome is the fact that most lands taken from Owerri people under the abuse of the Land Use Act for overriding public interest are later converted to private use.\u201d\n\nIt said till date, nothing concrete has been done to rebuild the Ekeukwu Owerri ancestral market or compensate those who lost their loved ones and goods worth billions of naira to the illegal demolition of the market.\n\nThe summit appreciated the people of Orlu and Okigwe zones for \u201charkening to our cry by massively electing an Owerri son as Governor of the state in 2019 but notes that the unfortunate Supreme Court judgment of 14th January has worsened the situation on the political equation in the state\u201d.\n\nIt commended Hon. Emeka Ihedioha for making Owerri\u2019s zone and indeed, Imo people proud during his seven months stay in office by addressing the myriads of administrative and infrastructural challenges head on, assuring him that history will not forget him.",

I had everything needed to be rotten. I was a sportsman, I was a cameraman, I also had one or two things.\n\n\u201cI ended up having so many girlfriends I couldn\u2019t remember the number.

I was transferred to the University of Ilorin and after some time her own husband was transferred to Ilorin, they had given birth to a child that was born lame.\n\n\u201cSo when they arrived in Ilorin, I was lecturing in Ilorin and I was also pastoring our small church in Ilorin. Someone told her that there is a pastor that God is performing miracles through him, take this child to him.\n\n\u201cIf he prays for this child the child will walk. She came to the Mission house and she asked for the pastor and they brought her to my office, she opened the door and we greeted and she said \u201cI want to see the Pastor\u201d, I said \u201cYes! Can I help you?\u201d she said \u201cYes! I want to see the Pastor\u201d. I said I am the pastor and she said \u201cYou are the pastor?\u201d I said yes! She said, \u201cyou will pray and God will answer?\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe prayed a simple prayer and the child walked. If any man is in Christ, he is a new creature.

          "text": "Political magic has become a staple diet of governance in postcolonial Africa. Why tell a simple lie when a more complicated lie will suffice? Why remonstrate with the truth when you know that dispelling and dispersing it with a canister of lies is a more effective and direct solution?\n\nWhen a whole Minister of Information, a man who is not always known for fidelity to the truth or loyalty to inconvenient facts, begins to moan and mutter about being bullied by the press, you begin to wonder whether the Oro-born master of dissimulation has taken the biggest flight of fancy from orotund reality. To be tormented by self-created fantasies is worse than being tormented by harsh facts.\n\nStill, we need to be very careful about this business of Diezani\u2019s bra. A woman\u2019s bra often contains explosives carefully tucked away. African big men do not joke with their women or their bra for that matter. In 1975, the then Major Mathieu Kerekou murdered his deputy, a certain Captain Michel Aikpe , on the grounds that he was found frolicking with the First Lady. As Gbolabo Ogunsanwo was to put it in his celebrated column with unaccustomed indelicacy, the late Beninois captain rode to his death on the buttocks of Madame Kerekou.\n\nMobutu was even known to be more cruel and callous, often forcibly acquiring as concubines the wives of the men he had killed in a ghastly ritual of total subjugation. After butchering one of his wives on the grounds of infidelity, Idi Amin Dada opened the door for her children to view the grisly remains of their mother.\n\nBut it is not an entirely African phenomenon. In revolutionary Russia after Stalin beheld the wife of Nikolai Bukharin\u2014 his Politburo rival and intellectual superior\u2014 in all her rapturous beauty and chic sophistication, the cruel and wily Georgian cooed: \u201cComrade Nikolai, even here you managed to out-general me!!\u201d It was the death sentence of one of the most gifted men thrown up by the Russian revolution.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAfter the collection of bra purportedly belonging to Diezani was unveiled by the federal authorities in all their sassy obscenities, Okon roused himself to vigorous action.\n\n\u201cOga, I wan quickly reach Abuja make man bid for dem Diezani bra. Dem say if man dey smell dem, money go come out yafunyafun. As I no get money like dem Yoruba boys who dey whack am, na good chance be dis one\u201d, the mad boy snorted.\n\n\u201cJust shut up. Is it a fool like you they want there?\u201d snooper screamed at the mad boy.\n\n\u201cOga no be like dat. Dis kontri no be for Yoruba people alone\u201d, the mad boy retorted. It was at this point that Baba Lekki cut in.\n\n\u201cOkon, I smell a rat \u201c, the old contrarian scoffed.\n\n\u201cBaba which kin rat be dat one? Na Yoruba women dey carry rat inside dem bra\u201d, the crazy boy snorted.\n\n\u201cThe bra na from Victoria Secret\u201d, the old man crowed.\n\n\u201cBaba na lie be dat one. Victoria no get secret.

          "title": "Fresh call for restructuring: Northern elders carpet Afenifere leader",
          "text": "By Vincent Kalu, Lagos, Noah Ebije, Kaduna and Sola Ojo, Kaduna\n\nSome Northern leaders have criticized Chief Ayo Adebanjo, leader of Afenifere, over his recent press statement calling for the restructuring of the country. The leaders who include Anthony Sani, immediate past Secretary General of Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Yerima Shettima, President, Arewa Youth Consultative Forum and Prof. Usman Yusuf, former Chief Executive of National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), accused the nonagenarian of political mischief, noting that his statement was capable of promoting ethno-religious crisis in the country.\n\nChief Adebanjo had, in a press statement, entitled, \u201cLet it be heard loud and clear\u201d, stressed that, \u201cAfenifere shall be leading the Yoruba nation to demand substantial restructuring, before any fraudulent elections might be held in 2023. The response of the Buharist regime to these equitable demands restructuring the country along federalist lines, in order to restore it to its roots and original agreements, shall go a long way in shaping the position of the Yoruba people in the future.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nIt further noted: \u201cLet it be heard loud and clear: Nigeria is not only negotiable, it is evidently dying. Gen. Yakubu Gowon (rtd) fought to keep Nigeria one. Is it for the Fulani to dominate other ethnic nationalities? Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo (rtd), said that Nigerian unity is non-negotiable. Is it for the Yorubas to be under Fulani domination?\n\n\u201d\n\nThe statement further appealed to the sense of justice of some eminent Nigerians: \u201cYour Eminence, Alhaji Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar, Sultan of Sokoto; Gen. Abdusulami Abubakar (rtd); Bishop Kukah, can we have peace without equity and justice?\u201d\n\nSetup your own platform that allows you to earn a minimum of \u20a6100,000 daily, payments are in US dollars, 100% legitimate .Click here to start now .\n\nIn his reaction Sani advised Adebanjo to be civil when commenting on national issues, adding that democracy was not an avenue to call for war. \u201cChief Ayo Adebanjo has the right to air his views on issues of national importance and use multiparty democracy to pursue his passion,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocracy is a contest of ideas and reasons and not a bull fight in a sumo ring. As someone who professes jaunty face of democratic values, the Chief knows how to use multiparty democracy to further his desires. But in doing so, he must note that in democracy, majority has its say and way while minority has only its say. That is why the whites in Oronia in South Africa have their say but not their way.\u201d\n\nHe called on Adebanjo not only to return to his progressive politics of yesteryears, as elder statesman, but to also support his arguments and statements with facts. He said: \u201cAs a scion of Chief Awolowo who pursued progressive politics that has no place for circumstance of birth but content of character in the order of things, Chief Ayo Adebanjo would help the country more by not promoting cleavages of the nation of over 250 ethnic groups along ethnic and religious lines.\n\n\u201cMore distressing is when he does not use fact-checks in support of his allegation of Fulanization. Most Nigerians would therefore be more confident of Chief Ayo Adebanjo\u2019s submission as an elder statesman if he is able to let the nation know the distribution of access of national resources, namely appointment, projects and major contracts by ethnicity. This is because by his obsession with allegation of Fulanization does not make the situation so.\u201d\n\nShettima who confessed to having tremendous respect for the elder statesman, \u201cexcept for this approach\u201d, cautioned him to tread carefully on the issue of restructuring, adding that it was not something that affects only Afenifere or South-West, but the entire county. He noted: \u201cIt is not about Afenifere. It is not about the South-West. We don\u2019t need to shoot our feet before we get to the battle. Often this is where our leaders or political leaders do get it wrong. Nobody or a group of a few people can make a highland. It has to be seen as an inclusive project in Nigeria because everybody is a victim of this very system. Even in the South-West, Afenifere cannot be said to be speaking for all and this is the reality of things. When you begin to talk as if you are talking on behalf of the whole country then, it has a lot of suspicions.\u201d\n\nHe asked: \u201cIs the country doing fine? The answer is no. Do we need to change things so that at the end of the day we might do a different thing from what we have now? The answer is yes. It then means that the likes of him, the likes of me and others who believe in this idea must be seen to meet and discuss issues. You don\u2019t make it sound as personal affairs because once there is suspicion, you don\u2019t have the buy-in of others.\u201d\n\nProf. Yusuf called on his fellow Northerners to ignore the press statement. \u201cAyo Adebanjo is a confused, bitter, frustrated, rambling and irrelevant old man at 93,\u201d he said. \u201cMy people do not care about his message or the personality that delivered the message.\u201d\n\nBut the National President of Middle Belt Forum (MBF), Dr. Bitrus Pogu, differed from others. According to him, the Middle Belt Forum and the Afenifere are on the same page with regard to the issue of restructuring, adding that it has to take place for the country to move forward.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe electoral bill which has been passed by the National Assembly and waiting for president\u2019s ascent is part of restructuring. It has to take place for Nigeria to move forward and for agitations for separation and breakaway to stop. If Nigeria is restructured and everybody feels happy, and nobody is dominating the others, Nigeria would remain one, and reach the level of development it supposed.\n\n\u201cGo and read Gideon Orkar\u2019s coup statement. He captured what is happening now very well \u2013 where a group is dominating this country; not only dominating, it has now unleashed terror on others. Everywhere you go, you hear Fulani herdsmen, bandits, Boko Haram. They are coming from the area Orkar wanted to excise out of Nigeria because of their domination.\n\n\u201cWe believe that this government will do justice to restructure this country because without it, these separatist agitations will grow. Before, it was only in the Southeast and now it has come to Southwest, and you have NINAS coming out to talk on behalf of indigenous ethnic nationalities. All these agitations are coming up because Nigeria is not working.\u201d\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation and Weak Erection. Click here .",

          "title": "Stripped of Influence, Govs Fight Back over Direct Primaries, Consider Court Action",
          "text": "Our Correspondents\n\nThough, President Muhammadu Buhari is yet to sign into law the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill, 2021, passed this week by the National Assembly, which, among other things, makes direct primaries mandatory for all parties for election of candidates, state governors across party lines are firming new plot to scuttle the amendment.\n\nThe governors, who felt the alteration would strip them of their power of deciding candidates for all elective positions in their parties, mounted pressure on the lawmakers to drop the amendment. But the lawmakers refused to back down; they went ahead to add mandatory direct primaries to the bill.\n\nFor the lawmakers, the amendment would strip the governors of their massive influence over delegates and restore the powers of all the members of the parties, with regard to selecting candidates for elections.\n\n\u201cThis amendment, if signed by the President, will also stop the governors from removing federal lawmakers at will. They just sit in their offices and decide who will return and who will not return. They have been doing this for over 20 years,\u201d a Senator, who pleaded for anonymity, told THISDAY last night.\n\nThe Senator eagerly pointed to how Governor Nasir El-rufai of Kaduna State stopped all the state\u2019s three senators in the Eight Senate from returning to the Ninth Senate.\n\nBut the state governors have not given up. They want their powers over delegates/selection of candidates retained and are ready to do anything to achieve this.\n\nAs a source put it last night, \u201cthe governors are ready for total war on this amendment.\u201d\n\nSources close to one of the governors told THISDAY: \u201cThe governors are waiting for President Muhammadu Buhari to return from France, so that they can pressure him to withhold assent to the bill. They believe they can convince the President to stay on their side. They are very sure that the President will send this bill back to the National Assembly.\u201d\n\nAnother source also said the governors \u201care not ruling out legal actions\u201d in case the President decides to sign the bill.\n\nHe said: \u201cThis is a Constitutional issue. Any law against the Constitution becomes invalid. Constitutionally, the political parties have the right to decide their mode of primaries to select candidate. Making direct primaries mandatory is unconstitutional. In any case, democracy is also about choice in any selection process. It is undemocratic to limit the political parties to direct primaries.\u201d\n\nBut one of the Senators, who led the mandatory direct primaries, said insinuations that it was undemocratic and unconstitutional \u201cis a ruse.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cDemocracy is also about people having a say in selecting candidates for elections.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with newsmen last Monday night at the end of the meeting held at Kebbi State Governor\u2019s Lodge, Asokoro, Abuja, Kebbi governor and Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum, PGF, Atiku Abubakar Bagudu said the governors were unhappy about the National Assembly\u2019s resolution on direct primaries.\n\nThe Kebbi governor, who faulted the National Assembly\u2019s insertion of direct primary into the law, maintained that political parties should be allowed to pick the option best suited for them. Bagudu noted that the resolution was against the spirit of Executive Order signed by President Buhari, which frowns on large gathering in the wake of the global pandemic.\n\nHe further argued that direct primaries were too cumbersome, unwieldy and would overstretch the limited resources of INEC, statutorily mandated to oversee primaries conducted by political parties.\n\nHe said: \u201cDirect primaries involve supervisory role by INEC. So, if multiple political parties are doing their primaries, INEC resources will be overstretched, and I think the chairman of INEC had even commented on that.\u201d\n\nThe PDP leadership is also opposed to mandatory direct primaries.\n\nThe PDP said, \u201cOur party holds that it is the inalienable right of each political party, within the context of our constitutional democracy to decide its form of internal democratic practices including the processes of nominating its candidates for elections at any level.\u201d\n\nThe PDP also believes that no political party should force its own processes on any other political party, as the direct primaries amendment, \u201ca practice the APC sought to achieve.\u201d\n\nThe Director General, Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Lukman, also alleged that APC lawmakers pushing for direct primaries were out to hoodwink the party.\n\nThe APC chieftain said understandably, part of the sentiment informing the actions of members of the National Assembly was that \u201cNigerians have little or zero confidence on the disposition of party leaders, who are alleged to be under the direct control of governors.\u201d\n\nLukman stressed that largely because of this perception, there was an ongoing media campaign blackmailing governors; that they were the ones perpetrating all the bad practices associated with the indirect methods and therefore the reason why they were against the adoption of direct primary.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Says Nigerians competitive abroad due to good education acquired at home\n\nDeji Elumoye in Paris, France\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday said despite mounting challenges facing nations, it was high time peace and solidarity \u201creign supreme\u201d across the globe.\n\nThe President, who spoke in Paris, France at a ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), said the world \u201chas an opportunity to count gains of the organisation in the last seven and half decades, while exploring the historic moment for building solidarity and enthroning peace.\u201d\n\nEarlier yesterday, Buhari, while receiving the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, Shaikh Shakboot Alnahyan, on the sidelines of the Paris Peace Forum, praised Diaspora Nigerians, saying their competitiveness \u201cis a product of the good education acquired at home.\u201d\n\nAt the UNESCO anniversary, Buhari canvassed global solidarity for the enthronement of peace and development.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur world is fast changing and so are the evolving challenges. There is, therefore, no better time to canvass for solidarity for the enthronement of peace and development.\n\n\u201cThe anniversary cautions us not to overlook our achievements and challenges of the past and present; not to overlook how our journey together has shaped our world.\u201d\n\nNigeria, he said, in felicitating with UNESCO, remained proud of its close association with the organisation since its establishment.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cSeventy-five years of building together a more advanced, knowledgeable and prosperous world through education, science, culture, communication and information.\n\n\u201cToday calls to mind the words of Federico Mayor, Director-General of UNESCO from 1987-1999 and I quote: \u2018any history begins when human beings have to draw from their knowledge of the past in order to better understand the present and look ahead to the future, when they come to realise that they must look into the facts, events and trends that have pre-figured their own era.\u2019 These are profound words, and they stand the test of time.\n\n\u201cAs we mark UNESCO\u2019s anniversary, we must acknowledge that it is a celebration of history; an occasion to remind ourselves of how far we have traveled, seeking to achieve the founding objectives of this great intellectual hub of the United Nations.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian leader further expressed happiness for being a part of the historic celebration, while congratulating UNESCO and its current leadership, for keeping the vision of the great organisation alive.\n\nHe added: \u201cAs a Member-State of UNESCO, Nigeria felicitates with all other Member-States, Associates and partners, who have walked the journey alongside UNESCO.\u201d\n\n\u2018Nigerians Competitive Abroad Due to Good Education Attained at Home\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, Buhari yesterday said the competitiveness which Nigerians display abroad \u201cis a result of the good education they acquired before travelling out of the country.\u201d\n\nThis is as he urged Nigerians in Diaspora to always abide by the rules of their host countries.\n\nThe President said this when he met with the Minister of State Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, Shaikh Shakboot Alnahyan, on the sidelines of the Paris Peace Forum.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cNigerians are all over the place, very competitive. And the competitiveness starts from home, where they have acquired good education, gone into businesses, and then take all that abroad.\u201d\n\nThe President encouraged Nigerians in Diaspora to \u201csubject themselves to the rules and standards of the country in which they live, either as working class, or doing businesses.\u201d\n\nHe welcomed the offer by UAE to partner with Nigeria in the areas of renewable energy, agriculture, infrastructure logistics, and provision of vaccines to further control the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn his own part, Alnahyan said his country \u201cthinks very highly of President Buhari\u2019s leadership,\u201d noting that the Nigerian leader \u201cis striving to build a better future for generations to come.\u201d\n\nHe said there were many Nigerians in his country \u201cwho add much value,\u201d assuring that the headwinds of the recent past in the relationship \u201care now behind us.\u201d\n\nAlnahyan said: \u201cWe want to secure, deepen and strengthen the association for the future. We have a lot in common. We may be taking small steps, but they are leading somewhere.\u201d\n\nOn proposed investments in Nigeria, Alnahyan said it would be a win-win situation, \u201cwhich would bring hope and opportunities for people in both countries; we want to come and add quality and value.\u201d\n\nThe Minister equally commended the Nigerian government for its robust tackling of violent extremism.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Dogara: Nigerians Have Accepted Mass Killings as New Normal",
          "text": "*Declares country risks survival if people merely tolerate each other\n\nCharles Ajunwa\n\nA former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara has said Nigerians seem to have accepted mass killings in the country as the new normal.\n\nDogara, in a key note address titled, \u201cPeace and Development in Nigeria: The Pragmatic Approach,\u201d delivered at a summit organised by the Sultan Maccido Institute for Peace and Development Studies, University of Abuja, lamented that such killings no longer made headlines, adding that the situation had created a feeling that \u201cnothing matters anymore.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cToday, Nigeria is faced with unprecedented crisis, so much so that nothing in our history prepares us for such a time as this. We seem to have accepted killings and mass murder as our new normal and so many cold-blooded murders of our brothers and sisters no longer make the headlines in the media.\n\n\u201cAs students, lecturers and political leaders, some of us are complicit, while the few who have dared to speak up are already outraged, fatigued and have surrendered to fatalism- a feeling that nothing matters anymore. It is like Nigeria seems to be suffering from some kind of God-ordained ineluctable fate.\n\n\u201cWhat we have done before doesn\u2019t matter; all that matters is our present station. As long as we are not actively engaged in seeking solutions to these intractable issues, we are actually, wittingly or unwittingly, actively promoting it.\u201d\n\nThe former Speaker said Nigeria runs the risk of not surviving if people merely tolerated each other, adding, \u201cOur happiness cannot be the other groups\u2019 unhappiness; our strength is not and will never be in our numbers but in our unity.\u201d\n\nHe advocated a united Nigeria, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ll be strong and when we strive to keep our bond and remain undivided, we will be invincible. This is what should concern every patriotic Nigerian at the moment, not scheming for future elections. All efforts of patriotic citizens must be geared towards stopping our dear country from the ongoing death by a thousand cuts.\u201d\n\nDogara argued that Nigeria\u2019s most immediate problem was the dangerous drift of the country into chaos and anarchy.\n\nApart from the rabid insecurity plaguing the nation, he said, \u201cThere are real or imagined charges of ethnic cleansing and domination of some sections by a certain section.\u201d\n\nThe former Speaker said: \u201cAttacks are unrelenting and there appears to be no end in sight. The situation has clearly gotten out of hand, following the repeated overrun of military formations by Boko Haram/ISWAP terrorists, wanton killings and kidnap for ransom and mass abduction of school children in different parts of the country.\n\n\u201cFor instance, we all know that the North bears nearly 90 per cent of the insecurity brunt of the country. If estimates are anything to go by, not less than 50,000 northerners have been killed while over three million have been displaced in the Northeast alone.\n\n\u201cNo one has the record of Northern lives lost to rural banditry, the farmer-herder clashes and ethno-religious conflicts. The number grows exponentially when we add the death occasioned by urban violence unleashed by an increasing army of mostly jobless youths suffering from substance use disorder.\u201d\n\nHe said there was also the threat posed by school dropouts and out-of-school children: \u201cA survey in 2015 put the number of out-of-school children in the country at 13.2 million. The latest MlCS data tells us that 69 per cent (9.1m) of out-of-school children in Nigeria are in northern states. The problem is further compounded by the fact that the North, just like other parts of Nigeria, is in a demographic transition.\n\n\u201cThe consequence of the \u2018youth bulge\u2019 is that there are so many young people competing for limited number of career opportunities. Those who lose out and fail to secure a place in society have become frustrated, angry and violent as predicted. This set of young people easily surrender themselves for radicalisation, as the timeless adage goes, an idle mind is the devil\u2019s workshop.\n\n\u201cInstead of the \u2018youth bulge\u2019 to be a blessing, it is fast leading to swapping of roles of our youths from productive labourers to disaffected rebels. What is left for us is to work out how to productively channel this restive energy. How do we warehouse this demography now and in the future? If we cannot find a place for them in society, how will they view us and the society they will live in? The situation is such that even the most incurable Nigerian optimist cannot sleep well in the face of these grim statistics. I hope this submit does not miss this point.\n\n\u201cThere is no hiding place for us anymore because Nigeria is no longer the same. Structural injustices, mass illiteracy, mass poverty, mass unemployment and under-employment have all combined to pull out those we had pushed to the fringes of society to our streets and villages with heavy tolls on Nigerian lives and devastation at all levels. We now have a small percentage of highly educated Nigerian youths who are prepared to question everything including questioning the questions themselves.\n\n\u201cWe succeeded in the past in decapitating oppressed Nigerians partly because they were largely illiterates and religion was used to keep them in check. Now we have seen that the frustration we fed them has reached a tipping point, the illiterates won\u2019t take it anymore, much less the educated youths who have freed themselves from fictional constraints and are asking questions like never before.\n\n\u201cIt is a pity that many are calling for the disintegration of Nigeria; saying that Nigeria cannot work. Unfortunately, they are emboldened by what they see but the real threats are buried in what they have failed to see. For instance, it is doubtful that if Nigeria were to break into pieces, the process will be peaceful. If a disintegration war breaks out now, the Western World had long predicted this and developed tools to secure their interest which is ensuring that the war does not distort their markets.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Launches online application portal, promises fairness\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal government yesterday officially launched an online platform for its National Housing Scheme (NHS), effectively preparing the ground for the sale of over 5,000 housing units in 34 states of the federation.\n\nSpeaking at the event in Abuja, Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola, noted that the new portal was expected to facilitate home ownership and rental schemes in both urban and rural areas.\n\nOf the 36 states, it was learnt that while Lagos State is yet to provide the government with land for the scheme, Rivers State is expected to join in the phase three of the project.\n\nThe minister called on Nigerians to leverage the opportunities granted by the federal government under the programme to own apartments in any parts of the country of their choice.\n\nWhile stating that the over 5,000 houses across 34 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) are currently at different stages of completion, the minister noted that that access to affordable houses had remained a challenge for many Nigerians.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs you know, we have houses scattered across the country that are not occupied. This is because people have a preference for different building styles. In the North, the people there prefer bungalows, while the South prefers blocks of flats.\n\n\u201cSo first, what we did was to carry out a survey to know what kind of houses Nigerians want to live in and that helped us to formulate relevant policies for the project.\n\nWe currently have over 5,000 units at different stages of completion.\u201d\n\nStressing that the size of the houses range from between 1 to 3 semi-detached bungalows and 1-3 bedroom, the minister noted that the flats will be sold for between N7 million to N16.19 million each, adding that payment can either be made through a mortgage or any financial system of choice.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe least selling price for each of these houses will be N7.222 million, and the highest will be N16.19 million. The highest is a 3-bedroom bungalow, it is not just the house but it also has land along with it. The bungalows are a little more expensive than the blocks of flats which do not have additional land.\n\n\u201cThere are some slight price differences in the blocks of flats built in the riverine and swampy areas, for example, houses in Edo, Bayelsa.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time we have a platform that every Nigerian has access to. This provides an opportunity for all Nigerians to apply and ensure a fair process of allocation. We will soon start the official handover and tape cutting as the subscribers come in. We have maintenance and facilities managers in all the estates.\n\n\u201cWe introduced the online portal from which the national housing programme will be offered to members of the public. The forms are online and allow for more openness, limits human interventions, and hold us more accountable. The endgame is an economic objective.\u201d\n\nHe said that the research done by the ministry was instrumental to the implementation of the federal government\u2019s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), explaining that contractors handling the projects are wholly Nigerian.\n\n\u201cNo international contractors were involved. We have 1,000 contractors from Nigeria. It also gave the contractors an opportunity to sustain their staff. Also, all materials for the project were locally made materials,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister urged Nigerians to register online via nhp.worksandhousing.gov.ng, listing the requirements for the application as a passport photograph, current tax clearance payslip, letter of recommendation, means of identification and evidence of 10 per cent initial deposit, which he said was for mortgage subscribers only.\n\nHe added: \u201cApplicants can also take a virtual tour of the property they are interested in. They can apply and register with email and phone number. Upon verification, they can complete their application.\n\n\u201cWe have included the abridged drawings of each estate. When an allocation is booked on the online portal, it will show that it is no longer available. This way we will avoid duplicity.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks during the event, President of the Nigerian Guild of Editors (NGE), Mr. Mustapha Isah, lauded the initiative, noting that the launch of the portal will give all Nigerians equal access to owning houses.\n\nAdded to that, Isah said that it would further ensure transparency and accountability in the entire process and urged Nigerians to key into the scheme, follow the instructions and register on the platform.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Yoruba Muslims and the fifth columnists",
          "text": "A Yoruba Muslim engineer recently alleged that because of his Islamic faith, he was denied a job by Femi Osibona, the real estate tycoon behind the collapsed 21-storey building. Since then, there has been an intense debate over allegations of pervasive discrimination against Yoruba Muslims by their Christian kith and kin. I, however, find it ironic that after Osibona\u2019s death, a video also showed him conducting Oba Abdulrasheed Akanbi, the Oluwo of Iwo and self-acclaimed Emir of Yorubaland, round the building. The Oluwo is a Muslim, by the way. I also saw a list of victims of the tragedy, many of them with Muslim names such as Ndajor Ahmed, Yunusa Abubakar and Ajiboye Habib.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, Osibona is not alive to defend himself so we would never hear his own version. We also understand that the engineer in question has now been employed by a company owned by a Muslim. Meanwhile, the Muslim Rights Council (MURIC) \u2014 which has been working round the clock to politicise religion in the south-west the same way the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) did at the national level in the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 immediately issued a statement saying \u201cthe rejection of a Muslim applicant\u201d is evidence of the \u201calienation of Muslims in Yorubaland\u201d. Before you could blink, this had gained a life, gleefully fuelled by outsiders who seized the opportunity to promote discord. At a time we should be mourning those who died in the tragedy, we are arguing over religion.\n\nI must first confess that I have always been very proud of the religious harmony that shapes social relations in Yorubaland. By harmony, I do not suggest the absence of religious differences or occasional tensions and conflicts. Rather, I define religious harmony as the insignificance attached to these differences. They are like a dot in a big picture. Religious fundamentalism is on the fringes in political, economic and social relations in Yorubaland. It is very common to hear people say \u201cwe were all created by the same God\u201d or \u201cwe are all worshipping the same God\u201d. This may sound like a denial or political statement, but it is more of a self-evolved mechanism to manage the differences.\n\nDoes that mean individuals do not harbour bigotry? Of course not. There are Muslims who would prefer to associate with fellow Muslims only and there are Christians who would always prefer to engage with just fellow Christians. This is universal; it is not peculiar to any religion or ethnic group. If we stretch it a little bit, we know there are Pentecostals who would not want to be friends with or employ Catholics, and vice-versa. Among Muslims, there are divisions and subdivisions as well. More so, I know Christians who would never eat Eid al-Adha meat and I know Muslims who would never step into a church even for a secular event. The unliberated mind is instinctively given to prejudice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose who read me regularly are aware that I preach ethnic and religious \u201cbalancing\u201d as a way of dousing fears of domination in a multi-cultural society. But I am disturbed by the obvious plot to weaponise religion and destabilise Yorubaland. Nobody should take the hullabaloo over the Osibona affair as a happenstance. There has been a sustained and not-so-subtle campaign in the last 10 or so years to sow seeds of discord among the Yoruba, to play Muslims against Christians and Christians against Muslims. One recurring evidence is the opposition to the wearing of hijab in schools. If a Deeper Lifer can wear a scarf to school, why can\u2019t a Muslim put on her hijab? Another evidence is the weaponisation of religion for political gains to turn Yorubaland into another Kaduna state.\n\nIf not that there is an agenda being played out, how can the alleged refusal of Osibona, one Yoruba Christian (among millions of Yoruba Christians), to employ one Yoruba Muslim (among millions of Yoruba Muslims) be extrapolated to mean all or most Yoruba Muslims are rejected by all or most Yoruba Christians? How can this form the conclusion that there is an \u201calienation of Muslims in Yorubaland\u201d? Yoruba Muslims alienated? Really? Is it the same Yorubaland that I live? I am not sure Yoruba Muslims themselves would like to be portrayed as victims and underdogs. Marginalisation, as a political construct, is a cheap card that tends to muddle up the real inequalities in the social strata.\n\nI don\u2019t know how they do it, but the Yoruba have always managed to navigate religious sentiments when playing politics. Religion as a content of Yoruba politics is so insignificant it is almost unbelievable. In the first republic, for instance, some of the most trusted associates of Chief Obafemi Awolowo, the revered Yoruba politician, were Muslims, notably Chief SO Gbadamosi and Alhaji DS Adegbenro. The Western House of Assembly crisis of 1962 saw Awolowo favouring Adegbenro to take over as premier from Chief SL Akintola, a Christian. I have not read anywhere that these great politicians ever threw religion into the terrain during their disagreements and rivalries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the second republic, as I have often pointed out, religion was not a factor. The Lagos governor was Alhaji Lateef Jakande and his deputy was Alhaji Rafiu Jafojo. Both Muslims. Christians did not utter one word of opposition. The Ogun governor was Chief Olabisi Onabanjo and his deputy was Chief Samuel Soluade. Both Christians. The Oyo governor was Chief Bola Ige and his deputy was Chief SM Afolabi. Both Christians. Muslims did not protest. You cannot tell me Muslims are minorities in the south-west! They simply did not, and still do not, vote along religious lines. There are probably more Muslims than Christians in Osun state, but they voted for a Christian-Christian ticket in 2003.\n\nDespite the poison that had been injected into the body politic in the 1980s and 1990s over a phantom Islamisation agenda, the Yoruba still managed to keep religion to the lowest level in their politics. The south-west overwhelmingly supported Chief MKO Abiola, a Muslim, in the 1993 presidential election. Many of those who took the bullet for Abiola were not of his faith. Chief Abraham Adesanya, who led the Afenifere onslaught to de-annul the June 12 election, was a Christian. Later on, the Afenifere leadership \u2014 mostly Christians \u2014 favoured Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, a Muslim, above Mr Funso Williams, a Christian, for the governorship of Lagos state.\n\nIn Oyo and Ogun states, the governorship batons have been passing between Muslims and Christians since 1999 \u2014 yet it was not by design or agreement. Mr Dapo Abiodun, a Christian, is today governor of Ogun with the full support of Tinubu, a Muslim. Tinubu also backed a Christian, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to be governor of Lagos state when he could have picked from a plethora of Muslim aspirants who were no less his favourites. Mr Seyi Makinde (PDP) was elected governor of Oyo state with Alhaji Rashidi Ladoja standing in his corner. In the same state, Chief Adebayo Alao-Akala, a Christian, asked his supporters to vote for Mr Adebayo Adelabu (APC), a Muslim.\n\nIn 2015, Chief Bisi Akande, a Muslim, nominated two ministers into President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s cabinet \u2014 Prof Isaac Adewole and Prof Omoleye Daramola. Both Christians. Religion did not shape his thinking. Amosun, a Muslim, nominated Mrs Kemi Adeosun, a Christian, into the same cabinet. For every instance of religious bigotry recorded in Yorubaland \u2014 either in politics or the socio-economic sphere \u2014 I can give a thousand examples to counter it. I would rather suggest that this spirit of accommodation and tolerance be promoted nationwide but those who have other motives would rather be amplifying something else to promote an agenda. It is a dangerous and dirty game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not uncommon for a Yoruba to come from a multi-religious family. Recently, a colleague lost his sister. I asked about burial plans. He calmly said she had been buried. I was surprised. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know that you are a Muslim,\u201d I said. He replied: \u201cI am a Christian but my sister was a Muslim. My father was a Christian and my mum an alhaja. Each of the children chose the religion they wanted.\u201d We then went into the whole discussion of the religious harmony in Yorubaland. You are more likely to find a Yoruba person who has both Muslim and Christian relatives than one who doesn\u2019t have. That is the Yorubaland I grew up to know, love and cherish. Danger is now knocking on the door.\n\nWhile south-westerners usually flaunt religious diversity as a credential, some interlopers have now hijacked this culture to mean Yoruba Muslim politicians must say they have Christian spouses to be accepted by Christians. I am not sure Muslim politicians such as Abiola, Jakande, Lam Adesina, Ladoja, and Rauf Aregbesola, among others, denied the religion of their spouses before enjoying support at the polls. The most complicated electoral permutation facing Yoruba Muslim presidential hopefuls today is not if south-west Christians would reject them but if northern Muslims would support them in the event that they picked a northern Christian as running mate.\n\nI would like to appeal to Yoruba leaders at all levels and in all spheres of life not to take this cherished religious harmony for granted. They must keep nurturing it. It is something to be consciously and continuously worked at so as not to give room to hirelings and fundamentalists to sow strife in Yorubaland. If there are religious issues to be addressed, they should be addressed sincerely. Weaponising religion for politics may sound sweet on social media but it never ends well. Anyone tempted to play the game should just take a long look at Kaduna. Can the acrimony ever end? Weaponising religion is not a good journey to embark upon. It is a journey of no return.\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nJUNGLE JUSTICE\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCuriouser and curiouser. Police have made arrests in connection with the raid on Justice Mary Peter-Odili\u2019s residence in Abuja but nothing makes sense to me yet. The picture we have now is that there was a ring, a syndicate, behind it \u2014 some of them allegedly connected to the powers that be. There is a booming petition industry. The removal of Justice Walter Onnoghen as CJN was kickstarted by a petition originated by an NGO headed by someone who is very close to the powers that be. Nigeria has become such a jungle that people can secure a frivolous court order to launch an assault on a Supreme Court judge. What a country. Nigeria is going to the dogs one day at a time. Pathetic!\n\nSOLUDO ON SEAT\n\nProfessor Charles Chukwuma Soludo, former CBN governor, is a technocrat and an intellectual of international repute. Which, in Nigerian-speak, means he should not be anywhere near the field of political contest. He should just sit down and wait to be appointed minister or whatever. He should never dive into the \u201cmurky waters\u201d of politics. Well, he is having none of that. He has finally been elected governor of Anambra state at third attempt. I insist that our best brains should continue to \u201cdive\u201d into the political fray if they have the interest. If Soludo is able to manage the delicate balance between politics and policy, I expect him to be a success because he is man of ideas. Congrats!\n\nKUDOS, INEC\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProf Mahmood Yakubu has passed through a lot of hard times as chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), but I have to commend him and his team for constantly seeking to improve the electoral process and leveraging largely on technology. The Anambra governorship election was particularly going to be challenging given the tense security situation and the gangrenous political climate. Although the separatist Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) called off its sit-at-home order at the last minute, the turnout was still nothing to write home about. INEC still has to improve on its logistics but, above all, I think the umpire had a credible outing. Kudos.\n\nTURNOUT TURNOFF\n\nLow voter turnout is a global problem, but we are recording too many lows in Nigeria. In Anambra state, there are 2.5m registered voters, but only 253,388 \u2014 roughly 10% \u2014 came out on the day of the governorship election. If you think it was because of IPOB, you need to pay attention to the general turnout across elections. Why the apathy? Why do people take the pain to register and then sit at home on election day? The simplest answer, from me sitting in my living room, is that most voters do not have faith in the system. But we really need to do a research on voter apathy. We need solutions and incentives going forward. What is democracy without the people? Shallow.",

Chief Abraham Adesanya, who led the Afenifere onslaught to de-annul the June 12 election, was a Christian. Later on, the Afenifere leadership \u2014 mostly Christians \u2014 favoured Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, a Muslim, above Mr Funso Williams, a Christian, for the governorship of Lagos state.\n\nIn Oyo and Ogun states, the governorship batons have been passing between Muslims and Christians since 1999 \u2014 yet it was not by design or agreement. Mr Dapo Abiodun, a Christian, is today governor of Ogun with the full support of Tinubu, a Muslim. Tinubu also backed a Christian, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to be governor of Lagos state when he could have picked from a plethora of Muslim aspirants who were no less his favourites. Mr Seyi Makinde (PDP) was elected governor of Oyo state with Alhaji Rashidi Ladoja standing in his corner. In the same state, Chief Adebayo Alao-Akala, a Christian, asked his supporters to vote for Mr Adebayo Adelabu (APC), a Muslim.\n\nIn 2015, Chief Bisi Akande, a Muslim, nominated two ministers into President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s cabinet \u2014 Prof Isaac Adewole and Prof Omoleye Daramola. Both Christians. Religion did not shape his thinking. Amosun, a Muslim, nominated Mrs Kemi Adeosun, a Christian, into the same cabinet. For every instance of religious bigotry recorded in Yorubaland \u2014 either in politics or the socio-economic sphere \u2014 I can give a thousand examples to counter it. I would rather suggest that this spirit of accommodation and tolerance be promoted nationwide but those who have other motives would rather be amplifying something else to promote an agenda. It is a dangerous and dirty game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is not uncommon for a Yoruba to come from a multi-religious family. Recently, a colleague lost his sister. I asked about burial plans. He calmly said she had been buried. I was surprised. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know that you are a Muslim,\u201d I said. He replied: \u201cI am a Christian but my sister was a Muslim. My father was a Christian and my mum an alhaja. Each of the children chose the religion they wanted.\u201d We then went into the whole discussion of the religious harmony in Yorubaland. You are more likely to find a Yoruba person who has both Muslim and Christian relatives than one who doesn\u2019t have. That is the Yorubaland I grew up to know, love and cherish. Danger is now knocking on the door.\n\nWhile south-westerners usually flaunt religious diversity as a credential, some interlopers have now hijacked this culture to mean Yoruba Muslim politicians must say they have Christian spouses to be accepted by Christians. I am not sure Muslim politicians such as Abiola, Jakande, Lam Adesina, Ladoja, and Rauf Aregbesola, among others, denied the religion of their spouses before enjoying support at the polls. The most complicated electoral permutation facing Yoruba Muslim presidential hopefuls today is not if south-west Christians would reject them but if northern Muslims would support them in the event that they picked a northern Christian as running mate.\n\nI would like to appeal to Yoruba leaders at all levels and in all spheres of life not to take this cherished religious harmony for granted. They must keep nurturing it. It is something to be consciously and continuously worked at so as not to give room to hirelings and fundamentalists to sow strife in Yorubaland. If there are religious issues to be addressed, they should be addressed sincerely. Weaponising religion for politics may sound sweet on social media but it never ends well. Anyone tempted to play the game should just take a long look at Kaduna. Can the acrimony ever end? Weaponising religion is not a good journey to embark upon. It is a journey of no return.\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nJUNGLE JUSTICE\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCuriouser and curiouser. Police have made arrests in connection with the raid on Justice Mary Peter-Odili\u2019s residence in Abuja but nothing makes sense to me yet. The picture we have now is that there was a ring, a syndicate, behind it \u2014 some of them allegedly connected to the powers that be. There is a booming petition industry. The removal of Justice Walter Onnoghen as CJN was kickstarted by a petition originated by an NGO headed by someone who is very close to the powers that be. Nigeria has become such a jungle that people can secure a frivolous court order to launch an assault on a Supreme Court judge. What a country. Nigeria is going to the dogs one day at a time. Pathetic!\n\nSOLUDO ON SEAT\n\nProfessor Charles Chukwuma Soludo, former CBN governor, is a technocrat and an intellectual of international repute. Which, in Nigerian-speak, means he should not be anywhere near the field of political contest. He should just sit down and wait to be appointed minister or whatever. He should never dive into the \u201cmurky waters\u201d of politics. Well, he is having none of that. He has finally been elected governor of Anambra state at third attempt. I insist that our best brains should continue to \u201cdive\u201d into the political fray if they have the interest. If Soludo is able to manage the delicate balance between politics and policy, I expect him to be a success because he is man of ideas. Congrats!\n\nKUDOS, INEC\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProf Mahmood Yakubu has passed through a lot of hard times as chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), but I have to commend him and his team for constantly seeking to improve the electoral process and leveraging largely on technology. The Anambra governorship election was particularly going to be challenging given the tense security situation and the gangrenous political climate. Although the separatist Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) called off its sit-at-home order at the last minute, the turnout was still nothing to write home about. INEC still has to improve on its logistics but, above all, I think the umpire had a credible outing. Kudos.\n\nTURNOUT TURNOFF\n\nLow voter turnout is a global problem, but we are recording too many lows in Nigeria. In Anambra state, there are 2.5m registered voters, but only 253,388 \u2014 roughly 10% \u2014 came out on the day of the governorship election. If you think it was because of IPOB, you need to pay attention to the general turnout across elections. Why the apathy? Why do people take the pain to register and then sit at home on election day? The simplest answer, from me sitting in my living room, is that most voters do not have faith in the system. But we really need to do a research on voter apathy. We need solutions and incentives going forward. What is democracy without the people? Shallow.",
          "summary": "Since then, there has been an intense debate over allegations of pervasive discrimination against Yoruba Muslims by their Christian kith and kin.\nThere has been a sustained and not-so-subtle campaign in the last 10 or so years to sow seeds of discord among the Yoruba, to play Muslims against Christians and Christians against Muslims.\nIf not that there is an agenda being played out, how can the alleged refusal of Osibona, one Yoruba Christian (among millions of Yoruba Christians), to employ one Yoruba Muslim (among millions of Yoruba Muslims) be extrapolated to mean all or most Yoruba Muslims are rejected by all or most Yoruba Christians?\nYoruba Muslims alienated?\nI am not sure Yoruba Muslims themselves would like to be portrayed as victims and underdogs.",

          "text": "Digital media in Africa is growing fast: traditional media organisations are finding their way to the internet while digital-only media organisations are taking firm root. More Africans are online, they are spending more time on the internet and relying more on digital media more than ever. According to the Social Flagship Report April 2021, created by Global Web Index (GWI), four African countries cracked the top 10 rankings for social media usage based on time spent, as Nigeria ranked first at (3:46), followed by Kenya (3:33), South Africa (3:32) and Ghana.\n\nOn the latest edition of TechCabal Live\u2014a video interview series in partnership with the UK-Nigeria Tech Hub\u2014held on October 25, we sought to understand Africa\u2019s digital media landscape, its challenges and future, and so we spoke with the editors of two of Africa\u2019s top digital newsrooms\u2014Quartz Africa Editor, Ciku Kimeria; and Stears Business\u2019, Editor-in-Chief, Fadekemi Abiru.\n\nHow can digital media in Africa create a profitable business model?\n\nWhile it is normal to get excited about the different innovative news products in the continent\u2019s digital media landscape, Abiru explains that more media houses need to produce more information that helps people understand what is going on around them.\n\nIn Africa, online news is mostly free. Only a few digital news organisations have been able to monetise their digital content. But Abiru wants this to change. \u201cLet people understand that information is something worth paying for. There is a challenge of helping people understand that where there is value, revenue can also be generated.\u201d Abiru believes that value creation is enough reason for digital media in Africa to monetise their online content. She further explains that the concept of \u201ccontent worth paying for\u201d is why Netflix and Spotify operate subscription-based business models.\n\nAbiru believes that for African newsrooms to use the subscription model successfully, they must produce deep, original and insightful pieces that cannot be found elsewhere.\n\nAfrican newsrooms have a talent problem\n\nAbiru complained about a talent shortage and the challenge of retaining talent. Ciku also believes that Africa faces a talent problem but is hopeful that training would go a long way to solve it. She added, though, that it is easier to train good writers on technical skills but very hard to teach good writing.\n\nQuality of work coming from African newsrooms must improve\n\nSpeaking on the quality of journalistic work coming out of African newsrooms, Ciku believes that there is a huge gap between African and, say, American journalism. But she believes the fault isn\u2019t entirely the journalist\u2019s. She says there has been a drop in the quality of journalism schools in Kenya, her home country.\n\nAnother reason for this drop in the quality of journalism is the university system in Africa, where there are scandals of people paying for their degrees.\n\n\u201cNow, when you read what a journalist has written, there are so many typos and errors,\u201d she lamented.\n\nYet another problem Ciku highlighted was funding. She believes African journalists can do amazing work, but their budget is way smaller than that of global publications.\n\n\u201cIf a great investigative journalist wants to go into a project in a place that\u2019s not safe, and his organisation gives him little or no money to do so, you can understand how they will not come up with the same quality of work as a global media house.\u201d\n\nThe major cause of the funding problem, Ciku said, is the environment and not individual journalists.\n\nYou can watch the rest of the conversation below:\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Launched in 2019 by Cregital, a Lagos-based creative design agency, Disha Pages gave users the tools with which to build their own one-page websites from the comfort of their smartphones, without worrying about technicalities such as coding or sorting out a domain name.\n\nCredit: Disha (Medium)\n\nThe product was an instant hit and got considerable adoption among creators and gig workers. Unfortunately, by a little over a year after its launch\u2014at the peak of the pandemic\u2014the company announced that they were shutting down the product.\n\n\u201cHow can we help?\u201d\n\nAs soon as the announcement of the shutdown went up, the Disha team were inundated with calls and messages from baffled well wishers, all of them concerned and wondering what they could do to keep the platform alive. These early conversations were tepid, nothing was concrete\u2014until Flutterwave came into the picture offering a total buyout. The move by the payments giant, which earlier this year became a unicorn, is surprising as both companies operate in different spaces\u2014Flutterwave in payments and Disha in the creator industry. One wonders, then, what the play is here.\n\nIn a call with Flutterwave\u2019s head of product marketing, Onyedikachim Nwankwo, explained that while both companies may run different businesses, their company goals are aligned. \u201cFlutterwave is about creating endless possibilities for everyone, and Disha\u2019s goal of enabling creators achieve success and get paid for their work ties into Flutterwave\u2019s larger mission of helping small businesses thrive.\u201d\n\nNew look for Disha?\n\nIn a statement announcing the acquisition, Flutterwave says that the buyout will grow Disha\u2019s base by providing users with the ability to make, receive and withdraw money from their Disha accounts in over 150 currencies and 34 countries across the world. Despite the acquisition, however, Disha will remain an independent company. According to Nwankwo, \u201cIts original vision will be maintained.\u201d\n\nRufus Oyemade, Software and Architectural Lead at Flutterwave, states that Disha coming under the Flutterwave family means its vision will be explored farther than earlier imagined. \u201cBefore now, when users created a Disha page and linked to a Flutterwave payment link, they got taken off the Disha site. Now, with the acquisition, users can create and accept their payments, all in one place.\u201d\n\nFlutterwave has always played in the creator space, having supported arts events like ArtX Lagos. Now, as the digital world opens up to creators getting paid for their work through innovations such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the payments giant is well positioned to help creators on Disha access global markets and further grow the global creator economy, which is estimated to be worth $100 billion.\n\nFlutterwave became a unicorn in March after reaching a $1 billion valuation, and the company may be set to triple that value in the future to the tune of $3 billion by acquiring more funding.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Exclusive: Meta\u2019s VP MEA and Turkey on Facebook\u2019s transition into the metaverse",
          "text": "At the end of October, social media giant, Facebook, changed its company to Meta. The announcement was made in an hour-long video that explained the company\u2019s decision to shift gears away from being known as just a social media company and focus on building the metaverse.\n\nLeading that work in Africa is Derya Matras, Vice President (VP), Middle East, Africa (MEA) and Turkey, Meta.\n\nPrior to her appointment as VP in August, Matras was the Managing Director for the MEA and Turkey region. Before that, she was Country Director for Facebook in Turkey for four years. Derya holds a BSc in electronics engineering from Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University, Istanbul, Turkey, and an MBA from Columbia Business School.\n\nOver email, Matras talked to TechCabal about Facebook\u2019s rebrand to Meta and how it plans to make money from the metaverse and deal with the challenges that come with building it.\n\nHow is the Metaverse better than Facebook in its current form?\n\nWhen Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world\u2014and we are not turning away from these existing products. Those experiences are going to form a crucial part of the future metaverse ecosystem. The Facebook app is still going to be called Facebook.\n\nThe name Meta is a clear link to our vision for the metaverse. However, the metaverse will exist, whether Meta is there or not. So, Meta means us moving beyond 2D screens towards immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality, to help build the next evolution in social technology. This is a natural evolution for our company as social media and technology evolves.\n\nWhat demographic is the metaverse targeting in Africa?\n\nGiven all that the metaverse has to offer, there\u2019s a lot at stake in making sure its possibilities are open to everyone and not just people from traditionally underrepresented groups. An inclusive metaverse benefits everyone.\n\nIs Facebook building the metaverse because it\u2019s best positioned to build something that\u2019s inevitable?\n\nIn recent decades, technology has given people the power to connect and express themselves more naturally. We started with websites, then we got phones with cameras, and then the internet became more visual and mobile. As connections got faster, video became a richer way to share experiences. If you look back over time, we\u2019ve gone from desktop to web to mobile; from text to photos to video. Now we are looking at what comes next. The metaverse will feel like a hybrid of today\u2019s online social experiences, sometimes expanded into three dimensions or projected into the physical world. It\u2019s the next evolution in a long line of social technologies, and it\u2019s ushering in a new chapter for our company.\n\nIn Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s letter, he mentioned that the \u201cmetaverse will not be created by one company\u201d. Does this mean there\u2019ll be other metaverses outside of Facebook\u2019s metaverse and that they can all exist side by side without Facebook trying to be the only metaverse out there?\n\nThe metaverse isn\u2019t a single product that one company can build. Its success depends on building robust interoperability across services, so different companies\u2019 experiences can work together. And it won\u2019t be built overnight. Many of these products will only be fully realised in the next 10-15 years. While that\u2019s frustrating for those of us eager to dive right in, it gives us time to ask difficult questions about how they should be built. We\u2019ll work with experts in government, industry and academia to think through issues and opportunities in the metaverse.\n\nWe also need to involve human and civil rights communities from the start to ensure these technologies are built in a way that\u2019s inclusive and empowering.\n\nAcross Africa, we\u2019re supporting Africa No Filter, Electric South and Imisi 3D to support creators who have been pushing the boundaries of digital storytelling using immersive technology to amplify African voices.\n\nIs there the potential for other applications and programmes to be built in the metaverse\u2014similar to the blockchain.\n\nWe are at the very start of this. A lot of the technology and infrastructure still needs to be built. It will take at least 5 to 10 years for this vision of the metaverse to come to life. This pace is going to be dictated less by business interests and more by technological realities. Infrastructure needs to be transformed with new technologies, hardware and cooling specifications to be able to support a robust service. And new hardware still needs to be built, including things like hologram displays, projectors, batteries, radios, custom silicon chips, cameras, speakers, and sensors to map the world around you and more.\n\nWhy should Facebook build this? Why not another company?\n\nThis was an important step for us to take on our journey, and as we evolve to Meta, we hope this will better reflect where we are going as a company. Like all businesses, we continue to innovate so that we can bring value to people\u2019s lives.\n\nWe are a social company with investments in technology, like VR; and the metaverse is the next frontier of virtual digital connection\u2014so it\u2019s a natural evolution for our business. But it\u2019s important to reiterate that Meta is neither going to build, own, or run the metaverse on its own. This isn\u2019t going to be a Meta product.\n\nBuilding this will be more like how the internet came about rather than how one app was launched. That\u2019s why we will be collaborating at every stage with other companies, developers, experts, and policymakers. Principles of privacy, safety, and security need to be built in from the start. If we have the principles right, then as a society, we will be better at tackling new challenges with these technologies as they arise.\n\nThe transition to communication via the metaverse will face some challenges considering that it\u2019s not just another app on the mobile phone. What challenges does Facebook expect to encounter in rolling out the metaverse in Africa?\n\nNew innovations bring new challenges, and there\u2019s lots we need to figure out. But that\u2019s why we\u2019re starting this conversation early. We have to be responsible in our approach, and we intend to do that in a number of ways:\n\nNo surprises: In the past, the speed with which new technologies have emerged has sometimes left policymakers and regulators playing catch-up. We don\u2019t want this to happen this time around. A core principle is going to be \u201cdon\u2019t surprise people\u201d. That\u2019s why we are having this conversation out in the open, way in advance of all these technologies being launched.\n\nCollaboration: Partnering with independent experts and organisations will be a crucial part of how we navigate future challenges. We have already launched a two-year $50 million investment in programmes and external research, collaborating with industry partners, civil rights groups, governments, non-profits, and academic institutions to get input as we build these technologies responsibly. This is alongside being a founding member of the XR Association (XRA), which is committed to helping build responsible XR, which includes virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and future immersive technology.\n\nBuilt-in: While we will need to continue to get better at anticipating risks, we won\u2019t be able to see around every corner. That\u2019s why the principles of privacy, safety, and security need to be built in from the start.\n\nFacebook plans to spend ~$10 billion this year on the metaverse project\u2014and even more in the coming years. How will the company make money from this?\n\nIt\u2019s very early, and our focus today is more around building the foundational pieces for the metaverse, like VR, and bringing more people into those experiences. We outlined a few areas during Connect where we think there is an opportunity around commerce. We want to help provide tools for creators and developers so they can build a meaningful business in the metaverse because we think digital commerce will become increasingly important.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that investing in the metaverse also means additional resources invested in issues like safety and security. For example, the $10 billion investment in Reality Labs that we have already announced will include spending on research to better understand how we can responsibly tackle safety and integrity challenges in the metaverse.\n\nAnd, just like the rest of the internet, we expect that free things in the metaverse would likely be powered by ads while there would also be paid experiences that are ad-free.\n\nThis is a very long-term vision. It\u2019s going to take investment over many years before the metaverse reaches scale.\n\nLately, fingers have been pointed at Facebook for inciting civil unrest in Africa and being ill-equipped to staff its Africa offices to properly regulate posts. How does Facebook plan to build the metaverse responsibly?\n\nEvery day, our teams have to balance protecting the ability of billions of people to express themselves openly with the need to keep our platform a safe and positive place. We continue to make significant improvements to tackle the spread of misinformation and harmful content. To suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true.\n\nWe are on track to spend over $5 billion on safety and security in 2021 alone and have 40,000 people working on these issues, including 15,000 people who review content in more than 70 languages.\n\nHow we build is as important as what we build. And we will be collaborating at every stage\u2014with other companies, developers, experts and policymakers\u2014to make sure that what we build is good for the world.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It\u2019s called Kifta Technologies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKifta Technologies creates cutting-edge defence technology used by private entities and countries globally.\n\nIt makes smart glasses that can identify who you\u2019re looking at and even tell you if they\u2019re a wanted criminal.\n\nInterestingly, the company is the brainchild of a Nigerian textile merchant, Monsuru Anifowoshe.\n\nAfter several cases of stolen, intercepted and even vanished textile containers travelling from Lagos to Kano, Anifowoshe decided to build drones that\u2019ll make sure his containers arrived at their destinations safely.\n\nHardware is hard. However, Anifowoshe is making it work somehow. Kifta\u2019s first Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) prototype cost $450,000 to build, easily a pre-seed raise for a software company in Nigeria.\n\nEmmanuel Paul visited Kifta Technologies HQ and dished all about the gadgets here: Nigeria\u2019s Kifta Technologies produces smart glasses, other cutting edge defence tech for companies and countries worldwide.\n\nOr you can jump straight to the video here.\n\nEquity-free financing by Lendable\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to funding, there are two ways to do it. You either give up some shares in your company or get a loan and pay it back later. The former \u2014 a popular option in the startup space \u2014 is equity financing, while the latter is debt financing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLendable, a UK-based debt financing company, typically gives startups between $5 million and $10 million in debt financing. However, it doesn\u2019t finance startups in the idea stage, only those with a proven product that needs to kick things up a notch.\n\nLendable shared how they invest, some of their biggest funding stories, and missed opportunities with Techpoint Africa\u2019s Chimgozirim Nwokoma.\n\nYou can read all about it here: How UK-based debt financing company, Lendable, is providing equity-free financing for African startups.\n\nRabbit\u2019s $11m pre-seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRabbit team. Sourece: TechCrunch\n\nThe grocery delivery business in Egypt seems to be getting a lot of attention lately. Last week, Breadfast and Appetito bagged $26 million and $2 million, respectively.\n\nThis week, it\u2019s RabbitMart, aka Rabbit\u2019s turn. The startup raised a massive pre-seed round of $11 million.\n\nWho invested? Per TechCrunch, the record-breaking pre-seed saw investments from Global Founders Capital and Goodwater Capital, among others.\n\nInterestingly, Rabbit was founded in June 2021 but just came out of stealth in October.\n\nUnlike players like Breadfast and Appetito, Rabbit says it will set itself apart by letting the market call the shots. According to its CEO, Ahmad Yousry, Rabbit, \u201cwe\u2019re going to let the market dictate what we sell. We\u2019re not limiting ourselves as a grocery player.\u201d\n\nThe company employs an Amazonesque system to fulfil orders in 20 minutes. It has a large warehouse in addition to fulfilment centres to speed up delivery.\n\nThe startup plans to add more fulfilment centres in major cities across Egypt over the next year.\n\nFlutterwave acquires Disha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, November 10, 2021, African payments startup, Flutterwave, announced its acquisition of Disha, a platform for creators to curate their content and receive payment.\n\nDisha, which has about 20,000 users globally, was on the brink of shutting down in February 2021 but told users in a tweet that it was \u201cconsidering new options for our company and will share an update as soon as we have made a resolution.\u201d\n\nFounded by former Cregital CEO, Evans Akanno, Rufus Oyemade and Blessing Abeng in 2019, most of the platform\u2019s users were based in the UK, US and Europe. However, it only generated a little over $1000 monthly, according to TechCrunch.\n\nWhat does this acquisition mean for Disha? Flutterwave will provide the platform with a new payout and collection solution to help users receive payments from audiences globally.\n\nWhile Flutterwave makes it easier for creators to receive payments, the acquisition is also a way to invest in a global creator market estimated at $104.2 billion.\n\nMFS Africa raises $100m Series C\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDare Okoudjou (Founder and CEO, MFS Africa).

          "text": "The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26) officially came to an end Saturday night with an agreement that all major emitters will be compelled to return in 12 months and explain at the UN how their economy-wide policies and plans are aligned to the Paris temperature goals.\n\nThe agreement made it clear that all nations need to do much more and fast too to prevent a catastrophic rise in global temperatures. It detailed actions required including cutting CO2 emissions, curbing methane, and setting up new rules to hold countries accountable for the progress they make \u2014 or fail to make.\n\nThe final agreement was worded to water down the demand for phasing out coal. The phrase \u201cphase down unabated coal,\u201d was a compromise to accommodate India\u2019s objection because the earlier draft had read to \u201cphase out\u201d coal. Negotiators from India insisted on the text to the consternation of others. The compromise was reached to avoid the fragile agreement from collapsing.\n\n\u201cThe approved texts are a compromise. They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today. They take important steps, but unfortunately, the collective political will was not enough to overcome some deep contradictions,\u201d said Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, secretary general of the United Nations.\n\nRead also: COP26: India in rumble over global climate target\n\nBut the deal reached on Saturday failed in certain important areas. Negotiators could not agree to phase out fossil fuels with countries Australia, Russia and Saudi Arabia weakening the pledge. However, the agreement for the first time indicated that fossil fuel was responsible for the climate crisis, a development that does not bode well for future oil projects.\n\n\u201cBut despite progress on future emissions reductions, COP26 failed those most impacted by the climate crisis now. The EU and US refused to create a fund that the poorest countries could draw on for crisis response,\u201d said International lead, Strategic, Communications, European Climate Foundation.\n\nHowever, some progress was realised from the talks. The negotiators were able to close the Paris rulebook which means that by 2024 all countries will have to report detailed data on emissions forming the baseline from which future reductions can be assessed.\n\nThey also agreed on new carbon market rules which plugs some gaps and create a structured trading regime between countries, but language isn\u2019t clear enough to stop companies gaming the system, said, King.\n\n\u201cSector-specific agreements on forests, coal, cars, methane and a $20bn agreement to stop overseas fossil fuel finance have the potential to make significant inroads into cutting emissions, but will require translation from national governments into policies and plans that have to be presented to COP in Egypt next year.\n\n\u201cThe banks and investors announcements in week one were large in numbers but devoid of substance. But the major banks have now committed to aligning their money to net zero in the 2020s and will face scrutiny on how they deliver on their green claims and shed fossil fuel and other high-carbon assets,\u201d said King.",

          "text": "Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State sees recent developments as pointers that the Federal Government might be cowing the judiciary ahead of 2023.\n\nWike alleged that the invasion of the residence of Justice of the Supreme Court, Mary Odili, was a precursor to the Federal Government\u2019s likely tactic of browbeating the judiciary to a state of fear and conformity as the country enters the next political season.\n\nThe governor said the FG wants to continue to ride roughshod unchecked over the rule of law and the sanctity of the country\u2019s electoral system, hence, the renewed attack on judicial officers.\n\nThe police in Abuja have paraded those they claimed were behind the invasion, but this may not have impressed Wike who had given a 48-hour ultimatum since last week.\n\nThe Rivers State governor now said at a special court session to mark the opening of the 2021/2022 Legal Year of the Rivers State judiciary held at the Chief Judge\u2019s ceremonial court, Port Harcourt on Thursday, that: \u201cAlthough it is still early morning in our democratic match towards 2023, the attack on Justice Mary Odili is a prelude to many more and even worse political maneuverings we should be prepared to experience from the FG, which having lost relevance and popular support is becoming more and more desperate over its dwindling political fortunes by the day.\n\n\u201cWhile cases with political undertones, including the constitutional validity of certain sections of the recent amendments to the 2010 Electoral Act, if assented to by Mr. President, would necessarily come before our courts; what is important is the duty and capacity of our judiciary to save our democracy and the country.\u201d\n\nHe noted that it is the responsibility of the government at all levels to protect the judiciary and accord the courts with such assistance as they may require to enable them to safeguard their independence, advance the rule of law, and dispense justice equally and fairly to all citizens.\n\nAccording to him, Unfortunately, while the present Federal Government has been very weak in resourcing and strengthening the judiciary; it has been very strong and readily predisposed to ridiculing the entire institution and subjecting individual judges to both physical and psychological trauma for its own self-interest.\n\n\u201cWe all witnessed the infamous midnight raids on judicial residences and the subjection of some judges, to illegal raids, arrests, and detentions by agents of the Federal Government purportedly carrying out a baseless sting operation back in 2016.\n\n\u201cSince then the intimidation of judges whose judgments, intellectual or moral disposition they are not comfortable with has continued unrelenting with the latest attack on a peaceful mother, wife of a former governor and Justice of the Supreme Court, our own highly revered Hon. Justice Mary Odili.\n\n\u201cIt is important to emphasize that we allow these intimidations to become acceptable standards of behaviour and even become complicit in their unholy design to undermine the administration of justice when we all opt to keep quiet in the face of these assaults.\u201d\n\nWike, who commended the leaders of the Nigerian Bar Association, the Body of Senior Advocates, the Chief Justice of Nigeria, and members of the public for promptly condemning the siege on the judiciary, said they must quickly move beyond the verbal protestations to unveil those behind the raid on Justice Odili\u2019s residence and ensure that they all are held to account for their actions, otherwise, this impunity would never cease to rear its ugly head in the country.\n\nRead also: Rivers not fighting FG over tax collection \u2013 Wike\n\nHe challenged the Federal Government to come clean on this infamy with the names, identities, and affiliations of those allegedly arrested for their roles or found to have been involved in the attack on the residence of Justice Odili if it is not to be perceived as the primary mastermind.\n\nSpeaking on the proposed proliferation of Law School campuses, the governor urged the management of the Nigerian Law School, the Council of Legal Education, and the Federal Government to see the folly in the plan, and nib the idea from the bud before it causes more damage to a foremost institution that is already severely challenged for lack of adequate funding.\n\nHe explained that the Port Harcourt Campus of the Nigerian Law School being built by the State government was consciously demanded and approval secured from the Council of Legal Education and ultimately from President Muhammadu Buhari, through the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice and named after late Nabo Graham-Douglas, SAN.\n\n\u201cHere again, some lazy and uninformed characters have criticized our Law School development project with the unfounded and lousy allegation that it lacks budgetary provisions in our 2021 budget, even when they conceded to the propriety of the project and the optimal benefits it would attract to the state and the business community.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike said in the last six years, his administration has continued to improve the welfare and wellbeing of state judicial officers, especially, the provision of new cars, comfortable and well-resourced offices, as well as the provision of life-long residences for all judicial officers, including those serving in Federal courts and other jurisdictions external to the state.\n\nChief Judge of Rivers State, Simeon Chibuzor Amadi said since assumption of office in May 2021, he has administered the judiciary with commitment in order to raise the bar of performance of judicial officers and staff that should reflect in the speedy dispensation of justice.\n\nAccording to him, training sessions have been organized for manpower capacity development in mediation practices, infrastructure improved, and the magistracy practice laws and rules revisited for purposes of review.\n\nJustice Amadi further said that of the 30,227 cases, 11,719 cases were disposed off and warned that no application from any lawyer for a transfer of cases will be tolerated if such case has already entertained at least two witnesses in court.\n\nIn his speech, the Rivers State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Zacchaeus Adangor, SAN, said it is imperative for members of the Bench and Bar to reaffirm their unwavering commitment to the effective, efficient, and speedy administration of justice in order to continue to enjoy the confidence of Nigerians.",

          "text": "In Nigeria, financial technology is now all the rage with the proliferation of tech companies riding on the back of the country\u2019s fast-evolving banking system and its vast population of digitally enabled youths to drive inclusion.\n\nThat space has been made more vibrant by the incursion of foreign fintechs bringing turnkey solutions as varied as mobile lending, e-commerce, payments and card issuance.\n\nTimbo Drayson, who helped Google introduce web mapping platform Google Maps to Africa and the Middle East, is bringing a disruption to the mix with the smart addressing app OkHi, which enables businesses to track clients through proper addressing.\n\nMr Drayson was recently in Lagos and told PREMIUM TIMES the innovation could provide the latest touchpoint for service providers to know their customers better.\n\nWhat transformation do you think OkHi\u2019s smart addressing will bring to a frontier market like Nigeria considering that awareness of such fintech services is still low in the country?\n\nWe estimate that lack of addressing costs the Nigerian economy about $3 billion a year in inefficiency. It\u2019s an enormous problem, much wider than just financial services. Our vision statement is \u201cA world where anyone can use their OkHi address to access the services they need.\u201d Extending that to Nigeria, imagine an environment where there is more financial inclusion due to people proving their address and their identity, e-commerce is a seamless checkout experience, deliveries are efficient and on time, to-the-door post is available, and perhaps most importantly, emergency services never get lost. Yes, today we\u2019re focused on address verification for financial services, which is a market of about 40 million people, but tomorrow we will be Nigeria\u2019s digital addressing system, making people\u2019s lives easier and making businesses more efficient.\n\nDigital mapping using mobile apps like Google Maps is still problematic in Nigeria in that users are sometimes misdirected by prompts on their phone, while some addresses may not feature on most apps. How will OkHi offer solutions to this?\n\nThe point is, in markets where there are functional addressing systems, there is a national database of addresses which Google Maps can leverage. It means as a user, you can put an address into Google Maps and very often navigate there. In a market like Nigeria, where there isn\u2019t a proper addressing system, Google Maps is much less reliable. The way to see OkHi is we are creating that national address database. As we do that, other services like Google maps and Uber will work much more effectively.\n\nHow can smart addressing help financial institutions cut costs?\n\nCurrently, banks and some of the larger fintechs are sending agents to people\u2019s houses to verify their address by checking if they live there, which can take weeks and cost up to N2000 per verification. We make it easy for businesses to verify their customer\u2019s address through their smartphone, replacing utility bills and physical visits. As we proved in a pilot with Stanbic, we reduce the cost by 52%, and reduce the time by four times (and time equals money).\n\nTell us how the idea of smart addressing came about and why you chose Africa as the starting point?\n\nAfter working at Google for seven years where I launched Google Maps across the Middle East and Africa, I took a sabbatical in 2014 to travel around East and West Africa, including Nigeria. I experienced the challenges with lack of addressing, whether it\u2019s inefficient deliveries, lost taxis, proof of address when registering a SIM card or even lost emergency services. I saw the inefficiency and the size of the problem first hand and that\u2019s where our mission to enable the 4 billion people to #beincluded came from.\n\nNigeria\u2019s banking space is fast expanding with a lot of fintech solutions. How will your company help in resolving key KYC issues in tracking loan defaulters for instance?\n\nLending is a really strong use case. Knowing where someone lives with a high level of confidence increases trust, which can then unlock larger loan disbursements, and therefore more revenue. As you point out, the clear area of impact OkHi can have is helping a lender with loan recovery. If you know where someone lives, you can find a customer that has defaulted.\n\nWhat has the adoption rate of products so far been since you launched in Nigeria?\n\nOur product has just launched with Quickteller, so it is very early days. We have a very strong pipeline of leading fintechs made up of neobanks and mobile lenders, as well as some traditional banks that will be going live in the coming weeks and months, so watch this space.\n\nHow do you plan to expand to other parts of Nigeria from your base in Lagos?\n\nThe key aspect to our product is it can work out of the box not only anywhere in Nigeria, but anywhere in the world.

Some soldiers were also killed.\n\n\u201cAnother group of terrorists attacked Mulai village, close to Maiduguri and rustled some cattle while another gang of fighters attacked a communication mast and health centre in Buni Yadi, Yobe State and carted away generator set and drugs.\n\n\u201cAt Ngamdu, in Kaga Local Government of Borno, ISWAP terrorists suffered a devastating blow in the hands of the troops, unfortunately, three Special Force operatives paid the Supreme sacrifice during the encounter.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Nigerian Army in a statement on Saturday, by its spokesman, General Onyema Nwachukwu, confirmed the killing of Zirkusu, but said troops of Joint Task Force, North East Operation HADIN KAI neutralized several ISWAP terrorists during the recent encounter in Askira Uba.\n\nHe said, \u201cIn the fierce encounter which is still raging as at the time of filling this report, troops supported by the Air Component of OPHK have destroyed five A \u2013 Jet, two A-29, two Dragon combat vehicles and nine Gun Trucks.\n\n\u201cSadly, a gallant senior officer Brigadier General Dzarma Zirkusu and three soldiers paid the supreme sacrifice in a very rare diplay of gallantry as they provided reinforcement in a counter offensive against the terrorists, and successfully defended the location. The family of the senior officer and soldiers have been contacted.\n\n\u201cThe Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen Faruk Yahaya deeply commiserates with the families and relations of the fallen heroes.

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe Ebonyi State chapter of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP), has rejected what it described as a plan by the state government, working in connivance with the state house of assembly, to auction the state\u2019s liaison offices in Abuja, Lagos, Enugu and Aba to the family of Governor David Umahi.\n\nThe opposition party which kicked against the move in a statement by Nwoba C. Nwoba, its spokesman, urged Ebonyi people to join voices with it to stop the acquisition of the public belongings by the Umahis as there\u2019s no basis for which they should be sold without a replacement plan.\n\n\u201cThe attention of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) in Ebonyi State has been drawn to the plan by the Ebonyi State Government in connivance with the House of Assembly to cede Ebonyi State liaison office buildings in Aba, Lagos, Abuja and Enugu to the Governor David Umahi\u2019s family. It is worrisome that the Francis Nwifuru\u2019s led House of Assembly could not deliberate extensively on the need to or not auction the property even when the PDP members in the House were objecting to the procedure adopted in deliberating on the letter containing the auction request by the State Government,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cWhy are the Ebonyi offices in Aba and Enugu auctioned outright? Is it to mean that Ebonyi people are no longer in their large numbers in these cities? More worrisome is the fact that there\u2019s no alternative to replacing them. The aim of establishing these liaison offices years back was to receive complaints from Ebonyi people scattered all over the places and attend to their daily needs. It\u2019s significant to note that these offices became redundant immediately Gov. Umahi\u2019s administration came into existence, bearing in mind that he could through the House of Assembly acquire them for personal use. This applies to the Abuja and Lagos offices which he claims sales will be public private partnership driven. We can authoritatively inform Ebonyi people that Gov. Umahi has concluded plans to acquire the property using cronies and which the leadership of the state assembly is aware of.\n\n\u201cWe, therefore urge Ebonyi people to join voices with us to stop the acquisition of these public belongings by the Umahis as there\u2019s no basis for which they should be sold without a replacement plan. We wish also to remind the Ebonyi State House of Assembly that it\u2019s not an appendage of the executive arm of the Ebonyi State Government, that they should at all times be doing the bidding of the executive without following due legislative process. To this end, we call on Ebonyi people to rise against this plan, and in case the governor finally has his way, should hold the Speaker Nwifuru-Umahi House responsible as the House couldn\u2019t listen to the different objections raised by the PDP members in the House towards approval of this obnoxious request on Tuesday and Thursday of this week respectively.\u201d",

Graduates will receive N15,000 per month, diploma holders\n\nand others will receive N10,000 monthly. This will at least, help them\n\nto go to the training centres.\n\n\u201cSeventy percent of the beneficiaries will come from HYPADEC catchment\n\ncommunities, 10 percent of the youths will be persons with disability,\n\n30 per cent women and the rest will be a fight for all. We want to make\n\nsure that the disabled and women are given adequate attention.The training is going to be between three and six months based on the trade the benefiting youths have chosen.\n\n\u201cIf the exercise is successful, we will train another batch of youths.\n\nSo that in every six months we will be able to graduate 490 youths\n\nfrom Kwara state that will be able to stand on their own,\u201d Yelwa stated.\n\nIn his remarks, Kwara State governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq,\n\nrepresented by secretary to the state government (SSG), Prof Sha\u2019aba\n\nJibril, said that \u201cmany of the HYPADEC communities are exposed to\n\nenvironmental degradation, flooding and continue to suffer untold\n\nhardship since their livelihood is solely dependent on fishing and\n\nfarming. They are therefore vulnerable.\n\n\u201cIt is my hope that the perennial problem of power supply, disaster\n\nsuch as lead poisoning and erosion will soon be a thing of the past.

And they beat the fellow West Africans courtesy of a pair of penalties scored by Victor Osimhen and skipper Ahmed Musa.\n\nOsimhen broke the deadlock in the 15th minute when he converted from the spot. The Nigerians calmly controlled the game and guarded their lead.\n\nThey doubled the tally with virtually the last kick of the game, substitute Musa converted a penalty after Osimhen was pulled down by the keeper inside the box.\n\nIn Praia, the hosts were stunned early when Isaac Ngoma gave the Central Africans an 11th minute lead, one which they guarded till halftime.\n\nHowever, Cape Verde came off the break a different side and it took them just six minutes to get back to level terms, Julio Tavares finding the back of the net. They kept the push and got the winner with quarter of an hour left after Ianique dos Santos Tavares netted the second.\n\nHeading to the final match in Lagos on Tuesday, Cape Verde are in a must win situation to progress to the play-off round while Nigeria, who have a two-point lead, just need in the least a draw.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

          "text": "According to Keystone Bank, the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, issued a directive that a portion of the $136 million owed to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) be paid in naira equivalent.\n\nThe bank revealed this during a meeting of the Ad-hoc Committee on Assessment and Status of All Recovered Loots, Movable and Immovable Assets, which encompassed loots and assets recovered by federal government agencies from 2002 to 2020.\n\nMr Malami, who had determined that a total of $136,676,600.51 was to be paid to NNPC, ordered that 96 million be paid in dollars and 40 million in naira be paid.\n\n\u201cOut of this entire amount, we paid $96 million in United States dollars and we paid the equivalent of $40 million in naira,\u201d according to Lawal Ahmed.\n\nMr Ahmed, who is the Executive Director, North and Public Sector Directorate, Keystone Bank, also said that Mr Malami recommended the exchange rate at N305 to a dollar.\n\n\u201cThat was the directive by the Attorney-General at the rate of N305 to a dollar,\u201d Mr Ahmed noted, although it is unclear when the transactions were carried out.\n\nWhen the chairman of the committee, Adejoro Adeogun, queried why funds meant for Brass LNG Investment account was remitted in a different account, Mr Ahmed stated that the bank had remitted all funds belonging to the NNPC.\n\n\u201cWe were paying into the Brass LNG\u2019s NNPC account in the TSA and at the time the Attorney-General gave the directive, he instructed that the funds be credited to the FGN Assets Recovery Account,\u201d the bank official said.\n\nMr Adeogun, while presenting a document to Mr Ahmed, explained that the figures in the transactions differ from the one obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nHowever, the bank representative argued that \u201cThe first item, which is N12,421,794,504.88 is the equivalent of $40m at N305, which was directed to the FGN Assets Recovery Account.\n\n\u201cThere were two accounts: Brass LNG and OML 40. At the time this (AGF) letter was written, I believe that we had not concluded payment yet. The final payments were made thereafter in tranches,\u201d Mr Ahmed added.\n\nReacting, a member of the committee, Olanrewaju Edun, criticised Mr Malami for issuing such directives, suggesting that the AGF be subjected to questioning.\n\n\u201cOut of the $40m that you claimed, the Attorney-General gave you a letter. As far as I am concerned, I don\u2019t know why you have to take a letter from the Attorney-General.\n\n\u201cThis is Nigeria\u2019s money owned by the three tiers of government. We can take you up on that.\n\n\u201cMr Chairman, I believe that my constituency has been robbed of money. Yes. And we need to contest that letter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why the Attorney-General had to issue a letter that something that was transacted in dollars should be paid in naira rate when you have differential rates in Nigeria,\u201d he added.",

They formed a barricade outside and use it as their own car pack. They intimidate people with guns. They came into the terminal building armed to the teeth, harassing passengers. A lot of people were scared. A white lady thought there was going to be a terrorist attack on the airport.\n\n\u201cTheir commander led them into the terminal building armed with assault rifles. It\u2019s even written that weapons are not allowed in that place, that part of the airport and these people came in with AK-47,\u201d he had said.\n\nAnother source had noted that the military men invaded the place in anger because their commanders were invited to Abuja over recent viral videos depicting the rot and extortion at the airport.\n\nHe alleged that the same Air Force personnel are responsible for recruiting touts from Oshodi to extort passengers at will.\n\n\u201cAll of these because their bosses were summoned to Abuja; this comes after that video of the woman alleging corruption at the airport that SaharaReporters published and a video made by a white guy.\n\n\u201cThe security chiefs at the Airport were summoned to Abuja. But the thing is, these airforce guys are the same guys that extort arriving passengers. They even bring touts from Oshodi to come to coordinate the parking space for them so they collect money from people instead of directing them to the real car park.\u201d\n\nSome weeks ago, an American vlogger, Sabbatical called out the airport officials for requesting money at different points, in a video that has now gone viral.\n\nHe described the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) in Lagos as \u201cextremely corrupt.\u201d",

          "text": "Nearly 200 nations came together Saturday on a global deal to combat climate change after two weeks of painful negotiation, but fell short of what science says is needed to contain dangerous temperature rises.\n\nRich countries stood accused of failing at the COP26 summit in Glasgow to deliver much-needed finance to vulnerable states that are at risk of drought, rising seas, fire and storms.\n\nBritain\u2019s COP26 president Alok Sharma rounded up the marathon negotiations telling delegates: \u201cIt is now decision time. And the choices you are set to make are vitally important.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Activists Sound Alarm On Climate Anxiety\n\nBut there was last-gasp drama as China and India insisted that language on fossil fuels be weakened in the final summit decision text.\n\nAs the final deal was clinched, a tearful Sharma said \u201cI apologise for the way this process has unfolded. I am deeply sorry,\u201d before banging down his gavel.\n\nDelegates entered the talks charged with keeping the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5-2C degrees within reach.\n\nThey were also tasked with finding the funding for nations most at risk of climate-related droughts, floods and storms supercharged by rising seas.\n\nObservers said the agreement fell far short of what is needed to avert dangerous warming and help countries adapt or recoup damages from the disasters already unfurling globally.\n\nLaurence Tubiana, the architect of the Paris deal, told AFP that \u201cCOP has failed to provide immediate assistance for people suffering now.\u201d\n\nSharma earlier told delegates in the final throes of marathon talks that they faced a \u201cmoment of truth for our planet, for our children and our grandchildren\u201d.\n\nSurvival\n\nThe final text urged nations to accelerate efforts to \u201cphase down\u201d unfiltered coal and \u201cphase out\u201d inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.\n\nLarge emitters China and India had opposed the mention of the polluting fuels, and the language in the final text was significantly more nuanced than earlier drafts.\n\nThe deal also called on all countries to accelerate their emissions cuts by submitting new national plans by 2022, three years earlier than agreed in Paris.\n\nBut after resistance from rich nations led by the United States and EU, the text omitted any reference to a specific finance facility for the loss and damage climate change has already caused in the developing world.\n\nIt instead only promised future \u201cdialogue\u201d on the subject.\n\n\u201cFor some loss and damage may be the beginning of conversation and dialogue,\u201d said Shauna Aminath, the Maldives environment minister. \u201cBut for us this is a matter of survival.\u201d\n\nAlthough host Britain said it wanted COP26 to keep the 1.5C temperature cap in reach, a UN scientific assessment last week said countries\u2019 latest climate plans put Earth on course to heat 2.7C.\n\nThe text noted \u201cwith deep regret\u201d that wealthy nations had also failed to stump up a separate annual sum of $100 billion they promised over a decade ago. It urged countries to pay up \u201curgently and through 2025\u201d.\n\nIt also promised to double finance to help developing countries adapt to rising temperatures by the same date.\n\n1.5C on life support\n\nBut developing nations said it was unfair for the summit to produce an unbalanced agreement heavily weighted toward \u201cmitigation\u201d \u2014 how economies can ditch fossil fuels and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nThey wanted specific instruction on how they can meet the bill of decarbonising while also adapting to the natural disasters supercharged by global warming.\n\n\u201cWe were told that COP26 was the last best chance to keep 1.5C alive but it\u2019s been placed on life support,\u201d Amanda Mukwashi, CEO of Christian Aid.\n\n\u201cRich nations have kicked the can down the road and with it the promise of the urgent climate action people on the frontline of this crisis need.\u201d\n\nThe two weeks in Glasgow saw a number of high-profile announcements from world leaders, such as a commitment to slash methane emissions by 30 percent by 2030.\n\nIt also witnessed mass protests against what activists said was a dangerous lack of urgency.\n\nTeresa Anderson, climate policy coordinator at ActionAid International, said COP26 was \u201can insult to the millions of people whose lives are being torn apart by the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nAFP",

          "text": "Pop star Britney Spears on Friday regained control of her personal life and her money when a judge ended a 13-year conservatorship that became a cause celebre for fans and critics of an arrangement typically meant to protect the elderly.\n\n\u201cEffective today, the conservatorship of the person and the estate of Britney Jean Spears is hereby terminated,\u201d Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny said after a 30-minute hearing in which no one opposed ending the court-sanctioned arrangement.\n\nThe 39-year-old \u201cPiece of Me\u201d singer had begged the court for months to terminate the conservatorship that has governed her personal life and $60 million estate since 2008.\n\nSpears did not attend Friday\u2019s hearing but said in an Instagram post, \u201cI love my fans so much it\u2019s crazy!!! I think I\u2019m gonna cry the rest of the day !!!! Best day ever.\u201d\n\nOutside the courthouse, dozens of fans erupted into cheers and tossed pink confetti into the air when they heard the news. Some danced and sang to her hit \u201cStronger.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a monumental day for Britney Spears,\u201d the pop star\u2019s attorney, Mathew Rosengart, said outside the courthouse. He thanked the #FreeBritney movement which he said had been essential to ending the legal arrangement.\n\nThe conservatorship was set up and overseen by the singer\u2019s father, Jamie Spears, after she had a public breakdown in 2007 and was hospitalized for undisclosed mental health issues.\n\nInterest in the case was propelled in the past year by documentaries and the #FreeBritney movement of fans who questioned why the singer needed such restrictions while she was touring around the world and earning millions of dollars.\n\nLauriann Wright, the attorney for Jodi Montgomery, who had been entrusted with overseeing Spears\u2019 personal life, told the judge there was \u201cno reason this termination cannot happen and Ms. Spears cannot live a safe, happy and fulfilling life.\u201d\n\nRosengart said a \u201csafety net\u201d had been put in place to help Spears transition back to regular life. Judge Penny added that the current conservator should continue working to settle ongoing financial issues in the case.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shaking,\u201d Leanne Simmons, a fan and one of the organizers of the #FreeBritney movement, said shortly after the decision. \u201cIt still hasn\u2019t sunk in to hear those words, \u2018The conservatorship has been terminated.\u2019 Britney is a free woman.\u201d\n\nThe Spears case helped prompt hearings in the U.S. Congress and a new law in California aimed at preventing abusive conservatorships, which are normally set up to protect disabled people, the elderly or those suffering from dementia.\n\nTRAUMATIZED AND HUMILIATED\n\nSince revealing years of private anguish in tearful testimony in June, Spears hired Rosengart, who moved aggressively to end the restrictions.\n\nIn June, she told the court she had been humiliated and traumatized and that she wanted her life back. She said she had been forced to work and take medication against her will and was prevented from marrying or even getting her hair done.\n\n\u201cShe stepped up on June 23rd and really shocked the country and shocked the world with her powerful, poignant words,\u201d Rosengart said.\n\nJudge Penny ended the conservatorship without requiring Spears to undergo a mental health evaluation, a step often taken in such cases.\n\nThe arrangement began to crumble in September when in a sudden reversal Jamie Spears said he supported ending it because it had helped her and was no longer needed.\n\nPenny suspended Jamie Spearsfrom the conservatorship in late September, calling his involvement \u201ctoxic\u201d to the singer\u2019s well-being.\n\nRosengart is pushing for Jamie Spears to be investigated for possible financial mismanagement of his daughter\u2019s affairs, but he said on Friday it would be up to Britney Spears to decide how to proceed on that matter.\n\nJamie Spears has said through attorneys that he helped his daughter rehabilitate her career and always acted in her best interest.\n\nSpears is engaged to marry her personal trainer boyfriend, Sam Asghari, but no date has been set. \u201cHistory was made today. Britney is Free,\u201d Asghari wrote on Instagram.",

          "text": "A man who traveled to space with William Shatner last month was killed along with another person when the small plane they were in crashed in a wooded area of northern New Jersey, according to state police.\n\nThe one-time space tourist Glen M. de Vries, 49, of New York City, and Thomas P. Fischer, 54, of Hopatcong, were aboard the single-engine Cessna 172 that went down Thursday.\n\nDe Vries was an instrument-rated private pilot, and Fischer owned a flight school. Authorities have not said who was piloting the small plane.\n\nThe plane had left Essex County Airport in Caldwell, on the edge of the New York City area, and was headed to Sussex Airport, in rural northwestern New Jersey, when the Federal Aviation Administration alerted public safety agencies to look for the missing plane around 3 p.m.\n\nEmergency crews found the wreckage in Hampton Township around 4 p.m., the FAA said.\n\nDe Vries, co-founder of a tech company, took a 10-minute flight to the edge of space Oct. 13 aboard Blue Origin\u2019s New Shepard spacecraft with Shatner and two others.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take me a while to be able to describe it. It was incredible,\u201d de Vries said as he got his Blue Origin \u201castronaut wings\u201d pinned onto his blue flight suit by Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos.\n\n\u201cWe are devastated to hear of the sudden passing of Glen de Vries,\u201d Blue Origin tweeted Friday. \u201cHe brought so much life and energy to the entire Blue Origin team and to his fellow crewmates. His passion for aviation, his charitable work, and his dedication to his craft will long be revered and admired.\u201d\n\nDe Vries co-founded Medidata Solutions, a software company specializing in clinical research, and was the vice chair of life sciences and health care at Dassault Systemes, which acquired Medidata in 2019. He had taken part in an auction for a seat on the first flight and bought a seat on the second trip.\n\nDe Vries also served on the board of Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nFischer owned the flight school Fischer Aviation and was its chief instructor, according to the company\u2019s website.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.",

          "title": "Trump Adviser Bannon Charged after Defying Capitol Riot Subpoena",
          "text": "Stephen Bannon, a prominent adviser to former U.S. President Donald Trump, has been criminally charged for defying a subpoena issued by a congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, the Justice Department said on Friday.\n\nBannon has refused to cooperate with the House of Representatives select committee seeking testimony and documents from him, citing Trump\u2019s insistence \u2013 already rejected by one judge \u2013 that he has a right to keep the requested material confidential under a legal doctrine called executive privilege.\n\nBannon, 67, was charged with one count of contempt of Congress for refusing to appear for a deposition and a second count for refusing to produce documents. Contempt of Congress is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail and a maximum fine of $100,000.\n\nJustice Department spokesperson Bill Miller said Bannon is \u201cexpected to self-surrender\u201d on Monday in Washington and make his first court appearance in the case that afternoon.\n\nTrump has sought to stonewall the committee, which is scrutinizing his actions relating to the deadly Capitol riot, and directed his former associates not to cooperate. The charges against Bannon may bolster the committee\u2019s efforts to secure testimony and documents from other Trump associates.\n\nBannon\u2019s indictment was announced just hours after Trump\u2019s former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows refused to appear for a deposition before the committee, risking also being found in contempt of Congress.\n\nAs a top adviser to Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign who later served as White House chief strategist, Bannon helped articulate the \u201cAmerica First\u201d right-wing populism and fierce opposition to immigration that helped define Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nBannon, who has promoted a variety of right-wing causes and candidates in the United States and abroad, continued to offer Trump advice after leaving his White House post in 2017. Bannon is a prominent figure in right-wing media circles and previously headed the Breitbart News website.\n\n\u2018CLEAR MESSAGE\u2019\n\n\u201cSteve Bannon\u2019s indictment should send a clear message to anyone who thinks they can ignore the Select Committee or try to stonewall our investigation: no one is above the law,\u201d Democrat Bennie Thompson and Republican Liz Cheney, the leaders of the committee, said in a statement.\n\nBannon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt is the second time in 15 months that Bannon has faced criminal charges. Bannon was charged in August 2020 with defrauding donors to We Build the Wall, a private fund-raising effort to boost Trump\u2019s wall project along the U.S.-Mexican border, and arrested aboard a yacht belonging to a fugitive Chinese billionaire. Trump subsequently issued a pardon to Bannon before that case could go to trial.\n\nThe Democratic-led House voted to hold Bannon in contempt of Congress in October. Most of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans in Congress opposed creating an independent commission or a committee to investigate the events surrounding Jan. 6.\n\nOn that day, a mob of Trump supporters rioted at the Capitol in a failed bid to prevent formal congressional certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s election victory. Before the riot, Trump gave a speech to his supporters repeating his false claims that the election was stolen from him and urged them to go to the Capitol and \u201cfight like hell\u201d to \u201cstop the steal.\u201d\n\nThe committee has said Bannon made public statements suggesting he knew in advance about \u201cextreme events\u201d that would occur on Jan. 6. Bannon said on a Jan. 5 podcast that \u201call hell is going to break loose tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAfter the House voted to hold Bannon in contempt, it was up to Biden\u2019s Justice Department, headed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, to decide whether to bring charges. Garland in a statement on Friday said his department \u201cadheres to the rule of law, follows the facts and the law and pursues equal justice under the law.\u201d\n\nTrump on Oct. 18 sued the committee and the National Archives, which holds material dating from his presidency, in a bid to keep hundreds of pages of records secret. A judge rejected Trump\u2019s lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the public interest in learning about Trump\u2019s actions on Jan. 6 was paramount. Trump appealed that ruling.\n\nThe last successful prosecution for contempt of Congress was in 1974 when a judge found G. Gordon Liddy, a conspirator in the Watergate scandal that drove President Richard Nixon to resign, guilty.",

          "title": "Biden, Xi Jinping to Hold Virtual Meeting on Monday",
          "text": "U.S. President Joe Biden will hold a virtual meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday, the White House said, talks Washington hopes will create some stability amid increased tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nIt is expected to be the leaders\u2019 most extensive meeting under the Biden administration and will follow on from a telephone call between the two on Sept. 9.\n\nWashington and Beijing have been sparring on issues from the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic to China\u2019s expanding nuclear arsenal. U.S. officials believe direct engagement with Xi is the best way to prevent ties spiraling toward conflict.\n\n\u201cThe two leaders will discuss ways to responsibly manage the competition \u2026 as well as ways to work together where our interests align,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement. \u201cPresident Biden will make clear U.S. intentions and priorities and be clear and candid about our concerns.\u201d\n\nBeijing is also keen to avoid confrontation as Xi faces a crucial year ahead with China\u2019s hosting of the Winter Olympic Games and a key Communist Party Congress where he looks to secure an unprecedented third term.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry said on Saturday the leaders would exchange views on bilateral relations and issues of common interests in the summit, which will take place on Tuesday morning in Asia.\n\nA senior U.S. official said Biden would make clear he welcomes stiff competition with China, but doesn\u2019t want conflict, and played down the likelihood of a long list of outcomes often tied to top-level meetings.\n\n\u201cThis is not about seeking specific deliverables or outcomes,\u201d the official said, adding in reference to the People\u2019s Republic of China: \u201cAs we compete with the PRC, President Biden expects President Xi and the PRC to play by the rules of road\u2014and he will make that point throughout the meeting.\u201d\n\nThe meeting will come after Biden signs a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal in a big ceremony on Monday to celebrate domestic renewal plans he believes will position the United States to out-compete China.\n\nU.S. officials have played down the possibility of progress on trade, where China is lagging in a commitment to buy $200 billion more in U.S. goods and services.\n\nChina has nevertheless continued to push for relief from hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs imposed under former President Donald Trump, arguing this could help both sides by easing inflation and boosting employment.\n\nCOMPETING VISIONS\n\nBiden and Xi outlined competing visions at meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum this week, with Biden stressing the U.S. commitment to a \u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific,\u201d which Washington says faces increasing Chinese \u201ccoercion,\u201d while Xi warned against a return to Cold War tensions.\n\nAddressing APEC leaders on Friday, Xi spoke of the need to \u201cstick to dialogue rather than confrontation, inclusiveness rather than exclusion, and integration rather than decoupling,\u201d an apparent reference to U.S. moves to make key supply chains independent of China.\n\nClimate is a priority for Biden, and China and the United States, the world\u2019s two biggest carbon emitters, unveiled a deal at global talks in Glasgow this week to ramp up cooperation, including by cutting methane emissions, phasing out coal consumption and protecting forests.\n\nHowever, the superpowers have clashed increasingly over self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own and that Washington is required to provide with the means to defend itself.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken angered China this week when he said Washington and its allies would take unspecified \u201caction\u201d if China were to use force to alter the Taiwan status quo, further muddying the long-held U.S. policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d as to whether the United States would respond militarily.\n\nSenior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi told Blinken in a call on Saturday that the United States should not send the wrong signals to Taiwan pro-independence forces, according a statement on the Chinese foreign ministry website.\n\n\u201cIf the United States really wants to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait, it should clearly and resolutely oppose any Taiwan pro-independence behavior,\u201d Wang said.\n\nWang and Blinken also exchanged views on areas including energy efficiency, climate change and the Iran nuclear issue and agreed to maintain dialogue on global challenges, China said.\n\nDaniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for Asia under the Obama administration, said both Biden and Xi were worried by the risk of a military incident escalating.\n\n\u201cBiden knows that the tools for prevention and crisis management are rusty, so we should expect him to push to put in place safeguards or \u2018guardrails\u2019 to reduce risk,\u201d he said.\n\nRussel said the Sept. 9 Biden-Xi call began with Xi listing complaints, but ended with a constructive agreement for officials to continue discussions.\n\n\u201cThis suggests that the personal relationship Biden built with Xi a decade ago is still strong, and that each conversation can add some stability to the mix.\u201d",
