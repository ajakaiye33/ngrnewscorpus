          "text": "By Juliet Umeh\n\nDirector General, Small & Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria, SMEDAN Dikko Umaru Radda has said that most Small and Medium Enterprises, SMEs struggle because they refuse to take advantage of intellectual property benefits to their businesses.\n\nRadda said that robust intellectual property, IP, can grow businesses as much as it contributes to economic growth.\n\nHe regretted that in spite of this, a lot of businesses in Nigeria especially the small and medium size entrepreneurs do not assess, audit, evaluate or monetise their intellectual property.\n\nRadda made the assertions at a forum tagged Intellectual Property Forum Nigeria, organized by IP Radio Station in conjunction with hybrid indigenous tourism and leisure company, Butterfly Tourism\n\nThe DG who was represented by Bumi Daudu, said some of the SMEs don\u2019t know even as little as what trade mark or protection is all about, and as a result, have been running businesses for decades without any protection of their IP.\n\nHe said: \u201cI think collaboration between those that are championing IPR in Nigeria and SMEDAN is inevitable at this moment where the business world is changing in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cPeople need to guard whatever they have with everything they have inside of them to make it work\u201d\n\nALSO READ: FG disburses over N56.8bn to beneficiaries of MSME\n\nEarlier in his opening remarks, founder/CEO of IP Radio Nigeria, Mr Nosa Uwadaie called for the democratization of intellectual property, considering that it has become a human right.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t see IP as only meant for multinationals. It permeates every facet of our business and national life. In fact, IP is a human right property in every facet of human existence, be it biological, environmental or business.\u201d\n\nCorroborating Uwadaie, President of Intellectual Property Law Association of Nigeria, IPLAN, Obafemi Agaba said: \u201cA robust IP regime will impact on the economy of the country.

          "text": "The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has pegged the fee for post-Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (post-UTME) at N2,000.\n\nIt also adopted the minimum cut-off marks for 2021/2022 admissions sent by heads of tertiary institutions across the country.\n\nThe adoption signifies that there will be no uniform cut-off marks for 2021/2022 admissions, as was done in the past.\n\nEvery institution is expected to maintain its minimum score during the admissions.\n\nThese are some of the decisions taken at Tuesday\u2019s 2021 policy meeting held virtually and chaired by the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, at the headquarters of JAMB in Bwari, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja.\n\nJAMB Registrar, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede, displayed the minimum cut-off marks adopted by tertiary institutions at the meeting.\n\nThe University of Maiduguri proposed 150; Usman Dan Fodio University, Sokoto, proposed 140; Pan-Atlantic University proposed 210; University of Lagos (UNILAG), 200; Lagos State University (LASU), 190; Covenant University, Ota, 190; and Bayero University, Kano (BUK), 180.\n\nAccording to the new arrangement, universities are not allowed to go below 120, while polytechnics and colleges of education pegged their minimum cut-off points for admission at 100.\n\nThe stakeholders approved October 29, 2021 as deadline for the closure of amendments to 2021 admissions.\n\nAt yesterday\u2019s policy meeting, stakeholders resolved to allow the Federal Ministry of Education to decide on the deadline for closure of 2022 admissions as they could not agree on the December 31, 2021 deadline for all public institutions and January 31, 2022 for all private institutions.\n\nOloyede warned the institutions not to go beyond the N2,000 pegged as Post-UTME fee.\n\nHe said: \u201cNobody should charge more than N2,000. The total gross is N2,000. It is not allowed by institutions to allow candidates to procure administrative charges.\n\n\u201cNo institution is allowed to capture or demand any result upload. It is the one that we upload on caps that we will send to all of you. The biometrics supplied by JAMB should be used for the exercise.\u201d\n\nAlso approved at the policy meeting were the guidelines for the higher institutions to use for admitting candidates based on their minimum scores approved by such institutions and the policy meeting.\n\nStakeholders at the meeting exempted prison inmates, visually impaired and foreign candidates from sitting for post-UTME exercise.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAdamu hailed JAMB for introducing the use of National Identification Number (NIN) in the registration for 2021 UTME.\n\nRepresented by the Permanent Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Education, Sonny Echono, the minister said the use of NIN drastically reduced examination malpractice in this year\u2019s examination.\n\nHe added that the West African Examination Council (WAEC) would also follow similar path by adopting mandatory use of NIN.\n\nAdamu said: \u201cI am enthused that the last examination recorded the lowest cases of examination irregularities in the history of the board because those who will normally have exploited the weak links through biometrics infractions had been effectively checkmated with the introduction of NIN by JAMB.\n\n\u201cIt is gratifying that WAEC has decided to follow the path of using NIN to curb examination malpractices. The ministry is presently considering other ways of using the NIN to uncover some other admission irregularities and all perpetrators, including their collaborators in the institutions who would be made to face the consequences.\u201d\n\nOn illegal admissions being conducted by some tertiary institutions, Adamu expressed concerns that Federal Government\u2019s directive that all admissions be done through JAMB\u2019s Central Admissions Processing System (CAPS) was being violated.\n\nThe minister directed JAMB to give the government the list of affected institutions for necessary punishments.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is saddening that despite the clear directives at previous policy meetings, some institutions still illegally admitted candidates outside CAPS. I consider such an act as a direct affront on the system, and appropriate sanctions shall be applied on those found to have been in such disruptive act.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, any institution that issues admission letters to candidates outside CAPS will be punished for such gross indiscipline and fraud. The consequence of admissions conducted outside of CAPS is grievous. It subjects the candidates to gloom future as nemesis of illegal admission awaits them at the completion of study when it will be impossible to take full advantage of the acquired candidates.\n\n\u201cAs a demonstration of our resolve, I have directed JAMB to bring forward for appropriate sanctions the list of all institutions involved in the violation of the directive of government, which was personally conveyed by me at the 2018 policy meeting in Gbongan, Osun State.\u201d",

          "title": "\u2018Unemployment major cause of kidnapping, banditry\u2019",
          "text": "Former Secretary-General of the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) Chief Anthony Sani has blamed the worsening insecurity in Nigeria on the mass unemployment and introduction of cashless economy. In this interview with ABDULGAFAR ALABELEWE, the elder statesman, who note that kidnapping for ransom had supplanted armed robbery, says government must address the underlying causes because it cannot be combated only by the military forces\n\nAt what point did Nigeria get it wrong to the extent that kidnap-for-ransom is now the order of the day?\n\nWhen people lament the state of insecurity that has culminated in kidnapping-for-ransom, it makes one to wonder their sense of history. This is because for the past 30 years, we have been hearing the chorus that unemployment is a time bomb waiting to be ignited by the indifference of the political elite. We are also aware of the fact that poverty which comes with unemployment and ignorance has been growing steadily due to a steady increase in population without the corresponding growth of the economy for many years. The introduction of a cashless policy made armed robbery unattractive. Hence the emergence of kidnapping-for-ransom has supplanted armed robbery. That is to say, the inability to grow the economy to absorb the youths coupled with ignorance and the introduction of the cashless economy have combined to spur kidnapping-for-ransom as a business venture which produces billionaires in a very short time. This has also attracted citizens of neighbouring countries to flock to Nigeria in order to participate in kidnapping for ransom.\n\nSchools are being closed and there is a general atmosphere of insecurity and people are living in fear. What are the implications of this on our education and general wellbeing?\n\nThe level of abductions of school children have become the deed in the fashion of recent. As a result, parents are afraid to send their wards to schools. The children are also afraid. More distressing is the claim of responsibility by Boko Haram either rightly or wrongly for the express purpose of furthering the cause of its agenda that western education is taboo.\n\nThe implication is that there will be no educated Nigerians in the next generation. Imagine the fate of a country populated by a majority of uneducated ignorant people. This is not acceptable. The government must therefore go as far as efforts can go and put an end to kidnapping for ransom through both military action and address of the underlying causes.\n\nHappily enough the new service chiefs have assured the nation that with the arrival of the Tucano Jet Bombers from America and the promised increase in the number of well trained and equipped security personnel as well as their motivation, they would take the fight to their doorsteps by dominating all the forests harbouring those posing insecurity to the nation.\n\nTalking about the underlying causes, a retired naval officer said on national television last week that the centre of gravity of banditry and insurgency are the sponsors. Do you share that view and how can the sponsors be brought to justice?\n\nWe all know without sponsors, insurgents and gunmen cannot prevail. Sponsors know the underlying causes of terrorism which they exploit for their advantage. When you consider the fact that terrorism transcends national boundaries, you would at once appreciate why America first put up a coalition of 66 countries of all faiths against IS, which is ISWAP in Nigeria. The coalition has now been increased to 102 countries. Also, 140 countries met in Rome last month and discussed how best to assist the Sahel region perceived as weak and could serve as safe haven for terrorism. One item on their agenda is about who sponsors terrorism. Given the global concern about sponsors of terrorism, I do not believe that the actual sponsors are known. This is because America which put a price tag of $7m on Shekau when he was alive would not spare Nigeria, if actually, they believe the Nigerian government knows the sponsors. I, therefore, do not believe sponsors of terrorism are known by the respective countries. If they did, curbing terrorism would not be that difficult.\n\nRead Also: The festering insecurity\n\nThe NDA was attacked by bandits last week, leading to the killing of two officers and the abduction of another. What does this say about the state of the nation\u2019s security?\n\nWhile I share the view that such an attack of NDA should not have happened, it is too early to forget that this is not the first time gunmen have attacked military formations in Nigeria. There have been several attacks of military formations and installations in Borno State. Most were repelled, while few of them were overwhelmed by the insurgents. We even heard claims by insurgents that they downed the jets that crashed recently. If it is true, the insurgents can down our jets, then what happened in NDA is child\u2019s play. So, there is nothing new about the attack of NDA, which is just another military formation. I heard the gunmen were able to get into the officers\u2019 quarters where most of them were not around due to assignments. And the very few who were in the quarter put up a good fight but lost two officers and one was abducted. I, therefore, see the attacks of the NDA as one of the challenges facing the nation\u2019s security and its management for performance.\n\nWhat lesson should the armed forces learn from the attack on NDA, considering that the academy is the nation\u2019s premier university and the alma mater of military officers?\n\nWhat I can say on this issue is that the army should insist on having enough number of trained and well-equipped personnel who are well-motivated to secure the nation without any hindrance. At the moment, the soldiers are overstretched and spread too thin across the country which geopolitical zones are facing different kinds of security challenges needing the attention of the soldiers. I was happy when I read the recently passed supplementary budget was devoted to fighting insecurity.\n\nDo you subscribe to the call by the Katsina State governor that citizens should arm themselves against the bandits?\n\nI share the governor\u2019s concern that because many of the villages are not manned by police and the military personnel which makes the villages to be vulnerable and targets of attacks by gunmen, the villagers have no choice but to defend themselves. But the idea of allowing the citizens of Katsina State free access to firearms runs counter to the presidential directive that all those with firearms like AK47 be shot at sight. I, therefore, do not see the possibility of Governor Masari\u2019s order prevailing over the presidential directive. Furthermore, when one considers what happens in America, where free access to firearms has killed more than 11,500 American lives this year alone, including 150 through mass shooting during this year independent celebrations on July 4, 2021, it is frightening to imagine what will happen in Nigeria, if the citizens are allowed free access to firearms.\n\nBut the governor\u2019s outcry has brought to the fore the need for more trained and well equipped security personnel to man the villages and dominate the forests which harbour the gunmen.\n\nWhat in your opinion is the way out of this quagmire to prevent the Afghan experience?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe way out is to provide enough number of well-trained security personnel who should be well equipped and well-motivated to man the villages and dominate all the forests harbouring the gunmen; more so that the Tucano Jet Bombers have started arriving to help the air force bomb their hideouts in the forests. With the link of SIM cards with National Identity Numbers (NIN), new technology of ICT which has help humanity overcome time and distance should help security agencies track the gunmen. Since fire-power alone cannot put an end to insecurity, gunmen, kidnappers, armed robbery, cattle rustling, ritual killings and cultism, consciously directed efforts should be made to address the underlying causes of insecurity. Happily enough, recent reports that the GDP grew by about five per cent in the first quarter of this year despite the myriad of challenges that include paucity of funds suggest the economic policies of the President Buhari-led administration are beginning to yield positive results.",

          "title": "Open grazing ban: 11 southern states fail to meet deadline, 6 comply",
          "text": "By Sunday Ani and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nAS the September 1 deadline on ban on open grazing ban in Southern Nigeria agreed on by the 17 southern states dawns, no fewer than 12 states have failed to comply.\n\nApart from Abia, Ogun, Oyo, Ekiti and Ebonyi states that have passed the law, others are either in the process or have not begun at all. In fact, five states \u2013 Anambra, Lagos, Imo, Edo and Cross River- have ignored the agreement while Rivers, Delta, Osun, Ondo, Bayelsa, Akwa-Ibom and Enugu, are just in the process of complying.\n\nIt is expected that as from today, it would be unlawful for anybody or group of persons to graze farm animals openly throughout the southern region.\n\nThis development, coupled with the Federal Government\u2019s recent statement that it had disbursed money running into billions of Naira to reactivate the moribund grazing routes totaling over 300 across the country have been generating varied reactions, particularly among the ethnic nationality groups. This is not unexpected as the announcement by the Federal Government has, by extension, ignored the open grazing ban in the south.\n\nThe Ohanaeze Ndigbo has insisted that it would be implemented in the South East because the people do not have any free land for open grazing.\n\n\u201cIn the South East, for instance, everywhere is tied to individuals, deities and even shines; so we don\u2019t have any free land for open grazing. We have made our position clear and I want to believe that all the governors understood this very well,\u201d the national publicity secretary, Alex Ogbonnia, stated.\n\nHe, however, stressed that in a situation where a governor in the zone disagrees with the group, as it is being alleged that the Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodimma, has done, the group would chose the path of dialogue until he understands the implication of what he is doing.\n\n\u201cThe fact that a governor disagrees with us now does not matter until such a time when we have overstretched our patience; if he doesn\u2019t understand, then, it will become a case.\u201d\n\nHe also likened Federal Government\u2019s effort to reactivate the grazing routes to reenacting the slave routes.\n\nOn his part, President of the Middle Belt Form (MBF), Dr. Pogu Bitrus, expects that by today, machinery would have been put in place to enforce the ban and also make provision for ranching.\n\n\u201cWe are only aware of Governor Uzodimma, who is allegedly reneging on the decision to accommodate what the southern people want. But, on the issue of open grazing routes, the constitution is very clear. The president can only control the FCT in terms of land. Land is controlled by the state governors for the people and that is what the constitution says. So, the president cannot, going by the constitution, impose on the state governments grazing routes. He can only negotiate; that is what the law says.\n\n\u201cSo, the issue of grazing routes, to me, is dead on arrival. I am not bothered about that because it is only a state governor who wants to cede his authority and power to the Federal Government that can allow such to happen in his state,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Northern Elders Forum (NEF) reiterated that even as it was not against the ban, the problems associated with open grazing should be treated as a national challenge rather than resorting to threats and ultimatums. It also appealed to all stakeholders to remain calm.\n\nSpokesman of the NEF, Dr. Hakeem Baba Ahmed, warned against the expiration of the deadline being used as an excuse to attack cattle herders or their livestock.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe NEF has made its position very clear. We are not against the stoppage of open grazing. Our position is that the problem can be solved and must be solved as a national problem and it should not involve the kind of threat or ultimatum that we see coming from leaders who should operate at a higher level of responsibility.\u201d\n\nBut Afenifere fears that as desirable as the ban is, it might not be successfully enforced because of the lopsided nature of policing in Nigeria. It, therefore, suggested that the southern states use the regional security outfits to enforce the ban.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, said: \u201cAs desirable as the open grazing law by southern state governments is, the chances of its successful enforcement are slim because of the lopsided nature of the country\u2019s policing system.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that the southern states should establish special police units to enforce the ban.\n\n\u201cIt is worth recalling however that when some states in the north banned the sale and consumption of alcohol in public, they did not rely on the federally controlled Nigeria Police to enforce the law in their respective states. Rather, they set up what they called Hisbah (local police) to enforce the law.\n\n\u201cIn this way, it may not be out of place if the states concerned in the South use such regional security outfits as Amotekun in the South West or Ebubeagu in the South East to get compliance. These local security networks should be allowed to enforce state laws particularly the ban on open grazing just as Hisbah is used in the North to enforce the ban on sale and open consumption of alcohol.

          "text": "From Adetutu Folasade-Koyi and Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has intensified its efforts to reconcile its warring leaders ahead its October 30 national convention.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that the Peace Committee headed by former Senate president, David Mark, met with the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike in Port Harcourt, yesterday.\n\nThe panel is scheduled to meet with the PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, in Abuja.\n\nThe crisis rocking the party assumed a dramatic twist, last Monday, after a Rivers State High Court, in Degema, restrained Secondus from functioning as national chairman pending the determination of the substantive suit.\n\nHowever, last Wednesday, a Kebbi State High Court, in Birnin Kebbi, issued a counter order and directed the embattled PDP chairman to resume his functions, immediately.\n\nNevertheless, a Federal High Court, in Calabar, Cross River State, on Friday, issued a fresh order barring Secondus from presiding over a meeting of the PDP National Executive Committee (NEC) held last Saturday.\n\nIn its immediate response to crisis, the PDP national caucus, last week, set up a peace committee to resolve all the lingering crisis.\n\nA source told Daily Sun that the Mark Committee, which is planning a soft-landing for all the warring parties, wants the gladiators to stop all litigations instituted at various courts across the country. The calculation, it was gathered, is that immediately all the legal encumbrances are removed, it would be easy for the party leaders to reach an amicable resolution of the crisis, possible before its next PDP NEC meeting scheduled for September 9.\n\nIt was also gathered that the inability of the PDP to agree on the composition of its Convention Planning and Zoning Committees, at its last NEC meeting was traceable to the crisis rocking the opposition party.\n\nThe PDP at the end of the NEC meeting, last Saturday, had deferred the consideration of nominations into the two committees to September, 9, by which time, it hoped to broker a truce between the warring parties.\n\nDaily Sun gathered that amidst fears that suits and counter suits by the various camps in the tussle for the control of the PDP structure, ahead of the 2023, may derail the national convention and ultimately affect the opposition party\u2019s preparation for the next general elections, party leaders are making efforts to resolve the issues as soon as possible.\n\nThis is as former national legal adviser, Mark Jacob, has said the party has not zoned its presidential ticket to the North.\n\nJacob, who is also a former attorney general and commissioner of justice in Kaduna State disclosed this when he appeared on Arise TV\u2019s The Morning Show, yesterday.\n\n\u201cNobody has discussed anything on zoning in our party. We have not zoned our party\u2019s presidential ticket to the North. In fact, the feeling among members is that it should be zoned to the Southern part of the country\u201d, he said.\n\nAccording to him, though it\u2019s democracy and every member has the right to their opinion while the party would not take unpopular opinion from any of its members.\n\nDuring its 92nd National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting at the weekend, the party had announced that it would arrive at a zoning formula for the National Working Committee (NWC) at a meeting billed for September 9.\n\nPolitical commentator, Adetayo Balogun warned the PDP against zoning its presidential ticket to the North.\n\nSpeaking with journalists in Abuja, he said discussions about the region to produce the next president has begun and the PDP should not make the mistake of giving the ticket to the North.\n\n\u201cIn searching for the next president, there\u2019s a debated preference for a southerner to emerge.

He said the meeting also approved that every institution was at liberty to admit candidates based on its own minimum score.\n\nIt was however learnt that the decision to allow universities, polytechnics and colleges of education adopt their cut-off marks was reached due to the inability to arrive at a particular figure, as was the case some years ago, where by voice vote, the institutions arrived at a particular figure as cut-off mark for admission.\n\nOloyede who spoke on the coutcome of the meeting said some universities as University of Maiduguri proposed 150 minimum cut-off mark; Usman Dan Fodio University Sokoto, 140; Pan Atlantic University, 210; University of Lagos, 200; Lagos State University, 190; Covenant University, 190 and Bayero University Kano, 180.\n\nHe said those at the meeting resolved to allow the ministry to decide as they could not agree on the December 31, 2021 deadline for public institutions and January 31, 2022, for private institutions.\n\nOloyede said stakeholders also adopted the 2021 admission guidelines, which provided that all applications for part-time or full-time programmes for degree, NCE, OND, and others must be posted only through JAMB. He said candidate\u2019s credentials must be uploaded on Central Admissions Processing System (CAPS) and recommended by the institution, while JAMB approves and the candidate accepts the offer of admission.\n\n\u201cIf any candidate fail to accept an offer, the institution is at liberty to change the candidate after informing JAMB,\u201d he said.\n\nOloyede said that for the 2021/2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), the board is introducing two new subjects, computer studies, and physical and health education, bringing total subjects undertaken in Nigeria to 25.\n\nThe stakeholders also exempted prison inmates, visually impaired and foreign candidates from sitting for post-UTME exercise.\n\nSpeaking on the 2020 admissions, Oloyede said out of the 956,809 admission spaces in 962 higher education institutions in the country, about 600,000 have so far been admitted.\n\nOloyede said private universities in the country were only able to admit 36,381 candidates out of the 120,938 spaces available to them. He said there were many admission spaces that have not been filled up in several courses due to lack of qualified candidates,\n\nDeclaring the policy meeting open, Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, commended JAMB for introducing use of National Identification Number (NIN) in the registration process for UTME.\n\nRepresented by Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Education, Sonny Echono, the minister said the use of NIN drastically reduced examination malpractices in the 2021 UTME, adding that the West African Examination Council (WAEC) will also follow similar path by adopting mandatory use of NIN.\n\nHe expressed concerns that the government\u2019s directive that all admissions should be done through JAMB\u2019s CAPS is being violated.\n\nHe directed JAMB to furnish government with the list of affected institutions for necessary punishments.\n\nGet paid up to N850,000 weekly, step by step guide on how to work from home and get paid in US Dollars.

The formula has become stagnant. It is lopsided, it puts more resources at the centre and less resources for states and local governments. The burden and responsibilities of daily needs are at states and local government levels. The current formula has given the Federal government over 50 per cent while states and Local Governments share less than 40 per cent.\n\n\u201cThis where the people are, this is where the problems are.

          "text": "\u2022Came out tops among evaluated five\n\nObinna Chima\n\nFresh facts have emerged about the process leading to the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) formal engagement of global fintech company, Bitt Inc. as its technical partner for its proposed digital currency, also known as e-Naira.\n\nTHISDAY learnt yesterday that the CBN went through a rigorous vendor selection process in line with the Public Procurement Act, conducted by seven departmental directors and a Deputy Governor whereby 15 companies were evaluated.\n\nThe evaluation was based on the following criteria: technology ownership and control; implementation timeline; efficiency, ease of adoption; support for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT); platform security; interoperability; implementation experience.\n\nAccording to a document seen by THISDAY, from the evaluated 15 companies, Bitt came tops with an average score of 82.3 per cent. The scores for some other bidders were: Bitt- 82.3 per cent; InterStellar \u2013 76.9 per cent; Zimbali- 76.4 per cent; G+D \u2013 76.3 per cent; and EmTech -66.4\n\nIt also revealed that a sandbox evaluation followed the selection process to have a hands on experience with Bitt and G+D being the two companies among the top five who had either gone live or had deployed a pilot.\n\nBitt is a leader in the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) industry, with subject matter experts at the intersection of technology and policy.\n\nThe company deployed its flagship product in regulated, collaborative, multi-stakeholder environments, including a live CBDC in four Caribbean countries, and digital currency deployments in Barbados and Latin America.\n\nTHISDAY findings also revealed that the Bitt DCMS for Eastern Caribbean Central Bank was vetted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\n\nAlso, the deployment in the Caribbean countries was driven by social impact, including financial inclusion, through special features for the unbanked, on/off-ramp through an accessible agency network, and the implementation of zero-cost mobile transactions.\n\nThe systems has patent-pending offline transaction capabilities, and the ability to integrate with other CBDC networks for cross-currency exchange.\n\nOverstock, which has majority stake in the company, is a more than 20 year old publicly traded company (Nasdaq: OSTK) with over $200M invested in blockchain technology related businesses. Pelion Ventures, a 35+ year old VC firm, manages OSTK investments.\n\nIn addition, Bitt was the first company to digitise a national currency on a blockchain, thus creating the first synthetic CBDC, with the support of the Central Bank of Barbados Governor and the Minister of Finance.\n\n\u201cThat system is still in operation today, and is integrated with the largest bill payment processor in the country and both major telcos.\n\n\u201cThe Government of Barbados uses it to collect payments online. mMoney has grown to service thousands of merchants andmany more individuals within Barbados. It is clearly not a closed payment system.\n\n\u201cThe main product, the Digital Currency Management System, licenced to CBN is not a closed payment system. The DCMS provides the Suite of applications for the monetary authority, commercial banks, merchants, and consumers (both, banked and unbanked),\u201d it added.\n\nA separate report also revealed that in March this year, \u2018DCash\u2019, was designed and developed by the international fintech company, Bitt, in partnership with the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and it became the world\u2019s first retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) to be publicly issued within a formal currency union.\n\nThe historic transaction was the climax of over two years of extensive research, consultations, planning, software development, operational training, merchant acquisition, customer service, and marketing achieved through collaboration with the ECCB, Bitt and multiple external stakeholders.\n\nSpeaking at the virtual launch, Bitt\u2019s CEO, Brian Popelka, had said, \u201cCBDCs are truly transforming the way that financial transactions are conducted around the world. This change brings significant benefits especially to emerging economies.\u201d\n\nCBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele had said the CBDC, otherwise known as the e-Naira, would bring about increased cross-border trade, accelerate financial inclusion, and lead to cheaper and faster remittance inflow.\n\nHe had said the digital money would lead to easier targeted social interventions, as well as improvement in monetary policy effectiveness, payment systems efficiency, and tax collection.\n\nCBN\u2019s Director, Corporate Communications Department, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, explained, in a statement, that the e-Naira project had been a long and thorough process for the apex bank following its resolve in 2017 to digitise the local currency after extensive research and exploration.\n\nNwanisobi said CBN\u2019s decision was in line with an unmistakable global trend in which over 85 per cent of central banks were considering adopting digital currencies in their countries.\n\nThe CBN pointed out that the selection of Bitt Inc. from among highly competitive bidders was based on the company\u2019s technical competence, efficiency, platform security, interoperability, and implementation experience.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cIn choosing Bitt Inc. the CBN will rely on the company\u2019s tested and proven digital currency experience, which is already in circulation in several Eastern Caribbean countries.\n\n\u201cBitt Inc. was key to the development and successful launch of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) pilot of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) in April 2021.\u201d\n\nEmefiele had recently hinted that a national digital currency would be launched in October.

          "text": "\u2022Says policy consistency responsible for 5% jump in economic growth in Q2\n\nDeji Elumoye\n\nThe federal government yesterday announced the creation of the Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme aimed at employing, annually, 20,000 graduates, who recently concluded the mandatory one-year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC).\n\nThe job scheme came as government said the 5.01 per cent growth the economy recorded in the second quarter of 2021 was due to the present administration\u2019s policy consistency and innovation.\n\nSpeaking while launching the programme, supported by the United Nations Development Programme and the European Union, at the State House, Abuja, President Muhammadu Buhari said it would also provide opportunity for mentors. He said those who were already engaged in various industries, gained relevant experience, and built capacity over the years would have the opportunity to provide mentorship and support for young Nigerians.\n\nAccording to Buhari, \u201cBeyond the skills and work experience, we will be building a new culture of mentorship and guidance that can chart a new course for skills development and work experience in our country.\n\n\u201cWe believe that as this programme creates new opportunities for 20,000 recent graduates annually, the beneficiaries will use the opportunities presented to them and maximise their 12 months of engagement.\u201d\n\nThe president added that the programme would provide a pathway for young Nigerians to gain work experience in top-tier organisations, gain relevant skills, and build the right networks for the future in various sectors, including information and communications technology, financial services, trade, manufacturing, agriculture, and agro-processing.\n\n\u201cOther sectors include mining, telecommunications, creative industries and technology, education, health, research and development, and public sector institutions,\u201d he stated, adding, \u201cWe believe that building the right skills and experiences across these sectors are important to sustain the economic growth we are experiencing.\u201d\n\nHe said the programme would build on other efforts of the government to support young Nigerians, such as the N75 billion youth fund in the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, which was created to support young Nigerians in business or with business ideas, with N25 billion released annually for three years.\n\nBuhari urged eligible Nigerians to apply for the jubilee programme, and called on the private sector to support the scheme by providing work placement opportunities, mentorship, and funding.\n\n\u201cI would like to say thank you to the United Nations Development Programme and the European Union for their support on this vital initiative. And I hereby declare the program open,\u201d he added.\n\nThe president also explained the growth recorded in the second quarter of 2021, and said it was due to his administration\u2019s consistency in policy and innovation, as well as its focus on job creation.\n\nHe stressed that the economic growth rate was the highest since his government came on board in 2015, and assured that Nigeria\u2019s Jubilee Fellows Programme would further consolidate on the success recorded.\n\nAccording to him, some of the key drivers of economic growth and diversification in the second quarter include telecommunications, transportation, electricity, agriculture, and manufacturing.\n\nBuhari stated, \u201cTuesday, 22nd June, 2021, I set-up the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy (NPRGS) steering committee to coordinate our work to fulfil my promise to lift 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in 10 years.\n\n\u201cThis is building on the positive results from the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan and the targeted response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic with the Economic Sustainability Plan.\n\n\u201cThese efforts have yielded results with Nigeria recording its biggest economic growth in six years with a GDP growth of five per cent in the second quarter of 2021. The sectors that drove this growth are trade, telecommunications, transportation, electricity, agriculture, and manufacturing. Each of these sectors showed significant improvement and, thus, created more jobs for our populace.\u201d\n\nHe also said, \u201cAn important part of our policies and strategies is the focus on employment and creating opportunities for our people. When this government was elected in 2015, we committed to increasing job opportunities for Nigerians and as part of our social investments programme we recruited 500,000 graduates into our N-power programme.\u201d\n\nBuhari noted that in 2019, he had directed that the number of graduates under the programme be increased to one million.\n\nHe said, \u201cThese graduates are recruited to work in agricultural, health and education institutions across the country. The N-power programme also has a non-graduate component that provides skills to tens of thousands of Nigerians in areas, such as technology, masonry, auto repairs, and carpentry.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Mr. Adeniyi Adebayo, said the government remained appreciative of the role of the private sector in transforming economies by creating employment and employment opportunities and investments.\n\nAdebayo disclosed that start-ups, largely driven by young Nigerians, attracted 170 million dollars in the past year, which was the highest on the African continent. He said the Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme was to celebrate the country\u2019s 60th anniversary.\n\nAdebayo noted the role of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo in driving the initiative to fruition and the support of UNDP.\n\nThe Resident Representative of UNDP, Mohammed Yahya, assured that the United Nations would continually support Nigeria to develop human capacity across the country.\n\nYahya said, \u201cEach day, young Nigerians continue to break barriers with their capacity and ingenuity. Young Nigerians have produced outstanding innovations. There is no shortage of talents in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Dangote: Only A Third of NNPC\u2019s Investment in Refinery Will Be Paid in Cash",
          "text": "\u2022 Says it has capacity to meet Nigeria\u2019s entire petrol, diesel, jet fuel needs\n\n\u2022Project will save country scarce forex, says Emefiele\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nAfrica\u2019s richest man and the President of the Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, yesterday disclosed that the 20 per cent equity taken by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in his much-awaited refinery will not be paid in a single cash transaction.\n\nSpeaking during a documentary aired on Arise News Channel, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, the renowned philanthropist noted that while a third of the $2.7 billion deal would be paid in cash, the second would be through crude sales and the third would be through profits made by the corporation.\n\nHe noted that there\u2019s a lot of misconceptions around the planned 20 per cent equity holding by the national oil company, explaining that the deal also involves all the products to be churned out by the $19 billion facility, including petrochemicals.\n\nRevealing that he got the inspiration to build the refinery from India, given what he described as the painful situation whereby Nigeria, a country of over 200 million people importing all petroleum products needed for consumption.\n\nHe pointed out that the project currently employs 29,000 Nigerians and 11, 000 foreigners with plans to ramp up the number to 57,000 in the coming months.\n\nThe 650,000 barrels per day refinery, located in Lagos is expected to start operation in the first half of next year, with the NNPC in the process of buying 20 per cent of the refinery.\n\nStressing that the refinery is capable of meeting the country\u2019s entire petrol, diesel and jet fuel needs, Dangote posited that as it stands, the country expends about 25 per cent of all its import bills on bringing in petrol products into the country.\n\nThe businessmen lamented that Nigeria lost between $50 billion to $60 in investments to the delayed passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), but explained that with the recent presidential assent, investors who had been sitting on the fence are now expected to move into the country.\n\n\u201cSo, these are the things that people don\u2019t really understand and I want to really clarify it. When they talk about the $2.7 billion, you know, they (NNPC) are paying one third of the money.\n\n\u201cAnother one third of the money, again, will actually be paid through supply of crude, with the deduction of maximum of about $2 and some cents. And then the one third of it, which is another $850 to $900 million will be paid from the profit they are going to make from the business.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s not a cash transaction where they are paying all cash. You can see that if we don\u2019t have confidence in what we are doing, we would have asked them to pay all cash,\u201d he stated.\n\nDangote mentioned that one of the benefits of the refinery to Nigeria would be to stabilise the country\u2019s currency, because as of today, about 25 per cent of the country\u2019s foreign exchange goes to importation of petroleum products.\n\nHe noted that if the country was to spend $8 billion to $9 billion for imports, for instance, that money would be saved because the refinery has the full capacity to meet every energy need of the country, whether petrol, diesel or aviation fuel, with a lot left to export, thereby generating a lot of foreign exchange for the country.\n\n\u201cSo you can see the difference, even our own balance of trade will change, it will strengthen also the naira because we\u2019re not going to have this massive avalanche of dollars going out for importing finished products of our own raw material.\n\n\u201cThis refinery that we built is very important and is going to help transform not only the oil sector in Nigeria, no, it will transform the entire economy of Nigeria, it will put millions of people directly or indirectly at work.\n\n\u201cThis will massively transform the economy and by transforming the economy, government will have more money to devote in terms of education, in terms of health and in terms of infrastructure,\u201d he opined.\n\nDangote added: \u201cIt makes me feel terrible to see a country as big as Nigeria, as resourceful as Nigeria and with this sort of population that we have 200 million plus, we\u2019re importing all our petroleum products. I mean, it is very painful.\n\n\u201cSo with that, I thought in my mind, and I said that somebody has to address this issue. We tried before, in 2007 like what I said earlier on, but the government of that day changed their minds, and then we jettisoned the idea and returned them.\n\n\u201cBut right now, we came back with the support of the government to make sure that yes, we help in addressing this issue of not only Nigeria. Because I\u2019m a Nigerian and I\u2019ve benefited quite a lot from Nigeria and if there are issues to be sorted out, I should be one of those who will bring solutions to our national problems.\u201d\n\nAccording to Dangote, the refinery project remains the biggest in Africa today and one of the biggest in the world, adding that a lot of Nigerians were getting massive training as a way to build in-country capacity.\n\nWith the expected operationalisation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), Dangote expressed confidence that investors would be attracted to the country, because before now, there was no incentive.\n\n\u201cBefore, there was no clarity, people were not really very ready and willing to put in their money. If you look at it, in the last couple of years, there has not been investment. We have lost more than $50 billion to $60 billion worth of investment,\u201d he noted.\n\nOn reasons for accepting NNPC\u2019s 20 per cent equity, he explained that it wasn\u2019t possible for the government to sit back when a massive project like the refinery is ongoing because of the need for energy security, assuring that in three or maximum four years, NNPC will recoup its investment.\n\n\u201cPeople keep talking about the refinery, they didn\u2019t buy only the refinery, they bought refinery with petrochemicals. I could have actually decided to do like some of my my mates here in Nigeria and just keep my money in the bank or keep the money abroad.\n\n\u201cBut you know I\u2019m very, very passionate about Nigeria and making Nigeria great. If it\u2019s just Dangote group making money, I would have just kept that money and participate in capital markets abroad where my money is in dollars and I am making money, but no.\n\n\u201cWe know as a country we have challenges, how do we address these issues. The only way for me is not to sit and be criticising, no, I should be part of the problem solvers and part of the change. My prayer is that I will give most of my wealth when I am alive,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Mr. Godwin Emefiele, who spoke in the documentary explained that with the coming of the refinery, Nigeria would save a lot of its foreign exchange that\u2019s currently being used in importing refined products.\n\nHe said: \u201cOrdinarily, setting up a 650, 000 barrels per day refinery, is usually a project that is set up by sovereign countries, not by individuals, no matter how big you are, no matter how big the company is.\n\n\u201cOur own selfish interest is that this will help to achieve our import substitution objectives and on this, you\u2019re talking about goods that are currently being imported into the country with scarce foreign exchange, that we will now begin to produce them locally, thereby saving foreign exchange that the central bank would have spent importing or funding the importation of these items.\n\n\u201cAt every opportunity that I have visited that project site, I get encouraged and I seize the opportunity of those visits to encourage even other Nigerians or other businesses, whether local or foreign, that Nigeria has a lot of potential and as long as people can contemplate this kind of projects, they will receive the needed support from the CBN for the importation of plants and equipment.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "How customer loyalty is helping Nigerian fintech apps through regulatory crackdown",
          "text": "On August 17, a court in Abuja granted an order to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to freeze bank accounts belonging to four startups, which allow Nigerians to invest in foreign securities, for 180 days.\n\nThe crackdown by the apex bank could result in severe unintended casualties for the companies; but above all, it puts at risk what is arguably their most valuable asset \u2014 customers\u2019 trust.\n\nThe global finance industry is built on the foundation of trust. And in Nigeria, where more than 80 million citizens live below the poverty line, trust is even more paramount. Most Nigerians are likely to be skeptical about storing their hard-earned Naira with a digital-only company for extended periods.\n\nAnd the fintech platforms affected by CBN\u2019s move \u2014 Trove, Risevest, Bamboo, and Chaka \u2014 know this.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nBeyond offering financial products with attractive investment returns, the startups have invested in building a customer trust and loyalty bank. This has mostly been through providing consistent financial literacy and transparent communication over the years, primarily via emails and Telegram channels.\n\nEach of the fintech firms has thousands of members in its respective Telegram community \u2014 Risevest (+12,000), Chaka (+5,000), and Trove (+3,000) \u2014 where inquiries and queries are responded to in real-time with opportunities to further educate their users.\n\nNews of the embargo on their bank accounts would ordinarily have sparked a frenzy among customers and it did for a moment. Some users took to social media to express their shock and others made moves to withdraw their funds, exhibiting a natural human instinct to fight or take flight when faced with a crisis or an unexpected situation.\n\nBut the majority of users have held on, helped by their trust in the companies, which quickly communicated the suspension to customers while assuring them their funds were safe.\n\n\u201cI got an email from Risevest before I even read in the news that their accounts were barred. So I was already calm knowing that my money was safe,\u201d Motunrayo Koyejo, a software engineer and Rise Vest user, told TechCabal. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have this much confidence if I didn\u2019t get that email.\u201d\n\nRise Vest\u2019s email to users after the suspension.\n\nWhile the suspension affected four retail trading apps, there is a tendency that such clampdown can result in contagion; a situation where a crisis affecting some companies spreads to other players in the industry.\n\nStephanie Osaji, who uses Cowrywise for savings said after seeing news of the court order, she was \u201cscared, thought about my funds and was wondering what would happen to my money\u201d if the platform suddenly shut down.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I considered withdrawing my money. I remember logging into the app and checking when my next due date for withdrawal was,\u201d Osaji said. \u201cBut then I just told myself that they would figure it out. I mean Nigerian startups almost always have a way of figuring things out.\u201d\n\nAnother Cowrywise user, Mosopefoluwa Okeowo, told TechCabal she thinks fintech startups will always find a solution. \u201cI honestly believe in them totally.\u201d\n\nThis sort of consumer confidence is one that takes years to build. Communicating with customers and stakeholders at the very early stages of a mishap is crucial to reassuring their confidence.\n\nSe the money I have in risevest yh, even if it will go like that we go die there. Thats how much I believe in Eke \u2014 Sani Yusuf (@saniyusuf) August 17, 2021\n\nSem. Sem. Started investing with Eke so long ago. Before he even started coming this way and we had never met until years later.\n\n\n\nRise will survive. https://t.co/a42wEDeVAW \u2014 Gossy (@gossyomega) August 23, 2021\n\nNigerians embracing investment-tech amid economic uncertainty\n\nAfrica\u2019s bustling fintech ecosystem has been increasingly defined by payments specialists and digital banks.\n\nBut a crop of wealth management startups has emerged in recent years, the majority helping Nigerians invest in foreign stocks and assets easier than ever before.\n\nInvesting in reliable financial assets appeals to many millennials in the country who are keen on hedging their future wealth against the unstable Naira, amid broader economic uncertainty.\n\nWith \u20a61,000 (around $2), anyone with a smartphone and internet can register on Chaka and browse through over 11,000 shares publicly listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and stock exchanges in the U.S.\n\nSavings and investment apps also boast superior returns on deposits. Compared to less than 5% interest rates on fixed deposits offered by Nigerian banks, Rise Vest offers a guaranteed 10% annual return on its fixed-income offering.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s safer to save money with banks but one gets little or nothing in return,\u201d Koyejo said. \u201cThat\u2019s not an option in this economy. I\u2019d rather keep my money and invest with Rise Vest.

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStartup investing in Africa has come a long way, and this is partly due to the work that angel investors do in helping startups take off. As their name suggests, angel investors are individuals who provide early-stage financing for startups that helps them get their business off the ground and hopefully attract bigger investments.\n\nBecause they invest at the very early stages of a startup\u2019s life, the chances of failure are really high, yet without the money they invest, many startups may never get started.\n\nFor today\u2019s instalment in the Angels and VC series, Techpoint Africa spoke to Biola Alabi, an angel investor and the founder of Biola Alabi Media, a company that produces film and television content. If you\u2019ve watched Nollywood movies such as Lara and the Beat, Banana Island Ghosts, and Bukas and Joints, then you have her company to thank for it.\n\nCan you give us a brief history of your professional experience?\n\nMy career has seen me work in different industries. I started out working in the automotive sector before moving to startups and then media. Working in the media was actually what led to me returning to Africa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I started working in Africa, I became more obsessed with impact. So for me, if I was going to leave the US to return to Africa, anything I did had to be impactful.\n\nThere was no point in being here if I was not going to make an impact. Currently, I run a strategic and advisory company that also produces film and television content.\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nFor me, it was really about investing in people. There were people with good ideas who often asked me to invest, but I always thought of formalising the process.\n\nThe founder of Big Cabal Media reached out to me on Twitter for a meeting, during which he told me about what they wanted to do and where they planned to go with the business.\n\nAt that time, I was a subscriber to TechCabal\u2018s newsletter. Having been a part of a tech ecosystem, I knew that reporting on ecosystems was important for building one.\n\nI was really interested in what they were doing and the fact that they were going to be Pan-African, so I wrote a cheque for them. I believe I was one of the first people who did that, and that sort of started my journey.\n\nOnce again, it was always about what the company was doing, if they were solving a pain point or creating jobs for young people on the continent and Nigeria. These were all things that were important to me. After Big Cabal Media, I started looking at tech companies to learn more about the tech ecosystem here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiola Alabi. Source: Supplied\n\nI visited CcHUB and got involved with Lagos Angel Network (LAN) because I also wanted to learn more about angel investing from an educational perspective, and LAN was a great place to do that. There\u2019s so much around angel investing. It\u2019s not just about writing a cheque; it\u2019s also about rolling up your sleeves and helping the entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a lot of learning to do, and I think I learnt a lot from my first investments.\n\nYou\u2019ve mentioned impact, but what else motivates you?\n\nWell, angel investing is literally about people; it\u2019s about investing in people who have a good idea. So part of how I see my role as an angel investor is in terms of how I can help the company grow and the value I can bring to them.\n\nSometimes there are companies where you don\u2019t have the opportunity to roll up your sleeves and get involved. I\u2019ve made some of these investments and found that I don\u2019t enjoy them as much as companies where I\u2019m helping out.\n\nAt the end of the day, we\u2019re angel investors and not executives, but if we can help the executives in the company strategise, think differently, and open our network to them, I believe that\u2019s when we\u2019re adding real value.\n\nThroughout my career, I\u2019ve worked in roles that have required me to add value to companies from a strategic perspective to grow portfolios within companies. These are things in my wheelhouse, so I\u2019m very excited if I can bring them to a startup.\n\nI\u2019m also excited when we can build corporate governance into their systems. As early-stage startups, they need to start to think very early about how to ensure that the business is structured correctly. Hence, structuring businesses is something I enjoy doing too.\n\nAngel investing is really about making a change. Of course, long term, hopefully, we make some profit, but that\u2019s not what drives me. While angel investing is part of my investment portfolio, it is not a core part. I only invest money that I don\u2019t mind losing, and we need more people to invest in early-stage startups on the continent.\n\nAre there specific industries that you\u2019re interested in, and why?\n\nThere are things that I\u2019m interested in, but sometimes, that\u2019s also not what drives my investments. For some, it could be that the market is not large enough or that I don\u2019t think the solution is something that we need right now. I\u2019m interested in the health sector, but sometimes I see businesses and don\u2019t invest in them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiola Alabi. Source: Supplied\n\nSometimes it\u2019s the leadership because I believe that you need a great team to grow and scale a company. They don\u2019t necessarily need to have all the right answers, but I really have to believe in the team.\n\nFor some businesses, it\u2019s just about how passionate I am about the solution. I might not necessarily know the big picture, and they might have to pivot a few times in their journey, but the fact that they were thinking about solving a very difficult problem can sometimes motivate me to write a cheque.\n\nI am very decisive because I\u2019ve learnt that the sooner you can decide as an investor, the better for you so that you don\u2019t waste your time or the entrepreneur\u2019s.\n\nI\u2019m very interested in health and education; in the past, I\u2019ve worked with a company committed to using media to educate.\n\nI\u2019m currently working with an edutech company, and they\u2019re building some really cool and exciting stuff. Anything that saves or preserves life, can move our health system forward, or eliminate a lot of the friction that exists in our financial system is interesting to me.\n\nAre you like most angel investors who invest at the early stage?\n\nAngel investing is really early stage. We come in very early so that you can go out and prove to bigger investors that you have a product people are willing to pay for. Sometimes we come in at the idea stage, especially if you\u2019re a first-time founder, but that\u2019s rare. Most, if not all, investments I\u2019ve done have been in companies with at least a minimum viable product (MVP).\n\nBy your standards, what shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI think one of the things a startup should not be doing is hide its challenges from investors. So startups usually have challenges, and a lot of the time, they only give you the good news.\n\nI try to advise startups to show the good, the bad, and the ugly sides of their business. They should be able to ask for help when they need it, so startups need to be as transparent as possible.\n\nEven if things are going badly, you should not ghost your investors. Keep them informed because it\u2019s a very small community and word travels very quickly.\n\nIf you\u2019re a founder, you never know when an investor is capable of helping you. Also, when making demands from investors, be very clear. Angel investors are busy, but they want to help, so make it easier for them to do that by being specific.\n\nWhat\u2019s your average ticket size for a company?\n\nThe cheques vary in size depending on where the entrepreneur is in their journey and where I think the company is. I\u2019ve written cheques for $5,000 all the way to $25,000. Currently, I\u2019m going out of my comfort zone and writing larger cheques.\n\nWhat companies do you have in your portfolio?\n\nChekkit, Big Cabal Media, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Trove, and a few others, which I won\u2019t disclose.\n\nHave you had any bad investments so far?\n\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d call them bad investments, but there\u2019ve been a few that haven\u2019t worked out. The company just wasn\u2019t the right company at the right time, and with those companies, you take it on the chin and move on. For some of these companies, I\u2019ve stayed in touch with the founders and have explored investing in new projects that they are working on.\n\nWhat are some of your significant wins?\n\nOne of the most notable stories for us has been Big Cabal Media and the transition from the founder who was also the CEO to a new CEO. So the founders wanted to move on to something else and had to be replaced. I\u2019m the chairwoman of the board, and that phase needed to be handled well.\n\nSuccession planning was not something we thought about before then, but it\u2019s something I now encourage founders to consider. You never know if you want to move on to something else or if you are the right fit for the stage at which the company is. Being able to pull it off successfully is something that I\u2019m incredibly proud of.\n\nAre there opportunities that you regret passing on?\n\nI\u2019m not sure I regret the opportunities I\u2019ve passed on because I try to learn from them. I\u2019m an angel investor, and that means I invest my money. I have a budget that I work with, and sometimes I pass on some deals because my budget does not cover them. One of the things that you must have as an angel investor is discipline so that you don\u2019t get burnt out.\n\nOccasionally, I go over my budget, but I try not to overstretch myself.

Product Manager, Marketplace, Kudi\n\nA few days ago, I saw a tweet asking how people described their job to older family members. For a lot of people, especially in the tech industry, that\u2019s a tough ask. In Nigeria, for example, only a decade ago, it was unheard of to be a product manager. You were either a lawyer, doctor, engineer, accountant, or a failure.\n\nFor Nifemi Akinwamide, Product Manager, Marketplace, Kudi, the decision to study metallurgical and materials engineering at the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA) had more to do with his desire to satisfy his parents than any interest in the course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn intervention from his guardian a few years after he got into school helped put him on his current path. Making the switch to study project management meant he could use his strengths adequately.\n\nIn this interview with our Senior Reporter, Oluwanifemi, he shares some of the lessons he has learnt on his journey.

Source: Supplied\n\nPan-African VC firm, LoftyInc Capital, has announced a $10 million fund for African entrepreneurs. The fund, its third, has limited partners like FBNQuest Funds, high-net-worth individuals from Facebook, Google, and Exxon Mobil, syndicates from the Green Investment Club, and Andela CEO, Jeremy Johnson.\n\nSince launching in 2012, the firm has invested in over 50 startups, including Nigerian fintech unicorn, Flutterwave, Andela, Akiba Digital, and TechAdvance. With the launch of this fund, LoftyInc wants to take big bets on startups outside Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt.\n\nA month ago, we spoke to Idris Bello, Managing Partner at LoftyInc, and he shared some insights into the firm\u2019s investment philosophy. You can read all about it here.\n\nIn a chat with TechCrunch, Bello revealed that the firm\u2019s successful exit from Flutterwave catalysed launching its third fund. With his experience investing in African startups, one may argue that a $10 million fund is small. However, he does not appear to be in a hurry, preferring instead to grow gradually.\n\nPointing out that a good number of the limited partners in the third fund hold C-level positions in multinationals, he argued that delivering good returns would pave the way for onboarding the institutions where they work.\n\nWhile African startups have continued to receive more money from investors, a significant portion of these funds comes from foreign investors. However, there is an increasing number of local investors willing to bet on African startups. As more successes are recorded, more local investors would be open to investing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCBN reveals who will design the eNaira\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe eNaira will launch on the 1st of October, 2021\n\nIn line with its plans to pilot a digital currency, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has revealed its choice of Bitt Inc as the technical partner for developing the eNaira.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, August 30, 2021, Godwin Emefiele, CBN Governor, listed the benefits of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to include accelerated financial inclusion, increased cross-border trade, payment systems efficiency and cheaper and faster remittances.\n\nExplaining the choice of Bitt Inc, Osita Nwanisobi, CBN spokesperson, said, \u201cThe CBN will rely on the company\u2019s tested and proven digital currency experience which is already in circulation in several Eastern Caribbean countries.\u201d\n\nBarbados-based Bitt Inc is a fintech company with some experience developing CBDCs, having developed DCash for the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank in April.\n\nIn February 2021, CBN prohibited commercial banks from providing financial services to cryptocurrency exchanges. However, in an interesting turn of events, the apex bank announced in July that the pilot scheme of a digital currency for the country would begin in October.\n\nAs cryptocurrency has gained widespread acceptance among many individuals, most governments have unanimously objected to its legitimacy. This could be because, unlike legal tender, cryptocurrencies are not controlled by any individual.\n\nHowever, in what seems to be a case of \u201cif you can\u2019t beat them, join them,\u201d apex banks globally are making plans for their own digital currencies. In Africa, for example, Ghana, Morocco, Tunisia, Kenya, and Madagascar are some of the countries looking into the creation of digital currencies.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading\n\nWhy Intelligent Minds Like Jeff Bezos Embrace the \u2018Rule of Writing.\u2019 Read.\n\nWhy You Need to Protect Your Sense of Wonder \u2014 Especially Now.

          "text": "The Lagos State government is insisting on collecting Value Added Tax (VAT) following the ruling of the Federal High Court in Port Harcourt that collection of VAT falls within the jurisdiction of state governments.\n\nWith an estimated population of about 22 million people and huge consumption expenditure, Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s economic hub, accounts for about 55 percent of Nigeria\u2019s total VAT. This puts it way above several other states with the FCT, Abuja, coming second with about 20 percent; Rivers, 6 percent, and Kano, 5 percent.\n\nThe Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, and presided over by Justice Stephen Pam, on August 9, restrained the FIRS from collecting VAT and personal income tax (PIT), saying, \u201c the law does not back FIRS authority above state governments in the collection of VAT and PIT.\u201d\n\nThe FIRS has appealed the ruling and advised the public to maintain a status-quo on the payment of the taxes. But the Lagos government says appeal does not equate to a stay of execution on the court\u2019s ruling, which means states have the right to act on the court\u2019s ruling to collect the specified taxes.\n\nGbenga Omotosho, Lagos commissioner for information and strategy, says the FIRS\u2019 appealing the case at the Appeal Court does not translate to a stay of execution, the state is legally backed to collect the tax.\n\n\u201cAn appeal is not a stay of execution. For us in Lagos, our position is that we have the backing of the law to demand and collect VAT. The court has ruled and we are following the judgment.\n\nRead also: Lagos DMO to secure fresh N185bn bond to fund projects\n\n\u201cAs a state, we believe the development is good for progress and true federalism that we have been clamouring for,\u201d Omotosho states.\n\nThe state\u2019s position is corroborated by Osa Director, a legal practitioner, who says VAT falls within the jurisdiction of state governments as ruled by the court.\n\nLagos has the backing of the law to collect VAT following the landmark ruling by the Port Harcourt Federal High Court, which paved the way for state governments to begin the collection of VAT and PIT in their respective states, Director confirms a phone interview.\n\nMuhammed Nami, executive chairman, FIRS, had in a letter dated August 24 and addressed to Moyosore Onigbanjo, the attorney-general and commissioner for justice in Lagos State, said the FIRS would continue collecting VAT from businesses in the state.\n\nThis came after the Lagos State government had directed the FIRS to stop issuing demand notices for payment of VAT in the state and to render accounts within seven days of all sums collected as VAT in the current accounting circle in the state.\n\nIn the letter addressed to the Lagos commissioner, Nami said since the Rivers court decision had been appealed \u201cthe law does not allow a party to a suit to carry out an action to forestall the decision of the appellate court once an appeal has been entered.\u201d\n\nHe said there were contrary rulings by similar courts on the same matter.\n\nRead Also: States expected to win, lose if VAT sharing formula changes\n\nThe FIRS further noted that parties must maintain the status quo until the decision of the appeal court.\n\n\u201cThe instant judgment of the Federal High Court, Rivers State, is in conflict with the extant judgment of the Federal High Court, Kogi State, on the same subject matter i.e. the validity of VAT Act as administered by the Service,\u201d the letter read..\n\n\u201cThe conflict created by the later judgment can only be resolved by the appellate court; and the right of the appellate court in this wise should not be compromised.\n\n\u201cIn view of the foregoing, parties have to maintain the status quo ante (i.e. their positions before the instant judgment of the Federal High Court, Rivers State).\n\n\u201cThe FIRS shall continue to collect VAT and administer the VAT Act until the final resolution of the legal dispute by the relevant appellate court.\u201d\n\nHowever, some legal minds have faulted the insistence of the FIRS to continue demanding and collecting VAT in spite of a subsisting ruling by a competent court of jurisdiction stopping it from doing so.\n\nBut Osa Director insists that the FIRS could risk contempt of court if it continues to insist on the collection before a pronouncement on the matter by an appellate court.\n\nAlso, Yomi Farounbi, former chairman, Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Ikeja branch, says the FIRS will be running foul of the law to continue to insist on the collection of VAT while the Federal High Court subsists.\n\nAccording to Farounbi, Lagos, or any other state of the federation, is now backed by the ruling to demand and collect VAT until the pronouncement is vacated by an appellate court. \u201cSo, whatever letter FIRS is writing to claim it can still collect while the ruling subsists is of no effect, unless they apply for a stay of execution,\u201d Farounbi .",

          "title": "Yemi Kale, a dogged reformer who changed Nigeria\u2019s data system",
          "text": "It wasn\u2019t by sheer luck or mere coincidence that Yemi Kale, Nigeria\u2019s immediate past Statistician General of the Federation and CEO, National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) emerged a serial winner of the prestigious BusinessDay\u2019s Excellence in Public Service Awards.\n\nIn those three straight years that he got recognized, the reasons presented by the BusinessDay Awards Committee for his nominations and eventual wins were clear and consistent \u2013 excellence, commitment, professionalism, consistence, objectivity.\n\nAfter a ten-year, two-term meritorious service, Kale bowed out last week Thursday as the Statistician General of the Federation and Chief Executive Officer at the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and was replaced by Simon Harry, who until his appointment, was the Director, Corporate Planning and Technical Coordination Department at the data agency. He finally handed over to the new helmsman at quite an emotional event on Tuesday in Abuja.\n\nWhile at the NBS, Kale, 46, did not just deliver visionary leadership but saw through prolific reforms. Those reforms restored confidence in the entire data process, and delivered brand value to the NBS as a producer of reliable, quality and timely statistics for both national and international use. The reforms also elevated the Office of the Statistician \u2013 General in a way that it is now highly admired and aspired by many.\n\nThe Statistics Act of 2007 gives NBS, the core responsibility of developing, managing and providing official statistics on a wide range of economic, social, population and environmental matters. The NBS also has a role to coordinate the statistical operations of official bodies and liaise with international organisations.\n\nBut up till 2011, the agency was unable to deliver expectations, particularly in terms of reliability, timeliness and believability of data/outcomes.\n\nAssuming office at just age 36 as the head of that important data agency, Kale saw the huge work ahead and was clearly determined to tackle them. And he did deliver!\n\nHe introduced bold reforms in the country\u2019s data system. Today, Nigeria has one of the most robust data systems at least in the region, a sharp contrast to pre-2011 when the country\u2019s data process and output was thin and could not be trusted.\n\nToday, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) is easily one of the most recognized and quoted data sources regarding Nigeria by local and international analysts, market operators, economists, journalists and development agencies including international bodies like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, Development Finance Institutions as well as public service officials.\n\nWith Kale on the saddle, Nigeria\u2019s quality of data was significantly enhanced through the introduction of Computer Assisted Personal Interviewers (CAPI) \u2013 a modern technology for field data collection, gradually departing from the use of paper questionnaire. He also introduced a call center which also eased data collection.\n\nOver the years, the NBS carried out a series of methodology reviews to boost data quality. Some of the methodology improvements include the rebasing of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the revision of the methodology for computing labour force and unemployment estimates, amongst others. The CPI rebasing in 2013, particularly showed how Nigerians\u2019 consumption pattern had changed, moving slightly away from just food to things like luxury, education, health.\n\nIn the area of data dissemination, Kale successfully upgraded the NBS website and introduced several features like an App, the data portal and the data release calendar tool, both of which are the first for any African Statistical Office. For the first time, NBS data now has time-lines and users now know when to expect data. Official statistics is also now disseminated via social media to reach a wider audience and users, a sharp deviation from the past.\n\nHe also introduced the use of infographics to make data easily understandable by the users. The timeliness, quantity and quality of data was greatly enhanced and data credibility improved significantly.\n\nBefore now, critical statistics like the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Inflation and Unemployment, poverty rates, trade, Internally Generated Revenues, FAAC allocations were most times unavailable, stale, and unreliable. Where available, such data were often challenged, and contradicted by those from other ministries and agencies of government even on the same subjects.\n\nToday, data produced by the NBS are eagerly anticipated, used, debated and appreciated.\n\nThe number of statistical reports produced and disseminated by NBS, a one -time poorly rated agency significantly jumped to an average of over 200 annually from hardly 32. The agency now records over 1.2 million downloads of reports annually as against just 100,000 in 2011. Visits to the website also increased substantially to 12million views from less that 1million previously. Ironically the feat was despite poor funding from government.\n\nKale saw through the tedious rebasing of Nigeria\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2014, which confirmed Nigeria as the Africa\u2019s largest economy. That exercise also saw Nigeria move closer to attaining its vision of becoming one of the twenty largest economy, popularly tagged \u201cVision 2020.\u201d\n\nThe exercise exposed how critical sectors like telecommunications, banking, entertainment and others had grown without being captured, despite the huge potential they carry. It also showed the meagre contribution of oil and taxes to GDP, and how government could leverage on that to diversify the economy.\n\nBusinessDay recalls that following surprises thrown up by the process, the BBC, like many others wondered why it took Nigeria some 24 years to rebase its economy. Their finding was simply that \u201cNigeria has a new Statistician-General, Yemi Kale, who seems to be very keen on beefing up the National Statistics.\u201d\n\nKale-led NBS unveiled an Enhanced General Data Dissemination System (e-GDDS) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which would help Nigeria attract the much needed Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) into the country.\n\nRead Also: How Nigeria can achieve sustainable development \u2013 Kale\n\nThe e-GDDS is the data standards initiatives by the IMF which aims at enhancing member countries\u2019 data transparency and promoting development of sound statistical systems The page particularly serves as a one-stop publication vehicle for essential macroeconomic data.\n\nThe IMF has repeatedly commended improvements in national statistics in its Article IV reports.\n\nKale\u2019s tenure witnessed the highest ever rating for statistical achievement in Nigeria\u2019s history as also measured by the World Bank.\n\nFollowing progress in recent years, the NBS is now recognised and earned seats on various Presidential committees, Boards of International Statistical Bodies such as the Partnership for Statistics in the 21st Century (PARIS 21) as well as nominated as vice chair of the African Committee of Statistician Generals in 2014.\n\nIn recognition of the improvement in Nigerian statistics, Kale was invited to the prestigious Chatham House, London in 2014 to give a lecture. It was the first time in Nigeria\u2019s history that an NBS CEO or any head of a government agency at such level would be invited to deliver a lecture at the Chatham House.\n\nHis profile, pedigree, and personal principles were evident drivers that made things happen.\n\nKale is highly rated for his fierce refusal to tamper with data outcomes even when they did not suit expectations of political actors, despite political pressures and poor funding.\n\nIn August 2016, he released figures indicating that Nigeria\u2019s economy had jumped into a recession, the first in 25 years.\n\nDespite wide accolades, his stance on objectivity, quite often, earned him disaffection from local authorities.\n\nReuben Abati, media aide to the past President Jonathan confirmed this in a recent interview. According to him, \u201cKale helped to reform the process of recording data in Nigeria, and he was very independent, very honest, and infact quite confident about how he went went about his chores.\u201d\n\n\u201c I worked in the Nigerian Presidency as Special Adviser to the President on media. Sometimes, some of those documents come to me first and I recall one year when he brought this report about the state of Statistics in the different sectors of the economy and he was very critical of the government.\n\n\u201cThat report was literarily putting government down and after reviewing it, I went to the president and said, sir, you have to sack this man. He is your appointee, why is he so negative about this administration? But President Jonathan said no, leave him alone, he\u2019s doing his job, let\u2019s rather look at the data and see what we can do with it.\n\nAbati believes that \u201cit was same kind of integrity, independent-mindedness that got him reappointed in 2016 by Present Buhari.\n\n\u201cYemi Kale was very consistent, and it is good that he has had a very good run,\u201d he noted.\n\nKale holds a B.Sc. in Economics (First class honours) from Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia, as well as M.Sc. (with distinction) and Ph.D. in Economics from the London School of Economics and Political Science. An alumnus of the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Kale worked as an equity analyst at Goldman Sachs and, for several years, as a quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch Financial Services.\n\nAfter that, he became Group Head, Research and Investment Strategy at Investment Banking and Trust Company Plc. (now Stanbic IBTC Bank plc) where he was credited for developing and deepening investment research in Nigeria, earning him the 2009 African Investor award for African Research Analyst of the year.\n\nLater, he became a Special Adviser to then Minister of Finance Shamsudeen Usman and later his Technical Adviser as the Minister of National Planning.\n\nIn 2011, Kale was appointed the SG/CEO National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and, in 2016, became the first NBS chief executive to be reappointed for a second term by President Buhari.\n\nKale was awarded the National Productivity Order of Merit for \u201coutstanding performance, professionalism and diligence\u201d in February 2017 by President Buhari.\n\nIn a chat with BusinessDay, Kale said balancing professionalism and integrity with political pressure was key for him. Commitment to his oath of office, and adopting the mission and vision of the NBS as his personal goals were key drivers of his successful tenure.\n\n\u201cThe public perception of Nigeria\u2019s official statistics has greatly improved. This has not come easy, as you know, Nigerians are very critical and readily suspicious of government pronouncements,\u201d Kale told BusinessDay.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, Trust is the most important currency for a statistical office. It wouldn\u2019t matter the variety and number of data releases if the users don\u2019t trust what is being produced.\n\n\u201cFortunately, NBS has been able to earn and retain public trust. We must never take this for granted, and must continually justify why the public should continue to trust our data products,\u201d he adds.\n\nKale hopes that the new SG/CEO will be able to build on the systems and procedures already built in the past decade.\n\nA serial award winner, Kale has received incredible accolades since the announcement of his exit from office.\n\nAbati thinks \u201che really deserves congratulations, and in fact, a presidential letter of commendation in terms of how he conducted himself in that office.\u201d\n\nBismark Rewane, CEO of Financial Derivatives, admitted that Kale\u2019s appointment, in 2011 was greeted with high level of skepticism but that he had succeeded in transforming the \u201claggard\u201d agency into a \u201ccutting edge and reliable data source\u201d.\n\nFor Obadiah Mailafia, Kale\u2019s biggest achievement was that he institutionalized the consistent release of data from NBS.\n\nTope Kolade Fasua, a renowned economist, and CEO of Global Analytics Consulting Limited said Kale gave his job \u201ca good shot.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of what he did, Nigerians take statistics more serious now. He was able to get the NBS to a good place.\u201d\n\nSocial media users have also commended Kale for what they see as a \u201cjob well done\u201d\n\nIn a voice note, one Obiesike who said he has never met or spoken with Kale, stated: \u201cI just wanted to say congratulations on your tenure, on the reform, getting everything you did, done. Really I don\u2019t think we actually met, but I\u2019ve been a fan just watching the way you\u2019ve managed public life and focused on getting the job done. I wish you the best in the future, hope that all you plans come to fruition and congratulations on escaping public life with your reputation intact which I think is almost impossible in Nigeria in 2021, and that\u2019s really something special. Well done!\n\nAnother Twitter user- @ChubaEzeks wrote \u201cNigerians owe so much gratitude to @sgyemikale for the brilliant work he did at @nigerianstat. In a low trust society (especially around data and the government), he transformed the brand of the NBS and made the institution trustworthy. Impressive stuff.\n\nToyan Adeniyi-Adele who also commented through his Twitter handle @adetoyan wrote: \u201cYemi Kale is moving on. Great job so far.\n\n\u201cFor years, Yemi Kale @nigerianstat provided a fresh of breath of air in this pungent admin by producing reliable data for use by many analysts. He was uncompromising, methodical and will be missed, \u00b4 Nkasi Wodu through his Twitter handle stated.\n\nAlso commenting, @ilsaAida noted: \u201cDr Yemi Kale did excellently well as Statistician General. He was a great steward. Wishing him all the very best in his endeavors.\n\nAnother commentator, BSA (Gen. Aibinuori BSA) wrote: \u201cDear Dr @sgyemikale, thank you so much for your service to our Nation. You were there, made the needed changes and left the Agency in a much better shape. Nigerians can\u2019t thank you enough.\n\nKale obviously left big shoes for his successor, and the task ahead is even daunting.\n\nMailafia sees the need for the NBS to expand the volumes of data.\n\n\u201cThere is no data on the level of I nsecurity in Nigeria for instance. This is not good enough.\u201d\n\nHe also encouraged the new NBS leadership to pursue partnerships with international donor agencies, the CBN to source funding for good statistics.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe new man should also improve staff welfare, and learn to develop big data which is the future.\u201d",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki and his counterparts in Oyo and Abia States, Engr. Seyi Makinde and Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu, respectively, on Tuesday, flagged off the e-registration and Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise in Anambra State, ahead of the November 6, 2021 date for the state\u2019s gubernatorial poll.\n\nObaseki, who is also the Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) e-Registration Committee, expressed confidence that the PDP will emerge victorious in the forthcoming election.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cAnambra State is the first state that we are launching the e-registration and CVR exercise as we were charged, as the committee on e-registration, to commence the exercise following the forthcoming election on November 6, 2021.\n\n\u201cAs far as I am concerned and have seen, PDP is the only party in Nigeria. Other parties are Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV) for elections. Our party\u2019s strength rests on the ward. It\u2019s the base of the party and the e-registration launch today will be driven by the leadership of the 326 wards in Anambra State.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the exercise, we can register you in our portal as PDP members and also register you with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) if you are not a voter. The process is very simple,\u201d he noted.\n\nStating the importance of the exercise in the nation\u2019s electoral process, Obaseki noted that e-registration would make it impossible and difficult to rig the election as against the former practice of writing result in collation centers.\n\nHe urged PDP members to take the e-registration exercise seriously to boost membership as it will create room for the party to win the election, adding, \u201cWe must join the PDP to stop the hardship in the country; like high cost of food, the killings and havoc from herdsmen, bandits and robbers. Our e-registration is the right planning for the party as the exercise will further showcase the greatness of our party.\u201d\n\nOn his part, Makinde noted: \u201cI am from the South-West. Obaseki is from the South-South, and Ikpeazu came from the South-East; you have the full support of the Southern part of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIf I can win election with just one member in the Oyo State House of Assembly, you can also do the same. Don\u2019t be discouraged. With the e-registration, it will be difficult to write results. They couldn\u2019t rig the Edo election; they can\u2019t also do it here. We will all rejoice come November 6, 2021 after the governorship election.\u201d\n\nIkpeazu charged the party members to embrace the registration exercise, adding, \u201cWe must come out en-masse to register from the comfort of our homes. The process is easy. No time to stand back but stand firm to stop the suffering and hardship in the nation by supporting PDP all the way to 2023.\u201d\n\nFormer Vice-Presidential candidate of the PDP, Dr. Peter Obi, commended the governors of Edo, Oyo and Abia states for coming to support the party\u2019s guber candidate, Valentine Ozigbo.\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nABUJA- Deputy President of the Senate, Ovie Omo-Agege, has said that a sustainable electoral process was only possible if it was founded on an adequate electioneering culture.\n\nRepresented by Dr Daniel Bwala, Special Adviser on Legal and Constitutional Matters, the deputy senate president said this at the public presentation and inaugural meeting of the Electoral Hub, in Abuja, on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to him, no matter how good the clauses were in the electoral laws, if the other aspects of the electioneering process were flawed, the electoral process itself will ultimately be flawed.\n\n\u201cWhile there have been many more issues in our electoral history, it seems to me that if we have had adequate and unambiguous clauses, plus adequate advocacy, understanding and the will to comply, we would have had less controversies, fewer post-election court cases and generally, a more credible electoral process.\n\n\u201cThis is to say that we need adequate and generally acceptable rules of engagement in the electioneering process.\n\n\u201cI refer to how candidates emerged on party platforms, campaign rally rules and generally political actions toward a fair and credible political participation by voters.\n\n\u201cI am glad, for instance, that the National Assembly is now dealing with the issue of direct primaries\u2019\u2019, Omo-Agege said.\n\nHe added that the obvious preference for direct primaries, for example, would have more than a salutary effect on the challenges of dealing with select delegates at primaries, which had been a sore point in our electioneering process, citing the ongoing electoral reform process, therefore, as a responsibility for all.\n\nThe deputy senate president said that there was need to join hands to work out an electoral system that would not only agree with global best practice, but would make Nigeria a stronger nation.\n\nMrs May Agbamuche-Mbu, National Commissioner, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), said that the launch of the forum would enrich knowledge and enhance understanding of the electoral process in Nigeria as well as serve as a reference point for both political parties and voters.\n\nAgbamuche-Mbu assured Nigerians that the commission would continue to improve on its processes for more transparent, credible elections, urging all eligible voters to utilise the Continuous Voter Registration to get voter cards, transfer their cards, among others.\n\n\u201cNine weeks into the exercise, we have witnessed 2,485,770 online registrants and 3,325,741 in total. These figures are encouraging and of the online registrants 2,160,292 are youths between ages 18 to 34,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nShe added that recently, INEC expanded polling units by creating additional 57,023 units across the country, bringing the total units to 176,996, with the aim of bringing the voting process closer to the people .\n\nProf. Adebayo Olukoshi, Chairman, The Electoral Forum and Professor, Wits School of Governance, in South Africa, commended the forum for the initiative to gather veterans with knowledgeable insights on the electoral process.\n\nOlukoshi said that the world over it was believed that interacting with such a class of people would help in improving the quality of governance, elections and democracy.\n\nHe said that issues of electoral integrity had continued to plague Nigeria, so, there was need to commit to working at ensuring electoral integrity, so that citizens could reap the dividends of democracy .\n\nMs Princess Hamman-Obels, Director, IRIAD, The Electoral Hub, said that the Hub conceptualised the Electoral Forum as a way to pool resource persons from electoral management bodies together with other electoral stakeholders.\n\nThis, Hamman-Obels said, was to find solutions to the unique problems facing the electoral process in Nigeria .\n\n\u201cWith the support of OSIWA, the forum has been established under the chairmanship of Prof. Adebayo Olukoshi, and other high-calibre practitioners.\n\n\u201cWe believe that by facilitating discussions among different stakeholders, we hope to deepen understanding of the electoral process in Nigeria, as well as provide solutions to improve electoral integrity and credibility,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nHamman-Obels said that the aim of the forum was to facilitate systematic electoral reforms, promote evidence-based law-making, policy and advocacy on elections in Nigeria.\n\nShe added that another objective of the forum was also to advance strategies to improve capacities and credibility of electoral management bodies in Nigeria.\n\nToday\u2019s public launch and inaugural meeting\u2019s objective was to formally launch the forum, determine its operations, produce understanding of members and review the Electoral Amendment bill, she said.\n\nMs Catherine Angai, Programme Coordinator, Democracy and Accountability, OSIWA, said that the support to Electoral Hub, spoke to OSIWA\u2019s priority for evidence-based electoral reforms.\n\nAngai added that it targeted those factors that impacted on electoral integrity, particularly the administrative barriers, and that the project had a research component which would critically analyse Nigeria\u2019s election management system.\n\nShe said that the research would create a compelling evidence-based narrative that presented a clear picture of the strengths and limitations of electoral bodies.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the project fills a major knowledge-gap and provides an expose into the structural issues that have impacted on the work of electoral management bodies over the years,\u2019\u2019 she said.

          "title": "Seven years after passing public smoking law, Lagos struggles with enforcement",
          "text": "Sam (surname withheld), a second-year National Diploma student at the Yaba College of Technology in Lagos, says he stopped reading in the school due to exposure to indiscriminate smoking.\n\nThe 21-year-old has never seen a \u2018No-smoking\u2019 or \u2018Smoking area\u2019 sign on the campus. He says there is no designated place for smoking in the school.\n\n\u201cMy friends and I used to do our assignment when we first gained admission here but we noticed that some students smoke beside the Art Complex and also behind the School of Liberal Studies at night, they smoke weed. Sometimes, I also perceive it in class, since then we take our assignments home,\u201d he said.\n\nContrary to the stipulations of the Lagos State anti-smoking law, most public places, including tertiary institutions and hotels, do not have designated smoking places.\n\nThe Lagos State House of Assembly passed the \u2018Law to Provide for the Regulation of Smoking in Public Places in Lagos State and for Connected Purposes\u2019 bill in January 2014 and it was signed into law by the then governor, Babatunde Fashola, a few weeks later.\n\nThe seven-page law, which comprises 16 sections, outlaws smoking in all public places such as libraries, museums, public toilets, schools, hospitals, daycare centres, schools and public buses, restaurants, hotels, stadia, among others. Penalties for defaulters range from N10,000 to N50,000 fines or imprisonment.\n\nAccording to Section 3(ii) of the law, \u201cWithout prejudice to the above subsection, an owner, occupier or a person in charge of a place listed in Schedule II may designate a section which shall not be more than ten per cent (10%) of the premises as a \u2018Smoking Area.'\u201d The facilities listed in Schedule II of the law include tertiary institutions, bars and nightclubs, and hotels.\n\nIgnoring the law\n\nA report by the Centre for the Study of Economies of Africa (CSEA), titled Health burden and economic cost of smoking in Nigeria, revealed that Nigeria records 28,876 preventable deaths related to tobacco annually and the country \u201chas been leading tobacco markets in Africa and the absolute number of active smokers remains one of the highest on the continent.\u201d\n\nThe research found that the Nigerian health system spends over N500 billion yearly to treat illnesses caused by smoking and passive smoking.\n\nA PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 check of public places in Lagos showed that most of them do not have designated smoking places within their facilities.\n\nAcademic institutions like the Yaba College of Technology, Lagos State University (Badagry entrance), St Mary and Alfred, and some other public secondary schools do not have the \u201cNo Smoking\u201d symbol at their entrances as provided by the law.\n\nA staff of St Mary and Alfred, who refused to identify herself, said \u201cI\u2019m not aware. It is somehow, don\u2019t you think\u201d?\n\nShe urged the government to inform schools in Lagos of the law and their role in the implementation process.\n\nSection 4 of the law stipulates as follows:\n\n\u201c(1) It shall be the duty of any person who owns, occupies or is in charge of Duty of the management of a \u2018No Smoking Area\u2019 to Owner/Occupier\n\ni. Ensure that approved \u2018No Smoking\u2019 signs are displayed conspicuously at each entrance and in prominent locations throughout the premises;\n\nii. Ensure that all \u2018No Smoking Areas\u2019 are fixed with smoke detectors;\n\niii. Ensure that where anyone smokes outside the premises of a public area, such is not done within ten (10) from the entrance of the premises; and\n\niv. Cause a person smoking in a \u2018No Smoking Area\u2019 to stop smoking.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nMost hotels, schools, banks, restaurants, shopping malls, and religious centres visited in Ikeja and Surulere did not fully comply with the law. For instance, Ikeja City Mall in Ikeja and Shoprite and Leisure Mall in Surulere do not have the signage displayed at their gates or within their facilities.\n\nSome of the workers in the malls who spoke to this reporter said they had never seen any of the signage on their premises. But security guards at the cinemas at the malls in Surulere and Ikeja said they do not have the signs but that it is displayed on their screens for viewers before the start of movies.\n\nChinenye Peter, the manager of Palasino Hotel in Surulere, said although there is no signage that their lounge is the only place permitted for smokers, the receptionist informs every guest at the point of entry of the hotel regulations.\n\nWhile some hotels do not have \u2018no smoking\u2019 signs at their gates, they, however, display it at their reception and outside the elevators.\n\nMichael Odogwu, a hotel manager in Surulere, said they \u201ccheck out\u201d from their room any guest found violating the anti-smoking law.\n\n\u201cWe once caught two guys smoking in their rooms, so when they were discovered we checked them out. Because they violated the rule and they had been told not to in the first place.\u201d\n\nMs Peter said they also expel defaulting guests from their facility, but after they had issued the first warning.\n\n\u201cOnce we detect, we issue a warning, and if it continues we take action. The person is not entitled to a refund. If it becomes violent we have the DSS and the police number to take care of it,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that \u201cin the lounge, we only allow some types of smoking. Marijuana, narcotics, are not allowed, the bouncer will bounce such people out.\u201d\n\nWay forward\n\nTosin Agunbiade, an environmentalist, said tobacco products have a damaging impact on the environment aside from the health consequences.\n\nHe said cigarette butts are not just a nuisance but toxic waste and when not properly disposed of can cause fire outbreaks.\n\n\u201cThey contain chemicals that contaminate our waterways and ground soil and harm our wildlife. Cigarette butts cause pollution by being carried as runoff, to drains and from there to rivers, beaches, and oceans,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Agunbiade urged the state government to install CCTV in \u201cstrategic places\u201d to strengthen the enforcement of the law and to safeguard lives and properties.\n\n\u201cIf possible, designated smoking areas should be provided and the waste generated while smoking and after should be properly managed.\n\n\u201cGeneral public announcement or awareness should be done periodically. People need to be educated and informed about the effect smoking has on the environment, health safety, and the possible sanctions.\u201d\n\nZero enforcement\n\nSince August 2014 when the anti-smoking law came into effect in Lagos, there has been no reported case of arrest or prosecution by the authorities.\n\nThe Lagos State government has not demonstrated any willingness to implement the law, said Akinbode Oluwafemi, a tobacco-control advocate.\n\n\u201cWe are yet to see what they are doing,\u201d said Mr Oluwafemi, whose organisation, the Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria, was instrumental in the passing of the law.\n\n\u201cThere is the National Tobacco Control Act of 2015 and the National Tobacco Control Regulations 2019 that have comprehensive provisions on the use of tobacco products. We had expected Lagos State to be at the forefront of enforcing those laws, but the opposite is the case.\u201d\n\nWhen this reporter visited the information unit of the Lagos State Environment Protection Agency (LASEPA) to enquire about the compliance to the law and prosecution rate, she was given a phone number by a staff identified as Ms Tolu to send questions via text message. She said her boss was unavailable.\n\nMessages and phone calls to the number were not responded to.",

          "text": "OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe Lagos State government has disagreed with the position of federal government on collection of Value Added Tax (VAT), insisting that it is the rightful entity to collect the tax.\n\nRecall that a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt had ruled that collection of VAT falls within the jurisdiction of state governments.\n\nThe court presided over by Justice Stephen Pam, on August 9, restrained the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) from collecting VAT and personal income tax (PIT), saying, \u201c the law does not back FIRS authority above state governments in the collection of VAT and PIT.\u201d\n\nFollowing the judgement, Lagos state government directed FIRS to stop issuing demand notices for payment of VAT in the state and to render accounts, within seven days, of all sums collected as VAT in the current accounting circle in the state.\n\nHowever, FIRS appealed the ruling and advised the public to maintain a status-quo on the payment of the taxes. And subsequently wrote to Lagos State government \u2013 which accounts for the bulk of VAT collections in the country \u2013 maintaining that it will continue to collect VAT from businesses.\n\nFIRS executive chairman, Muhammed Nami in the letter dated August 24 and addressed to Moyosore Onigbanjo, the attorney general and commissioner for justice in Lagos state, said since the Rivers court decision has been appealed, \u201cthe law does not allow a party to a suit to carry out an action to forestall the decision of the appellate court once an appeal has been entered\u201d.\n\nIt added that there were contrary rulings by similar courts on the same matter, Cable reported.\n\nFIRS added that parties must maintain the status quo until the decision of the appeal court.\n\n\u201cThe instant judgement of the Federal High Court, Rivers State, is in conflict with the extant judgement of the Federal High Court, Kogi State on the same subject matter i.e. the validity of VAT Act as administered by the Service,\u201d the letter read.\n\n\u201cThe conflict created by the later judgement can only be resolved by the appellate court; and the right of the appellate court in this wise should not be compromised.\n\n\u201cIn view of the foregoing, parties have to maintain the status quo ante (i.e. their positions before the instant judgement of the Federal High Court, Rivers State).\n\n\u201cThe FIRS shall continue to collect VAT and administer the VAT Act until the final resolution of the legal dispute by the relevant appellate court\n\nHowever, responding to Nami\u2019s letter on Tuesday, Gbenga Omotosho, Lagos commissioner for information and strategy, insisted that the FIRS\u2019 appealing the case at the Appeal Court does not translate to a stay of execution.\n\n\u201cAn appeal is not a stay of execution. For us in Lagos, our position is that we have the backing of the law to demand and collect VAT. The court has ruled and we are following the judgment,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs a state, we believe the development is good for progress and true federalism that we have been clamouring for.\u201d",

          "text": "In a bold move to arrest the recurring security challenges facing Katsina state, Governor Aminu Bello Masari has banned transportation of cattle from the state to any part of the country.\n\nSimilarly, the governor also ordered stoppage of sale of all animals in 14 markets of frontline areas of bandits, including Jibia, Batsari, Safana, Danmusa, Kankara, Malumfashi, Charanci, Maiaduwa, Kafur, Faskari, Sabuwa, Baure, Dutsin ma and Kaita local government areas.\n\nThese were some of the measures contained in the \u201cKatsina State Government, Nigeria, Security Challenges (Containment Order) signed Monday by the governor, which took effect August 31(Tuesday).\n\nAnnouncing the measures in the order dated 30th day of August, 2021, the governor said: \u201cIn the exercise of powers conferred upon me by the subsection (2) of section 176 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and all other powers enabling me on that behalf, I, Rt. Hon. Aminu Bello Masari CFR, the Governor of Katsina State, do hereby make the following:\n\n\u201cThis Notice may be cited as the Security Challenges (Containment) Order and shall come into effect on the 31st day of August 2021.\u201d\n\nThe governor further ordered \u201cimmediate total closure of Jibia-Gurbin Baure road to all motorists until further notice. Travellers plying that road are advised to go through Funtua.\u201d\n\nHe also ordered the \u201cimmediate closure of Kankara-Sheme road to all commercial vehicles, which are advised to go through Funtua. Only private non-commercial vehicles are to ply the road.\u201d\n\nIt also said \u201clorries/trucks carrying firewood from the bush are totally banned.\u201d Similarly, it suspended the sale of all animals at the markets in Jibia, Batsari, Safana, Danmusa, Kankara and some other local governments. .\n\nAlso, the governor ordered a \u201cban on transportation of cattle trucks from Katsina to any state in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe 12-point Order also banned the sale of second hand motorcycles at Charanchi market and carrying of three persons on motorcycles as well as carrying more than three passengers on a tricycle.\n\nFurthermore, the Order limited the sale of fuel of not more than N5,000.00 to motorists to only 2 designated filling stations in Jibia, Batsari, Safana, Danmusa, Kankara, Faskari, Sabuwa, Dandume, Musawa, Matazu, Dutsinma, Kurfi, Danja and Kafur local government areas, even as it reinforced the prohibition of the sale of petrol in jerry cans at filling stations.\n\nIn the same vein, the Order reinforced the ban on the operation of commercial tricycles and motorcycles from 10.00am to 6.00am in the state capital from 6.00pm to 6.00 am in the frontline local government areas.\n\nIt, however, identified and allowed essential workers like health personnel, security personnel and journalists to use tricycles and motorcycles beyond the banned period.\n\nAkeredolu on anti-grazing law\n\nIn a related development, Ondo state Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, SAN, Tuesday signed into Law the Anti-Grazing Bill passed by the state House of Assembly.\n\nAnnouncing this in a statement, Tuesday, the state Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Donald Ojogo, said the decision was in line with the southern governors\u2019 resolve.\n\n\u201cThe move is in line with the resolution of the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum at its last meeting in Lagos where September 1st was set as the deadline for Governors in Southern Nigeria to sign the Anti-Open Grazing Bill into law.\n\n\u201cThis is worthwhile and a very laudable development aimed at stemming needless instances of skirmishes, conflicts as well as infractions on the enviably peaceful disposition of the good people of Ondo State.\n\n\u201cIt is very pertinent to aver and indeed, reiterate that the Law shall rather, engender a more cordial, mutually benefiting relationship amongst residents of the State irrespective of ethnicity, religion or creed. For emphasis, no particular group of persons is the target.\n\n\u201cWhile it is the hope of government that all residents would take an ample advantage of this Law to enhance our socio-economic well being in Ondo State, compliance of same shall be given the utmost attention. Government shall pursue with vigour, through lawful means, to ensure strict compliance.\n\n\u201cIn this regard, details of the new Law shall be made available to the public for proper information, more depth of understanding on contents as well as other relevant areas,\u201d Ojogo said.\n\nAfenifere\u2019s alarm\n\nMeanwhile, Afennifere, the Pan Yoruba socio-political organisation, has raised the alarm over the influx of foreigners into the country, describing it as a major threat to Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\n\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 issued at the end of its monthly meeting held at the residence of its acting leader, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, the group said \u201cthe security situations arising from the influx are not only threatening the corporate existence of Nigeria, but making Nigerians to be living in fears.\u201d\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9, a copy of which was made available to Blueprint, was signed by its spokesman, Comrade Jare Ajayi.\n\n\u201cAfenifere noted with serious concern the unprecedented security problems accentuated by the influx of people even from outside Nigeria. Some of them are disguising as Okada riders. We call on the government and security agencies to put a halt to the unbridled influx of people with questionable intention,\u201d it said.\n\nThey further said: \u201cAfenifere observes that terrorism and related vices including kidnapping are now so worrisome that in some cases, our people in places like Yewa, Ogun State, Oke Ogun in Oyo State, etc are forced to be relocating into Benin Republic and other West African countries.\u201d\n\nThe group said \u201curgent actions must be taken to guarantee the security of these people and to put a stop to what is causing them agonies.\u201d\n\nOn activities of illegal mining in some parts of South-west states by the non indigenes, Afenifere noted that \u201d in many cases, the manner of this activity is not only jeopardising the economic and agricultural activities of our people in these areas, the security of the people is being seriously threatened.\u201d\n\nFrowning at the incessant security breaches across border towns of Kogi, Kwara, Ogun, Oyo, Osun, Ekiti and Ondo, they called for the protection of the people in these areas.\n\nThe members further reiterated support for the southern governors on the anti- grazing law, saying, \u201cit is a known fact that Afenifere strongly stands by the Southern Governors in their resolution on anti-grazing laws.\n\n\u201cWe commend the steps taken by governors of the South West on the establishment of security networks like Amotekun. We urge them to continue to forge ahead. \u201c\n\nMiyetti Allah begs Enugu House\n\nAlso on security, the Miyetti Allah Hore and Gan-Allah Fulani Development Association of Nigeria (GAFDAN) Tuesday pleaded with the Enugu state House of Assembly to give them more time to make input into the anti-grazing bill before the state legislature.\n\nGAFDAN head in the South-east, Alhaji Gidado Idris and zonal chairman, Musa Abdulahi made the group\u2019s position known during a public hearing in Enugu.\n\nThey specifically begged the House Committee on Agriculture, Ethics and Privileges to give them one month to deliberate on the bill and come up with their inputs.\n\nThe House came up with the bill following the spate of killings, maiming, and destruction of farm lands believed to be carried out by the herders in different communities across the state.\n\nBut commenting on the bill that had passed first and second reading, the duo said they needed more time inform their people on the new development.\n\n\u201cHonourable chairman, we are requesting that let thirty days (30 days) be given to us so that the elders and members of Gan-Allah Development Association of Nigeria, DAFDAN, be briefed about this development.\n\n\u201cIt is of very important for our members and elders to be aware of this development in order to avoid some doubts or misconception that, the government of Enugu State has given huge amount of money and we failed to communicate or inform them about the new development,\u201d they pleaded.\n\nEarlier, Deputy Speaker Uche Ugwu, had while declaring open the session, said the essence of the bill was to ensure peace and progress in the state and Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe are one people in Nigeria guided by one Constitution. What we want to do is to put a law that will bring peace and progress in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIn our respective villages, we rear goats, sheep and other animals but we don\u2019t allow them to eat other peoples crops, otherwise we report the person to the village chiefs and elders where they pay penalties,\u201d he said, and urged those with submissions to make to do so with open mind.\n\nExplaining the objective of the bill, the chairman of the joint committee in charge of the bill and the public hearing, Hon. Amaka Ugwueze, said when passed into law, the bill would stop the destruction of farms, rape and other crimes and also prevent and control the spread of animal diseases as well as check the devastation of the environment.",

I refer to how candidates emerge on party platforms, campaign rally rules, and generally political actions toward a fair and credible political participation by voters.\n\n\u201cI am glad for instance that the National Assembly is now dealing with the issue of direct or indirect primaries.\n\n\u201cThe obvious preference for direct primaries, for example, would have a strong salutary consequence on the challenges of dealing with select delegates at primaries, which has been a sore point in our electioneering process.\u201d\n\nHe therefore stressed the need for all hands to be on deck in the ongoing electoral reform process.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing electoral reform process is a responsibility of us all. Those of us lawmakers are representatives of various constituent groups including geographical, professional, organisational (such as yours), social, ethnic, religious, among others.\n\n\u201cLet us therefore join hands to work out an electoral system that does not only agree with global best practices, but will make a stronger nation of our great country Nigeria,\u201d he pleaded.\n\nThe electoral process, according to him, \u201cis a central fabric of our journey in democracy, good governance and effective political participation.\u201d\n\nHe explained further that there were three central dimensions to the electoral process namely: adequacy of the process; understanding the process, as well as acceptability and compliance.\n\n\u201cWhile there have been many more issues in our electoral history, it seems to me that if we had had adequate clauses and unambiguity of same, plus adequate advocacy, understanding and will to comply, we would have had less controversies, fewer post-election court cases and generally, a more credible electoral process,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "The United States Africa Command yesterday said that the A-29 Super Tucano aircraft inducted into the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) inventory on Tuesday will assist Nigeria in their fight against violent extremist organizations, including the Islamic State West Africa Province.\n\nThis even as it disclosed that the $500 million military hardware is the largest FMS program in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nUnited States Africa Command in a statement on Tuesday evening further disclosed that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is providing $36.1M in infrastructure support to the A-29s\u2019 home base, Kainji Air Base, including covered magazines and aircraft sunshades, a new airfield hot cargo pad, perimeter and security fencing, airfield lights, and various airfield apron, parking, hangar, and entry control point enhancements.\n\nThe Command added that the Nigerian Air Force is one of its key partners that play a critical role in furthering regional security and stability.\n\nU.S. Air Forces Europe-Air Forces Africa commander, Gen. Jeff Harrigian, said that the \u201cceremony symbolizes the strength of our unique partnership and underscores the value of training and working together\u201d.\n\nThe Super Tucanos he noted was the impetus for the significant deepening of training and professional relationships, adding that \u201cPrecision targeting, air-to-ground integration, and human rights training are all included in the partnership between the U.S. and Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe statement added that the joint structure of air-to-ground integration also supports Nigerian Army and Navy operations.\n\n\u201cNigeria purchased the A-29s through the Foreign Military Sales program, which follows the Department of Defense\u2019s \u2018Total Package Approach\u2019 model and includes spare parts for several years of operation, contract logistics support, munitions, and a multi-year construction project to improve Kainji Air Base infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe total sale is valued at almost $500 million, making it the largest FMS program in sub-Saharan Africa. Harrigian and U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard, spoke to the media about how this platform will help improve Nigerian Air Force capabilities, as well as increase training and integration opportunities between Nigerian and U.S. troops. The A-29 can perform intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and precision air-to-ground strikes, strengthening Nigeria\u2019s ability to fight terrorism.\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cThe A-29 is a prime tool to help Nigeria combat violent extremism and is vital to sustained deterrence. The total package deal\u2014aircrew and maintainer training, precision-guided weapon delivery, and more\u2014highlights our enduring partnership with the Nigerian Air Force and our commitment to enabling their successes where we can. A total of 64 pilots and maintainers from the Nigerian Air Force trained to U.S. standards with the U.S. Air Force\u2019s 81st Fighter Squadron at Moody Air Base in Georgia, USA. Training also emphasized the Law of Armed Conflict and civilian casualty mitigation, which are fundamental principles of the Nigerian military\u2019s professional education and training.\n\n\u201cAs part of the program, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is providing $36.1M in infrastructure support to the A-29s\u2019 home base, Kainji Air Base, including a covered magazines and aircraft sunshades, a new airfield hot cargo pad, perimeter and security fencing, airfield lights, and various airfield apron, parking, hangar, and entry control point enhancements. The infrastructure package also includes a flight annex wing building for simulator training as well as munitions assembly and storage and small arms storage. USACE has also stationed a project engineer at Kainji to provide ongoing maintenance and assistance. USACE previously detailed its support to Nigeria here.\n\n\u201cThe Super Tucano induction ceremony is the latest of multiple significant engagements between U.S. Africa Command, its components, and Nigerian counterparts. Other recent engagements include a visit by the Expeditionary Sea Base USS Hershel \u201cWoody\u201d Williams (ESB 4) in August 2021 and U.S. Army Special Forces training with the Nigeria Navy Special Boat Service in July 2021\u201d.\n\nThe statement recalled that the U.S. Army Gen. Stephen Townsend, commander, U.S. Africa Command, visited Nigeria in February 2021, where he met with President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s Chief of Staff Ibrahim Gambari, Minister of Defense Magashi, and Chief of Defense Staff Gen. Leo Irabor.",

          "text": "As the September 1 deadline for the 17 southern states to implement the open grazing prohibition approaches, no fewer than 12 states have failed to do so.\n\nApart from Abia, Ogun, Oyo, Ekiti, and Ebonyi, the other states are either in the process of enacting the law or have not begun at all. In fact, five states \u2013 Anambra, Lagos, Imo, Edo, and Cross River \u2013 have refused to sign the agreement, while Rivers, Delta, Osun, Ondo, Bayelsa, Akwa-Ibom, and Enugu are just getting started.\n\nIt is expected that as from today, it would be unlawful for anybody or group of persons to graze farm animals openly throughout the southern region.\n\nThis development, combined with the Federal Government\u2019s recent announcement that it has disbursed billions of Naira to reactivate the country\u2019s dormant grazing routes, which number over 300, has elicited a wide range of opinions, particularly among ethnic nationalities groups.\n\nThe Ohanaeze Ndigbo has insisted that it would be implemented in the South East because the people do not have any free land for open grazing.\n\n\u201cIn the South East, for instance, everywhere is tied to individuals, deities and even shines; so we don\u2019t have any free land for open grazing. We have made our position clear and I want to believe that all the governors understood this very well,\u201d the national publicity secretary, Alex Ogbonnia, stated.\n\nHe, however, stressed that in a situation where a governor in the zone disagrees with the group, as it is being alleged that the Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodimma, has done, the group would chose the path of dialogue until he understands the implication of what he is doing.\n\n\u201cThe fact that a governor disagrees with us now does not matter until such a time when we have overstretched our patience; if he doesn\u2019t understand, then, it will become a case.\u201d\n\nHe also likened Federal Government\u2019s effort to reactivate the grazing routes to reenacting the slave routes.\n\nOn his part, President of the Middle Belt Form (MBF), Dr. Pogu Bitrus, expects that by today, machinery would have been put in place to enforce the ban and also make provision for ranching.\n\n\u201cWe are only aware of Governor Uzodimma, who is allegedly reneging on the decision to accommodate what the southern people want. But, on the issue of open grazing routes, the constitution is very clear. The president can only control the FCT in terms of land. Land is controlled by the state governors for the people and that is what the constitution says. So, the president cannot, going by the constitution, impose on the state governments grazing routes. He can only negotiate; that is what the law says.\n\n\u201cSo, the issue of grazing routes, to me, is dead on arrival. I am not bothered about that because it is only a state governor who wants to cede his authority and power to the Federal Government that can allow such to happen in his state,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Northern Elders Forum (NEF) reiterated that even as it was not against the ban, the problems associated with open grazing should be treated as a national challenge rather than resorting to threats and ultimatums. It also appealed to all stakeholders to remain calm.\n\nSpokesman of the NEF, Dr. Hakeem Baba Ahmed, warned against the expiration of the deadline being used as an excuse to attack cattle herders or their livestock.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe NEF has made its position very clear. We are not against the stoppage of open grazing. Our position is that the problem can be solved and must be solved as a national problem and it should not involve the kind of threat or ultimatum that we see coming from leaders who should operate at a higher level of responsibility.\u201d\n\nBut Afenifere fears that as desirable as the ban is, it might not be successfully enforced because of the lopsided nature of policing in Nigeria. It, therefore, suggested that the southern states use the regional security outfits to enforce the ban.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, said: \u201cAs desirable as the open grazing law by southern state governments is, the chances of its successful enforcement are slim because of the lopsided nature of the country\u2019s policing system.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that the southern states should establish special police units to enforce the ban.\n\n\u201cIt is worth recalling however that when some states in the north banned the sale and consumption of alcohol in public, they did not rely on the federally controlled Nigeria Police to enforce the law in their respective states. Rather, they set up what they called Hisbah (local police) to enforce the law.\n\n\u201cIn this way, it may not be out of place if the states concerned in the South use such regional security outfits as Amotekun in the South West or Ebubeagu in the South East to get compliance. These local security networks should be allowed to enforce state laws particularly the ban on open grazing just as Hisbah is used in the North to enforce the ban on sale and open consumption of alcohol. What is sauce for the goose should also be sauce for the gander\u201d",

          "text": "Fresh facts have emerged about the process leading to the Central Bank of Nigeria\u2019s (CBN) formal engagement of global fintech company, Bitt Inc. as its technical partner for its proposed digital currency, also known as e-Naira.\n\nTHISDAY learnt on Tuesday that the CBN went through a rigorous vendor selection process in line with the Public Procurement Act, conducted by seven departmental directors and a Deputy Governor whereby 10 companies were evaluated.\n\nThe evaluation was based on the following criteria: technology ownership and control; implementation timeline; efficiency, ease of adoption; support for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT); platform security; interoperability; implementation experience.\n\nAccording to a document seen by THISDAY, Bitt came tops with an average score of 82.3 per cent. The scores for the top five bidders were: Bitt- 82.3 per cent; InterStellar \u2013 76.9 per cent; Zimbali- 76.4 per cent; G+D \u2013 76.3 per cent; and EmTech -66.4\n\nIt also revealed that a sandbox evaluation followed the selection process to have a hands on experience with Bitt and G+D being the two companies among the top five who had either gone live or had deployed a pilot.\n\nBitt is a leader in the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) industry, with subject matter experts at the intersection of technology and policy.\n\nThe company deployed its flagship product in regulated, collaborative, multi-stakeholder environments, including a live CBDC in four Caribbean countries, and digital currency deployments in Barbados and Latin America.\n\nTHISDAY findings also revealed that the Bitt DCMS for Eastern Caribbean Central Bank was vetted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\n\nAlso, the deployment in the Caribbean countries was driven by social impact, including financial inclusion, through special features for the unbanked, on/off-ramp through an accessible agency network, and the implementation of zero-cost mobile transactions.\n\nThe systems has patent-pending offline transaction capabilities, and the ability to integrate with other CBDC networks for cross-currency exchange.\n\nOverstock, which has majority stake in the company, is a more than 20 year old publicly traded company (Nasdaq: OSTK) with over $200M invested in blockchain technology related businesses. Pelion Ventures, a 35+ year old VC firm, manages OSTK investments.\n\nIn addition, Bitt was the first company to digitise a national currency on a blockchain, thus creating the first synthetic CBDC, with the support of the Central Bank of Barbados Governor and the Minister of Finance.\n\n\u201cThat system is still in operation today, and is integrated with the largest bill payment processor in the country and both major telcos.\n\n\u201cThe Government of Barbados uses it to collect payments online. mMoney has grown to service thousands of merchants andmany more individuals within Barbados. It is clearly not a closed payment system.\n\n\u201cThe main product, the Digital Currency Management System, licenced to CBN is not a closed payment system. The DCMS provides the Suite of applications for the monetary authority, commercial banks, merchants, and consumers (both, banked and unbanked),\u201d it added.\n\nA separate report also revealed that in March this year, \u2018DCash\u2019, was designed and developed by the international fintech company, Bitt, in partnership with the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and it became the world\u2019s first retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) to be publicly issued within a formal currency union.\n\nThe historic transaction was the climax of over two years of extensive research, consultations, planning, software development, operational training, merchant acquisition, customer service, and marketing achieved through collaboration with the ECCB, Bitt and multiple external stakeholders.\n\nSpeaking at the virtual launch, Bitt\u2019s CEO, Brian Popelka, had said, \u201cCBDCs are truly transforming the way that financial transactions are conducted around the world. This change brings significant benefits especially to emerging economies.\u201d\n\nCBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele had said the CBDC, otherwise known as the e-Naira, would bring about increased cross-border trade, accelerate financial inclusion, and lead to cheaper and faster remittance inflow.\n\nHe had said the digital money would lead to easier targeted social interventions, as well as improvement in monetary policy effectiveness, payment systems efficiency, and tax collection.\n\nCBN\u2019s Director, Corporate Communications Department, Mr. Osita Nwanisobi, explained, in a statement, that the e-Naira project had been a long and thorough process for the apex bank following its resolve in 2017 to digitise the local currency after extensive research and exploration.\n\nNwanisobi said CBN\u2019s decision was in line with an unmistakable global trend in which over 85 per cent of central banks were considering adopting digital currencies in their countries.\n\nThe CBN pointed out that the selection of Bitt Inc. from among highly competitive bidders was based on the company\u2019s technical competence, efficiency, platform security, interoperability, and implementation experience.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cIn choosing Bitt Inc. the CBN will rely on the company\u2019s tested and proven digital currency experience, which is already in circulation in several Eastern Caribbean countries.\n\n\u201cBitt Inc. was key to the development and successful launch of the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) pilot of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) in April 2021.\u201d\n\nEmefiele had recently hinted that a national digital currency would be launched in October. The apex bank had also said the digital currency would be treated as a critical national infrastructure to protect it from operational and cyber-security risks.\n\nObinna Chima",

          "title": "Dangote: Only A Third of NNPC\u2019s Investment in Refinery Will Be Paid in Cash",
          "text": "Africa\u2019s richest man and the President of the Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote on Tuesday disclosed that the 20 per cent equity taken by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in his much-awaited refinery will not be paid in a single cash transaction.\n\nSpeaking during a documentary aired on Arise News Channel, THISDAY\u2019s broadcast arm, the renowned philanthropist noted that while a third of the $2.7 billion deal would be paid in cash, the second would be through crude sales and the third would be through profits made by the corporation.\n\nHe noted that there\u2019s a lot of misconceptions around the planned 20 per cent equity holding by the national oil company, explaining that the deal also involves all the products to be churned out by the $19 billion facility, including petrochemicals.\n\nRevealing that he got the inspiration to build the refinery from India, given what he described as the painful situation whereby Nigeria, a country of over 200 million people importing all petroleum products needed for consumption.\n\nHe pointed out that the project currently employs 29,000 Nigerians and 11, 000 foreigners with plans to ramp up the number to 57,000 in the coming months.\n\nThe 650,000 barrels per day refinery, located in Lagos is expected to start operation in the first half of next year, with the NNPC in the process of buying 20 per cent of the refinery.\n\nStressing that the refinery is capable of meeting the country\u2019s entire petrol, diesel and jet fuel needs, Dangote posited that as it stands, the country expends about 25 per cent of all its import bills on bringing in petrol products into the country.\n\nThe businessmen lamented that Nigeria lost between $50 billion to $60 in investments to the delayed passage of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), but explained that with the recent presidential assent, investors who had been sitting on the fence are now expected to move into the country.\n\n\u201cSo, these are the things that people don\u2019t really understand and I want to really clarify it. When they talk about the $2.7 billion, you know, they (NNPC) are paying one third of the money.\n\n\u201cAnother one third of the money, again, will actually be paid through supply of crude, with the deduction of maximum of about $2 and some cents. And then the one third of it, which is another $850 to $900 million will be paid from the profit they are going to make from the business.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s not a cash transaction where they are paying all cash. You can see that if we don\u2019t have confidence in what we are doing, we would have asked them to pay all cash,\u201d he stated.\n\nDangote mentioned that one of the benefits of the refinery to Nigeria would be to stabilise the country\u2019s currency, because as of today, about 25 per cent of the country\u2019s foreign exchange goes to importation of petroleum products.\n\nHe noted that if the country was to spend $8 billion to $9 billion for imports, for instance, that money would be saved because the refinery has the full capacity to meet every energy need of the country, whether petrol, diesel or aviation fuel, with a lot left to export, thereby generating a lot of foreign exchange for the country.\n\n\u201cSo you can see the difference, even our own balance of trade will change, it will strengthen also the naira because we\u2019re not going to have this massive avalanche of dollars going out for importing finished products of our own raw material.\n\n\u201cThis refinery that we built is very important and is going to help transform not only the oil sector in Nigeria, no, it will transform the entire economy of Nigeria, it will put millions of people directly or indirectly at work.\n\n\u201cThis will massively transform the economy and by transforming the economy, government will have more money to devote in terms of education, in terms of health and in terms of infrastructure,\u201d he opined.\n\nDangote added: \u201cIt makes me feel terrible to see a country as big as Nigeria, as resourceful as Nigeria and with this sort of population that we have 200 million plus, we\u2019re importing all our petroleum products. I mean, it is very painful.\n\n\u201cSo with that, I thought in my mind, and I said that somebody has to address this issue. We tried before, in 2007 like what I said earlier on, but the government of that day changed their minds, and then we jettisoned the idea and returned them.\n\n\u201cBut right now, we came back with the support of the government to make sure that yes, we help in addressing this issue of not only Nigeria. Because I\u2019m a Nigerian and I\u2019ve benefited quite a lot from Nigeria and if there are issues to be sorted out, I should be one of those who will bring solutions to our national problems.\u201d\n\nAccording to Dangote, the refinery project remains the biggest in Africa today and one of the biggest in the world, adding that a lot of Nigerians were getting massive training as a way to build in-country capacity.\n\nWith the expected operationalisation of the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA), Dangote expressed confidence that investors would be attracted to the country, because before now, there was no incentive.\n\n\u201cBefore, there was no clarity, people were not really very ready and willing to put in their money. If you look at it, in the last couple of years, there has not been investment. We have lost more than $50 billion to $60 billion worth of investment,\u201d he noted.\n\nOn reasons for accepting NNPC\u2019s 20 per cent equity, he explained that it wasn\u2019t possible for the government to sit back when a massive project like the refinery is ongoing because of the need for energy security, assuring that in three or maximum four years, NNPC will recoup its investment.\n\n\u201cPeople keep talking about the refinery, they didn\u2019t buy only the refinery, they bought refinery with petrochemicals. I could have actually decided to do like some of my my mates here in Nigeria and just keep my money in the bank or keep the money abroad.\n\n\u201cBut you know I\u2019m very, very passionate about Nigeria and making Nigeria great. If it\u2019s just Dangote group making money, I would have just kept that money and participate in capital markets abroad where my money is in dollars and I am making money, but no.\n\n\u201cWe know as a country we have challenges, how do we address these issues. The only way for me is not to sit and be criticising, no, I should be part of the problem solvers and part of the change. My prayer is that I will give most of my wealth when I am alive,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Mr. Godwin Emefiele, who spoke in the documentary explained that with the coming of the refinery, Nigeria would save a lot of its foreign exchange that\u2019s currently being used in importing refined products.\n\nHe said: \u201cOrdinarily, setting up a 650, 000 barrels per day refinery, is usually a project that is set up by sovereign countries, not by individuals, no matter how big you are, no matter how big the company is.\n\n\u201cOur own selfish interest is that this will help to achieve our import substitution objectives and on this, you\u2019re talking about goods that are currently being imported into the country with scarce foreign exchange, that we will now begin to produce them locally, thereby saving foreign exchange that the central bank would have spent importing or funding the importation of these items.\n\n\u201cAt every opportunity that I have visited that project site, I get encouraged and I seize the opportunity of those visits to encourage even other Nigerians or other businesses, whether local or foreign, that Nigeria has a lot of potential and as long as people can contemplate this kind of projects, they will receive the needed support from the CBN for the importation of plants and equipment.\u201d\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
