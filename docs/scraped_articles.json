          "text": "Ola Ajayi, Ibadan\n\nFollowing the bloody clash between members of the Oodua Peoples Congress and a notorious gang identified as Herald gang within Ibadan metropolis which resulted in the death of some people, the leader of OPC in Oyo State, Mr Rotimi Olumo has confirmed that three of his men were killed during the fracas.\n\nThere are contradictory casualty figures while the crisis which engulfed places like Oopoyeosa, Inalende and Abebi lasted. Some claimed that 11 people were killed, while others said it was only four people that were killed. Two bodies were found.\n\nOlumo who said his men did not kill anyone said alleged that it was one Jalaruru that led the attack.\n\nAccording to him, the violent clash started when gang allegedly robbed some motorcycles. But, the robbers were traced to their hideout and the matter was reported at the Mokola Divisional Police station.\n\nOlumo said, \u201cThe OPC boys involved are our boys. We only heard of the matter midnight Thursday. The Herald boys gathered around 12midnight (Thursday) that our boys called that the Herald boys since Sunday had been terrorising the area snatching phones, robbing and stealing motorcycles and they are youths from Oopo.\n\n\u201cBut, in the evening the gang attacked the house of one of our men named Olodo who built a house in Oopo and the member had a narrow escape. But after he escaped, he called our men to go and help him rescue his wife and children and that was how another round of fight started\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the fight, we didn\u2019t know where and how the gangs got their guns, they fired shots at our men and attacked our men in their homes. They knew they won\u2019t be able to face them collectively at the midnight after burning their houses.\n\n\u201cThe gang attacked our boys and they shot three of our men namely Akin Aluko, Quadri Omitola and Opeyemi.\n\n\u201cThey were rushed to the hospital, but by day break Friday, two of them had died. The third person is in still in coma. It is under probability. That was what the thugs in Oopo and Inalende did overnight\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut, I have appealed to our boys to be law abiding and not engage in reprisal as a law abiding organisation. I told them to allow the police to take up the matter. I have ordered all my boys in the vicinity to vacate their area so that they won\u2019t be provoked.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, I learnt that the gangs are still threatening that they will still attack our men but you know that if they attack them, our people will have no choice than to defend themselves.\u201d\n\nOn possible retaliation, \u201cI am not aware of that and I have not been informed. We are just after those in the hospital so that they can get adequate medical attention.\n\n\u201cI have begun my own investigation and I haven\u2019t heard that our men killed seven of the gang members. I haven\u2019t got that report. But, before midnight, if it is true, we will confirm and I will get back to you.\u201d Olumo said.\n\nThe state Police Command through its Public Relations Officer, DSP Adewale Osifeso confirmed the crisis but declined to give casualty figure noting that he was yet to be fully briefed.",

He stresses that he has no presidential ambitions, but one would not be surprised to see him manifest at a later date as Nigeria\u2019s President.\n\nSanusi ranks amongst the most controversial of living Nigerians. His book, For The Good Of The Nation \u2013 Essays And Perspectives, therefore compels considerable attention. Remarkably, the book does not include Sanusi\u2019s writings on Finance and the Economy.\n\n\n\nREAD ALSOReps probe Police over \u2018missing\u2019 $7.5m recovered loot\n\nThe book is divided into five parts, notably, Identity, Politics & Democracy; Reflections On Shari\u2019ah; SLS And The Gender Question; Islamic Theology and Philosophy; and finally, Interviews.\n\nFor The Good Of The Nation \u2013 Essays And Perspectives has been in the works for ten years, that is, after the publisher Tunde Fagbenle approached Sanusi \u201csometime in 2021, with the proposal to put together my articles and papers published largely between 1998 and 2005 in academic books, conference proceedings, newspapers and internet websites.\u201d Sanusi\u2019s controversial stints as Governor of the CBN and Emir of Kano put a hold on the publication until he \u201cdecided the time is now right for this book to come out.\u201d\n\nIn his Preface to For The Good Of The Nation which Sanusi signed thusly \u201cMuhammad Sanusi II, CON, 14th Fulani Emir of Kano, September, 2020\u201d, the author reveals that the first time he ever published \u201canything was at the age of fourteen, as a Form 4 student in King\u2019s College, in the 1975/76 session.\u201d\n\nSanusi\u2019s soul-mate in life as in controversy, Nasir El-Rufai, supplies the Foreword dated July 2012, and the words are stirring: \u201cLamido is angry about the Nigerian condition and is unsparing in his exposure of the hypocrisy of our political and economic elite in creating and sustaining this condition for their enrichment. He spares no one, even the Fulani royalty and traditional northern institutions into which he was born, or the traditional Islamic clerics, one of which his illustrious grandfather and former Emir was until his death. I have known Lamido for nearly forty years, and in my opinion, every position he has taken, view expressed and everything he has done is driven by a craving for justice and equal opportunity for all, and nothing more.\u201d\n\nThe mourned one, Professor Pius Adesanmi, who died in the Ethiopia Air crash in 2019, penned the introduction dated May 2012 to For The Good Of The Nation which begins this way: \u201cThis book is the book. It is auto/biography, history, politics, political economy, identity, and the sociography of nationhood.\u201d In Adesanmi\u2019s view, \u201cIf Sanusi takes no prisoners in his critique of Northern society, understandings of Islam, and Northern political elite, do not expect him to take prisoners in his critique of Yoruba and Igbo societies and their respective political leaders and structures.\u201d\n\nThe issue of restructuring is all the rage in modern-day Nigeria. Sanusi controversially wades into the matter, noting \u201cthat the Igbo were the prime movers of the first successful military mutiny which eliminated the political leaders and senior officers of the North and West while letting-off those of the East.\u201d He then follows to formula by indicting the Igbo and General JTU Ironsi for promulgating the military Decree 34 of May 1966 that transformed the Federation to a Unitary State. Of course the North has used the unitary status over the years more than all others to further prebendalism.\n\nSanusi condemns the bigotry and chauvinism of his fellow Northern Muslims for raising hell over President \u201cObasanjo\u2019s appointment of Northern Christians into his cabinet\u201d, and then goes ahead to cite the instance of \u201cRetired Christian Generals, from Takum to Zangon-Kataf, who find themselves overshadowed by more junior, but Muslim, Generals in the North, take out their frustration by financing and coordinating religious conflicts. One of them has already been convicted once.\u201d History always has its two sides and more.\n\nIn his take of what he entitles \u201cThe Yoruba Factor And Area-Boy Politics\u201d, Sanusi avers that the Yoruba political leadership, in line with the view of Balarabe Musa, \u201chas shown itself over the years to be incapable of rising above narrow tribal interests and reciprocating goodwill from other sections of the country by treating other groups with respect. Practically every crisis in Nigeria since independence has its roots in this attitude.\u201d\n\nSanusi\u2019s litany of charges on the Yoruba runs thus: \u201cThe Yoruba elite were the first, in 1962, to attempt a violent overthrow of an elected government in this country. In 1966, it was the violence in the West which provided the avenue for the putsch of January 15. After Chief Awolowo lost to Shagari in the 1983 elections, it was the discontent and bad publicity in the South-West which led to the Buhari intervention. When Buhari jailed UPN Governors like Ige and Onabanjo, the South-Western press castigated that essentially good government and provided the right mood for IBB to take over power.\u201d\n\nOn his topic, \u201cThe Igbo Factor And The Reasonable Limits Of Retribution\u201d, Sanusi writes: \u201cThe Northern Bourgeoisie and the Yoruba Bourgeoisie have conspired to keep the Igbo out of the scheme of things. In the recent transition, when the Igbo solidly supported the PDP in the hope of an Ekwueme presidency, the North and the South-West treated this as a Biafra agenda.\u201d Sanusi then warns that \u201cthe nation is sitting on a time-bomb\u201d because the young oppressed Igbo may not take the marginalization for much longer and \u201cwill soon decide that it is better to fight their war\u2026\u201d\n\nIn all, Sanusi\u2019s ideas are progressive and on the side of the masses. He weighs in radically \u201con the islamisation of politics and the politicisation of islam\u201d; rises up \u201cin defence of Reverend Father Kukah\u201d; dispassionately intervenes on \u201cpolitics and Shari\u2019ah in Northern Nigeria\u201d; and deliberates insightfully on \u201cIslamic Theology and Philosophy.\u201d\n\nThe revelation, for me, of For The Good Of The Nation is the depiction of Sanusi Lamido Sanusi as a feminist. The issue of women in Islam is one turf where angels fear to tread, but Sanusi refuses to be deterred. In two and a half years of becoming Governor of the Central Bank, he appointed seven female directors, even as only four women had ever been appointed directors in the 50 years of the existence of the Central Bank before his appointment.\n\nFor peace and equity to take over in Nigeria, committed change-agents like Sanusi are needed from all sections of Nigeria, especially in the conservative North, \u201cto bring together good Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo, Ogoni and Angas men and women; good Christians and Muslims; to run the affairs of this country\u2026\u201d\n\nFor The Good Of The Nation \u2013 Essays And Perspectives by Sanusi Lamido Sanusi is a wake-up call for the rebirth of Nigeria. Controversial books change nations. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi is in the great company of firebrands like Thomas Paine.",

One will urge Buhari to caution his Aides.\n\n\u201cHow old was Femi Adesina when the civil war broke out in 1967 that he seems to know more of what happened?

          "text": "By Vincent Akanmode\n\nOne phenomenon for which the Buhari administration will be easily remembered even long after it has departed is the issue of banditry. While the problem was not entirely new to the country before President Muhammadu Buhari assumed office in 2015, it has since evolved into a monster that threatens the very foundation of the country. Whereas it was initially limited to some parts of the north before 2015, there is no part of the country now where the people can walk without watching their backs or sleep with both eyes closed. The ugly development has drawn the country into the realm of Thomas Hobbes\u2019 state of nature where life, according to the 17th Century British political philosopher, was solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.\n\nEach passing day, the nation wakes up to the news of hordes of people abducted on their journeys, in their homes, at their places of work or even at worship centres by dare-devil gunmen demanding abominable sums as ransoms. And the dimensions the demands for ransom have assumed are both befuddling and frightening.\n\nIn Kaduna State, for instance, poor parents had to cough out a whopping N180 million to secure the release of 13 students abducted from Greenfield University after 38 days in kidnappers\u2019 den. The parents told of how they sold their property to raise the said sum paid to the gunmen who invaded the university campus on April 20 and took away 18 students and three members of the institution\u2019s staff. One of the students had been killed during the raid while another five were shot dead by the kidnappers in their den to drive home the threat that they would all be killed if a ransom of N800 million was not paid on time.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn Zamfara State, there were reports of some bandits\u2019 leaders making it a condition for farmers in some communities to work on their (bandits\u2019) farmlands before they would be allowed to cultivate their own farmlands as the planting season approached. The hapless farmers had no choice but to comply. A resident of Babbar Doka community was quoted as saying that farmers from Kura Mota, Ruwan Mesa, Unguwar Makeri, Mai Taushi, Danbaure, Hayin Madi and Chabi loaded in three Canter trucks were made to work on the farm of a notorious bandits\u2019 leader known as Black. Some desperate communities have also had to negotiate with bandits on the monthly sum they would have to remit for the residents to live in peace.\n\nIn some communities, residents have formed themselves into cooperative societies for the purpose of raising the sum needed as ransom each time a member or their relations are kidnapped while others have resorted to borrowing money from banks to pay the ransoms demanded for the release of their loved ones from kidnappers\u2019 dens. Invariably, the nation is faced with the rise of billionaires who add no other value to the GDP than threaten people\u2019s lives with AK-47 rifles. And the fear of these gun-wielding bandits appears to have been compounded by the rise of another set of bandits who wield no guns but whose actions are not any less lethal with regard to the nation\u2019s finances.\n\nIn recent weeks, the news media have been awash with stories of mind-boggling sums pilfered from the public purse. There were reports during the week of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) recovering the sum of N1 billion from the bank account of a federal permanent secretary. EFCC Chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, had hinted at it last month while appearing before the Senate Committee on Finance. \u201cWe have recovered over N1 billion sitting in the account of a civil servant last week,\u201d he said. During the week also, the EFCC boss spoke of a female minister who allegedly bought $37 million worth of property from a bank and made a cash deposit of $20 million conveyed from her residence with a bullion van. Appearing at the ministerial briefing organized by the presidential communication team at the Presidential Villa on Thursday, Bawa also revealed the discovery of the sum of N6 billion stolen from the treasury of an unnamed state.\n\nThe rise of civil bandits like the unnamed minister and the permanent secretary is seen by many as the fallout of armed banditry. Many public office holders are now desperate to store up as much money as possible so they would be in a position to easily pay whatever sum is demanded as ransom when they or their loved ones are abducted. It is the unfortunate consequence of the failure of the nation\u2019s leadership to nip banditry in the bud and heed the age-long aphorism that a stitch in time saves nine. Now the nation\u2019s wealth is being redistributed in a way that individuals and groups whose activities add nothing to the gross domestic product (GDP) are in control of its wealth. That partly explains the galloping inflation that has become the lot of the country and why the naira continues to crumble against other currencies like a pack of cards.",

          "text": "By Elo Edremoda, Warri\n\nThere is controversy surrounding the death of a 14-year-old child, identified simply as Aghogho, who was last Sunday, killed by a stray bullet at Old Welfare Street in Igbudu community, Warri South council area of Delta state.\n\nSources said the victim was hit by a stray bullet from gunshots fired by soldiers manning a security post in the area and who were trying to avert a clash between rival cult groups around 7p.m.\n\nAnother report claims the bullet was fired by suspected cultists during the skirmish.\n\nThe victim, an only child, was reportedly running an errand for her mother when she met her untimely end.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the gun was fired by the soldiers or cult boys. All we know is that when the gun was shot, a bullet hit Aghogho, a girl of about 14 years whom, her mother, had sent on an errand that evening,\u201d a source narrated.\n\nIt was gathered that when the family of the deceased approached the soldiers over the incident, they denied firing shots, directing the bereaved family to go to the community boys.\n\nBut a group, Delta Communities Transparency Advocacy Initiative (DCTAI), has accused the soldiers who are attached to 3 Battalion, Sector 1 Command, of being responsible for the death of the teenager.\n\nIn a statement made available to newsmen in Warri, the group insisted that its findings revealed that the rival cult clash involved the use of only dangerous weapons such as knives, cutlasses and broken bottles until soldiers arrived at the scene.\n\nThe statement signed by the national coordinator and secretary of DCTAI,\n\nChief Matthew Edafe and Comrade Philip Onokpite, asserted that while trying to disperse the warring cultists, a bullet from the shots fired by the soldiers struck the young girl.\n\n\u201cShortly after we received the report of how a teenage girl by name Aghogho, was hit by a stray bullet that later took her life, we decided to commence an independent investigation into the case to ascertain the true position of what actually transpired at the scene that ill-fated day.\n\n\u201cOur on-the-spot assessment of the scene of the incident revealed that the supremacy tussle between two rival cult groups in the area which had been going on for quite some time in Igbudu community and its environs started again that day at about 5;30pm from a beer parlour and later snowballed into a free for all fights among members of the rival cult groups in the area.\n\n\u201cWe were made to understand by the residents of the area that the fracas between the cult groups which lasted almost two hours saw the engagement of dangerous weapons like axe knives, cutlasses and broken bottles by the cult members, all through the period the violent clash lasted and there was no gunshot heard.\n\n\u201cIt was at about 7pm when the Soldiers from the 3 Battalion under Sector 1 Command, \u2018Operation Delta Safe\u2019 arrived the scene and in attempt to disperse the cultists fired warning shots into the air and it was one of the bullets that actually strayed to hit the teenager who happened to be an only child sent on an errand by her mother.\n\n\u201cWe are hereby using this medium to appeal to the soldiers of the 3Battalion, Effurun Barracks to accept the fact that the sad incident was due to the carelessness of its men and take full responsibility for their professional misconduct that led to the death of the young girl,\u201d the statement concluded.\n\nIn a swift reaction to the allegation, the Commanding Officer (R) 3 Battalion, Effurun Barracks, Uvwie LGA, Major Bala, dismissed the claim of the group, stating that his men carried out the intervention operation to restore peace to the troubled area with utmost care and professionalism.\n\nHe described as false the claim that there was no gunshot in the area until his men arrived, stating that it was the sporadic gun shootings from the scene that attracted his men who were stationed at a nearby checkpoint in the community.\n\nHe said that some cultists were seen carrying double barrel rifles and shooting at each other before the arrival of his men.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBala added that it would require a ballistic expert to determine the exact bullet that killed the deceased with both the entry and exit point in her body taking into cognisance an\u010f also the distance at which the bullet hit the victim must be established to be able to confirm the allegation made by the group.\n\nMeanwhile, residents of Old Welfare Street have decried the incessant activities of cultists, who fight, kill and break into people\u2019s houses to steal valuables.\n\n\u201cNobody is safe in my area; cultists walk around with guns day and night. It is either they are fighting, killing or breaking into people\u2019s houses to steal.\n\n\u201cThough the community is Igbudu community, we cannot go and complain to them because it seems that the community boys and Hausa boys (who are cultists) are the perpetrators of this evil,\u201d a resident of the area lamented.",

          "title": "Charly Boy @ 71 Injustice in Nigeria stinks",
          "text": "By Oscar Nwogu\n\nCharles Chukwuemeka Oputa popularly known as Charly Boy is an enigma of some sort. As maverick as he is, he cannot stop pulling stunts here and there. On June 19, 2020, the ever-bubbly punk king celebrated his 70th birthday with little or no fanfare owing largely to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOne year after, the general feeling is that Charly Boy would mark his 71st birthday today, Saturday June 19. But the weird one has pulled his stunt again, defying all logic, as he vowed to mark another 70th birthday. According to him, he has commenced his backward aging process and would be celebrating his 69th birthday next year, as against marking 72.\n\nAsked why he prefers to count his age backward rather than upward, the musician, producer and activist says there is nothing to celebrate going forward. \u201cThe government in power has not done anything to put smiles on the faces of Nigerians. It is confusion, agitation, rape, killings, maiming, stagnation, nepotism, tribalism and clownishness everywhere. There is no hope for the common man. Since there is nothing to celebrate, I would rather remark my 70th birthday this year. Next year, I will mark 69, a process of aging backwards,\u201d he explained.\n\nHowever, Charly Boy will today celebrate his aging backward birthday with the launch of his EP titled, Odudubariba, which simply means a spiritual warrior. \u201cYes, it\u2019s again my second 70th birthday; next year, I will be 69, and henceforth will continue my backward aging. With the mood of the country and its people, we will keep the celebration simple and low-keyed. I am doing this for my fans and myself. What we are going through in Nigeria today is decades of inaction, docility and my thief better pass your thief mentality. We have been living on corruption money since the \u201860s.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t continue to live as one if we can\u2019t come to the table to resolve our differences. The injustice in Nigeria stinks, that\u2019s why many regions want to go their separate ways. From day one, the foundation of this country was faulty, a scam, and the constitution, fraudulent. We can\u2019t make progress with a faulty foundation. We have no choice but to reap what we have sowed over the years. It\u2019s unfortunate but that\u2019s the reality of our time,\u201d he said.\n\nAre we expecting fireworks, protests and all sort of razzmatazz from Charly Boy as he counts his age backward? His response: \u201cThe mood in the country doesn\u2019t call for any fireworks, say who die? It\u2019s time for deep, meaningful reflection about our dangerous predicament. I\u2019m not insensitive to the pain my people are passing through. I have retired from active street protest, which has not yielded much with the bunch of people in government today. Two years ago, I retired from active street protest after giving it my all for 45 years. I am not a professional protester. I have reviewed my strategy and I am deploying my frustrations through my music, hence my coming back to one of the powerful tools of resistance: music.\u201d\n\nThe Charly Boy brand means different things to different people. His alternative lifestyle and political views have brought in its wake a mix of bad admirers and haters. On the choice of his outrageous brand, the controversial musician says, \u201cI built this youthful brand to shock and awe ignorant, mongoparkish, analogue, outdated, stupid and idiotic Nigerians out of their potopoto mindset.\u201d\n\nAs president of the Performing Musicians Employers Association of Nigeria (PMAN) many years ago, Charly Boy did not only restore respect and dignity of the Nigerian musicians, he also fought piracy and ensured that artistes had a strong voice in the affairs of the industry. \u201cAs PMAN president, I fought for more respect for the Nigerian artiste, I fought for more money, fought for their intellectual property rights. Today, the Nigerian music and musicians are reaping the fruits of our struggles back in the day.\u201d\n\nThe Area Fada, as he is popularly called, believes that the Nigerian youths need reawakening of their mindset. \u201cIt\u2019s either they are vexed enough to understand what is about to happen or happening to them or they are too scared and rigid to act. It is the docility of the youths that has contributed to my decision to stay on my own and use music, which is a stronger tool, to fight for the people.\n\n\u201cI still believe that the salvation of this country lies in the hands of its exceptional youths. I still can\u2019t see how these ancestors from the 18th century can defeat the millennial of the 21st century. This oppressive government can\u2019t operate in perpetuity. It has an expiration date. But for sure, there will be consequences for our docility over the years. Before it gets better, it will get worse. How do we reason with barbarians and animals in human skin? There is a demonic wind blowing across the country now. Prayers alone can never solve this, we must resolve to strategically push back or accept our fate as slaves,\u201d he averred.\n\nHowever, the veteran musician believes that all hope is not lost for Nigeria. \u201cThere is hope for the country,\u201d he enthused, \u201cit is still the exceptional few, Nigerian youths, that will remedy this country when the chips are down.\u201d\n\nAny regrets? Charly Boy retorted: \u201cRegrets? No. Life is a journey of twists and turns. I have lived a charming life, 90 per cent of the time on my own terms and rules. I was the underdog no one gave a chance. I have lived several lives in one and I am not your regular everyday Nigerian, I am a limited edition. I have no damn regrets. My life is better than most Hollywood fiction. I will forever be my authentic self. I\u2019ll forever keep pushing my dreams with consistency, tenacity, sagacity, audacity and tremendous focus.\u201d",

But by the time it was over, it left five people dead, scores injured, some of them critically, 25 cars burnt and one building structure in complete ruins.\n\nThere is, perhaps, no better way to describe the ruins and destruction caused by the liquefied petroleum tanker explosion that shook Mobolaji Johnson Way, Ikeja, Lagos, to its foundation on Thursday night, precisely at about 11p.m. Said to have been caused by a leaking valve of a moving tanker, it ignited a huge fireball that practically licked up every combustible item on its path. Affected mostly are business owners and employees at Ogun State Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) Plaza, Ikeja.\n\nA vulcanizer who lost two cars given to him to sell to the inferno, became the object of pity of sympathizers when he lamented that he wa finished as he didn\u2019t know what to do or to tell the owners.\n\nMany hours later, the smoldering scene still points to a tragedy of immense proportion. Initial report claimed that 13 people, nine males, four females, sustained various degrees of burns in the incident, which occurred in front of the popular Sheraton Hotel, Ikeja. The Acting Zonal Coordinator, South West Zonal Office of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Mr. Ibrahim Farinloye, informed newsmen that three bodies were initially recovered from the scene of the explosion. But the number later increased to five.\n\nThe affected victims are being attended to at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), he added. \u201cOnly four of the critically injured were transferred to Burn Centre, General Hospital Gbagada at about 0230hours today. The yet-to-be-identified bodies were recovered from the generator house of OPIC Plaza and the restaurant,\u201d he said. \u201cSearch-and-rescue is still ongoing at the collapsed buildings.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the LPG tanker exploded at about 10.32 hours. The resulting fire travelled with the wind to the premises of Ogun State Property Investment Company (OPIC) Plaza, besides Sheraton Hotel and housing different commercial outfits, including the Chinese Restaurant.\n\nProviding an update on the incident, he said: \u201cThe fire was put out at about 0030 hours following concerted efforts by five fire trucks from Lagos State Fire Service and two from LASEMA Response Unit. Preliminary assessment on vehicles damaged indicated that about 25 were burnt. Comprehensive post-disaster assessment on the extent of general damages would be done later. The Commissioner of Police, Lagos Command, Hakeem Odumosu was at hand and took charge of crowd control and normalised the situation for a successful operation. NEMA, LASTMA, State Fire Service, FRSC and NSCDC were at the scene.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the inferno was reported to have led to the quick evacuation of all guests at Sheraton Hotel. It later led to a heavy traffic congestion that grounded movements on all entrances/exits routes to Ikeja and trapped motorists for several hours. Some of the affected motorists, who made short videos of the incident, blamed the slow response by emergency services for the escalation of the inferno. The videos shared on social platforms showed aggrieved onlookers lamenting how long it took rescuers \u2013 some claimed it was more than 30 minutes \u2013 to get to the scene of the fire incident.\n\nThe Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), in a short message, said all emergency workers were at the scene working to contain the situation. The Director General (DG), Dr. Femi Oke-Osanyintolu said that the information gathered at the scene revealed that the fire started as a result of explosion while the gas tanker was moving inward Ikeja.\n\nVictims and eyewitness accounts\n\nOscar Odion, a dispatch rider with Sandra Logistics and an eyewitness of the ensuing horror, said that he was on his way back from the day\u2019s work when he saw the fire. Cries of agony rent the air as fire fighters battled hard against the enraging and spreading flame. Smokes and fire billowed from the bodies of people caught in the resultant melee. Some tried to escape only to get crushed by escaping motorists.\n\nHis account: \u201cIt happened around 11 pm yesterday while I was on my way home. I was riding with a friend when we saw the fire. We saw people struggling to escape. A child lay abandoned on the floor. I watched as the building collapsed. We tried to curtail the spread of the fire before fire service people arrived. A guy tried to rescue a victim trapped in the fire. Another guy saved from the fire got knocked down by a vehicle on motion. We mainly engaged ourselves in fetching water from the tap in the compound, because fire service men from the first fire service truck that arrived the scene claimed not to have water. As the fire spread we could not stand and do nothing.\u201d\n\nOluwaseun Olowaremi Peters, a driver with Oasis Supermarket, was not only an eyewitness but much more importantly a survivor of the inferno. When our reporter met him he was in a sober mood and busy quietly telling few people around him how he narrowly escaped death. Donning a pair of oversized black trousers and with his hands folded in praying position, to signify his gratitude to God, he said:\n\n\u201cI wanted to watch the football match. But on realizing that the bet9ja shop had closed, I went back to my car to rest my head and listen to the commentary of the game. But not long after I woke up from sleep to have my night prayer, because I had decided not to go home, I heard a big bang. It was like the sound of a thunder. Everywhere was covered with acrid smoke so much that I could not see. It was painful to the eyes. When I realized it was not raining, I quickly ran out.\n\n\u201cAs I was trying to escape, my trousers got caught up somewhere. I tore it and jumped outside as I saw the enraging fire coming towards me. I thank God that my car\u2019s door opened at once because if it had not, I would have been trapped in the fire. When I jumped from the fence, I landed inside a gas storage tank. All my body became cold up till my toenails. I was immobilized; I could not move. All the same I mustered strength and escaped.\u201d\n\nMuritala Mudasiru, a vulcanizer who lost two cars and two machines to the inferno, was being consoled by friends as he stood behind the yellow demarcating tape, furtively gazing into space.\n\n\u201cI was here till 10 pm before I left for home,\u201d he explained. \u201cI first got the call that a gas trailer had spoiled and released some gas. The fire came from the New China Restaurant. I lost two vulcanizing machines and two cars, Mazda and Toyota Corolla, kept in my custody for sale.\u201d\n\nA little tension rose up yesterday between a team of police officers and some of the victims when the security officers tried to clear and cordon off the scene. One of the victims who gave his name as Niyi decried the police\u2019s attempt to treat him like a miscreant and vehemently objected to it.\n\nLagos State Government has commiserated with Ogun State Government and the families of those who died in the aftermath of the gas explosion which affected OPIC Plaza in Ikeja.\n\nThe State Commissioner for Special Duties and Intergovernmental Relations, Mr Tayo Bamgbose-Martins issued the condolence message during an assessment visit to the scene of the fire incident\n\nMr Bamgbose-Martins who was in company of his Physical Planning counterpart, Mr Idris Salako, the Commissioner of Police and other key government officials described the incident as very devastating. He assured that due diligence would be done and necessary measures implemented to prevent a reoccurrence.\n\nDirector-General of the State Emergency Management Agency, LASEMA, Dr Femi Oke-Osanyintolu stated that instead of milling round scenes of emergencies and sending wrong or conflicting information on social media, residents should always report incidents via the 112 and 767 toll free emergency numbers.\n\nThe LASEMA DG disclosed that the carcass of the gas tanker and truck had been evacuated and forensic evidence would be gathered to ascertain whether the recommended safety measures were violated.",

          "text": "From Priscilla Ediare, Ado-Ekiti\n\nThe Ekiti State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), has again suspended two members of the party over alleged affiliations with South West Agenda for 2023 (SWAGA), a political platform rooting for the Presidential aspiration of the former Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nThe two victims, Messrs Kayode Adetifa and Jide Oso, were APC members in Ward 9, Owaye Quarters in Ayede Ekiti, Oye Local Government Area of the state.\n\nThe Chairman of Ward 08, Ado-Ekiti Local Government, Mr. Clement Afolabi, was in April suspended over a similar offence.\n\nEkiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi, is believed in some quarters to be nursing presidential ambition\n\nThe suspension, contained in two separate letters, was signed by the ward executives, led by the chairman, Abejide Sola.\n\nThe letters dated May 31, 2021, stated : \u201cWe noted from your activities in the party in the recent past that you have been working against the unity of the party even to the extent of creating a parallel ward that you named \u201cSWAGA\u201d within the ward .\n\n\u201cIn view of the above reasons the general executive of the ward met 27th May, 2021 and decided to suspend you for running against the party (APC) Constitution till further notice.\u201d\n\nResponding, the APC Publicity Secretary, Hon. Ade Ajayi, said the two were disciplined by party leaders for factionalising the party, saying the suspension has nothing to do with SWAGA.\n\nAjayi, who is also from Ayede Ekiti, said the report from the ward indicated that the two were defying party\u2019s orders and dividing the party through their actions\n\n\u201cThey were not suspended because of SWAGA. But they have been dividing the party and all efforts to rein them in failed,\u201d he said.",

          "title": "Student Dies in Crossfire as Troops Free Five Kebbi School Abductees",
          "text": "\u2022Bagudu visits school, promises all abductees will be rescued\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Ismail Adebayo in Birnin Kebbi\n\nOne of the students abducted by bandits who attacked the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi State, last Thursday night has died during a crossfire between the kidnappers and security agents.\n\nThe kidnappers, who stormed the school in large number, were armed with sophisticated weapons, abducted 30 students, and killed a policeman. A teacher, a vice-principal, the school\u2019s security officer, and the wife of a teacher, were also abducted.\n\nGovernor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State visited the affected school yesterday, where he met with the parents, and promised that all abducted students would be freed.\n\nThe shootout that claimed the life of the student happened yesterday morning when the fleeing kidnappers ran into men of the Joint Taskforce of Operation Hadarin Daji in the North-West Zone, at a roadblock, while heading out of Kebbi State.\n\nAccording to the Deputy Force Commander, Operation Hadari Daji, Air Commodore Abubakar Abdulkadir, as a result of the duel, the bandits were forced to abandon five students and a teacher.\n\nSadly, one of the students, who was unidentified, died in the crossfire. No further detail was given on how the death occurred.\n\nAbdulkadir said: \u201cIn the early hours of this morning, we came across the kidnappers. They came to our blocking point, and we engaged them. At that point, they abandoned five of the students and one of the teachers. Unfortunately, I think we lost one of the students.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Army in a statement yesterday confirmed the death of the student but attributed the death to \u201cexhaustion during a rescue operation as troops of Operation Hadarin Daji engaged kidnappers in a fire-fight, culminating in the rescue of five students and two teachers of Federal Government College, Yauri.\u201d\n\nA statement issued by the Army Spokesman, Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu, said troops had launched a manhunt for the kidnappers and bandits, following the abduction of the students.\n\n\u201cThe rescue followed an initial encounter with the abductors in the early hours of today (yesterday) 18 June 2021 after trailing the kidnappers from Yauri through Riyao to Sombo community, where the kidnappers who had split into two groups fled, with one group conveying the abducted children, while the second group conveyed rustled cattle,\u201d it said.\n\nThe update on the abduction said the land troops in conjunction with elements of the Nigerian Air Force, who provided close air support during the rescue mission, intercepted the two groups at about 2.30 am.\n\nIt said the troops also recovered 800 cattle rustled by the bandits and maintained that the gallant troops were still on the heels of the kidnappers to rescue the remaining abductees still in captivity.\n\n\u201cThe rescued teachers and students will be handed over to the Kebbi State Government. The Nigerian Army appreciates the cooperation so far from good-spirited citizens and wishes to solicit more. \u201cThe Chief of Army Staff Maj Gen Faruk Yahaya has directed the commander to spare no effort until all the abducted persons are safely rescued and reunited with their loved ones,\u201d it said.\n\nThe rescued students and teachers are currently receiving medical treatment at the Yauri General Hospital.\n\nBagudu Promises Freedom for Abducted Students\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Bagudu yesterday met with parents of abducted Yauri students at the school premises, assuring them that they would be rescued soon.\n\nHe assured the parents that the state government, relevant security agencies, and the presidency were working together to rescue the student from the bandits.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe will do anything to bring the children back. We have already engaged the necessary security agencies and they are working to rescue them. All we need to do we have done. What we need from you are your prayers and support.\u201d\n\nBagudu said the state government was alerted two weeks ago that the bandits were sighted around the school area, adding: \u201cWe planned to move them but the school authorities said the students have two weeks left to write their final exams. For this, the commissioner of police was gracious enough to dispatch 22 men and officers from the counter-terrorism unit to the school but they were overpowered because the bandits came in hundreds.\u201d\n\n\u2018How Bandits Took Our Children Away\u2019\n\nWorried parents of the abducted Yauri students yesterday narrated to Governor Bagudu how the bandits came in hundreds, overran the security at the school, and went away with many students.\n\nA parent and one of the cooks engaged for the security personnel deployed to the school, Mrs. Aliheri Gabonchok said she was at the kitchen when the bandits stormed the premises and started shooting sporadically.\n\nShe said: \u201cWhen they came, I rushed into hiding with some of the students I could gather. I told them to lie down till the gunshot subsided. I came out when they had left, only to hear from other staff, who also escaped, that they went away with some students, school staff, and even my husband.\u201d\n\nAnother parent, Ainan Muhammed, said the bandits who invaded the school were about 400.\n\nAnother parent, Aliyu Wushishi said his five children were among those abducted by the bandits and appealed to the governor to do whatever he could do to rescue the students from the bandits.\n\nThe Emir of Yauri, Dr. Sayyanu Abdullahi charged the government to have the political will to deal with banditry.\n\nThe emir also said people in the various communities should see it as their duty to expose those serving as informants to bandits in their communities.\n\nThe royal father gave the charge when governor Badugu visited his palace in Yauri after meeting with some parents of the abducted students.\n\nVehicle Used for Abduction\n\nMeanwhile, the police command in Kebbi State yesterday explained that one of the vehicles used for the kidnaping belongs to a high court judge in the state.\n\nNafi\u2019u Abubakar, the Kebbi police spokesman, said the van was hijacked by bandits on Birnin Yauri road.\n\nAbubakar said the police are yet to determine the number of students kidnapped from the school located in Ngaski LGA of the state.\n\nHe said the reports making the rounds that 50 students were kidnapped from the school were false.\n\nThe Kebbi police spokesman said: \u201cThe attention of the police has been drawn to reports made by some media stations that a police vehicle was used in kidnapping about 50 students of the FGC. A White Hilux Van with registration No. kBSJ 29 belonging to a High Court judge with the inscription of Kebbi State Judiciary, hijacked by bandits on Birnin Yauri road was the one used in the kidnapping and not a police vehicle as stated by some media stations.\n\n\u201cThe command wishes to make it clear and set the records straight that yet to be ascertained number of students are still missing as rescue operation is still ongoing.\u201d\n\nThough the Kebbi State Government and the school\u2019s authorities are yet to release the official number of students and staff abducted in the school, unofficial sources said, in all, 30 students and four officials were kidnapped.\n\n\u201c25 students and two officials of the school are still with the kidnappers,\u201d said a source close to the school.\n\nYauri Lawmaker Laments\n\nThe lawmaker representing the Igaski/Shanga/Yauri in Kebbi State at the House of Representatives, Yusuf Sununu, has lamented attacks by bandits in Kebbi State.\n\nSununu warned that the growing insecurity in Kebbi State was a major threat to food security in the country.\n\nSununu said the pervading insecurity in the country was becoming worrisome, saying, \u201cgone are the days when Kebbi used to be the most peaceful in the country.\n\n\u201cA week ago, we had another calamity when bandits \u2013 according to eyewitnesses \u2013 numbering about 250 to 300, each with an AK-47 rifle and using very strong motorcycles, came into my constituency. They had a field day and operated for more than eight hours, going from house to house, room to room, collecting money, handsets, motorcycles, and cattle. That led to a massive influx of internally displaced persons to the headquarters of the emirate in the town of Yauri.\n\n\u201cHowever, we were able to convince people and they started going back to their respective areas. But they (bandits) left a message that they would be coming back. Taking it seriously, some people refused to go back, and in the early hours of today, they repeated what they had done earlier, and they came into the constituency, somehow around 10:30 am or thereabout. They were able to gain access after strong fights with some security guards and policemen guarding the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, and they made their way into the school.\n\n\u201cThis is a cause for concern and as representative of the people, I had to come here and make a call on the Federal Government to look at Yauri\u2019s position with its neighbouring Niger State. It has direct access to Zamfara State and west of Yauri is the bank of River Niger. We fear that their major target is to enter Yauri. Now, we are calling on the Federal Government to provide adequate security. I have got in touch with security agencies. We had discussions and it has been confirmed to me that military aircraft are in surveillance in the area.\n\n\u201cWe have to make it clear that Kebbi State and indeed Yauri holds a unique position in the food security of this country. Over 90 per cent of the land of Yauri is for rice farming. But as of today, no farmer can comfortably go back to his farm and farm and come back to sleep with his eyes closed.\n\n\u201cWe are right now facing an influx of some people into Yauri with a higher rate of internally displaced persons. Accommodation, feeding, and other necessary logistics are being affected. The worst part of it is that a nation can only develop when it is sound educationally.\n\n\u201cThe so-called Boko Haram is almost becoming a reality because parents cannot feel free to send their wards to school for fear of being kidnapped. As it is now, a lot of primary schools in the emirate in Yauri town are being occupied by IDPs. This tends to deter the progress so far achieved by the Kebbi State Government in terms of agriculture and in terms of promoting access to education.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Osinbajo: Corporate bodies must ensure accountability in service provision\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday charged the MTN Group to make its services affordable and in high quality to its Nigerian subscribers.\n\nThe President\u2019s charge came the same day Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo urged corporate organisations operating in Nigeria, including the MTN, to ensure there is accountability in the provision of services to customers and to pay greater attention to the needs of the people.\n\nSpeaking yesterday at the State House, Abuja when he received in audience members of the board of MTN Group led by its President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Mupita, President Buhari said: \u201cNigeria is your most lucrative market in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, as well as the source of a third of the income of the entire MTN Group. As such, we urge you to offer top-of-the-range and affordable service to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs we seek to make broadband widely available and affordable, we urge MTN to continue to support our efforts by expanding high quality connectivity to Nigerians in unserved and underserved areas.\u201d\n\nThe President also called on the group to support the implementation of the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in the Nigerian telecommunications sector.\n\n\u201cI recently unveiled and launched the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in the Nigerian telecommunications sector. I call on MTN to support the implementation of this policy and train and engage more Nigerians in your company.\n\n\u201cIn particular, we would like you to continue to support our efforts by improving the quality of service and enabling a downward price review of the cost of data and other services, in view of your large market in Nigeria. We also urge you to step up your Corporate Social Responsibility programmes and support Research and Development that will enhance your services in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe assured his visitors that his administration was doing everything possible to make Nigeria investor-friendly by addressing identified challenges:\n\n\u201cWe are implementing a number of policies and programmes to ensure that institutions like MTN have a conducive environment for doing business in Nigeria. Our massive jump in the Global Ease of Doing Business Ranking is proof that our efforts are yielding positive results.\n\n\u201cWe have identified and addressed the key challenges that affected the growth of the digital economy sector. One of such challenges was the high Right of Way costs and another was the vandalism of critical national infrastructure.\n\n\u201cI am happy to note that the Right of Way charges have now been pegged at a maximum of N145/linear metre and I have given directives for the protection of critical national infrastructure and this has addressed the issue of vandalism of such infrastructure. Service providers should always appreciate the effort of government and not undermine it.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari expressed his delight that the Information and communications technology sector was doing very well despite the global economic downturn.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe information and communications technology sector was the fastest growing sector in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and the entire year 2020, based on the report by the National Bureau of Statistics. The sector\u2019s 14.70% double digit growth rate played a principal role in supporting our country to exit the recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe growth rate of the sector exceeded four times the next fastest growing sector of Q4 2020, which had a growth rate of 3.42%. This is truly commendable.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Osinbajo, delivered his message on Thursday when he received members of the board of telecoms giant, MTN, led by the company\u2019s Group President and CEO, Mr Ralph Mupita, on a courtesy visit to the Presidential Villa.\n\nHe stated that it was critical for corporate organisations to show commitment to improving services and to build confidence in the people.\n\nWhile noting that there have been hiccups in the relationship, the VP commended MTN for its contribution to the country, adding that the company is clearly an important part of Nigeria\u2019s story.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cCorporate organisations should be more accountable in their services, in the ownership structure, and also in paying attention to the needs of the people. Companies that ensure this will experience progress, as this is the right direction to go. Going forward, most corporates will find that attaching greater importance to the people is the way to go.\n\n\u201cFor telecommunication firms like MTN, financial inclusion is crucial, so is broadband connection in deepening access and will help to connect hard-to-reach places, and to retail social welfare and services. The company\u2019s investment was crucial when Nigeria needed to show that not only is there a large population in the country, but that it is a large market. The market was severely underestimated for a long time. So, MTN is an important part of our story, we regard MTN as an important partner.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier, Mupita said that they want to deepen structure of ownership in Nigeria.\n\nWhile disclosing that the company wants to have the largest retail-based shareholding in Nigeria, Mupita said they plan to sell another 14 per cent to Nigerian individuals and institutions.\n\nHe added that MTN as a corporate citizen is responsible in all the countries where it is represented.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He succeeded Ban Ki-moon in January 2017 as the ninth secretary-general.\n\nSpeaking with journalists after taking the oath of office for a second term, Guterres said he had extended an offer to Mohammed to continue in office.\n\n\u201cAfter being elected, I have the pleasure to invite the deputy secretary-general to remain in my second mandate and I hope she will accept,\u201d Guterres said.\n\nMohammed, who was standing behind Guterres at the press briefing, responded with the comment: \u201cabsolute honour\u201d.\n\nShe had also served as the special adviser to Ban Ki-moon on post-2015 development planning, which focused on the 2030 agenda for sustainable development goals.\n\nMohammed is a diplomat and politician who is serving as the fifth Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations.\n\nPreviously, she was Nigeria\u2019s Minister of Environment from 2015 to 2016 and was a key player in the Post-2015 Development Agenda process.\n\nMohammed was born in Liverpool, UK to a Fulani Nigerian veterinarian-officer and a British nurse.

Her mandate included designing a Virtual Poverty Fund with innovative approaches to poverty reduction, budget coordination and monitoring, as well as providing advice on pertinent issues regarding poverty, public sector reform and sustainable development.\n\nMohammed later became the Founder and CEO of the Center for Development Policy Solutions and as an Adjunct Professor for the Master\u2019s in Development Practice program at Columbia University.\n\nDuring that time, she served on numerous international advisory boards and panels, including the UN Secretary-General\u2019s High-level Panel on Post-2015 Development Agenda and the Independent Expert Advisory Group on the Data Revolution for Sustainable Development.

          "text": "Festus Akanbi\n\nThe controversy surrounding the power of the President to extend the tenure of any retiring Inspector General of Police, pending the completion of the process of appointing a successor, was yesterday laid to rest with the affirmation of the President\u2019s power to do so by the ruling of a federal high court in Abuja.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had on February 4 extended the tenure of Mohammed Adamu as Inspector-General of Police by three months after he clocked the mandatory 35 years in service on February 1.\n\nHowever, a legal practitioner, Maxwell Opara, dragged the president and IGP to court, arguing that by virtue of section 215 of the Nigerian Constitution and section 7 of the Nigeria Police Act, 2020, Adamu cannot continue to function as the IGP, having completed 35 years in service.\n\nIn his defence, the IGP told the federal high court that the new Nigeria Police Act gave him a four-year tenure, which would only lapse in either 2023 or 2024.\n\nSupporting Adamu\u2019s position, President Buhari and the attorney-general of the federation, Abubakar Malami \u2013 who are the second and third defendants in the matter \u2013 told the court through their lawyer that the law permits the IGP to remain in office until either 2023 or 2024.\n\nIn his judgment yesterday, Ahmed Mohammed, the presiding judge, held that since the constitution and the police act empower the president to appoint an IGP, by implication, he could extend the tenure of a retiring IGP before concluding the required consultation with the police council and other processes required for the appointment of a substantive replacement.\n\nThe judge also observed that the constitution and the police act were silent on the issue of whether or not the president could extend the tenure of a retired IGP.\n\nSome senior advocates of Nigeria (SANs) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had assailed Buhari for extending Adamu\u2019s tenure.\n\nThey declared his action as violating the 1999 Constitution as (amended) and the Police Act (2020).\n\nMinister of Police Affairs, Mr. Mohammad Dingyadi, told State House reporters in Abuja that Adamu\u2019s tenure elongation would allow for proper screening of all qualified senior police officers before the eventual choice of a new IG.\n\nHe said then: \u201cMr. President has decided that the present IG, Mohammed Adamu, will continue to serve as the IG for the next three months to allow for a robust and efficient process of appointing a new IG.\n\n\u201cThis is not unconnected to the desire of Mr. President to not only have a smooth handover but to also ensure that the right officer is appointed into that position. Mr. President is extending by three months to allow him to get into the process of allowing a new one.\u201d\n\nAdamu was eventually retired on April 6, when the current IGP, Usman Alkali was named by the President as the acting IGP.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Urges military to ramp up fight against insurgency\n\nDeji Elumoye and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday assured residents of Borno State of the federal government\u2019s readiness to fight terrorism to the end, telling the military not to give criminals a breathing space to undermine Nigeria\u2019s interests.\n\nThe president, during a visit to Borno State, commended troops for their loyalty and selfless service to Nigeria and urged them not to relent in their efforts to end the insurgency in the North-east.\n\nHe promised support for the families of fallen security personnel, saying he would ensure all Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) return to their homes.\n\nHe also commended the state Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, for his resilience and relentless efforts in rebuilding the state.\n\nBuhari, during the visit to appraise the security situation in the state and to inaugurate some development projects attributed the recent successes recorded by the military against the insurgents and terrorists at Dikwa, Damboa and Gwoza to careful planning, infusion of new equipment and other war materials as well as quality military leadership.\n\nHe, however, acknowledged the enormity of the task ahead of the military.\n\n\u201cThe attacks launched by cowardly terrorists against military and civilian targets last month and in previous months were a pointer to us that the work of defeating insurgency and terrorism and of restoring permanent peace to this region is not yet over,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe will not rest until all the millions of Internally Displaced Persons are able to return and resettle in their homes and rebuild their shattered lives.\u201d\n\nHe expressed the hope that the service chiefs would bring to bear on the war, their experience as commanders in theatre at various times.\n\nThe president said: \u201cAll of them are, therefore, personally familiar with the challenge of insurgency. I fully expect them to bring this wealth of personal experience to bear as we move to end this scourge once and for all.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, these successes owe a lot to the role played by volunteers of the Civilian JTF, hunters and vigilantes. These good people include women, who are making huge sacrifices and patriotic contributions to our peace-restoration efforts.\u201d\n\nHe stated that many servicemen and women, as well as volunteers, had been killed in the fight to rid communities and the country of terrorism and insurgency and thanked all those involved for their gallantry and sacrifices.\n\nBuhari assured their loved ones that their sacrifices will not be in vain: \u201cI must also acknowledge the very important role and the sacrifices made by parents, guardians and other loved ones amongst the people of Borno State, the North-east region and the country as a whole, who support their sons, daughters, husbands, brothers and sisters in going to battlefields to defend Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity and peace. I thank and commend them for their resilience and assure them success is in sight.\u201d\n\nHe said it was a mark of appreciation for the sacrifices made by Borno State\u2019s volunteers that the Nigerian Army was authorised to enlist hundreds of them into the Army.\n\nHe urged the people to sustain the cooperation with the military and the other security services.\n\n\u201cBoth must see each other as being on one side in order for us to succeed,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari said the late President Idris Deby of Chad played a major role in the fight against terrorism in the Lake Chad region and urged his successors to work hard in restoring democracy to the country and support the processes of bringing peace to the region.\n\nHe said the recent appointment of Ambassador Babagana Kingibe as special envoy to Chad and the Lake Chad Basin was intended to accelerate the restoration of democratic stability in the Chad Republic and enhance cooperation among all the countries of the Lake Chad Basin.\n\nHe assured the people that the federal government had taken decisive measures to safeguard IDPs and refugees who recently returned from Cameroon and the Niger Republic, adding that it was engaged in the task of rebuilding their communities after more than a decade of war and terrorism.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt was part of these measures that I gave approval for the federal government to build 10,000 resettlement homes in Borno State. Four thousand of these homes have already been completed. Furthermore, I approved for constant release of food intervention by the Nigerian Customs Service and the North East Development Commission in order to support displaced persons.\n\n\u201cI have directed these agencies to sustain and deepen this support. I also wish to specially commend His Excellency, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum, for his tireless efforts in directly supervising the distribution of food and economic empowerment to IDPs in all local government areas.\u201d He expressed the belief that the efforts at alleviating the suffering of displaced communities will hamper attempts by terrorists and insurgents to recruit fighters and spies from IDPs and other vulnerable populations through the use of paltry material incentives.\n\nOn electricity supply, Buhari said his administration would continue to make concerted efforts towards guaranteeing energy security to all, adding that Maiduguri could not, and would not be left out.\n\nHe said the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had been directed to expedite the delivery of 50MW power plant in the state towards ensuring the restoration of electricity to Maiduguri and its environs.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, in the light of the current improvement of security in the state, I have also issued directives for the immediate resumption of oil & gas exploration activities in the Lake Chad Basin. This is part of our overall effort to restore the state back to normalcy,\u201d the president explained.\n\nThe president applauded Zulum\u2019s efforts at providing facilities that directly impact the livelihood of people, particularly building educational and health institutions and constructing roads.\n\nHe also commended the Shehu of Borno, Abubakar Ibn Umar Garbai El-Kanemi, as well as all the other royal highnesses and Bulamas at all levels for their very exemplary leadership, patience, determination and wisdom during the past decade of ravage by insurgency and terrorism.\n\nAccording to him, the fact that royal highnesses now operate from their domains was evidence that peace was being restored to the communities despite the challenges that remain to be overcome.\n\n\u201cThe elders, statesmen, Muslim and Christian community leaders all over this state and region also deserve our thanks and warm appreciation for their resilience, moral leadership and support for the federal and state governments during these trying times.\n\n\u201cI will never forget in my life that during my career as a politician, Borno State is where I got the highest percentage of votes, more than 90 per cent! The least I can do for you is to continue the relentless effort to fully restore peace to this state, the North-east region and the country as a whole,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged the military and security agencies to continue to make Nigeria proud.\n\nBuhari also interacted with some of the wounded soldiers assuring them that the government was committed to their recovery and welfare.\n\nIn his remarks, the Commander of Theatre Operations HADIN KAI, Maj. Gen.

          "text": "The Buhari administration has stepped up efforts to regulate the online media in Nigeria in what is seen by many as attempts to further stifle the civic space in the country.\n\nTwo weeks after blocking Twitter\u2019s operations, the federal government has asked the House of Representatives to enact a law that will empower the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to control all forms of internet broadcasting and social media.\n\nThe request was made on Wednesday by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, during a public hearing organised by the house committee on information, national orientation, ethics, and values on a bill to amend the NBC Act.\n\nThe commission already controls television and radio broadcasting in Nigeria, based on provisions in Section 2(b) of the NBC Act. It states that \u201cthe Commission shall have [the] responsibility of receiving, processing and considering applications for the establishment, ownership or operation of radio and television stations including cable television services, direct satellite broadcast and any other medium of broadcasting.\u201d\n\nLai Mohammed now wants the commission to also regulate the online media, in addition to other channels of broadcasting. \u201cI want to add here specifically that internet broadcasting and all online media should be included in this because we have a responsibility to monitor contents, including Twitter,\u201d the minister told lawmakers.\n\nBefore Lai Mohammed\u2019s proposal, the broadcasting regulator had asked all social media platforms and service providers in the online broadcasting space in Nigeria to apply for a broadcast licence.\n\nPossible clampdown on freedom of expression\n\nWidespread criticism has trailed the proposal by the Nigerian government, which has only further stoked concerns over a possible clampdown on free speech and internet freedom by the Buhari administration.\n\nMedia stakeholders at the public hearing kicked against the inclusion of online media under NBC\u2019s mandate, asking the panel to instead make the commission more independent of the Minister of Information.\n\nOver time, the NBC has acted as an extension of the Ministry of Information and Culture, which rarely acts independently, and thus, the commission\u2019s operations have often been subject to political interference. This was condemned by the International Press Centre (IPC) and the Centre for Media Law and Advocacy in a joint statement that called for the neutrality of the commission.\n\nAccording to Akin Akingbulu, executive director of the Institute for Media and Society, the commission should not receive directives from the information minister. \u201cThe power to give directives to the commission, vested in the minister of information in section 6 should be removed and replaced with powers which include policy formulation for the broadcasting sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial media bill through the backdoor\u201d\n\nDespite the ban on Twitter, Nigerians continue to use the platform thanks to virtual private networks (VPNs) that help bypass the suspension. Many have taken to Twitter to express criticism over the proposed regulation of online media.\n\nBREAKING: NBC Amendment Bill Is Social Media Bill Through The Backdoor \u2014 SERAP (@SERAPNigeria) June 17, 2021\n\nAmendment of the NBC act;grafting the shoot of autocracy. \u2014 Senator Shehu Sani (@ShehuSani) June 17, 2021\n\nNigeria Govt is asking House of Reps to amend the NBC Act and include \u201cinternet broadcasting\u201d.\n\n\n\nThat means all online radio/TV stations must register with NBC and Lai Mohammed. This is social media censorship brought back through the back door.\n\n\n\nLend your voice. Say no.

          "text": "Facebook, this week, said it has removed fake accounts, pages and groups that posted about news and politics ahead of Ethiopia\u2019s general election scheduled to hold next week.\n\nIn a statement published on its website, the social media giant reportedly took down 65 Facebook profiles, 52 pages, 27 groups and 32 Instagram accounts for violating its rules against misleading others about their purpose and identity.\n\nThe fake accounts mainly posted in Amharic about topics that include the Prosperity Party and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. They also criticised opposition politicians and groups in Ethiopia, such as the Oromo Liberation Front, Ethiopian Democratic Party, and the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front.\n\n\u201cThe people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts as a central part of their operations to mislead people about who they are and what they are doing, and that was the basis for our action,\u201d Facebook said.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, the fake accounts posted the same content across multiple pages and groups to grow their following, and targeted domestic audiences in its own country.\n\nRoughly 1.1 million accounts followed one or more of the Facebook pages, about 766,000 accounts joined one or more of the groups, and around 1,700 people followed one or more of the Instagram accounts.\n\n\u201cGiven the upcoming election and the ongoing tensions in Ethiopia, our teams moved as quickly as possible to complete the investigation and disrupt this operation,\u201d Gleicher said.\n\nFacebook also linked the fake accounts to individuals associated with the Information Network Security Agency (INSA) in Ethiopia.\n\nA brutal war erupted in the country\u2019s Tigray region after which the United States restricted visas for government and military officials of Ethiopia and Eritrea over allegations of human rights violations.\n\nPro-government demonstrators in Ethiopia had criticised the move by Washington and Gleicher added that the fake accounts were critical of the sanctions as well. Although they did not directly focus on the conflict in Tigray.\n\nFacebook\u2019s move comes after severe criticism it has faced in the past for not doing enough to tackle fake accounts during national elections, including in the U.S. The social network has outlined plans in preparation for the Ethiopia vote, including ways to combat misinformation and hate speech.\n\nThe June 21 general elections will see Ethiopians elect members of the House of Peoples\u2019 Representatives.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Netflix on Sunday, June 13, commenced its first 3-month Episodic Lab (EPL) and Development Executive Traineeship (DET) programmes in Africa. This is in partnership with the Realness Institute, a South Africa-based Centre for African film-makers.\n\nOver 500 applications were received from Nigeria, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe for the inaugural development lab for African writers and DET initiatives. However, only twelve professionals were selected to take part in both trainings.\n\nTwo Nigerians, Ayoade Adeyanju and Kehinde Joseph, selected to take part in EPL based on their story ideas, will get to develop their concepts with help from expert story consultants and creative producers. Other participants are Andile Ngcizela, Dominique Jossie and Kudakwashe Maradzika from South Africa and Mary Waireri from Kenya.\n\nThe lab participants will receive about $2,000 monthly stipend to enable them to focus entirely on their training, which will run remotely till September 5, 2021. At the end of the lab, each writer will have an opportunity to pitch their incubated concept to Netflix and could see their series further developed for production.\n\nMeanwhile, Ololade Okedare is the only Nigerian selected to participate in the DET, in addition to South Africans Anneke Villet, Antionette Engel and Thandeka Zwane, Damaris Irungu Ochieng\u2019 from Kenya and Lara Sousa, a Mozambican.\n\nThe executive trainees will get to immerse themselves in the story development process and receive technical training by partnering with the EPL writers to develop story concepts into quality productions.\n\nImproving storytelling in Africa\n\nThe Netflix programme is being held to strengthen the foundation of quality storytelling in Africa and is part of efforts by the global streaming giant to produce more original local content from creative writers on the continent.\n\n\u201cWithout the existence of our storytellers, our favourite Netflix stories wouldn\u2019t be possible,\u201d Alison Triegaardt, Netflix manager for Grow Creative in Africa, said. \u201cAfrica has an amazing pool of talent \u2013 both in front and behind the camera \u2013 hence Netflix is committed to investing in African stories and talent long-term.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a 5-day workshop focusing on post-production organised by Netflix is scheduled to be held later this month. The APost Lab is aimed at training film & television professionals from across Africa on technical best practices, technical and creative support methods, and methods to facilitate the best creative process.\n\nThirty-two participants have been invited to participate in the workshops while more than 100 film & TV professionals from across the continent will be part of the Masterclasses.\n\nPotential boost to subscriber base\n\nIn addition to improving quality storytelling in Africa, Netflix would most likely be looking to grow its relatively small subscriber base in the region by producing more relatable, original local content with the help of the development lab.\n\nAccording to a Digital TV Research study, Netflix currently has about 2 million subscribers in Africa, which is half of the continent\u2019s total streaming subscriber base.\n\nThere is a chance having more relatable original African content could lure more viewers on the continent to use the streaming service particularly as the London-based industry researcher estimates streaming subscriptions in Africa will reach 13 million by 2025, up from over 3.9 million in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re energised and excited by the many opportunities that lie ahead for us to help strengthen the quality of African storytelling and to bring fresh voices to our members in Africa and around the world\u201d, Triegaardt concluded.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Former Andela Community Manager, Babajide Duroshola, has stepped down as Safeboda\u2019s Country Director for Nigeria. Duroshola made this announcement today via his Twitter handle and in a Medium post.\n\nI came, I saw and conquered!!! https://t.co/vtdlgCWknP \u2014 Bab\u00e1j\u00edd\u00e9 D\u00far\u00f3sh\u1ecdl\u00e1 (@Babajiide) June 18, 2021\n\nDuroshola took over as Country Manager in 2019. This came after months of speculation regarding the Uganda-founded ride-hailing startup\u2019s launch in the country. During his tenure, the company introduced its finance offerings with users able to purchase airtime on the platform.\n\nThe startup initially announced plans to launch in Lagos following a Series B round, but that never happened. Although not the stated reason, the okada ban in Lagos meant that Safeboda had to launch in Ibadan, where ORide and MAX.ng were already present.\n\nThat decision seems to have paid off, with the company claiming to have completed 1.5 million trips and onboarded over 5,000 drivers. These appear to be impressive figures, especially when you consider that the startup said it had onboarded 2,500 riders and completed 1 million trips on the anniversary of its first year in operation.\n\nAt the time of its launch in Nigeria, there were predictions of bike-hailing wars with ORide and MAX.ng. However, in an interesting turn of events, as Safeboda launched in Ibadan, ORide exited the ride-hailing market.\n\nPerhaps to justify their decision to launch in Ibadan, Safeboda has regularly publicised the number of rides made on the platform. And with MAX.ng not doing the same, it is difficult to say if Safeboda is the dominant player in the ride-hailing industry.\n\nFounded in 2014 by Ricky Rapa Thompson, Maxime Dieudonne, and Alastair Sussock in Uganda, the startup soon spread to Kenya in 2018. However, by 2020, it announced that it was moving out of Kenya, having been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile no announcements have been made regarding Duroshola\u2019s replacement, he hinted that the startup had found a replacement internally.",

          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has announced plans to restructure the country\u2019s current licensing structure to bring it in line with global standards in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) ecosystem.\n\nThe current structure has served the industry for 18 years since its publication, and as NCC CEO, Umar Danbatta, says, it is due for an \u201curgent review\u201d.\n\nHe also set up a standing committee that would prepare reports and recommendations on existing licences, consultative fora, new licence undertakings, amendment to licence fees and durations, benchmarking of licences with similar jurisdictions, and the impact of certain licences on other licence holders.\n\nThe committee is also expected to recommend solutions and develop an updated regulatory framework for new and amended licences with a final report on the project with all recommendations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanbatta, while inaugurating the committee, said the need for the review of the existing licence structure was informed by the wide range of technological advances and the convergence of technologies and services which have characterised the global telecoms space over the years, and whose impact is increasingly being experienced in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria\u2019s licence structure\n\nNigeria currently favours a two-category regime \u2014 individual and class \u2014 for general and specific services.\n\nClass licences have a flat fee of \u20a610,000 ($24.39), while individual licences are within the range of \u20a6250,000 ($609.76) and \u20a650,000,000 ($121,952.22).\n\nThere will be amendments to fees as the committee is expected to give recommendations based on a comparative analysis of countries with similar jurisdiction.\n\nIn comparison with Nigeria, South Africa also operates a two-category licence structure, but its fees are more expensive. For class licences, they have a flat fee of R13,721 ($971.73), and for individual licences, application costs are determined by the Information Technology Association (ITA).\n\nKenya also operates the same licence regime with prices ranging from Ksh 1000 ($9.28) to Ksh 15 million ($139,146.57).\n\nConsidering all that the committee has to deliberate on, we might see significant changes such as increased licencing fees based on fees in other African countries, new licences relating to 5G implementation, mobile virtual network operators, or over-the-top licences.\n\nGlobal ICT standards\n\nAccording to the International Telecommunication Union\u2019s (ITU) 2020 Global ICT Regulatory Outlook, Nigeria is a third-generation (G3) country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo put this in context, the ITU ranks countries into five generations using Regulatory Tracker indicators divided into four pillars: Regulatory Authority, Regulatory Mandate, Regulatory Regime and Competition Framework. The Regulatory Tracker is an evidence-based tool to help decision-makers and regulators make sense of the rapid evolution of ICT.\n\nWith an overall score of 78.3, Nigeria barely passes the benchmark above G2 countries where basic reform \u2014 partial liberalisation and privatisation across all layers \u2014 occurs.\n\nThe Ethiopian government\u2019s bid to sell off its stake in Ethio Telecom gives more clarity. Before the sale of its first private national telecoms licence to Safaricom\u2019s consortium, the country ranked as a G1 country \u2014 government-owned and controlled industry.\n\nAfter the sale, it was bumped up to a G2 country because the industry had been privatised.\n\nAs a G3 country, Nigeria\u2019s ICT ecosystem enables investment, innovation and access \u2014 dual focus on stimulating competition in service and content delivery, and consumer protection.\n\nKenya is the only African country to rank as a G5 country. According to ITU\u2019s ranking, the East African nation\u2019s ICT Regulatory Framework fosters vibrant markets and is also key to finding market solutions. It also means that Kenya\u2019s ICT regulator plays a leadership role.\n\nIt\u2019s been 18 years since the last licence review. In that time, we\u2019ve seen Glo\u2019s famous per second billing that blew the market wide open, competition leading to reduced \u2014 but still expensive \u2014 data prices, 4G coverage, MainOne\u2019s fiber cable\n\nWill the door be open to new players?

          "title": "A lamplight on technology and autism spectrum disorder in Africa",
          "text": "From the Massai tribe in Kenya to the Yorubas in Nigeria, the birth of a child is a delightful and highly celebrated event in Africa. There\u2019s cooking and tons of prayers spoken over the child, and, of course, its parents are overwhelmed with a lifetime\u2019s worth of parenting advice.\n\nBut what happens when a child fails to reach expected developmental milestones? For example, how should parents handle a four-year-old who doesn\u2019t respond appropriately to things happening around, is overly sensitive to specific sights and sounds, and hasn\u2019t spoken their first words yet?\n\nIn most parts of Africa, the immediate response is fear as such challenges are believed to result from spiritual problems. However, the likelihood of these being symptoms of a neurological disorder is hardly entertained.\n\nA report by Spectrumnews reveals that autism goes undiagnosed in African children until they are eight years old, unlike their American counterparts, who are diagnosed four years earlier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAutism from the African lens\n\nMedically known as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), autism is a neurological developmental disability characterised by various symptoms, including nonverbal speech patterns, hypersensitivity to specific sights, sounds and colours, and, in some cases, intellectual impairment.\n\nOverall, it is a diverse group of conditions that primarily affects the ability to communicate and interact with one\u2019s immediate environment appropriately.\n\nUsually, it appears fully by age 2 or 3 but can be diagnosed as early as 12 months. Unlike Down syndrome and cerebral palsy, autism mostly comes with no physical signs.\n\nIt is a medically diagnosed condition, and because of its complexity and broad range of characteristics, it should not be diagnosed by non-medical personnel.\n\nDiagnosing autism is a challenge in Africa because of several superstitious beliefs associated with the condition and the unavailability of the proper medical infrastructure required to run the tests.\n\nIn some parts of the continent, people living with autism are \u201clabelled as devils, and they are not diagnosed or given treatment. Some people believe that the disorder is punishment for a parent\u2019s bad behaviour or an affliction,\u201d says Bernadette Lamar, a Sierra Leonean who runs a behavioural healthcare centre.\n\nDue to a lack of inadequate information, parents with autistic children in Africa are usually left with no choice but to seek help from spiritual sources. And to avoid stigmatisation, they lock up their children, keeping them out of plain sight.\n\nIn 2002, Zemi Yenus founded Ethiopia\u2019s first school for children with autism after her son was diagnosed with the condition. He had been rejected from multiple mainstream schools, and she had a hard time finding special needs children teachers in Ethiopia who knew what autism was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo she used her savings from her old job as a beautician to open her school in a small rented Addis Ababa house. She called it The Joy Center of Excellence for Autism and kicked off with just four children, including her son.\n\nOn May 11, 2021, Yenus passed on from COVID-19-related complications. Her centre currently caters for hundreds of Ethiopian children living with ASD.\n\nSome data to run with\n\nAccording to World Health Organisation statistics, globally, 1 in 160 children has ASD. With sketchy data on children living with autism in Africa, it is difficult to arrive at a figure for the continent.\n\nNevertheless, a 2019 Autism Society of Kenya (ASK) report revealed that in Kenya alone, there was likely to be 1 autistic child for every 25 children. And a globalliving.org report estimates that Ethiopia has 600,000 autistic children.\n\nWHO\u2019s global ratio might be very different if the Organisation accounted for Africa\u2019s autism figures. But that is neither here nor there in a discussion about the challenges autistic children and their parents face in Africa.\n\nHow tech fits into the picture\n\nCurious to discover how technology can create awareness and help autistic children lead better lives, I spoke with Mrs C. Adedeji, a special needs children instructor.\n\nShe mentioned how various applications and e-tools could assist parents and instructors in delivering individual-based lessons to these children.\n\nFrom our conversation, I learnt that autistic children, like everyone else, come with a unique, innate skill-set to harness adequate time and attention.\n\n\u201cIn my years as a caregiver for special children, it\u2019s a thing of joy and reward when I see children that I\u2019ve taught and nurtured \u2014 alongside somewhat tired and hopeful parents \u2014 do things for themselves and even build their talents. Because, like everyone else, they are gifted and can make meaningful contributions to the world,\u201d Adedeji said.\n\nThankfully, technology can assist learning and help autistic children grow, improve verbal communication, learn speech patterns, and build social interaction skills.\n\nShe confirmed that \u201ca lot of apps are so effective in helping and improving the lives of these children through self-guided learning and the removal of a structure common to most brick and mortar classes.\u201d\n\nWith mobile apps, video games, and medically approved online resources available, autistic children stand a better chance to manage the disorder today than they did years ago.\n\nThe slow rate of Internet penetration remains a big hindrance to parents and special children instructors who need technological assistance to care for and teach these children in most African countries.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me, I think the best option is for the government of most African countries to see this as a cause for concern and foster the integration of special needs technological materials in our regular schools,\u201d Adedeji added.\n\nThere is currently no cure for ASD, and because it is a spectrum disorder, the symptoms vary from mild to acute. However, a range of treatments can be administered to manage it better.\n\nMobile applications like Language Therapy for Kids \u2013 MITA, Speech Blubs 2, Otsimo and others help administer Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication-handicapped Children (TEACCH) \u2014 individual-based visual learning methods \u2014 to children living with autism and also assist instructors and parents in caring for them.\n\nThese apps should not replace a strong community of support from parents, a good special needs children instructor, and an inclusive society.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nThe most effective way to manage ASD is early diagnosis, and this is another area where technology has helped.\n\nThe electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test tool used to detect the brain\u2019s electrical activity. It can also serve as a biomarker for ASD. A team of researchers in South Africa decided to test the effectiveness of this technology.\n\nThey discovered that the biomarker could differentiate between ASD in typically developing children and those whose genes showed some signs of ASD but were not with the condition. The results had a 90% accuracy.\n\nA greater cause for concern\n\nBeyond the challenge of a lack of data on autism, the stigmatisation autistic children and their parents face in Africa is a major problem.\n\nThis is because the disorder is considered more of a spiritual condition than a medical one that can be effectively managed.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t understand this is purely a medical condition. It can happen to anyone regardless of their background. A lot needs to be done in our part of the world in terms of education, acceptance, and understanding,\u201d said Amoah, coordinator at a treatment centre for children with disabilities in Accra, Ghana.\n\nChildren living with autism can learn to live with the disorder if accepted and managed rather than rejected and stigmatised. By making room for the range of diversities that characterise our world, we can make the world a better place.\n\nHappy Autistic Pride Day!",

          "title": "NCARD: FG, stakeholders call for private sector investment in agricultural development",
          "text": "By Nneka Nwogwugwu\n\nThe Federal government and stakeholders in the agricultural sector have called for private sector investment in the development of Nigeria\u2019s agricultural sector.\n\nThe stakeholders made this call at the end of the 44th Regular Meeting of the National Council on Agriculture and Rural Development (NCARD) on Thursday in Abuja.\n\nDeclaring the event open, the minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Alhaji Sabo Nanono noted major contributions the present administration has achieved in developing the agric sector despite the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn his remarks, he said, \u201cThe challenges brought by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, floods and insecurity has galvanized the government into setting up necessary structures (and upgrade existing ones) to address infrastructural deficiency, technology gaps, security challenges and extension inadequacy.\n\n\u201cAs a stop-gap intervention, we launched the Agric for Food and Jobs Program, originally conceived as an input loan for smallholder farmers across several commodities including maize, rice, cotton, groundnut, sorghum, cowpea, soybean, sesame, cassava and oil-palm.\n\n\u201cThe scheme brought into a partnership the Central Bank of Nigeria, Commodity Associations and Agricultural Platform Companies for effective facilitation. This we believe will not only improve production significantly but also aid in the off-taking of the produce while providing input at reduced price due to economy of scale.\n\n\u201cTo ensure that the input gets to the intended farmers, we created a database for all the participating farmers in the AFJP. Unlike anything that has been done before, we set out to capture the biodata of the farmers and link this with the geographical information of their farmed plots, their crops and the volumes they produce.\n\n\u201cAll this will feed into the monitoring and evaluation system of the project so that we can measure impact along the line. Although we initially set out to capture the data of 2.4million farmers across the country, the results from the exercise have encouraged the Economic Sustainability Plan team to expand the data capture to 10million farmers.\n\n\u201cThis database is going to be the platform for government interventions going forward, putting an end to ghost schemes and other unscrupulous practices in the agricultural industry.\u201d\n\nCalling on the private sector for increased efforts in investing in the sector, Nanono noted that enquiries have been received from several international bodies on how they may participate in the National Livestock Transformation Plan either in financial or technical capacity.\n\nAccording to him, a Dutch consortium which is partnering the Federal Government for the implementation of the first pilot state was able to attract a grant from their home country of Netherlands for the start-up of the National Livestock Transformation Plan pilot in Nasarawa State.\n\n\u201cThis pilot site will serve as a hub for knowledge and skills transfer to the pastoralist community, who will be encouraged and hand-held to adopt ranching, to practice what they have learnt. The National Livestock Transformation Plan has been adjudged worldwide to be a well-conceived project which seeks to transform our livestock sector from nomadic-dependent sector into an organized ranching one.\n\n\u201c To this end, 22 State and the Federal Capital Territory have registered with the NLTP Office, out of which 10 States have created their own teams which have been trained by the Federal Office. Seven of these 10 States have also earmarked about 19 Grazing Reserves for the implementation of the NLTP, with a total land size of approximately 400,00 hectares,\u201d he added.\n\nHighlighting other programmes introduced by his administration, he outlined that, \u201crice was included in the list of items for which importation facility provision (forex) was stopped since the inception of this administration.\n\n\u201cThe dividend of that action has been improvement in the quality of rice processed within Nigeria and has improved earning for the rice farmers and placed their association, RIFAN, at a vantage point for negotiating loan deals for farmers with funding entities.\n\nAmong other achievements by the Ministry, the minister also added \u201cwe have entered into partnership with the government of Brazil through one of their foremost technology transfer institution, the Fundacao Getulio Vargas (FGV).\n\n\u201c This partnership has yielded an Agricultural Mechanisation loan to the tune of nine hundred and ninety five million euros(\u20ac995m). This shall be granted to Nigerian entrepreneurs to establish Service Centres across all the 774 Local Governments of the country, selling services to all categories of farmers and thereby helping to improve their productivity. The service centres shall be of either a Type 1, supporting production activities; or a Type 2, supporting processing and packaging activities.\n\n\u201cWe also have the target to improve on the export front and to this end, necessary support is being given for increase in the export of Agricultural commodities like Sesame, Hibiscus, Cotton and Sorghum. The Nigerian Export Promotion Council has been working with the Ministry of Agriculture to exploit our strategic advantage in the production of these commodities, improving our production protocols to conform with internationally acceptable standards, maintenance of an exporters\u2019 directory and \u2018Exporter certificate verification\u2019 portal, generation of Product map and improving our visibility through the attendance of International Trade Shows. All this is geared towards improving our export profile thereby improving our Forex Earning capacity which is necessary at this period of oil market volatility.\n\n\u201cAs part of the strategies to implement the Nigerian Correctional Service act, the Nigerian Prisons Service established farms which are to serve as training grounds to inmates serving time at the different prisons. Prison farms are essential for the new correctional services act to fulfil its aim of reforming, rehabilitating and reintegrating offenders.\u201d\n\nEarlier speaking, the minister of state for Agriculture, Hon. Mustapha Baba Shehuri added that the Nigerian Economy had its GDP contracted for two consecutive terms i.e 2nd and 3rd Quarters in 2020 leading to recession.\n\nHe said it was in the 4th Quarter of 2020 that the economy returned to positive growth with GDP expanding to 0.1% from negative growth of 3.6%, Agricultural Sector was part of the achievement. As a matter of fact, the local production of Maize, Rice, Cassava, Potatoes, Yam and other staples steadily increased. It is also the same story for Livestock, Fisheries and Dairy sector.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we did not import food during the lockdown was a testimony that we can grow what we eat and eat what we produce. This unique effort in the Agricultural sector resulted in sharp decline in the Nation\u2019s major food import bills on Rice, Wheat, Milk products and Frozen Fish.\n\n\u201cI salute the effort of our farmers and other stakeholders who worked under difficult and challenging environment to boost the production of our major staples,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso speaking, the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) representative in Nigeria, Fred Kafeero stated that private investors involvement in agriculture is a call for action to cushion effects of COVID-19.\n\nKafeero also urged that investments and technical assistance should be mobilised, adding that research in Nigeria should also be strengthened.\n\nAlso, Nigeria\u2019s country Director, Actionaid, Ene Obi called on the private sector to approve and support the Federal Agric Ministry and state Ministries to allocate funding for Agriculture and smallholder farmers including women farmers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Free access to social media is robbing youths of their future \u2015 Oyedepo\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the farmers, the president of the All farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Farouq Mudi while explaining the importance of private investment , noted that the association has started establishing projects in collaboration with the private sector.\n\nHe informed that Brains and Hammers, a real estate company is partnering with the Ministry to deepen water irrigation techniques to enhance crop production in Nigeria.\n\nResponding to the UN\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP) report, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Dr. Ernest A. Umakhihe said the meeting will give way for stakeholders to mitigate global hunger concerns in 20 nations.",

The young Muhammadu Buhari spent 30 months in the frontlines as a young army officer, fighting the war of unity.\n\nAnd he has said it: we will not be around and watch Nigeria go down. Never. We will rather speak to insurrectionists in the language they understand.\n\n\u201cAnd what of Olusegun Obasanjo, a civil war hero.

Around 10:30 in the morning, they reached their final destination \u2013 the Federal Government College, Birnin-Yauri.\u201d\n\nSununu noted that as soon as the bandits got to the school, they were faced with a tough task as they were initially resisted and engaged in a gunfight by operatives of the Mobile Police and Police Counter-Terrorism Unit stationed at the school.\n\nHe disclosed that the fire exchange lasted for a long period before the bandits overpowered the security operatives due to their large number.\n\nThe bandits, the lawmaker stated, succeeded in killing a policeman and gained access into the school and abducted an unspecified number of students and five teachers.\n\nHe explained that it was difficult to ascertain the exact number of students abducted as parents from nearby villages and towns raced to the school to take their children away immediately after the incident.\n\nSununu, however, gave an assurance that the military has swung into action, noting that progress has been made.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs at last night, I had a discussion with the Field Commander of Operation Hadarin Daji who said that they have succeeded in entering into the den of the kidnappers and I think this is a major success because the security agencies are now taking the fight to the base of the kidnappers\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Nigerian Army said on Friday that its troops operating under the auspices of Operation Hadarin Daji have been on hot pursuit of bandits who abducted some students and teachers from Federal Government College, Birnin Yawuri on Thursday, June 17, 2021\n\nIt said in a statement signed by the new Director Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Onyema Nwachukwu, that two teachers and five students have so far been rescued after a fierce exchange of fire with the criminals.\n\n\u201cThe rescue followed an initial encounter with the abductors in the early hours of today 18 June 2021 after trailing the kidnappers from Yawuri through Riyao to Sombo community, where the kidnappers who had split into two groups fled.\n\n\u201cWith one group conveying the abducted children, while the second group conveyed rustled cattle,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe land troops in conjunction with elements of the Nigerian Air Force, who provided close air support during the rescue mission intercepted the two groups at about 2.30 am and engaged them in a fire fight leading to the successful rescue of the teachers and students.\n\n\u201cThe troops also recovered 800 cattle rustled by the bandits. The gallant troops are still on the heels of the kidnappers in order to rescue the remaining abductees still in captivity.\n\n\u201cSadly, a casualty was recorded during the exchange. A female student was found to have given up the ghost as a result of exhaustion. The rescued teachers and students will be handed over to the Kebbi State Government\u201d, he stated.\n\nNwachukwu said the Nigerian Army appreciates the cooperation so far from good spirited citizens and wishes to solicit for more.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chief of Army Staff, Maj Gen Faruk Yahaya, has directed the Commander to spare no effort until all the abducted persons are safely rescued and reunited with their loved ones.\n\nIn the meantime, Police authorities in Kebbi State have given more updates on the abduction of an unspecified number of students from the Federal Government College, Birnin-Yauri.\n\nMr. Nafi\u2019U Abubakar, the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, disclosed that the gunmen used a stolen vehicle to convey the abducted students.\n\nHe made the disclosure in a statement on Friday in reaction to reports that the bandits who attacked the school used a police vehicle to kidnap about 50 students from the school.\n\nAbubakar explained that the assailants used a white Hilux van marked KBSJ 29, which was hijacked along the Birnin-Yauri Road, to perpetrate the crime.\n\nHe insisted that the bandits never used any police van as claimed, adding that the number of students missing after the incident was still unknown.\n\nAccording to the command spokesman, a rescue operation to ensure the safe return of the students is ongoing by the security agencies.\n\nHe promised that the police would give more updates on the progress made as events unfold and warned against spreading false information.",

The race is full of billionaires, such that, one would think Anambra is up for auction.\n\nThe parties that lead with the highest numbers of aspirants in Anambra are the People\u2019s Democratic Party(PDP), All Progressives Congress (APC), the ruling All Progressive Grand Alliance(APGA) and the Young Progressives Party (YPP).\n\nBy the close of June 2021, the major parties would have reduced the large number of aspirants to four.Only one of them will become Governor.\n\nThe slate of governorship aspirants include a few women. This reality has changed the political terrain and equation.\n\nUnlikely as it may seem, the options remain open that a woman might emerge as Anambra\u2019s next Governor.\n\nOne of the women in the race is Lady Chidi Onyemelukwe (LCO) of the PDP. She is the first daughter of late Dr. Alex Ekwueme, Nigeria\u2019s Second Republic Vice President and deputy to President Shehu Shagari.\n\nOnyemelukwe, the PDP deputy governorship candidate in 2017 and running mate to Oseloka H. Obaze is on a dual-track governance Odyssey.\n\nFirst, she is a second-generation Nigerian politician, who perhaps wants to succeed and possibly, surpass her father. She is more of a front runner than a dark horse. Her presence in the race seems to have rattled some veterans, that they have tried and failed to de-market her candidacy.\n\nSecond, she is core PDP \u2013 a member since 1999, a woman and from Anambra South; so she fits well into the narrative of the consensus candidate, should the need arise. But more important, she has experience, capacity, vision, integrity and the fear of God.\n\nLike most offsprings of first and second republic politicians, Onyemelukwe has pedigree and name recognition, even as she hardly invokes the Ekwueme name.\n\nIf she succeeds, she will be in the cadre of political offsprings of the Imokes, Nwodos, Ikokwus, Awolowos, Akintolas, Macaulays, Shagaris, Ribadus, Balewas, Obis, Onohs and others, who walked the paths of their parents into public service and partisan politics.\n\nOnyemelukwe is not an avowed feminist, but she is fully committed to gender mainstreaming. This is evident in her manifesto and promise of a 60:40 gender ratio. Being a female candidate in a crowded field of mostly male billionaire aspirants, makes her attractive, well beyond her natural elegance.\n\nSomething else that sets Onyemelukwe apart in the field, is her willingness to vow to govern with the fear of God; whom she claims is her \u201cgodfather\u201d. She has done so with equanimity. Her Restoration platform reflects broad vision and transformative thinking. Those close to her, say that beneath the soft and elegant mien, is a tough and steely mindset.\n\nOnyemelukwe also has the benefit of political tutelage. As a kid she resided at Ribadu Road, seat of the Second Republic presidency. As an adult, she served as her father\u2019s private secretary in the formative periods of G-18, G-34 and eventually, PDP. Unknown to many, she typed most of her father\u2019s confidential papers, deployed to challenge the Abacha regime and compel a return to democracy.\n\nLater on, Onyemelukwe served as a Senior Special Assistant in Aso Rock under President Olusegun Obasanjo before going on to head a federal parastatal \u2013 the Federal Housing Authority.\n\nHer executive experience from both jobs in policy formulation and governance, remains critical. That PDP picked her in 2017 over presumed veterans as it\u2019s deputy-governorship candidate, gives her a very good head start.\n\nSince entering into the fray, Onyemelukwe has shown humility but assertiveness, in handling the stereotype that Anambra is not ready for a female leader. Instead of being combative, she has emphasized her commitment to frugality, transparency, honesty, restoration and good governance. The accolade she received when she met with PDP women leaders from the 21 local government areas said it all; \u201cHer beauty is easy to see, but much more important than that is her character. Chidi is virtuous. Hardly will you see this kind of virtue, administrative experience and beauty packed into one human being.\u201d\n\nOnce asked to sum up her political motivation, mission and aspirations, she said: \u201cThis for me is an emotional issue. I could not have asked for better political mentor, than my father. I will sustain my father\u2019s legacy. In line with his personal and governance values, my priorities are to restore trust and confidence, in both leadership and government. Our ethics and core values will be premised on accountability and transparency.\u201d\n\nOnyemelukwe, is what Anambra needs. She will make a good Governor.\n\nMoreover, the 2021 electoral campaign has been tainted by the zoning controversy, especially the claim that it is the turn of Anambra South zone. The party is divided on this but Onyemelukwe is well situated. She is by birth and marriage core South. Her constituency in that regard, runs from the Orumbas through Old Aguata to Nnewi.\n\nIf she faces any obstacle, it is the fact is that the Igbo politicians unlike the Hausa and Yoruba, have not been very good in political succession planning. This might be the result of Igbo Republicanism \u2013 the Igbo Ewe Eze syndrome. But that is what makes Onyemelukwe\u2019s candidacy somewhat attractive. Of the lot running for Anambra governorship, she is alone as coming from a renowned political family. The name recognition others covet, comes to her naturally.\n\nTwice, in 1983 and 1999 Onyemelukwe\u2019s dad, Dr. Alex Ekwueme missed a shot at the Nigerian presidency. His losses were huge losses for the Igbo. There is no telling where fate and Onyemelukwe\u2019s political trajectory might take her. But clearly, she seems set to follow late Senator Onyeabo Obi, Okwesilize Nwodo, Lyle Imoke, Mukhtar Shagari, and other second generation Nigeria politicians, who followed the path of their parents into partisan politics and elective offices. Her success, will also be a restitution that honours her father\u2019s efforts political and memory.\n\nGlobally, Nigerians continue to excel. Such successes can be replicated at home, if the political will exist. So perhaps, and just perhaps, the time is right for Nigeria to have its first democratically elected female Governor in Lady Chidi Onyemelukwe. As registered voter, female professional, and member of Nigerian Diaspora, Onyemelukwe has my vote, anytime any day.\n\n*Ms. Enuma writes from the United States",

          "text": "Despite widespread opposition from Nigerians, President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s government has begun to retrace and restore grazing paths across the country.\n\nAfter a conference in Delta State, 17 southern governors placed a ban on open grazing in the region, according to NEWS DIRECT.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, on the other hand, has urged states to re-establish cow grazing routes throughout the country.\n\nThis was said by the president in an interview with Arise Television that aired on Thursday.\n\nHe said he has ordered Nigeria\u2019s Attorney General, Abubakar Malami, to start the process of reclaiming land from people who have modified cattle grazing routes for their own use.\n\nThe grazing paths, according to Buhari, were established during the First Republic when \u201cNigerians used to observe regulations,\u201d but they have since been converted.\n\nHe explained, \u201cWhat I did was urge him to go dig up the gazette of the First Republic when people were observing laws.\u201d\n\nMany Nigerians, notably governors from the north and south, have expressed opposition to the federal government\u2019s plan.\n\nUnfazed, the federal administration has started identifying and reclaiming stock routes, also known as grazing routes, that herders use to graze their livestock.\n\nAccording to the Federal Government, this was done to alleviate the conflict between herders and farmers.\n\nDespite the fact that some of the routes have been encroached upon owing to human activity, the government has begun the process of identifying monuments along the routes in order to reclaim them as cow grazing areas.\n\nOfficials from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development confirmed to The PUNCH on Friday that the routes would be recovered.\n\nThey also noted that routes that have been encroached upon due to the installation of public infrastructure may be excluded from the recovery effort.\n\nWinnie Lai-Solarin, the acting Director of FMARD\u2019s Animal Husbandry Department, indicated that while cattle ranching was one of the key choices considered for herders, not every pastoralist could afford it at this time.\n\nShe said, \u201cThere are some stock routes that we have across the country, and in the past, we had monuments along these stock routes, particularly the primary stock routes.\n\n\u201cAnd in the course of farming or other human activities along those stock routes, the monuments were altered, but we know where they are. So we are saying that some of them can be retraced.\n\n\u201cAnd this is particularly for areas that are not encroached upon as of now. The pastoralists know the routes, and on some of those routes, you will see the pieces of the monuments along them.\u201d\n\nLai-Solarin added, \u201cSo for those that are not encroached upon and are not in conflict zones, we will go ahead to retrace and guide the pastoralists along them. We didn\u2019t get to where we are today in one day and so we cannot expect that every pastoralist should suddenly start ranching now.\n\n\u201cSome would still have to move but let\u2019s keep the movement as safe as possible and in areas that are not conflict zones. That is what I am saying. We are not going to retrace stock routes where there are infrastructures that are for the public good.\u201d",

          "title": "Global economic crisis: Is Nigeria ready for renewable energy transition?",
          "text": "\u2026Osinbajo advises a more equitable transition\n\n\u2026Gas, our own renewable energy \u2013 Sylva\n\n\u2018\u2026Stakeholders\u2019 collaboration needed\u2019\n\n\u2026 Nigeria ready, but\u2026- Expert\n\nThe world is moving from fossil fuel to renewable energy, but many have been left wondering whether or not Nigeria, with its dependence on oil as a major source of revenue, is ready for this global shift. BENJAMIN UMUTEME writes.\n\nIn 1957, when Nigeria discovered oil in Oloibiri, in the present day Bayelsa state, most people thought the country was set to become a global super player, but it was not to be. Rather, the country\u2019s economy has continued to struggle especially with the volatility of the oil market in recent times.\n\nWith the discovery of oil, Nigeria left its other sources of revenue without a look into the future. While the country made so much money from the sale of crude oil, it failed miserably to invest the money in critical sectors of the economy and, by extension, the oil sector, thereby stalling investments in the industry.\n\nAnd then the coronavirus pandemic hit the world economy making Nigeria\u2019s inability to make hay while the sun was shining obvious. By April last year, oil prices had entered negative territory and with it the need for the global economy began to look at cleaner and cheaper sources of energy to power production.\n\nEnergy transition/issues\n\nMany say the next transformation in human civilisation now occurs in the energy sector. Already, the transition has started disrupting oil exporting economies like Nigeria that depend heavily on oil for its economic activities.\n\nEnvironmental issues are one of the major problems facing humans today. Emissions from energy use, resource depletion and waste generation from production and consumption activities and many other anthropogenic activities impacts the globe adversely, consequently, the growing attention on energy transition and circular economy.\n\nFossil fuel has played a critical role in socio-economic development and international relations of countries over the last 120 years. However, climate change and air pollution have increased the inevitability to consider the use of fossil fuels. The major problem with fossil fuel use is greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions.\n\nThe GHGs\u2014N2O, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) have increased by 20 per cent, 40 per cent, and 150 per cent above pre-industrial level. In the 1880s, during the industrial revolution, the atmospheric concentration of CO2 was about 280 parts per million (ppm).\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, it was 399 and 403.9 ppm, respectively, representing a 30 per cent increase above pre-industrial level. Emissions from combustion of fossil fuel account for 65 per cent of the global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Residence time of CO2 in the atmosphere varies between 50 to 200 years. About two-thirds of global GHGs emissions come from energy production and consumption. Between 1880 and 2012, the average temperature of the globe increased by 0.85 \u2103.\n\nPresently, there are increased variations in temperatures and severe weather, resulting in increased degrees and incidences of hot days across most regions of the globe; thus, the present emphasis on renewable energy.\n\nActions that support sustainable development and advancement throughout all segments of the human environment are critical to human civilisation. Transition from \u201chydrocarbon molecules to electrons\u201d (fossil fuels to renewable and low-carbon energy) is growing globally.\n\nAs it stands, renewable energy technologies are becoming more cost-competitive relative to fossil fuels. The increasing transition will have serious socio-economic and political implications if the country does not diversify its economy. For instance, the contraction in oil export because of global transition to renewable energy will reduce the government\u2019s revenue, increase unemployment, decrease capacity to finance infrastructure and development projects, and increase poverty rate.\n\nNigeria has enormous renewable energy potential, solar, wind, biomass, among others. The use of renewable will improve environmental quality including increased use of biomass (organic wastes) for energy production which would advance Nigeria solid waste management system and vice versa. All these are associated with sustainable resource management.\n\nTotal\u2019s initiative, others\u2019 strategies\n\nIn a bid to drive home the reality of the transition to cleaner source of energy, oil major Total Exploration re-branded to Total Energies. This, the company said, signals its new strategy of diversification towards cleaner energy sources.\n\n\u201cThe group is expressing its intention to transform itself into a multi-energy company to respond to the twin challenges faced by energy transitions: more energy and fewer emissions,\u201d Total\u2019s chief executive Patrick Pouyanne said in a statement.\n\nThis year, Total plans to devote more than 20 per cent of its investment budget to renewable energy sources as well as electricity. But environmental activists say it must do more to fight climate change, and recently the International Energy Agency said all future fossil fuel projects must be scrapped if the world is to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nSimilarly, several international oil firms are already realigning their operations and reducing investments in upstream activities with a view to embracing cleaner fuels. Even European Banks are becoming reluctant to support new investments in fossil fuels.\n\nCountries, even the least expected to comply, are making commitments to a carbon-free world.\n\nChina has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2060, India has committed to a target of achieving 40 per cent of its total electricity generation from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030, the UK sees the country carbon neutral by 2050 and for the first time, in 2020, renewable overtook fossil fuels as the European Union\u2019s main source of electricity.\n\nThe president, Nigerian Gas Producers, Ed Ubong, noted that gas will continue to play a key role as green fuel as we try to meet the renewable target as the country try to meet its sustainable energy demand.\n\nHe said, \u201cNigeria is sitting on a huge reserve of gas. We must utilise the gas we have. We must unlock the challenge that exists in the gas to power value chain and improve power to energy for the over 85 million Nigerians. We must address structural issues around the grid.\n\n\u201cHow do we reduce distribution losses, how do we ensure that payment happens, how do we ensure that gas plants get gas reliably.\u201d Here-in is the dilemma for Nigeria and most emerging economies that still rely heavily on \u2018dirty fuel.\u2019\n\nOsinbajo\u2019s admonition\n\nHowever, in what looks like a plea to the European Union, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has urged developed countries to adopt a more equitable energy transition for the developing world. According to the vice-president, they ought to recognise the significant differences between different fuels and the context of their use.\n\nHe is of the view that there should be a gradual adoption and implementation of the transitioning scheme for fossil fuels, especially for Africa\u2019s developing economies with huge energy access gaps.\n\n\u201cThe path to de-carbonisation by 2050 needs to solve energy poverty by 2030, or that demand will be met through dirty energy sources,\u201d he said.\n\nFG\u2019s regrets\n\nThe Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, regrets that Nigeria does not have the resources to go into renewable at the moment. He, however, does believe that for Nigeria, gas is a bridge to achieving its own renewable energy.\n\nSpeaking with Blueprint Weekend recently in Abuja, Sylva said while the world is moving towards clean energy, Nigeria would be transiting to gas, which it considers as its own clean energy.\n\n\u201cSo, should we also join them now to move to renewable energy and abandon our resources? I don\u2019t think so, and I say it boldly everywhere. After all, those economies were built on resources from coal and other dirtier fuels,\u201d he said.\n\nThe minister was rather confident that with the county\u2019s abundant gas resources Nigeria would gradually transit to renewable. According to him, the country does not have the huge funds needed to go into clean energy research.\n\n\u201cOkay, today, they have moved to this level. In a situation where 600 million Africans are still without energy, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a realistic position. That\u2019s why in Nigeria, our focus now is on gas which we consider at best a destination fuel and at worst a transition fuel to renewable.\n\n\u201cAnd since we have it in abundance why don\u2019t we maximise it now so that at least we are taking a step forward as well. That\u2019s our position in Nigeria, not necessarily that we want to go into developing renewable. In energy usually, there must be a mix. You are not expected to use only one source of energy. Our focus now is on gas as a major source of energy which we have in abundance.\n\n\u201cThe global energy industry is moving towards renewable even the investors are taking out investable funds from the oil and gas sector and moving into renewable. Is Nigeria also joining that race?\n\n\u201cIt is something that is difficult to say. We are not in that race as such. There\u2019s a lot of funding required for research for renewable and we are not into that yet. But for Nigeria, we are looking at gas as a transition fuel to renewable.\u201d\n\nHe said further: \u201cSome people are even looking at gas not as a transition fuel, but as renewable. If you have gas you can consider it to be renewable fuel as well. The question I always ask when I go for international events is: if the concern with non renewable is carbon emission, why is the global economies are now focusing on developing carbon capture technologies instead of moving away from the non renewable?\n\n\u201cIf the global economy is focused on carbon capture, we can actually clean up the fuel as well and reduce the emission from non renewable, clean it and it becomes something that will not affect climate change. But the global system tends to be moving away from the oil and gas non renewable resources which we have in abundance.\n\n\u201cIn energy usually, there must be a mix. You are not expected to use only one source of energy. Our focus now is on gas as a major source of energy which we have in abundance.\u201d\n\nA gradual process?\n\nOn his part, the maintenance/project manager, Servon Nigeria Limited, Anderson Aleru, told this reporter that Nigeria was ready for the energy transition.\n\n\u201cIt is going to be a gradual process; natural resources like gas are something we have in sufficient quantities and the federal government wants to really start producing gas so that we can also convert it to supply electricity.\n\n\u201cIt will take time because to be able to build a central processing facility for this gas is very expensive. It\u2019s going to be a gradual process since funds will be involved,\u201d he said.\n\nStakeholders\u2019 role\n\nSpeaking to Blueprint Weekend on the sidelines of the Nigeria International Petroleum Summit (NIPS), the general manager, Sales of Global Process and Pipeline Limited (GPSS), Taiwo Abiodun, said energy transition can only be possible if all hands are on deck.\n\nAccording to him, with its abundant gas resources, Nigeria can use gas as a transition to clean energy.\n\nHe said, \u201cPresently, Nigeria is generating a certain percentage of gas but you can also see that with what is happening, what we are suffering with insecurity, what we are suffering about all the issues that affect crude and all that, the future is basically inherent in gas production. And how can that happen?\n\n\u201cYou will also agree with me that a lot of Nigerian companies have been given license to do a whole lot of local refineries just to support what the national companies are also doing. Why, because renewable energy is the future of the world globally. Everybody needs gas! Gas is life now! For us to even have light here, we need gas.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to pull our forces together to make sure that there is a high-level of improved production of hydrocarbons in Nigeria through our collaboration working with the right stakeholders and make sure that we deliver what we can do.\n\n\u201cWe have the resources, we have the technology, and we have the capability in Nigeria. What is lacking is that collaboration. If everybody, all IOCs, all technical persons came together to say \u2018hey, let us give it a try, let us take it over,\u2019 in the next 10 years, there will be less of crude and there is going to be more of gas because everywhere the talk is about renewable.\n\n\u201cJust last week, Total Exploration Nigeria changed to Total Energies. Now, Total is already thinking of a 10-20 years plan into renewable energy. What do you need to drive renewable energy? You need gas; you need hydrocarbons to drive it. And that is probably going to be the future everybody wants to hear.\u201d\n\nPIB?\n\nIn his view, an economist, Friday Efih, said a quick passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) will quicken the energy transition for the country.\n\nAccording to the expert, the inability of the legislature to pass the PIB for the past 12 years is a drawback to investments in the oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cAs it stands now, one cannot out rightly say Nigeria is ready for energy transition especially with the kind of money involved in changing to renewable,\u201d he said.",

Around 10:30 in the morning, they reached their final destination \u2013 the Federal Government College, Birnin-Yauri.\u201d\n\nA Major Success\n\nSununu noted that as soon as the bandits got to the school, they were faced with a tough task as they were initially resisted and engaged in a gunfight by operatives of the Mobile Police and Police Counter-Terrorism Unit stationed at the school.\n\nHe disclosed that the fire exchange lasted for a long period before the bandits overpowered the security operatives due to their large number.\n\nThe bandits, the lawmaker stated, succeeded in killing a policeman and gained access into the school and abducted an unspecified number of students and five teachers.\n\nHe explained that it was difficult to ascertain the exact number of students abducted as parents from nearby villages and towns raced to the school to take their children away immediately after the incident.\n\nSununu, however, gave an assurance that the military has swung into action, noting that progress has been made.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs at last night, I had a discussion with the Field Commander of Operation Hadarin Daji who said that they have succeeded in entering into the den of the kidnappers and I think this is a major success because the security agencies are now taking the fight to the base of the kidnappers.\n\n\u201cI was also told that over 800 cattle that were rustled some days back have been recovered and as of now, the military has combed the area where we are expecting that the students are with the bandits.
