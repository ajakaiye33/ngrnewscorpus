          "text": "A governorship aspirant in Rivers State, Tonye Princewill, has alleged that some yet-to-be-identified gunmen invaded his home, ransacked it and removed his Close-Circuit Television hard drive.\n\nHe said the gunmen who invaded his GRA residence in Port Harcourt during the early hours of Friday searched rooms suspected to be his own.\n\nThe development is coming exactly four days after Princewill declared his intention to contest the governorship election in the state come 2023 under the platform of the All Progressives Congress.\n\nConfirming the incident in a statement on Friday, Princewill described the invasion as an \u201cassassination attempt\u201d, adding that he was clearly the \u201ctarget\u201d.\n\nWhile linking the incident to the forthcoming elections, the governorship hopeful said the assailants took nothing except the CCTV recorder hard drive which indicated that he was a \u201ctarget for elimination\u201d.\n\nThe statement read,\u201d I can confirm that in the early hours of this morning my house was broken into.\n\n\u201cThe target was clearly me, as the intruders headed straight for what they thought was my room, broke in, and met my absence. Nothing of value was taken, except the hard drive of the CCTV recorder, which leads me to conclude, that they had only one objective. My elimination.\n\n\u201cI want to thank God that the devil is a liar and His children will always be protected. Thankfully I am well and nobody in my household was hurt.\n\n\u201cBut this is a stark reminder that the 2023 political season has started and those who can not win on the field will seek other ways to attain power. It may have worked in the past, but not here and not now.\u201d\n\nHe said rather than be deterred by the incident, he would be more committed to a cause he believes in.\n\n\u201cWe are clearly a threat to someone. That person and their group of persons will soon be exposed. In the meantime, I ask for your prayers and your support, and some privacy.\n\n\u201cAny additional detail we have will be released to you via the security agencies. Let them do their jobs. Men from the security agencies are currently on the scene and I have every confidence that justice will be done,\u201d Princewill added.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Marseille travel to face bitter rivals Paris Saint-Germain this weekend in buoyant mood as they target Champions League qualification and a European trophy to finish the season.\n\nPSG these days dominate French football and are closing in on an eighth Ligue 1 title in 10 seasons, but Marseille can still claim to be the country\u2019s best supported team and there is something else they can still brag about to their rivals.\n\nWith the Parisians again falling short in their pursuit of Champions League glory this season, the southern giants remain the only French club to have lifted the European Cup, back in 1993.\n\nToo inconsistent to seriously challenge PSG in recent years, Marseille have emerged as the best of the rest in Ligue 1 this season under Jorge Sampaoli and they head to the Parc des Princes sitting in second place.\n\nWith the top three qualifying for Europe\u2019s elite club competition, OM have a healthy seven-point cushion over Strasbourg in fourth as they target a return to the Champions League.\n\nThat is of particular importance given the fragile finances of the club owned by American tycoon Frank McCourt, but they also have silverware in their sights.\n\nThursday\u2019s 1-0 win over PAOK in Greece took them through to the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League 3-1 on aggregate, with Dimitri Payet scoring the only goal on the night.\n\nThe new third-tier European competition may have been dismissed by many at the start of the campaign, but the opportunity of a second European trophy is not to be sniffed at for Marseille.\n\nThey will play fellow former European Cup winners Feyenoord in the last four, with the first leg to come later this month.\n\nThe winner of that will face either Leicester City or Roma in the final in Tirana in late May.\n\nMarseille have now won eight straight games in all competitions with Payet in particular in inspired form.\n\n\u201cThis run really makes the end of the season exciting for us,\u201d said forward Cedric Bakambu after beating PAOK.\n\n\u201cWe have the PSG game in our minds, but we shouldn\u2019t play down this result.\n\n\u201cWe should savour it and then get back to work. Everything is possible in football.\u201d\n\nHowever, it would be an enormous surprise if they could extend that winning streak in Paris, where they had gone a decade without tasting victory before coming out on top at the start of last season when only a handful of supporters were allowed to attend due to the pandemic.\n\nPlayer to watch: Kylian Mbappe\n\nBecause he is arguably the best player in the world right now. Mbappe scored a hat-trick in PSG\u2019s 6-1 win at Clermont last weekend while also setting up a goal for Neymar and winning a penalty that the Brazilian converted. The week before that he scored two and had a hat-trick of assists against Lorient.\n\nMarseille will provide stiffer opposition than either of those limited sides, but Mbappe will take some stopping as he looks to add to his Ligue 1 best tallies of 20 goals and 14 assists moving into perhaps his final weeks as a PSG player.\n\nKey stats\n\n8 \u2013 Marseille have won their last eight games in all competitions.\n\n10 \u2013 Kylian Mbappe has been directly involved in 10 goals in PSG\u2019s last two games. He has scored five, provided four assists and won a penalty which led to a goal.\n\n5 \u2013 Lyon are five points adrift of the top five and risk missing out on European qualification for next season following their midweek Europa League exit.\n\nFixtures (times GMT)\n\nFriday\n\nRennes v Monaco (1900)\n\nSaturday\n\nSaint-Etienne v Brest (1500), Lille v Lens (1900)\n\nSunday\n\nNice v Lorient (1100),\n\nMetz v Clermont,\n\nMontpellier v Reims,\n\nNantes v Angers,\n\nTroyes v Strasbourg (all 1300),\n\nLyon v Bordeaux (1505),\n\nParis Saint-Germain v Marseille (1845)\n\nAFP",

          "title": "Hiding under the umbrella of insecurity, by Femi Adesina",
          "text": "Security is everything, nobody can dispute that. You have to be alive to enjoy every other thing government is providing; roads, rail, bridges, airports, food security, in fact, everything.\n\nThat is why whenever you hear President Muhammadu Buhari talk of the priorities of his administration for the country, he starts with security, stressing that before you can efficiently manage an organization, town, city, or country, you first have to secure it. He then proceeds to talk about reviving the economy, and fighting corruption. But security is always number one.\n\nDoes Nigeria have security challenges? Severe ones. I\u2019ve always said it, while adding that the government was taking up the gauntlet.\n\nTwo weeks ago, after the attack on the Abuja-Kaduna train by terrorists, I wrote that Nigeria was actually at war. It was, however, silly and idiotic to see a newspaper twist that piece in a news story, writing; \u2018Femi Adesina finally admits that Nigeria is at war.\u2019 Otiose. Witless. Illiterate. Who does not know that our country had been at war against insurgency since 2009, when Boko Haram manifested in the Northeast?\n\nBut we leave those who twist every word to continue to contort themselves, till they completely get out of shape, tying themselves up in a labyrinth. It will serve them right.\n\nThe point of interest today is the hackneyed calls on President Buhari to resign over the country\u2019s security challenges, the latest coming from a so-called Northern Elders Forum (NEF), a group I\u2019d once described as \u201cGenerals without troops.\u201d\n\nThe Forum is largely made of angry, bitter, self-seeking individuals, who had thought they would be leading President Buhari by the nose when he emerged in 2015. In fact, key personalities in the group made strenuous efforts to be part of the administration. When they didn\u2019t succeed, they became adversaries.\n\nIt is on record that NEF had always opposed the Buhari administration since its gambit failed, and before the 2019 presidential election, it openly endorsed Atiku Abubakar of the People\u2019s Democratic Party (PDP) as next President. And that completely vitiates whatever position the Forum adopts today. It is partisan, bilious, by no means neutral. It is from a self-serving standpoint.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2022, there were at least 271 mass shootings in United States of America, resulting in 1,518 people killed, and 980 wounded. Just this week, there has been the Brooklyn Subway Shooting, in which at least 23 people were critically injured. In all these, did you hear calls for the resignation of any American President? It is on record that last year was the deadliest in a decade, in terms of mass shootings. Have you heard of calls for the resignation of President Joe Biden by a caterwauling band? No.\n\nEvery life is important. No single life should be taken wantonly. Not in America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and definitely not in Nigeria. And when challenges occur, as we currently have, it should not be turned to a leaky political umbrella, from under which you hide to express hatred and malice. That is what is happening in Nigeria today. Individuals, groups, organizations, political parties, who had been against President Muhammadu Buhari, and who had been given bloody noses at the polls, are now using the smokescreen of insecurity to vent their spleen. We failed to oust him through the ballot box, let\u2019s run him out of town by another means. Let\u2019s instigate the country against him. But majority of Nigerians know better.\n\nThere was a story that made the rounds over the weekend. A former military leader, who also became a democratically elected President for two terms, has been reportedly mobilizing all living former leaders to pass a vote of no confidence in President Buhari, due to the county\u2019s security challenges. It was reported that only Gen Yakubu Gowon baulked at the idea, and opted out.\n\nI have been waiting for the story to be debunked, but it hasn\u2019t happened. Let\u2019s then assume that it is true. The agent provocateur has been known as an antagonist of Buhari for a number of years. In fact, he publicly wrote a letter in 2018, commanding the President to \u201cdismount from the horse,\u201d and allow another rider to mount. The incumbent demurred. Is it not democracy? Let\u2019s test our strength at the polls.\n\nThe former leader mobilized against Buhari, publicly endorsing his former deputy in office, whom he had earlier destroyed and treated like something the cat dragged in. The election came, and they were all beaten black and blue. How does he then think Nigerians will accept his constant haranguing of government as something actuated by positive motives? It is sour grapes, pure and simple.\n\nDo we have security problems? We do, just as many other countries of the world. How then do we solve the problems? That is what we expect to hear, and not playing of petty politics under the umbrella of insecurity.\n\nSome of the issues are historical, transcending almost every administration we have had. They are almost as old as the country. Some others are relatively new; insurgency, banditry, kidnappings for ransom, and have the imprint of foreign backing, particularly in some parts of the North. What is the way out?\n\nFor the internecine ones, it is crystal clear that no government can legislate peace. The people themselves must resolve to live together, and accommodate one another. No group can wish the other away under indigene versus settler sentiments. We must resolve for peace. They must not only seek peace, but also pursue it.\n\nAs for insurgency, banditry and kidnappings, government is rising to the challenges. Yes, there are successes and reversals at times, but there\u2019s no doubt that the necessary efforts are being made. It is, therefore, unconscionable to make it appear as if nothing is being done. It is a power struggle. A class struggle. An economic struggle. But at last, Nigeria shall win.\n\nIt is the sacred duty of government to provide security of lives and property. Our Constitution says it in black and white. No leader will be happy to see his citizens killed. That is why more than any government before it, the Buhari administration has funded our security agencies, trained, equipped and motivated them. They are out there, fighting to keep us safe. The least we can do is pray for them, encourage them, not engaging in petty power play, which amounts to dancing on the graves of the dead.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity",

Shuaibu Ibrahim said the NYSC Radio is on Channel 88.3 FM in Abuja while the NYSC TV runs on TStv Channel 365.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe philosophy behind the establishment of these stations is multifaceted. They will educate and entertain, give the scheme a stronger voice to propagate the programmes and sensitise Nigerians on the policies of government, in addition to the promotion of national unity, national ethos, as well as values re orientation.\n\n\u201cThus, they will contribute in redirecting the mindsets of Nigerians, especially the youth, towards things that are noble.\u201d\n\nThe director general said the stations are primarily run by corps members under the supervision of relevant NYSC staff members.\n\nHe said the programmes are meant to provide an avenue to train and hone the skills of successive batches of corps members interested in pursuing careers in the broadcast industry, particularly in production, TV/Radio engineering, programme presentation, graphic design and content development, among others.",

So, take up opportunities for skills development and other opportunities that will give you the leverage in global economy.\u201d",

The UN body said since December 2020, 11, 536 schools were closed due to abductions and security issues.\n\nPeter Hawkins, the UNICEF representative in Nigeria, said school abductions and attacks have discouraged children, especially girls, from learning.\n\nAmnesty International\u2019s Nigeria Director, Osai Ojigho, in a report, said the increasingly brazen manner of recent abductions showed that the Nigerian authorities were failing to prevent these crimes from taking place and have not learnt any lessons from the abduction of the Chibok school girls eight years ago, as families of abducted children are left without any hope of reuniting with their loved ones.\n\n\u201cNigerian is failing to protect vulnerable children, by refusing to respond to alerts of impending attacks on schools across the North of the country, the Nigerian authorities have failed to prevent mass abductions of thousands of school children.\n\n\u201cIn all cases, the Nigerian authorities have remained shockingly unwilling to investigate these attacks or to ensure that the perpetrators of these callous crimes face justice. Every fresh attack is followed by further abductions that deprive school children of their right to liberty and leave victims\u2019 families with no hope of accessing justice, truth, or reparations.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian authorities must urgently comply with the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child to which it is a state party.

          "text": "\n\n*Rejects Atuche, two others\n\n*Buhari meets CDS, Service Chiefs Tuesday\n\n*FG to conduct census in April, 2023\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nThe deteriorating security condition in the country was the focus of the first meeting of the National Council of State (NCS) this year, which held yesterday in Abuja, with the governors taking turns to brief the gathering on the situation in their respective states.\n\n\n\nThe meeting, presided by President Muhammadu Buhari, and attended by past Heads of State and presidents, granted state pardon to former Governors Joshua Dariye and Jolly Nyame of Plateau and Taraba states, respectively, who were serving jail terms for corruption.\n\n\n\nThe two former governors were among 159 convicts pardoned by the council at the meeting held at the Council Chambers of the State House, Abuja.\n\nBut the council rejected the application for prerogative of mercy for a former Managing Director of the defunct Bank PHB, Francis Atuche, who was convicted for stealing and jailed last year. Two other applications were also disallowed.\n\n\n\nBuhari would follow up the discussions at the NCS gathering with a meeting of the National Security Council (NSC) to review the current security situation in the country. The security council comprises Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), the three service chiefs, Inspector General of Police, and others from the military brass.\n\n\n\nThe NCS approved a national population census for April 2023, after the general election slated for February and March 2023.\n\n\n\nBriefing newsmen at the end of the NCS meeting, Governor Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State disclosed that the president would meet security chiefs on Tuesday over the worsening security situation following recommendations and comments by members of the council of state.\n\n\n\nBadaru said, \u201cThe issue of security was brought before the council and it was discussed. Suggestions were made by the state governments and some of the members of the council, and President Muhammadu Buhari promised to call a security meeting to discuss the issues raised on Tuesday so that we will have enhanced security in the country.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe president was more concerned also about food security and the need for a secure country where farmers would go back to land and continue to produce and it is observed that we are by and large food secured. And, in fact, we are feeding the neighbouring countries also because of the worldwide cost in food around the world and most of the neighbouring countries find Nigerian food cheaper.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo, there is need for enhanced production, so that you will not only meet the Nigerian demand, but also the neighbouring countries\u2019 demand and the president promised to discuss this with the service chiefs on Tuesday. So that adequate security arrangement will continue to flow based on the advice he received today from the various governors and also from members of the council.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking also, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, said the council approved 159 out of 162 applications for prerogative of mercy for convicts and inmates in correctional centres across the country. Malami said the recommendation came after the council received the report of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Prerogative of Mercy.\n\n\n\nThe minister stated, \u201cIn the exercise of the powers on the granting of pardon, precisely on the 28th day of August 2018, the president put in place a committee known as the Presidential Advisory Committee on Prerogative of Mercy, which was saddled with the responsibility of visiting the country\u2019s correctional facilities and making recommendations to the president on the exercise of his power of mercy and compassion, by way of either granting pardon to those that have been convicted, clemency, or some other form of concessions by way of reduction in sentence and term.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was in exercise such duties and responsibility, in line with the terms of the Committee on Prerogative of Mercy, that we presented the report to the president and the requirement of the law on the exercise of that mercy and pardon (is that we) should seek the advice of the Council of State.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn line with that, a memo was presented by the president this afternoon to the council through which the report of the committee was presented to council for its advice. The committee made a submission of 162 people presented to the president for such consideration.\n\n\n\n\u201cTwenty-six of the inmates are recommended for presidential pardon, 85 of surviving ex-convicts were recommended for presidential pardon, one deceased person was recommended for posthumous presidential pardon, 27 inmates were recommended for presidential clemency, 13 inmates were recommended for a review of their sentences or prison terms, 10 inmates were presented for a reduced sentence from death to life imprisonment. In total, 162 convicts were presented for the president\u2019s consideration for pardon and mercy.\u201d\n\nMalami said the council rejected proposal to grant pardon to one of the prisoners sentenced to 120 years for stealing over N25 billion. He said the pardon was sought due a life threatening illness.\n\n\n\nThe second inmate was convicted for forgery and sentenced to 14 years in jail, and he had stayed in prison for a year and six months, while the third person, who obtained money by false pretence, was sentenced for seven years, he said.\n\nMalami stressed that the council was not satisfied with reasons adduced for the pardon of the three convicts and, therefore, rejected them.\n\n\n\nOn his part, Minister of Special Duties, Senator George Akume, said the council approved the conferment of National Honours Award on 434 Nigerians, who distinguished themselves in their various field of endeavour.\n\nThe council gave approval for a national headcount to hold in April 2023 after the general election. This would be preceded by a Pilot Census to be conducted by National Population Commission (NPC) in June 2022 after political parties\u2019 primary elections.\n\n\n\nNPC Director General, Nasir Isa-Kwarra, said the commission would deploy technology in the conduct of the national census. Isa-Kwarra said through census, data was generated for planning, noting that the data currently being used are mere projections and obsolete.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt is very crucial because I have highlighted that the census is a very important exercise for the nation. Through census we generate the data that we use for policy making, for planning, for development, by the three tiers of government, and the private sector, they all need this.\n\n\u201cIf you are in private sector, you\u2019re producing something, certainly, you need to know the population of an area if you want to create a market there.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo census data is very crucial, very important. Because, the data we\u2019ve been using are just projections, estimation and are sort of obsolete, we need the actual census data to use for our planning.\u201d\n\nAt the commencement of the meeting, the council observed a minute silence in honour of former Head of Interim National Government (ING), Chief Ernest Shonekan, who died on January 11, 2022.\n\n\n\nThis was the fourth time Buhari would chair the NCS meeting in seven years, with the first held on October 21, 2015, the second on September 7, 2016, and the third held virtually in August 2020.\n\nThe National Council of State is an organ of the federal government saddled with the responsibility of advising the executive on policy-making matters.\n\n\n\nMembers of the council include the president, vice president, past presidents, Senate President, House of Representatives Speaker, Chief Justice of Nigeria, serving and past.\n\n\n\nOthers are Attorney General of the Federation, all state governors, and Minister of Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThose who attended the meeting were Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno, and Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari.\n\n\n\nFormer Heads of State physically in attendance were General Yakubu Gowon, General Abdusalami Abubakar, and former President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\n\n\nOthers attended the meeting virtually from their various locations.\n\nState governors in attendance included Hope Uzodinma (Imo), Kayode Fayemi (Ekiti), Atiku Bagudu(Kebbi), Bello Matawalle (Zamfara), and Nasir El Rufai (Kaduna).

          "text": "\n\n*Approves N4trn Subsidy\n\nDeji Elumoye and Sunday Aborisade, Abuja\n\nFollowing public outrage against the massive stealing of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil, which had seen the country lose huge earnings as well as hobbled its ability to meet the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, yesterday constituted a 13-member Adhoc Committee to investigate oil theft in Nigeria and its impact on petroleum production and oil revenues.\n\nThe composition of the panel was announced on the floor at plenary.\n\n\n\nLawan named Senator Bassey Albert Akpan as Chairman of the Committee.\n\nOther members on the panel include Senators Yusuf A. Yusuf, Solomon Olamilekan Adeola, Kabiru Gaya, Mohammed Adamu Aliero, George Thompson Sekibo and Gabriel Suswam.\n\n\n\nThe panel also included Senators Kashim Shettima, Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi, Ali Ndume, Stella Oduah, Sani Musa and Ibrahim Gobir.\n\n\n\nThe adhoc committee was given one month to conclude work on investigations and report back to the chamber in plenary.\n\n\n\nAlso yesterday, the Senate approved a revised budget of N17,319,704,091,019 trillion for the 2022 fiscal year.\n\nAlso, the Senate approved the total sum of N4 trillion for petrol subsidy in 2022. The figure represented the amount contained in two separate requests by the President to the National Assembly for approval.\n\n\n\nThe president, had in a letter to the legislature dated 10th February, 2022, sought an additional N2.557 trillion to fund subsidy payments from July to December, 2022.\n\n\n\nHe had disclosed that 138 of the 254 projects in the budget totalling N13.24 billion had been identified for deletion.\n\nThe National Assembly in December, 2021, had approved the sum of N442.7 billion for subsidy in the 2022 budget for the period of January to June this year.\n\n\n\nBuhari, however, anchored his fresh request on the fact that petrol subsidy was not duly appropriated for in the national budget beyond June.\n\n\n\nAccording to him, the development was as a result of the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act which stops all such payments past the given June deadline.\n\n\n\nIn another letter dated 12th April, 2022, Buhari had requested the National Assembly to approve an additional N1 trillion to his earlier N2.557 subsidy request to bring the total amount on payments to N4 trillion for the year 2022.\n\nThe approval came with the passage of a bill to amend the 2022 Appropriations Act transmitted to the National Assembly on 10th February, 2022, by President Muhammadu Buhari for consideration.\n\n\n\nThe Senate in December, 2021, had passed a budget of N17,126,873,917,692 trillion.\n\nThe revised sum of N17.3 trillion in contrast with the 2022 budget of N17.13 trillion passed last year, represented a N193 billion increase.\n\n\n\nThe passage of the Appropriations Act, 2022 (Amendment) Bill, followed the consideration of a report by the Committee on Appropriations.\n\nThe figure represented an increase of N192.5 billion from the N17.1 trillion approved and assented to last December.\n\n\n\nThe passage followed the consideration of a report by the Appropriation Committee on the 2022 Appropriations Bill in both chambers.\n\nThe nation\u2019s parliament increased its annual budget by N12 billion. It was N139 billion in the 2022 budget but has now increased to N153 billion in the revised version, approved yesterday.\n\n\n\nA critical analysis of the revised budget showed that there was no increment in the capital vote of N5.415 trillion\n\nThe increment affected only the recurrent expenditure.\n\n\n\nOut of the total sum of N17,319,704,091,019 trillion passed, N817,699,410,210 billion is for Statutory Transfers; N3,978,087,110,437 trillion for Debt Service; N7,108,621,131,849 trillion for Recurrent (Non-Debt Expenditure); and N5,415,296,438,523 trillion for Contribution to the Development Fund for Capital Expenditure.\n\n\n\nHe explained that the additional request was against the backdrop of adjustments to the 2022 fiscal framework which became imperative due to market developments occasioned by the spike in crude prices, following the Russian-Ukrainian war.\n\n\n\nThe chamber, accordingly, approved the President\u2019s request for additional N3.557 trillion for PMS subsidy with the passage of the 2022 Appropriations Act (Amendment) Bill, Thursday.\n\n\n\nIt also approved N192.52 billion aggregate increase sought by the executive, and an additional provision of N182.45 billion to cater for the needs of the Nigerian Police Force to enhance their morale.\n\n\n\nThe Senate, after passing the 2022 Appropriations Act (Amendment) Bill, adjourned till the 26th of April, 2021\n\nThe Senate had before the approval, considered the report of its Committee on Finance on the Medium Term Expenditure and Fiscal Strategy Paper, laid by the Chairman, Senator Olamilekan Adeola.\n\n\n\nThe red chamber, in the MTEF/FSP approved oil benchmark $73 per barrel as proposed by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\n\nIt also approved oil production volume of 1.600m per day.\n\nThe chamber gave its nod for an additional provision of N182.4 billion to cater for the needs of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nIt approved debt service provision of N76.13 billion, and net reductions in Statutory Transfers by N66.07 billion.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Alleges EFCC, ICPC only after low-level corruption cases\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nA new report by the United States Department of State has alleged that the judiciary in Nigeria remains susceptible to corruption and is constantly under pressure from the executive and legislative arms of government.\n\n\n\nIn its \u201cCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2021,\u201d the US stated that although the constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, political leaders influence the judges and lawyers, particularly at the state and local government levels.\n\n\n\nThe document added that there was a widespread public perception that judges were easily bribed, and litigants could not rely on the courts to render impartial judgments.\n\n\n\n\u201cMany citizens encountered long delays and reported receiving requests from judicial officials for bribes to expedite cases or obtain favourable rulings,\u201d the report stated.\n\n\n\nIt listed understaffing, inefficiency, and corruption as factors preventing the judiciary from functioning adequately.\n\nOther challenges, the US stated, included the absence of continuing education requirements for attorneys coupled with the fact that police officers were often assigned to serve as prosecutors.\n\n\n\nIt alleged that judges frequently fail to appear for trials, stressing however that the salaries of court officials are low, and officials often lacked proper equipment and training.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe constitution and the annual appropriation acts stipulate that the National Assembly and the judiciary be paid directly from the federation account as statutory transfers before other budgetary expenditures are made to maintain their autonomy and separation of powers.\n\n\n\n\u201cFederal and state governments, however, often undermined the judiciary by withholding funding and manipulating appointments,\u201d the US report noted.\n\n\n\nOn problems with trial procedures, the US posited that although defendants were presumed innocent and enjoy certain rights, authorities do not always respect these rights, most frequently due to a lack of capacity.\n\n\u201cInsufficient number of judges and courtrooms, together with growing caseloads, often resulted in pre-trial, trial, and appellate delays that could extend a trial for as many as 10 years.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlthough accused persons are entitled to counsel of their choice, there were reportedly some cases where defence counsel was absent from required court appearances so regularly that a court might proceed with a routine hearing in the absence of counsel, except for certain offences for which conviction carries the death penalty,\u201d it alleged.\n\n\n\nAccording to the document, in some cases, the police would demand additional payment from family members who wanted to attend a trial even as the authorities could hold defendants in prison awaiting trial for periods well beyond the terms allowed by law.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the document alleged that Nigeria\u2019s anti-corruption agencies, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) as well as the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) were mainly focused on pursuing low and mid-level corruption cases.\n\n\n\nThe US stated that although there had been a few indictments of active top level government officials, the cases were being hampered by administrative delays.\n\nThe US document stated: \u201cThe ICPC holds broad authority to prosecute most forms of corruption. The EFCC\u2019s writ extends only to financial and economic crimes.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe bulk of the ICPC and EFCC\u2019s anti-corruption efforts remained focused on low- and mid-level government officials, although both organisations brought indictments against various active and former high-level government officials.\n\n\n\n\u201cMany of the corruption cases, particularly the high-profile ones, remained pending before the courts due to administrative or procedural delays.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlthough the law provides criminal penalties for conviction of official corruption, the government, the US report stated, did not consistently implement the law, and government employees, including elected officials, frequently engaged in corrupt practices with impunity.\n\n\n\n\u201cMassive, widespread, and pervasive corruption affected all levels of government, including the judiciary and security services.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe constitution provides immunity from civil and criminal prosecution for the president, vice president, governors, and deputy governors while in office. There were numerous allegations of government corruption during the year,\u201d it added.\n\n\n\nOn the government\u2019s posture towards human rights abuses, the report noted government officials sometimes cooperated and responded to such cases, but generally either dismissed allegations, did not provide substantive response, or did not publicise outcomes of investigations.\n\n\n\nThe document added that in the north-east, there had been reports that the military threatened civil society groups and humanitarian organisations after aid provided by the organisations purportedly reached insurgent groups.\n\n\n\nEven though the law establishes the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) as an independent non-judicial mechanism for the promotion and protection of human rights, it noted that the role of the body has been largely advisory as well as for training and advocacy purposes.\n\n\n\n\u201cDuring the year, there were no reports of its (NHRC) prior investigations having led to accountability. The law provides for recognition and enforcement of damages awarded to plaintiffs, but it was unclear whether this happened,\u201d the report stated.\n\n\n\nOn insurgency in the North-east by the militant terrorist groups Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA), it noted that the terrorists continued to conduct numerous attacks on government and civilian targets, resulting in thousands of deaths and injuries.\n\n\n\nAccording to the US report, this has led to the internal displacement of more than three million persons, and the external displacement of more than an estimated 327,000 Nigerian refugees to neighbouring countries as of the year\u2019s end.\n\n\n\nQuoting the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the document noted that more than 24,000 persons were registered as missing in the country, with the majority from the conflict area in the North-east.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere were reports of disappearances by or on behalf of government authorities. According to Amnesty International, the whereabouts of at least 50 suspected supporters of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) group arrested in Rivers State between October and November 2020 remained unknown at year\u2019s end,\u201d it said.\n\nIt stressed that ineffective and non-existent civil registration and identification management systems in areas hosting displaced persons, refugees, and returnees remained a concern.\n\n\n\nFor refugees, the report pointed out that even when civil documents were obtained, community members and local officials were sometimes unaware of their legal rights or standing, which could also prevent them from moving freely, obtaining work, or accessing health care.\n\n\n\nDuring the year, the US posited that ISIS-WA terrorists demonstrated increased ability to conduct complex attacks against military outposts and formations.\n\n\n\n\u201cDuring the year ISIS-WA terrorists took over significant territory formerly held by Boko Haram. ISIS-WA expanded efforts to implement shadow governance structures in large swaths of Borno State,\u201d it said.\n\n\n\nIn the South-east, it stated that following IPOB\u2019s launch of its military wing, the Eastern Security Network, in December 2020, in the first quarter of the year, local media reported 54 violent attacks on civilians and security forces and 222 deaths, representing a 59 per cent and 344 per cent increase, respectively, compared with the quarter prior to its establishment.\n\n\n\nIt stated that while some reports estimated the number of Boko Haram and ISIS-WA abductees at more than 2,000, the total count of the missing was unknown as towns repeatedly changed hands, and many families were still on the run or dispersed in camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs).\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "MTN Nigeria, the Nigerian arm of Africa\u2019s largest telecom, today received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria to run a payment service bank.\n\nWith this approval, MTN Nigeria can provide virtually all the services offered by conventional commercial banks with the exception of granting credit and processing foreign exchange transactions.\n\nThis announcement follows a previous approval in principle granted in November 2021, to Airtel Africa Plc and MTN Nigeria Communications Plc to operate a payment service bank in the country. The final approval was subject to the fulfilment of certain standards of the conditions within six months. This hints that, while MTN has gotten its own approval, Airtel Nigeria could be getting its own soon.\n\nDespite being home to Africa\u2019s largest unbanked population, Nigeria has not witnessed the same exponential growth in mobile money adoption and lags behind its regional peers like Ghana and Kenya when it comes to penetration. In January, MTN revealed that MTN Nigeria\u2019s mobile money service had attracted 9.4 million active users since launching in August 2019.\n\nThis approval is expected to spur the adoption of mobile money in Nigeria as the use cases increase. The widespread coverage of MTN will help it serve people all over the country, especially in rural areas and also position the telecom giant as a competitor for the market share and earnings of commercial lenders.\n\nMTN Nigeria, which provides one-third of the MTN Group\u2019s sales, saw revenue climb to a record \u20a61.7 trillion ($3.4 billion) last year, with profit leaping 45.5% to \u20a6298.9 billion ($598 million). Mobile money is a growing contributor to MTN Nigeria\u2019s income, and it\u2019s expected that the new banking licence would allow the company to explore growth opportunities presented by the Nigeria\u2019s unbanked population.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

If it wasn\u2019t, I think the weekend would be because it is a public holiday. \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude0a So you have the entire day and weekend to rest and be taken care of.\n\nToday, being a good Good Friday, I\u2019ll be talking about the following:\n\nDriving financial inclusion with embedded finance\n\nUber\u2019s operation suspension in Tanzania\n\nOPay Egypt\u2019s preliminary approval\n\nTechpoint Africa Blockchain Summit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, Techpoint Africa is organising the Techpoint Africa Blockchain Summit, where you can learn the basics of Web3 and discover how to build a career in Web3 and blockchain.\n\nThe Blockchain Summit will be held on May 21, 2022, at Four Points by Sheraton, Victoria Island, Lagos.

I couldn\u2019t think.\n\nI guess the salesperson suspected what was wrong. So, she informed me that I didn\u2019t have to pay upfront and I could spread out my payments over six months or so.\n\nBut I was surprised because I didn\u2019t expect a physical retail electronic store to offer such a financial service.\n\nWhat is the service? The store integrates financial services into its non-financial platform \u2014 essentially embedded finance.\n\nIn simpler words, embedded finance is the use of financial tools or services \u2013 like lending or payment processing \u2013 by a non-financial institution.\n\nConsequently, embedded finance enables customers to obtain financial assistance through a third-party app. Embedded finance plans to simplify financial processes for consumers, making it easier for them to get the services they need when they need them.\n\nThe big question is: Can embedded finance drive financial inclusion in Nigeria? Click on the link to find out.\n\nUber Tanzania suspends operations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, Thursday, April 14, 2022, ride-hailing company, Uber, suspended operations in Tanzania until further notice after six years in the country.\n\nUber announced the decision in a statement sent to customers across the country, noting that they will not operate in Tanzania until an agreement with the authorities is reached.\n\nWhy the suspension? Uber is suspending operations in Tanzania after the country\u2019s Land Transport Regulatory Authority (LATRA) \u2014 an authority that establishes and approves fares for ride-hailing operators \u2014 approved higher fares as fuel prices reached an all-time high.\n\nA look into the increase: The new fare represents a 50% increase over the previous fare per km. Essentially, its original fare of TSh450/km ($0.19/km) has been raised to TSh900/km ($0.39).\n\nIs this similar? Yeah, it is. Recall that in May 2021, the company increased its fares in Kenya and Nigeria in response to driver demand for a larger share of commissions to offset increased operating costs.\n\nConsequently, it raised its motorcycle ride and delivery services in Kenya by 15%, while ChapChap \u2013 a ride option that allows riders going in the same direction to share a ride if they find a match \u2013 riders will pay an extra KSh 3 ($ 0.03) per kilometre. This followed Uber\u2019s unveiling of electric motorcycles and scooters in Kenya.\n\nIn Nigeria, Uber increased rates on its UberX platform by 13% in Lagos and 20% in Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja.\n\nWhat\u2019s the company saying? In the same statement, Uber stated that current transportation regulations had created an unfriendly environment, which has posed a challenge to their business.\n\nMeanwhile, LATRA stated in a March 14, 2022 order that the ride-hailing services fares were approved \u201cin an effort to maintain competition and affordable ride-hailing taxi services.\u201d\n\nHowever, Tanzania\u2019s ride-hailing operators do not perceive LATRA as a regulatory body that promotes competition and low-cost taxi services. Rather, they accuse LATRA of assuming a dictating role by doubling market rates.\n\nAlso, it is accused of regularly threatening to revoke operator licenses, thereby creating an uncertain and hostile business environment.\n\nQuick note: Did you know that Uber launched UberMoto, its on-demand motorbike service in Ibadan, Nigeria, in January 2022 to compete with SafeBoda, MAX.ng, and Gokada?\n\nTake a look at it here: Uber\u2019s gamble on Nigerian motorbikes\n\nAfrican startups that have gone through Y Combinator Accelerator Programme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the years, African startups are becoming an important part of Y Combinator\u2019s (YC) accelerator programme since the first startup from the continent participated in the Winter 2009 cohort. Since then, 95 companies have participated as of the Winter 2022 launch, about half of which are financial services providers, and 51 are from Nigeria.\n\nTechpoint Africa\u2019s data and research arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, has partnered with YC to examine the impact of the California-based startup accelerator on the continent. The report will be released soon.

OPay Egypt, a fintech and electronic payments company, has announced that the Central Bank of Egypt has given it preliminary approval to issue prepaid cards via its OPay app.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that OPay cards will be linked to OPay\u2019s mobile app, allowing users to request the issuance or cancellation of prepaid cards.\n\nAccording to Hesham Ezz El-Din, Digital & Cards Business Director at OPay Egypt, prepaid cards will assist them in reaching a non-cash society in light of The Central Bank of Egypt\u2019s strategy and the Egyptian state\u2019s directive.\n\nThe prepaid cards will be distributed in collaboration with Egyptian Cards Company, the largest card distributor in the local and regional markets.\n\nWhat is the company hoping to accomplish with this? OPay Egypt aims to provide all electronic payment solutions in the local market.\n\nHow? Customers will be able to deposit money into the cards and then use them for cash withdrawals and purchases without opening a bank account. These cards offer OPay customers a wide range of services to meet their financial and payment needs.\n\nLastly, Ezz El-Din stated that they are working hard to strengthen their presence in the local Egyptian market through this new offering and supporting their customers through an inclusive system that aids in driving forward digital transformation and financial inclusion.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nNestcoin is hiring an Associate UX Researcher.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, African eCommerce giant, Jumia, launched JumiaPay, its mobile money option, five years after it had first launched. In a statement on its launch, then co-CEO Jeremy Hodara said the objective was to \u201cprovide a safe, secure and convenient shopping experience to our customers.\u201d\n\nWhile novel in Africa at the time, the model has since been adopted by Nigerian startups as they attempt to capture more market share. If you\u2019re wondering what this model is, it is embedded finance.\n\nAn embedded finance play involves a company, usually not a financial institution, offering a financial service in addition to its existing offers.\n\nFor example, a fashion eCommerce startup could add a wallet that users can use for payments, a lending feature that lets them get loans or an insurance feature to insure expensive purchases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor businesses, the benefits are massive. Using our previous example, the eCommerce startup could witness fewer cart abandonments if customers do not have to use external payment methods. They could also see more people buy from them due to the lending feature.\n\nOn the other hand, customers experience ease while using different services and could get access to products they may have been unable to afford previously. Whichever way you look at it, embedded finance seems like a good deal for everyone involved, so how does that affect financial inclusion in Nigeria?\n\nAccording to the World Bank, financial inclusion means that businesses and individuals have access to financial products and services that meet their needs responsibly and sustainably.\n\nThese needs include the ability to save, make payments, access loans, and get insurance. In a 2021 EFInA study, only 45% of Nigerians had a bank account, with the majority of them living in urban areas.\n\n71% of urban adults have a bank account compared to 40% in rural areas. This disparity also shows in the gender of bank account holders, with 57% of men having bank accounts compared to 45% of women.\n\nOne of the reasons for the inability of Nigerians to open bank accounts is the hassles of getting a Bank Verification Number (BVN). Currently, only banks that are often absent in rural areas can assign BVNs.\n\nPer the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System (NIBSS), only 54,169,047 Nigerians have a BVN. While the CBN has launched BVN 2.0 to cater to people who don\u2019t have all the basic requirements, numerous Nigerians are still unable to get one.\n\nWith more than half of Nigerians under 18, this figure suggests that over 40% of Nigerians are excluded from using financial services. However, considering financial inclusion can be achieved in other ways besides using a bank account, this may not be an accurate representation of financial inclusion in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy integrating financial services into non-financial solutions, more Nigerians can be integrated into the financial system without requiring a bank account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "title": "Is Flutterwave\u2019s CEO guilty of insider trading or not?",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello there,\n\nYesterday, I incorrectly stated that Flutterwave is Africa\u2019s most valuable company.\n\nBut per African Financials\u2019 March 2022 market report, South Africa\u2019s multinational telecommunications company, MTN Group, is the most valuable African company in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by market capitalisation.\n\nSome numbers: As of February 2022, MTN Group\u2019s market capitalisation was estimated at $24 billion, making it the most valuable brand in SSA. This is comparable to Flutterwave\u2019s $3 billion valuation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlutterwave, on the other hand, is arguably Africa\u2019s most valuable startup. That was where I got it wrong. Please keep in mind that, at the time of writing, MTN Group is the most valuable African company, while Flutterwave is the most valuable African startup.\n\nMore importantly, Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola, Flutterwave CEO, is the one facing allegations, not Flutterwave.\n\nWe still need you on this: Help Techpoint Africa determine how much African tech workers earn by filling out this form or sharing it with your developer friends.\n\nAnyway, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nFlutterwave CEO\u2019s insider trading allegation\n\nHow VC firm, Katapult, invests\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million Series A\n\nIs Flutterwave\u2019s CEO guilty of insider trading or not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall that on Tuesday, April 12, 2022, David Hundeyin, an investigative journalist, published an article in which he allegedly accused Flutterwave Founder and CEO, Olugenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola of impersonation, inappropriate behaviour, and insider trading.\n\nSince then, the phrase \u201cinsider trading\u201d has topped my Twitter trend tables. While I\u2019ve seen a variety of perspectives \u2013 some of which appear to be accurate and some false \u2013 the question on almost everyone\u2019s lips is, is insider trading a thing given that Flutterwave is a private, US-based startup?\n\nBefore you exercise your Googling skills, I\u2019d like to do my part to simplify things.\n\nFirst off, insider trading, according to Investopedia, is the purchase or sale of stock in a publicly-traded company by someone who has non-public, material information about that stock.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSidebar: For proper understanding, nonpublic material information is corporate news or information about a company that has not been made public but has the potential to affect its stock price.\n\nFor example, suppose Chimgozirim learns about nonpublic material information from someone who works at ABC company and shares it with Bolu. If Chimgozirim\u2019s informant uses this insider information to profit in the stock market, all three involved are guilty and can be prosecuted.\n\nBesides, insider information is typically available to executives working within or near a public company.\n\nAccording to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), illegal insider trading is the purchase or sale of a security in violation of a fiduciary duty or other relationship of trust and confidence based on material, nonpublic information about the security.\n\nWhat does the law say about insider trading? Insider trading laws apply to private and public companies and transactions involving employees, employee stock plans, and third-party shareholders.\n\nSo, what is your verdict on the allegations against Agboola? Guilty? Or innocent?\n\nWhile I may not be able to delve into some of Hundeyin\u2019s allegations, today\u2019s podcast analysed the article to an extent, leaving us with many unanswered questions. You can listen to it here.\n\nAlso, Ogheneruemu has worked on a piece to fact-check Hundeyin\u2019s story. And I believe it will add context to this. Please read it here: Fact Check: Is there any truth to some of the allegations against Flutterwave Founder, Olugbenga Agboola?\n\nHow VC firm, Katapult, invests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf my memory serves me correctly, since secondary school \u2013 if not primary school \u2013 some of us have heard the clause \u201cAgriculture is the mainstay of the national economy.\u201d And, of course, I mean the Nigerian economy.\n\nI also remember my secondary school Agricultural Science teachers repeatedly asking my class to discuss what that meant in both tests and exams at one point or another.\n\nSo, how about we talk about what this means for Africa? Do you want to give it a shot?\n\nI\u2019ll go then: Agriculture is the backbone of most African economies, and agricultural performance is inextricably linked to economic performance in these countries.\n\nTo give some context, studies have shown that agriculture is by far Africa\u2019s most important economic activity. It employs roughly two-thirds of the continent\u2019s working population and contributes an average of 30%-60% to each country\u2019s gross domestic product and approximately 30% of export value.\n\nI\u2019m not here to bore you, so this is my final point: Per a Mckinsey research, Agriculture has a massive social and economic impact in Africa. Smallholder farmers account for more than 60% of sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s population, and agriculture accounts for approximately 23% of the region\u2019s GDP.\n\nRegardless of my points, much of Africa\u2019s agricultural potential is still untapped. In 2020, 282 million Africans went hungry due to insecurity, inadequate agricultural infrastructure, and drought.\n\nMoreover, according to the United Nations (UN), it is expected that Africa will be unable to feed 60% of its population by 2025. The African population, estimated at 118 million at the turn of the twentieth century, had risen to 788.5 million in 1997 and is expected to reach 1.5 billion by 2025.\n\n1.5 billion people will go hungry by 2025? Omo X100! But what are we doing to change this narrative?\n\nAlthough food insecurity, climate change, and other agricultural issues persist on the continent, some startups are trying to address some of the sector\u2019s problems. And Katapult Africa, a venture capital firm, focuses on startups developing solutions for agriculture, food, and the environment.\n\nInteresting facts about the VC firm: The firm was founded in 2016 by Norwegian entrepreneur, Tharald Nustad and has invested in 108 startups, including two unicorns \u2013 Esusu and Betterfly. Also, in 2018, the firm began investing in African startups, and it now has 17 startups in its portfolio.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that I\u2019m not one to give spoilers. But I trust Chimgozirim to provide a detailed explanation of how Katapult invests.\n\nCheck out his insightful article here: An insight into how Katapult VC invests in African startups\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUmba, a digital banking platform based in Lagos, Nigeria, has raised $15 million in Series A funding to expand into new markets like Egypt, Ghana, and Kenya, where mobile money is popular.\n\nWho are the investors? Costanoa Ventures led the round. While firms like Nubank, a credit fintech platform, ACT Ventures, Lux Capital, Palm Drive Capital, Banana Capital, and Streamlined Ventures participated, individuals like Tom Blomfield, the co-founder of Monzo, and Lachy Groom also took part in the round.\n\nWhat does it do? The startup claims it offers transparent and readily available financial products to Africans who are underbanked or unbanked by legacy banks \u2013 locally owned and operated community banks.\n\nWhat is the startup\u2019s model?: Tiernan Kennedy (CEO) and Barry O\u2019Mahony (CFO) launched the company in 2018. And per TechCrunch, the company follows the credit-led model, first solving customers\u2019 liquidity problems before upselling them on a wide range of banking products.\n\nUmba says most of its revenue is generated by charging customers a monthly interest rate of 10%, which the CEO claims is the lowest rate in the market. But how true is this?\n\nTake Payhippo for example \u2013 an AI-powered lending platform that makes it easier to fund small and medium-sized businesses \u2013 claims its loan offering begins with short-term, affordable working capital delivered in 30\u201345 days at a 6% interest rate.\n\nHowever, since Umba\u2019s launch, the company claims it has doubled its revenues every three months, with over 1 million installs on Google Play.\n\nUnlike legacy banks, the company says that its core banking systems, which it designed from the ground up, prioritises customers. Consequently, in both the banking and mobile money markets, it offers customised user experience without delay.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nNestcoin is hiring an Associate UX Researcher.

          "title": "More Nigerian tech developers set sights on jobs abroad",
          "text": "A growing number of Nigerian tech developers are either planning to go abroad to ply their trade or looking to get international jobs while in Nigeria.\n\nOyewale Oyediran, who studied Computer Science at Obafemi Awolowo, is one of many Nigerian tech developers, who have left Nigeria. He left the country for Germany in 2018, and is now in Canada working for Twitter as senior software engineer, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nMany Nigerian tech developers and entrepreneurs are making waves abroad. Nigerian-born Tope Awotona, founder and chief executive of Calendly, recently trended on social media for making it to Forbes\u2019 list as one of America\u2019s wealthiest immigrants.\n\nWhile the tech ecosystem has seen an increase in the number of startups and tech hubs, attracting millions of dollars in investment, not a few Nigerian tech developers are angling to leave the country.\n\nCIO, a tech and IT magazine, disclosed that the 10 most in-demand jobs for 2021 included programmer analyst, mobile app developer, software developer and engineers.\n\nAccording to the US Bureau of Labour and Statistics, developer jobs will grow 22 percent between 2019 and 2029, which remains faster than the average rate of other professions.\n\nRead also: Wardchat leverages technology to connect voters across Nigeria\n\nIt has been reported that most African talents, many of whom are Nigerians, are finding their way to international startups, while they have a growing tech ecosystem to develop.\n\nBusinessDay spoke with some Nigerian developers and they gave a sense of why they prefer to work for international organisations (some via freelance platforms).\n\nAdeleke Abiodun, a software engineer and CEO, Abango Technologies Limited, explained that government policy remained one of the factors pushing Nigerian developers out of the country, citing strict restrictions and ban of many developer works in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to Abiodun, the Nigerian government keeps restricting and putting on hold so many opportunities that should be leveraged for the betterment of the country and developers.\n\nCiting the Twitter ban period, which lasted for seven months, he said, \u201cI have so many friends whose market audience is strictly on Twitter, but the business died as a result of that single restriction. We say we want to liberate the young entrepreneurs in Nigeria, a lot of countries are using blockchain to build so many things to boost their economy but our government placed a ban on it, making developers flee the country for foreign offers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe young developer described the experience of a friend working as a developer in one of the biggest companies in the United Kingdom as motivating.\n\n\u201cI was harassed by the Nigerian police because I was carrying a laptop, and before I could settle with them, I had already missed a conference and a million-naira presentation that I was invited to as a guest speaker.\n\nThis is the height of it all as they took me to the station and requested that I produce my business papers even after searching my laptop. I showed them some of my work and because they couldn\u2019t see anything on me, I was told to produce my CAC documents and I had to miss that offer,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the developers, foreign clients value the mental health of their staff members and see them as assets.\n\nAbiodun said, \u201cThere is no job security in the country, despite your level of experience. In Nigeria, most companies don\u2019t value developers because they believe that one can easily be replaced once they leave.\n\n\u201cWe go places where we get value, and that is why it seems like foreigners are hijacking our talents and workforce. I do lots of remote work and freelancing for international organisations where I get treated with due respect and also pay for consultancy. They value time but you can rarely see that here.\u201d\n\nDarlington Okafor, UI/UX web designer and CEO, NORWEBS designs, noted that the value of the naira to the dollar had been falling in recent years.\n\nHe said: \u201cMost developers are enticed by being paid with dollars as well as the incentives that come with it.\n\n\u201cSome of these big companies like Amazon, Google and others have great incentives for people who work for them and the same is applicable to other tech companies abroad. I believe this is a major driving force for developers targeting foreign clients.\u201d\n\nDarlington stressed the need for a tech community that would drive the financing of developers\u2019 ideas in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe likes of Silicon Valley provide loan facilities to developers. Most Nigerian developers want to go out there and work with all those foreign companies to have access to these opportunities,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Nicholas Idoko, a web developer, most of the time, the foreign clients know what they want and would not try to exceed the boundaries of agreement or try negotiating with you in a funny way.\n\nHe said: \u201cAlthough there are Nigerian clients who know what they want, a larger population of our local clients believe you should do the work practically free for them.\n\n\u201cSome will give you a web application to develop and along the line, they will add an external feature that is not even in the memorandum of understanding, thereby breaching the agreement but a foreign client will never do it.\u201d",
          "summary": "A growing number of Nigerian tech developers are either planning to go abroad to ply their trade or looking to get international jobs while in Nigeria.\nOyewale Oyediran, who studied Computer Science at Obafemi Awolowo, is one of many Nigerian tech developers, who have left Nigeria.\nMany Nigerian tech developers and entrepreneurs are making waves abroad.\nWhile the tech ecosystem has seen an increase in the number of startups and tech hubs, attracting millions of dollars in investment, not a few Nigerian tech developers are angling to leave the country.\nMost Nigerian developers want to go out there and work with all those foreign companies to have access to these opportunities,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Stakeholders in the aviation sector have raised concerns over the extensions given to airlines on their expired Air Operating Certificates (AOCs) instead of renewal or refusal.\n\nBusinessDay gathered that some of the airlines have met the basic safety requirements for the renewal of their AOCs.\n\nAOCs are certificates that allow operators to operate. Airlines in Nigeria renew their AOCs every two years.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s investigation revealed that since last year, it has been very difficult for airlines to get their AOCs renewed as the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) have either denied them AOCs or extended their AOCs.\n\nIt was learnt that about five airlines have not been able to renew their air certificates but have continued to get extensions on their licences from the NCAA.\n\nAn operator who craved anonymity told BusinessDay that \u201cit is only in Nigeria that AOCs are extended, as other countries either deny airlines AOCs if they are not able to meet up with basic safety requirements or issue AOC to airlines that meet basic safety demands as required by the International Civil Aviation Organization\u201d.\n\nAccording to the operator, extensions are only given on other aspects of operations such as medicals but not on AOC, which is key to safety.\n\nHe said to get an AOC renewed, an airline must go through stages such as presentation of staff in management positions; provision of manuals, procedures, and aircraft maintenance certificates; and get security approvals, among others.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe DG of NCAA can reissue the document and allow the other process to continue internally as was done by a former DG, Dumeren, under whom the whole AOC process began. I never heard of extensions under Demuren. He would reissue even before the date lapses. Airlines continue with a brand new certificate forwarded with a letter of warning to complete other requirements, which they always rob safety powder to make it look critical but are usually not.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a game where some of us feel it\u2019s just to keep the airlines desperate and extort money accordingly. There is really no big deal to what they keep as a big deal here. Once aircraft are fit to fly and crew and other dispatch staff are properly trained and current, the safety envelope is closed. There are desirables that may not be cleared, but then airlines can be given up to 90 days to correct.\u201d\n\nRead also: Mixed fortunes as foreign airlines expand Nigerian footprint\n\nMusa Nuhu, director-general of NCAA, confirmed that airlines had been getting extensions on AOCs.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe most duration airlines have been given for extension is 90 days, but usually, it is hardly more than 30 days.\n\n\u201cWe do this thing so that the system will keep functioning. You can imagine if we are unable to complete the process either on the part of the airline or NCAA, we now ground one or two airlines, can you imagine the chaos that we will have in the industry?\u201d\n\nHe explained that disruptions resulting from COVID-19 were not only applicable to flights but also several processes including regulatory functions due to government enforced shutdowns and or provision of skeletal essential services.\n\nHe said all these created significant backlogs.\n\n\u201cThe global aviation is still in recovery mode. The extension of AOC after meeting some basic requirements (e.g. not having a level 1 finding) is a flexibility tool to ensure the aviation ecosystem keeps running while recovery to normal operation is ongoing. In addition, Nigeria finds itself in peculiar circumstances where domestic aviation has experienced significant growth in terms of new AOCs and airports, thus further exacerbating the backlog,\u201d Nuhu said.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s findings show Arik Air has got a three-month extension three times.\n\nAnother operator told BusinessDay on condition of anonymity that his airline had got a 90-day extension on his AOC.\n\nA source in Arik also confirmed that the airline had tried renewing its AOCs for over six months despite fulfilling all safety requirements but kept getting AOC extensions from the NCAA.\n\nLate last year, Baywood Ibe, chief executive officer of TAL Helicopters, said he had evidence to prove that a staff member of NCAA connived with NHV, a Danish operator, to ensure that his firm\u2019s AOC was not renewed.\n\nIbe said at the time the renewal process commenced, the airline had met all the requirements.\n\nBut Nuhu denied any connivance with NHV, insisting that TAL did not meet the mandatory safety requirements necessary to get a renewal.",

          "title": "Nigerians groan as high diesel price stokes inflation",
          "text": "The impact of higher energy costs is expected to reflect stronger in Nigeria\u2019s inflation figures when the National Bureau of Statistics publishes data for March but for Nigerians the pain has lasted longer.\n\nThe rise in the price of diesel following the global energy crisis sparked by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has had a devastating impact on businesses in Nigeria, from manufacturing giants to medium-sized enterprises and small-scale organisations.\n\nFrom gigantic diesel generating plants that turn the industrial machines in Nigeria, to the trucks used for long-distance haulage of both industrial and finished goods, to small machines used by small-scale enterprises, diesel has a stronghold on Africa\u2019s largest economy.\n\nBonchudi Ndigwe, managing director of Continental Waste Managers Limited, explained to BusinessDay how the unprecedented hike in diesel prices has been negatively impacting his business operations in the last two months.\n\n\u201cFor our business, which is about 80 percent transportation with diesel engine trucks, it is clear that this unprecedented diesel price increase is a major blow to our operations.\n\n\u201cFirstly, the prevailing business environment and downturn in the economy did not allow us to make any increase in our tariffs since the consumers/clients are currently finding it difficult to pay the existing rates, not to talk of an increase occasioned by the jump in diesel price.\u201d\n\nNdigwe said, \u201cSecondly, the present diesel price is negatively impacting on frequency and efficiency of service to tenements, since our compactor trucks could only move after they have been fuelled, and this is directly related to payment receipts from serviced clients which are dwindling by the day.\n\n\u201cAnd considering that waste management business in Lagos state is rigidly regulated and tariffs to tenements controlled and roundly discussed with stakeholders, it becomes almost impossible to suddenly increase the rate because of the jump in diesel price.\n\n\u201cTherefore, we are solely bearing the brunt for the increase in diesel price and clearly experiencing reduced receivables and difficulties in providing services to our esteemed clients.\u201d\n\nDiesel prices, which are deregulated in Nigeria, have jumped from about N288 per litre in January to over N780 by the end of March/early April.\n\nA staff member of the Abuja Urban Mass Transit, who opted to be anonymous, told BusinessDay that the current crisis had caused transport fare to increase from N100 to N250, from Bwari to Wuse route.\n\nAccording to him, payment of salaries is inconsistent because the organisation is struggling to stay afloat amid the high diesel cost.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge challenge for the lower/struggling class as the urban mass transit is largely patronised by masses who cannot afford high taxi rates. The hike in prices is defeating the purpose of the transport system,\u201d he said.\n\nThis crisis has forced businesses to begin rationing supplies, cutting down work hours and wasting productive working hours either monitoring diesel consumption or totally clamping down on consumption.\n\nStephen Nejo, a Lagos-based banker, noted that some banks had cut down the number of operating hours.\n\n\u201cThe cost of running diesel has really increased. When you look at the cost and the income is not increasing, the best you can do is to reduce your expenditure by reducing the number of hours you run in serving customers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe impact of the price hike has been worsened by the drop in electricity supply in the country on the back of the collapse of the national grid.\n\nImu Ismaila, a petty trader who deals in frozen fish and chicken, said she had lost nearly N100,000 since the power failure that had lasted for several weeks and had refused to improve.\n\nShe said the cost of preserving her goods had increased due to the high diesel cost, forcing her to increase the price of her wares.\n\nIsmaila, who resides in the Lokogoma area of Abuja, said: \u201cIn the first week when this problem started more than 30 pieces of my fish decayed; this business requires constant electricity, and because of that shortage, everyday some of my fish must decay.\n\n\u201cI am managing the situation by increasing prices; else I will keep running on huge losses every day. My customers are complaining but that\u2019s the only way; though the increase is not much, Nigerians will still complain.\u201d\n\nWole Akeju, executive director at RedBox Deluxe Caf\u00e9, said out of all his three businesses, his lounge and drink businesses had been hit the most.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe cold room, used to store the drinks, run on diesel because everything has to be chilled. We are really struggling because we cannot pass that cost to our customers because they will complain, making us lose them to our competitors.\n\n\u201cAt some point, we bought diesel as high as N750-N800 per litre. Although, it has come down a bit now but it has not changed anything. Until it goes back to N400 per litre, then maybe things will be OK.\u201d\n\nTransferred cost\n\nMoses Ojo, a Lagos-based economic analyst, told BusinessDay that the prices of bread and sachet water rose significantly in the first quarter of the year.\n\n\u201cIn my view, businesses are already transferring increase in input costs to final consumers due to pressures on their margins. Recently, we have seen an increase in the prices of loaves of bread, sachet water and other consumables,\u201d Ojo said.\n\nAccording to him, the ability of businesses, especially consumer goods firms, to transfer the increase in input costs to the final consumer is being hampered by the weak consumer spending and other macroeconomic factors that are not favourable to the consumers.\n\n\u201cHowever, there is a limit to the ability of businesses to absorb increased costs,\u201d he added.\n\nMuda Yusuf, chief executive officer at Centre for the Promotion of Private Enterprise, said the degree of the competition in a market would determine whether to increase prices or not.\n\n\u201cIt depends on the degree of competition in the market. If it is a highly competitive market, it will be very difficult for producers or retailers to transfer the increase to consumers for fear of losing them. So, when you are faced with elastic demand it is not easy to increase prices,\u201d he said.\n\nRead also: Private schools struggle amid rising diesel price\n\nDamilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, said: \u201cIt depends on the industry. For inelastic products, players will find it easy to transfer additional cost to consumers.\n\n\u201cFor elastic products like food stuff and consumables, the situation puts them in a dilemma. Absorb costs and see your bottom line drop; transfer cost and lose market share. I feel industry dynamics will shape decisions.\u201d\n\nIbrahim Tajudeen, head of research at Chapel Hill Denham, indicated that threat to profits would be a major trigger that would stimulate transfer of cost to the consumers.\n\n\u201cThey will pass it when the pressure on their profitability is too much for them to bear because there will be a tolerance level for them in that regard and at that point, they will be willing to pull the trigger in terms of price increase to consumers,\u201d he said.\n\nDavid Arinze, a businessman at Bannex, a shopping mall in Abuja, said he had made up his mind on getting solar system for his business.\n\n\u201cInstalling a solar system is very expensive, but it is a more sustainable solution. However, the loan to purchase it is going to be very costly and that cost might have to be channelled to my customers unfortunately,\u201d he said.\n\nExperts differ on MPC\u2019s next action\n\nLast month, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria signalled a possible hike in the benchmark interest rate in the second quarter.\n\n\u201cThe current surge in energy prices has placed significant levels of pressure on businesses to acquire loans,\u201d Tajudeen said.\n\n\u201cThe likelihood of increasing interest rates is high and the reason is that 40 percent of the MPC committee at the previous meeting voted for a rate increase. So, in the next meeting, if 60 percent of them vote for a rate increase, it might be as high as 50 basis points,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to Ojo, the surge in energy prices is a one-off event that was caused by the disruption in supply chain by the war between Russia and Ukraine and the decision to boycott Russian crude oil by some countries.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe situation is expected to normalise soon; however countries like the United States have taken actions to ameliorate the crisis by releasing a significant quantity of crude oil to the world market daily.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I do not think the situation will have an impact on the decision of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in their next meeting,\u201d he added.\n\nYusuf is of the view that the MPC would not increase the rate because the key drivers of inflation are not monetary issues.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s inflation is cost-driven. And if the monetary policy rate is increased, it can only create more challenges for businesses because the cost of borrowing will go up which will mean more problems, worsening the pains of those using diesel,\u201d he said.\n\nAdewale said the MPC\u2019s decision at the next meeting would be largely dependent on Q1 2022 GDP figure, which would be released before the end of April.\n\nHe said, \u201cAt the last meeting of the MPC, one of the key considerations was the impact of the higher energy prices on consumer prices. Something interesting also happened: four out of 10 members voted for a hike compared to the unanimous decision in January.\n\n\u201cFor the May meeting, the outcome of the Q1-2022 and inflation trajectory as well as expectations would shape policy decisions. I think if GDP growth comes out suboptimal, I see the MPC holding rates (though some members will opt for a hike) to ensure growth is supported while adopting its usual administrative measures to regulate liquidity.\n\n\u201cThe truth is because Inflation is driven by structural factors, CBN won\u2019t be willing to hike interest rates because it poses a threat to their development interventions.\u201d\n\nAdewale said: \u201cDiesel has been deregulated for a long time now. Marketers are left to source for dollars, which they buy from the black market. You know the rate at which dollars are sold in the black market.\n\n\u201cAgainst these odds, I am hopeful that the pump price of diesel will eventually go down in a few weeks and subsequent anticipated inflationary pressures would hopefully be tamed. The market will definitely adjust itself,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari and the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, on Thursday, commissioned 68 housing units, under the National Housing Programme (NHP) Phase 1, in Uhunmwonde Local Government Area of Edo State.\n\nObaseki, at the unveiling of the units, called for increased collaboration between the state and federal governments, as well as other stakeholders to address the housing deficit in the country.\n\nThe governor said, \u201cAs the National Bureau of Statistics has shown, we have over twenty million housing deficit in Nigeria, which means that very many Nigerians are living without proper shelter. The World Bank recommends at least a million homes annually to bridge this gap.\n\n\u201cBut due to limited resources and economic challenges, it is difficult for us to attain this goal. It is very important to encourage all partners, particularly the federal government, that collaboration is very key. While we congratulate them and appreciate what they have done, we are saying that the road ahead is very long.\n\n\u201cThe pace at which we are going is very slow. We need to change the strategy; 65 units of housing after nine years of construction will not solve our problems. We need to do more, and as a state, we are going to collaborate with the federal government to achieve the desired goals.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhile considering the gains of this project, it\u2019s pertinent to note and underscore the need to develop other aspects of the housing industry that will help us move at a much faster pace and one of them is mortgages. Unless we introduce a virile, realistic, and affordable mortgage arrangement we will not be able to develop housing as we want to.\n\n\u201cFor us in Edo, we are very committed to housing projects. As we speak, we have about four projects which we are working on already.\u201d\n\nObaseki continued: \u201cWe are prepared to work with all partners including the federal government and communities to make sure that we take the issue of housing development very seriously. We would like to collaborate with the federal government. We hope that the next phase will not be developed the way this one has been developed.\n\n\u201cWe have more land, so we shouldn\u2019t be doing housing like this on four hectares. We have more land to give to you; we also understand some of the challenges you faced, but those challenges can be overcome. We need to collaborate closely.\n\n\u201cI believe that the dream of the federal government to tackle her housing deficit will be best accomplished with a closer working collaboration with states so that we can jointly build houses for Nigerians at the rate which we need to build. If we go on at this rate, half of us will be on the street.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, President Buhari, who was represented by Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, commended the state government for providing the land and the host community for their cooperation in ensuring the project is completed.\n\n\u201cThis is a benefit of inter-government collaboration despite the political divide. This is one of the first phases of the several phases of the Federal Government Housing projects since 2016.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

Olamilekan Adeola.(APC \u2013 Lagos).\n\nSenate accordingly approved the $73 dollars per barrel proposed by President Muhammadu Buhari, including approving oil production volume of 1.600 million per day;\n\nA Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS) subsidy of N4 trillion; and a cut in the provision for Federally funded upstream projects being implemented by N200 billion from N352.80.\n\nWhile approving an increase in the Federal Government Independent Revenue of N400 billion, Senate gave its approval for an additional provision of N182.4 billion to cater to the needs of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nIt approved debt service provision of N76.13 billion, and net reductions in Statutory Transfers by N66.07 billion.\n\nA breakdown of the net reductions are as follows: NDDC, by N13.46 billion from N102.78 billion to N89.32 billion; NEDC, by N6.30 billion from N48.08 billion to N41.78 billion; and UBEC, by N23.16 billion from N112.29 billion to N89.13 billion.\n\nOthers are Basic Health Care Fund, by N11.58 billion from N56.14 billion to N44.56 billion; and NASENI, by N11.58 billion from N56.14 billion to N44.56 billion.\n\nThe chamber also approved a fiscal deficit of N7.35 trillion.\n\nIn his presentation, Adeola said that the total budget deficit was projected to increase by N965.42 billion to N7.35 trillion, representing 3.99 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\n\nAccording to him, the incremental deficit would be financed by new borrowings from the domestic market.\n\nLawmakers, who made contributions on the report for the review of the 2022 fiscal framework, attributed the Nigeria\u2019s economic downturn to crude oil theft.\n\nSen. Olubunmi Adetunmbi (APC \u2013 Ekiti), said the federal government and security agencies owed it a duty to stop the stealing of our common wealth.\n\nHe decried that at a time when most countries of the world were reaping hugely from the increase in crude oil prices caused by the Russia-Ukrainian crisis, Nigeria was left out for its inability to meet its OPEC quota.\n\nThe Senate Leader, Yahaya Abdullahi, said the country should be in a state of mourning over its current experience, attributing the failure of security agencies to protect oil assets as a major reason for the decline of the economy.\n\nHe expressed concern over rising cases of oil theft despite huge resources allocated to the military, police and other security agencies.\n\nOther Senators, like Gabriel Suswam (PDP Benue ), Betty Apiafi (PDP Rivers), urged the Senate not to hastily approve the President\u2019s request to adjust the 2022 fiscal framework until certain questions were answered.\n\nWhile Suswam raised concerns on the widening gap in budget deficit and the federal government\u2019s decision to resort to funding from the Capital Market, Apiafi, demanded answers from the NNPC and relevant agencies on solutions to curb crude oil theft.\n\nThe Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, in his concluding remarks, called on the Federal Government to take \u201cradical\u201d steps towards stopping the theft of crude oil by economic saboteurs.\n\nHe also called for a stop to the importation of refined petroleum products into the country, so as to cut down on expenditures incurred in the process, as well as to maximize profits from crude oil sales.\n\n\u201cThis (crude theft) is not something to play politics with, and I don\u2019t think the answers are going to be easy to come by.\n\n\u201cRadical decisions would have to be taken, but before we find answers we have to live with this, though we have to be as fast as possible in looking for answers.\n\n\u201cI had a session with the Chief of Defence Staff about a month ago, and my discussions with him were on the oil theft and the efforts of our security agencies to combat this menace.\n\n\u201cAnd like we know, our security agencies are doing their best, but we have people \u2013 our people \u2013 who are sabotaging the oil industry, because oil theft is not perpetrated by somebody else but by people who are citizens.\n\n\u201cSo, we need to continue to support the security agencies in whatever way possible so that they are able to deal with this.\n\n\u201cI also believe that, whether there is oil theft or not, until we stop the importation of refined products to Nigeria, we will never get the best out of the oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cWe should, therefore, work to ensure that we produce our refined products locally, because that is one way of cutting our expenditure on importation.\n\n\u201cI also think that diversification of the economy is key, because we depend so much on this oil and gas industry, the slightest issues that affects it internationally affects us seriously in our country,\u201d Lawan said.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nThe Pastor of Dunamis International Gospel Centre Worldwide, Abuja, Pastor Paul Enenche, Wednesday, said he had no acknowledge that the late popular gospel artiste, Osinachi Nwachukwu, was maltreated by her husband, Peter Nwachukwu.\n\nOsinachi, a 42-year-old artiste who was a lead singer in Enenche\u2019s church died on Friday in an undisclosed hospital in Abuja after being admitted for days.\n\nIt was alleged that the woman died as a result of domestic violence.\n\nIn a recorded video broadcast posted across all his social media handles and on the church\u2019s Facebook Page, Dunamis TV, Wednesday, Enenche said all he knew was that the late Osinachi and her husband, Peter, came to him for prayers when the former complained of chest pain over two months ago.\n\nEnenche stated that \u201cOver two-and-a-half months to three months ago, she came to see me with her husband with complaints of chest pain and respiratory distress. I prayed for her and prayed again.\n\n\u201cWhen the symptoms did not abate, I counselled that they went to the hospital to help us know exactly what we were dealing with and they asked if I could help them facilitate that process. I called our head of medical team, Dr Osang, who is a consultant paediatrician with the Federal Medical Centre, Keffi (Nasarawa State) to assist to handle their situation.\n\n\u201cHe called the FMC, Jabi (Abuja), where they attended to her. On seeing her, they ordered some examinations and investigations and that including CT scan. That was done, and from what the doctors saw, they felt there was the need for further investigation either at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital or the National Hospital, Abuja. I called the doctor at the UATH, Dr Akoh Alexander, and told him the situation.\n\nThe Pastor said the late artiste was later admitted and was responding to treatment before he heard about her death.\n\nThe Pastor further said, \u201cNow if there was domestic violence that led to or coincided with those symptoms she came with two-and-a-half to three months ago, there is no way I would know. If there had been perennial domestic violence, there is no way I would have known.\n\n\u201cThe things we are hearing after her passing were very strange to my hearing. Then, I began to ask questions. Then, I asked the twin sister, \u2018Were you aware that your sister passed through all these things?\u2019 She said yes, that she knew some of them, but that the majority of them she heard only from those she (Osinachi) confided in.\n\n\u201cI asked her, \u2018If you knew, why didn\u2019t you let us know?\u2019 and she said, she (Osinachi) always begged her not to tell the pastor or the church that the man would change and asked for prayers. That continued to happen.\u201d\n\nEnenche added that he asked Osinachi\u2019s first son of what transpired between his mom and dad and he confirmed the stories.\n\nThe said that he refused to speak up in order not to attract his father\u2019s anger.\n\n\u201cThe last one that touched me so much was the music producer who came to see me in the office two days ago to tell me his own experience and how he witnessed that the man slapped the wife in his studio,\u201d he added.\n\nEnenche maintained that all he knew about the deceased\u2019s plight in the hands of her husband were brought to his knowledge after her death.\n\nIn the meantime, the Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen, said she almost cried when Osinachi\u2019s children narrated their late mother\u2019s ordeal in the hands of their father to her.\n\nThe NIGERIAN OBSERVER monitored the interview of the minister on NTA\u2019s Good Morning Nigeria\u2019s breakfast show.\n\nThe Minister said her encounter with the deceased\u2019s children confirmed that her husband is married to another woman.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

This housing estate is an example of the fulfillment of that promise of change.\n\n\u201cThis is a good example of some of the developmental possibilities that inter-governmental collaboration can produce, and I am optimistic that with the provision of more land, the Federal Government certainly can do more. Of course, the progressive ideals of our government seek to achieve one primary objective, which is to improve the human condition.\n\n\u201cWe certainly cannot meet everyone of those Nigerians in person, but our economic policies and investment in infrastructure such as the National Housing Programme and others will reach and positively impact many of them. Our desire and commitment towards improving the human condition and our message of change, have another facet beyond job creation.\u201d\n\nThe president also stated that the inauguration provided an opportunity to fulfil the promise of providing houses for the Super Eagles, for winning the 1994 African Cup of Nations, with Wilfred Agbonavbare and the late Thompson Oliha, who was represented by his wife, Iris, benefiting, with three-bedroom flat allocated to each of them.\n\nHe said in the states where the houses had been completed, his administration had issued maintenance contracts to small businesses, in order to ensure that the estates were maintained and kept in good repair, thereby creating jobs for Nigerians.\n\nPresident Buhari hailed the government and people of Edo State for their cooperation towards the successful completion and inauguration of the housing project, which he said would help to improve and promote the welfare of people of the state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEdo State governor Godwin Obaseki, in his remarks, reiterated that many Nigerians were not living in proper shelter, in view of limited resources and economic challenges.\n\nObaseki noted that collaboration was key, in order to meet Nigeria\u2019s housing needs, while urging other stakeholders to support the initiative.\n\nThe minister of works and housing, Babatunde Fashola (SAN) in his address, revealed that in 34 states of Nigeria, the federal government, through the Ministry of Works and Housing, had delivered similar housing projects, with the support of the state governors, who provided the land.\n\nFashola, who was represented by the director, public buildings and housing development, Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, Solomon Labafilo, disclosed that the project was the outcome of a national survey conducted by the ministry.\n\nHe said: \u201cAs we head towards the end of President Buhari\u2019s tenure of office, I am happy to also say that we have entered a season of completion of many projects such as this, as they begin to bear fruits.",

This is disgraceful, indefensible and unacceptable,\u201d he tweeted\n\nThe former minister wondered how much longer Nigerians can put up with the incessant bloodletting, kidnappings and maiming of innocent citizens while government only issues statements.\n\nFani-Kayode wondered how many more Nigerians will die before citizens cultivate a sense of national outrage.\n\n\u201cWhen will our people and Government say \u2018enough is enough!\u2019 Do we have any self-respect and pride?\n\n\u201cThese are NIGERIANS that are being butchered!!! Our very own people and our very own compatriots!!! When will something be done to stop the wholesale carnage?\n\n\u201cWe have endured the pain and shame in silence for far too long, hoping and praying that the authorities will rise up to the occasion and that things will change for the better. Sadly things appear to be getting worse.\n\n\u201cWe cannot sit back and watch silently anymore as our compatriots are being cut short by a bunch of ruthless, vicious, evil and savage militias made up of primarily foreign barbarians and bloodthirsty bandits. The FG has an obligation before God and the Nigerian people to do far more.\n\n\u201cThey have a few more months before their tenure comes to an end to put a stop to this madness. They have a few more months to stop the war crimes, the crimes against humanity, the genocide & the unprecedented terror and hardship that has been unleashed against the people of this country by these villainous and heartless enemies of humanity.\n\n\u201cThey must empower our security and intelligence agencies, give them the green light and stop holding them back,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former minister said that the government must take actions without further delay and must fish out those criminals wherever they are and stop acting as if the killers were being treated with kid gloves.\n\n\u201cAnything short of that would be a monumental failure on their part and a deep insult and spiritual wound to the Nigerian people. There is no honor or decency in showing restraint before those that kill innocent men, women and children.\n\n\u201cThere is no decency in treating those that seek to wipe out our people with kid gloves. They deserve to be sent to their maker in the most brutal and decisive manner and we demand no less from the Federal Government,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are reports that the Berom people of Plateau State have lost over 11, 000 of their indigenes as a result of the killings going on in their communities for over two decades.\n\nFulani militias are said to have also sacked thousands of people from 68 villages and communities, and occupied the places.\n\nA recent report has it that more than 6,000 persons were displaced following attacks carried out by suspected terrorists in Kanam Local Government Area of Plateau State and that majority of the people were currently taking refuge in markets and primary schools.\n\nThe suspected terrorists had invaded about seven communities in Kanam LGA on Sunday and shot at anyone they saw, which led to the killing of over 70 persons.\n\nSeveral persons were also abducted by the terrorists, who also set their houses ablaze.\n\nReacting to the killings, President Muhammadu Buhari declared that the sponsors and the perpetrators must not be forgiven.",

          "text": "Indications emerged Thursday that former governors of Taraba state, Jolly Nyame, and Joshua Dariye of Plateau state were among the 159 convicts granted pardon by the Council of State.\n\nSimilarly, Blueprint also gathered that a former army general and minister of communications under the late Head of State, General Sani Abacha, and his late special assistant, Lt. Col. Oluwole Oyebanji Akinyode, and all the junior officers jailed over the 1990 abortive Gideon Orkar coup, were also on the list.\n\nHowever, it was reliably learnt that unlike other beneficiaries, a former Managing Director of Bank PHB, Francis Atuche, jailed for 25.7billion fraud, had his request for pardon rejected by the Council.\n\nHe was jailed June 17, 2021 alongside Ugo Anyanwu, a former Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the bank.\n\nWhile Atuche bagged six years, the trial judge, Justice Lateefa Okunu of the Lagos High Court, sentenced Anyanwu to 4-year imprisonment.\n\nAtuche, it would be recalled, had begged the court not to jail him, saying he had learnt his lessons, and that he did not want to be an ex-convict.\n\nPleading with the court, Atuche had said: \u201cAll the time I was the MD of Bank PHB, I gave my all to the bank. Never at any material time did it occur to me that I would set up a scheme to defraud the bank.\n\n\u201cI plead for mercy, leniency, your kindness, and I plead that out of your kindness and generosity, you will not allow me to go to jail. I am sorry and remorseful.\u201d he said.\n\nAtuche further told the court that as a professional banker and chartered accountant, he certainly did not want to become a convict.\n\n\u201cI pray that God will place in your heart to be kind. I plead from the bottom of my heart. I\u2019m extremely sorry; today will be a turning point in my life, I\u2019m very sorry,\u201d he said.\n\nNyame, Dariye\u2019s travails\n\nNyame, a former governor of Taraba state (1999 to 2007), was serving a 12-year jail term at the Kuje Prison over N1.64 billion fraud, with the Supreme Court upholding his conviction February 2020.\n\nFor Dariye, former governor of Plateau state who got jailed while serving as a lawmaker, the court found him guilty of stealing public funds to the tune of N1.6 billion during his tenure as governor between 1999 and 2007.\n\nHe got into the Senate 2015 and jailed June 2018, during which he served out his tenure as lawmaker until 2019.\n\nJustice Adebukola Banjoko of the FCT High Court Abuja had on June 12, 2018 convicted Dariye and originally sentenced him to 14 \u2013 year imprisonment on charges of criminal breach of trust and two years jail terms for criminal misappropriation.\n\nUpon appeal, however, the Court of Appeal in Abuja November 16, 2018, commuted the jail term to 10.\n\nIn a affirming its decision, the Court of Appeal held that section 416 (2) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015, prohibited the imposition of a maximum sentence on a first offender.\n\nDissatisfied, Dariye proceeded to the Supreme Court, where Justice Ejembi Emo, a member of the five-man panel, ruled that the former governor\u2019s appeal \u201csucceeded in part\u201d having quashed his conviction in respect of charges of criminal misappropriation.\n\nThe former lawmaker\u2019s effort to exit the prison in 2021 failed as a five-man panel of the apex court, led by Mary Odili (JSC), though in a unanimous decision, quashed the aspect of his conviction over criminal misappropriation, but that was not sufficient to let him off the hook.\n\nThe offences for which he was discharged, only attracted two-year jail term out of the 14 years handed him by the lower court.\n\nIn specific terms, the Supreme Court upheld the former lawmaker\u2019s conviction in respect of criminal breach of trust, which attracted a 10-year jail term.\n\nAttendance\n\nIn attendance at the meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari, were former President Goodluck Jonathan, two former Heads of State, Yakubu Gowon and Abdulsalami Abubakar, while former President Olusegun Obasanjo was said to be away to the United States on medical vacation.\n\nThe Council of State is a constitutional organ saddled with the responsibility of advising the executive arm of government on major policy decisions.\n\nThe membership include the President, Vice President, past Presidents, Senate President, Speaker House of Representatives, as well as the Chief Justice of Nigeria, past and serving.\n\nThe rest are the Attorney-General of the Federation, all State Governors and the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nAGF Malami briefs\n\nAttorney General and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami (SAN) who briefed journalists at the end of the meeting, was however silent on the identity of the beneficiaries of the Council\u2019s magnanimity.\n\nHe said the recommendation came after the council received the report of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Prerogative of Mercy.\n\n\u201cIn the exercise of the powers on the granting of pardon, precisely on the 28th day of August 2018, the President put in place a committee known as the Presidential Advisory Committee on Prerogative of Mercy, which was saddled with the responsibility of visiting the country\u2019s correctional facilities and making recommendations to the President on the exercise of his power of mercy and compassion, by way of either granting pardon to those that have been convicted, clemency, or some other form of concessions by way of reduction in sentence and term.\n\n\u201cIt was in exercise such duties and responsibility in line with the terms of the Committee on Prerogative of Mercy that we presented the report to the President and the requirement of the law on the exercise of that mercy and pardon, should seek the advice of the Council of State.\n\n\u201cIn line with that, a memo was presented by the president this afternoon to the council through which the report of the Committee was presented to council for its advice. The Committee made a submission of 162 people presented to the President for such consideration.\n\n\u201c26 of the inmates are recommended for presidential pardon, 85 of surviving ex-convicts were recommended for presidential pardon, one deceased person was recommended for post humours presidential pardon, 27 inmates were recommended for presidential clemency, 13 inmates were recommended for a review of their sentences or prison terms, 10 inmates were presented for a reduced sentence from death to life imprisonment. In total, 162 convicts were presented for the President\u2019s consideration for pardon and mercy,\u201d he said.\n\nMalami also said the Council of States endorsed 159 out of the 162 convicts and advised the president to grant them pardon and mercy, but rejected three of the recommended convicts.\n\n\u201cThe Council rejected proposal to grant pardon to one of the prisoners sentenced to 120 years for stealing over N25 billion. The reason for seeking for pardon was because of life threatening illness.\n\n\u201cThe second person was convicted for forgery, sentenced for 14 years and has stayed in prison for a year and six months. The third person was obtaining money by false pretence and was sentenced for seven years,\u201d Malami further explained.\n\nNational honours\n\nAlso speaking, Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs Senator George Akume disclosed that over 400 nominations were endorsed by the council for the granting of national honours.\n\n\u201cThe council approved the conferment of National Honours Award on 434 Nigerians who have distinguished themselves in the various field of endeavours.\n\n\u201cIt is supposed to be a yearly event, where the president confers on worthy Nigerians, men and women of integrity and character and are therefore, found worthy to be conferred with our national honours,\u201d he said.\n\nShonekan remembered\n\nPrior to the commencement of the meeting, a minute silence was observed in honour of late Head of Interim Government Chief Ernest Shonekan by members.",

          "title": "US Report: Nigerian Judicial Officers Demand Bribe for Favourable Rulings",
          "text": "A new report by the United States Department of State has alleged that the judiciary in Nigeria remains susceptible to corruption and is constantly under pressure from the executive and legislative arms of government.\n\nIn its \u201cCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2021,\u201d the US stated that although the constitution and law provide for an independent judiciary, political leaders influence the judges and lawyers, particularly at the state and local government levels.\n\nRelatedStories No Content Available\n\nThe document added that there was a widespread public perception that judges were easily bribed, and litigants could not rely on the courts to render impartial judgments.\n\n\u201cMany citizens encountered long delays and reported receiving requests from judicial officials for bribes to expedite cases or obtain favourable rulings,\u201d the report stated.\n\nIt listed understaffing, inefficiency, and corruption as factors preventing the judiciary from functioning adequately.\n\nOther challenges, the US stated, included the absence of continuing education requirements for attorneys coupled with the fact that police officers were often assigned to serve as prosecutors.\n\nIt alleged that judges frequently fail to appear for trials, stressing however that the salaries of court officials are low, and officials often lacked proper equipment and training.\n\n\u201cThe constitution and the annual appropriation acts stipulate that the National Assembly and the judiciary be paid directly from the federation account as statutory transfers before other budgetary expenditures are made to maintain their autonomy and separation of powers.\n\n\u201cFederal and state governments, however, often undermined the judiciary by withholding funding and manipulating appointments,\u201d the US report noted.\n\nOn problems with trial procedures, the US posited that although defendants were presumed innocent and enjoy certain rights, authorities do not always respect these rights, most frequently due to a lack of capacity.\n\n\u201cInsufficient number of judges and courtrooms, together with growing caseloads, often resulted in pre-trial, trial, and appellate delays that could extend a trial for as many as 10 years.\n\n\u201cAlthough accused persons are entitled to counsel of their choice, there were reportedly some cases where defence counsel was absent from required court appearances so regularly that a court might proceed with a routine hearing in the absence of counsel, except for certain offences for which conviction carries the death penalty,\u201d it alleged.\n\nAccording to the document, in some cases, the police would demand additional payment from family members who wanted to attend a trial even as the authorities could hold defendants in prison awaiting trial for periods well beyond the terms allowed by law.\n\nFurthermore, the document alleged that Nigeria\u2019s anti-corruption agencies, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) as well as the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) were mainly focused on pursuing low and mid-level corruption cases.\n\nThe US stated that although there had been a few indictments of active top level government officials, the cases were being hampered by administrative delays.\n\nThe US document stated: \u201cThe ICPC holds broad authority to prosecute most forms of corruption. The EFCC\u2019s writ extends only to financial and economic crimes.\n\n\u201cThe bulk of the ICPC and EFCC\u2019s anti-corruption efforts remained focused on low- and mid-level government officials, although both organisations brought indictments against various active and former high-level government officials.\n\n\u201cMany of the corruption cases, particularly the high-profile ones, remained pending before the courts due to administrative or procedural delays.\u201d\n\nAlthough the law provides criminal penalties for conviction of official corruption, the government, the US report stated, did not consistently implement the law, and government employees, including elected officials, frequently engaged in corrupt practices with impunity.\n\n\u201cMassive, widespread, and pervasive corruption affected all levels of government, including the judiciary and security services.\n\n\u201cThe constitution provides immunity from civil and criminal prosecution for the president, vice president, governors, and deputy governors while in office. There were numerous allegations of government corruption during the year,\u201d it added.\n\nOn the government\u2019s posture towards human rights abuses, the report noted government officials sometimes cooperated and responded to such cases, but generally either dismissed allegations, did not provide substantive response, or did not publicise outcomes of investigations.\n\nThe document added that in the north-east, there had been reports that the military threatened civil society groups and humanitarian organisations after aid provided by the organisations purportedly reached insurgent groups.\n\nEven though the law establishes the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) as an independent non-judicial mechanism for the promotion and protection of human rights, it noted that the role of the body has been largely advisory as well as for training and advocacy purposes.\n\n\u201cDuring the year, there were no reports of its (NHRC) prior investigations having led to accountability. The law provides for recognition and enforcement of damages awarded to plaintiffs, but it was unclear whether this happened,\u201d the report stated.\n\nOn insurgency in the North-east by the militant terrorist groups Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA), it noted that the terrorists continued to conduct numerous attacks on government and civilian targets, resulting in thousands of deaths and injuries.\n\nAccording to the US report, this has led to the internal displacement of more than three million persons, and the external displacement of more than an estimated 327,000 Nigerian refugees to neighbouring countries as of the year\u2019s end.\n\nQuoting the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the document noted that more than 24,000 persons were registered as missing in the country, with the majority from the conflict area in the North-east.\n\n\u201cThere were reports of disappearances by or on behalf of government authorities. According to Amnesty International, the whereabouts of at least 50 suspected supporters of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) group arrested in Rivers State between October and November 2020 remained unknown at year\u2019s end,\u201d it said.\n\nIt stressed that ineffective and non-existent civil registration and identification management systems in areas hosting displaced persons, refugees, and returnees remained a concern.\n\nFor refugees, the report pointed out that even when civil documents were obtained, community members and local officials were sometimes unaware of their legal rights or standing, which could also prevent them from moving freely, obtaining work, or accessing health care.\n\nDuring the year, the US posited that ISIS-WA terrorists demonstrated increased ability to conduct complex attacks against military outposts and formations.\n\n\u201cDuring the year ISIS-WA terrorists took over significant territory formerly held by Boko Haram. ISIS-WA expanded efforts to implement shadow governance structures in large swaths of Borno State,\u201d it said.\n\nIn the South-east, it stated that following IPOB\u2019s launch of its military wing, the Eastern Security Network, in December 2020, in the first quarter of the year, local media reported 54 violent attacks on civilians and security forces and 222 deaths, representing a 59 per cent and 344 per cent increase, respectively, compared with the quarter prior to its establishment.\n\nIt stated that while some reports estimated the number of Boko Haram and ISIS-WA abductees at more than 2,000, the total count of the missing was unknown as towns repeatedly changed hands, and many families were still on the run or dispersed in camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs).\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "title": "Nigerian Senate Sets Up 13-man Panel to Investigate Crude Oil Theft, Approves N4trn Subsidy",
          "text": "Following public outrage against the massive stealing of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil, which had seen the country lose huge earnings as well as hobbled its ability to meet the quota allocated by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, on Thursday constituted a 13-member Adhoc Committee to investigate oil theft in Nigeria and its impact on petroleum production and oil revenues.\n\nThe composition of the panel was announced on the floor at plenary. Lawan named Senator Bassey Albert Akpan as Chairman of the Committee.\n\nOther members on the panel include Senators Yusuf A. Yusuf, Solomon Olamilekan Adeola, Kabiru Gaya, Mohammed Adamu Aliero, George Thompson Sekibo and Gabriel Suswam.\n\nThe panel also included Senators Kashim Shettima, Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi, Ali Ndume, Stella Oduah, Sani Musa and Ibrahim Gobir.\n\nThe adhoc committee was given one month to conclude work on investigations and report back to the chamber in plenary.\n\nAlso yesterday, the Senate approved a revised budget of N17,319,704,091,019 trillion for the 2022 fiscal year.\n\nAlso, the Senate approved the total sum of N4 trillion for petrol subsidy in 2022. The figure represented the amount contained in two separate requests by the President to the National Assembly for approval.\n\nThe president, had in a letter to the legislature dated 10th February, 2022, sought an additional N2.557 trillion to fund subsidy payments from July to December, 2022.\n\nHe had disclosed that 138 of the 254 projects in the budget totalling N13.24 billion had been identified for deletion.\n\nThe National Assembly in December, 2021, had approved the sum of N442.7 billion for subsidy in the 2022 budget for the period of January to June this year.\n\nBuhari, however, anchored his fresh request on the fact that petrol subsidy was not duly appropriated for in the national budget beyond June.\n\nAccording to him, the development was as a result of the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act which stops all such payments past the given June deadline.\n\nIn another letter dated 12th April, 2022, Buhari had requested the National Assembly to approve an additional N1 trillion to his earlier N2.557 subsidy request to bring the total amount on payments to N4 trillion for the year 2022.\n\nThe approval came with the passage of a bill to amend the 2022 Appropriations Act transmitted to the National Assembly on 10th February, 2022, by President Muhammadu Buhari for consideration.\n\nThe Senate in December, 2021, had passed a budget of N17,126,873,917,692 trillion.\n\nThe revised sum of N17.3 trillion in contrast with the 2022 budget of N17.13 trillion passed last year, represented a N193 billion increase.\n\nThe passage of the Appropriations Act, 2022 (Amendment) Bill, followed the consideration of a report by the Committee on Appropriations.\n\nThe figure represented an increase of N192.5 billion from the N17.1 trillion approved and assented to last December.\n\nThe passage followed the consideration of a report by the Appropriation Committee on the 2022 Appropriations Bill in both chambers.\n\nThe nation\u2019s parliament increased its annual budget by N12 billion. It was N139 billion in the 2022 budget but has now increased to N153 billion in the revised version, approved yesterday.\n\nA critical analysis of the revised budget showed that there was no increment in the capital vote of N5.415 trillion\n\nThe increment affected only the recurrent expenditure. Out of the total sum of N17,319,704,091,019 trillion passed, N817,699,410,210 billion is for Statutory Transfers; N3,978,087,110,437 trillion for Debt Service; N7,108,621,131,849 trillion for Recurrent (Non-Debt Expenditure); and N5,415,296,438,523 trillion for Contribution to the Development Fund for Capital Expenditure.\n\nHe explained that the additional request was against the backdrop of adjustments to the 2022 fiscal framework which became imperative due to market developments occasioned by the spike in crude prices, following the Russian-Ukrainian war.\n\nThe chamber, accordingly, approved the President\u2019s request for additional N3.557 trillion for PMS subsidy with the passage of the 2022 Appropriations Act (Amendment) Bill, Thursday.\n\nIt also approved N192.52 billion aggregate increase sought by the executive, and an additional provision of N182.45 billion to cater for the needs of the Nigerian Police Force to enhance their morale.\n\nThe Senate, after passing the 2022 Appropriations Act (Amendment) Bill, adjourned till the 26th of April, 2021\n\nThe Senate had before the approval, considered the report of its Committee on Finance on the Medium Term Expenditure and Fiscal Strategy Paper, laid by the Chairman, Senator Olamilekan Adeola.\n\nThe red chamber, in the MTEF/FSP approved oil benchmark $73 per barrel as proposed by President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nIt also approved oil production volume of 1.600m per day.\n\nThe chamber gave its nod for an additional provision of N182.4 billion to cater for the needs of the Nigeria Police Force.\n\nIt approved debt service provision of N76.13 billion, and net reductions in Statutory Transfers by N66.07 billion.\n\nDeji Elumoye and Sunday Aborisade, Abuja",
