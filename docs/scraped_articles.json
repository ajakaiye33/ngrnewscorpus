          "text": "Lara Adejoro\n\nAs the strike embarked upon by the National Association of Resident Doctors enters its second day, medical activities have been paralysed in government-owned hospitals.\n\nA visit to the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja on Tuesday by our correspondent revealed that there was full compliance with the strike directive by the NARD as resident doctors stayed away from work.\n\nPUNCH HealthWise findings also revealed that resident doctors at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi-Araba complied with the strike as they handed over patients\u2019 care to senior physicians.\n\nRecall that NARD had on Saturday issued a communiqu\u00e9 after its Annual General Meeting of the association\u2019s National Executive Council announced that members would commence an indefinite strike, beginning from August 1.\n\nSome of the issues raised by NARD include the inconsistent payment of salaries, hazard allowances, non-payment of death benefits, and issues surrounding the registration of members on the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System.\n\nThe strike was also to demand the immediate withdrawal of the circular removing House Officers from the scheme of service and the hasty implementation of the circular by the Lagos State Government.\n\nAt LASUTH, many new patients and outpatients who came to the hospital were stranded because only senior physicians and nurses were attending to some patients.\n\nHowever, consultants who took over the provision of skeletal services say they are overwhelmed.\n\nA man who identified himself as Mr. Femi Ajayi said he was referred from a private hospital to LASUTH, only to be told that his wife can\u2019t be attended to.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just tired, we came all the way from Ajegunle to Ikeja and it\u2019s been a waste of time. It\u2019s an emergency but they say doctors are on strike. It\u2019s really tiring. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother female patient who spoke on condition of anonymity said she arrived at the hospital in the early hours of Tuesday but was not attended to.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know they are on strike, I came today only to find out that doctors are on strike and they can\u2019t attend to me but they told me to come back on Friday.\n\n\u201cI just pray that God will heal me and take sickness away from my life because it\u2019s not been a smooth one at all,\u201d she lamented.\n\nPresident of the Association of Resident Doctors, LASUTH chapter, Dr. Azeez Ojekunle appealed to the Lagos State Government to resolve the issues that necessitated the ongoing strike action.\n\nOjekunle said that some members of ARD had a meeting with the representatives of the Lagos state government from the office of the Head of Service and its counterpart in Establishment, Training, and Pension to dialogue and resolve the situation.\n\n\u201cThese are doctors that are the frontline health workers that patients see when they visit hospitals. They are licensed and have been inducted into the medical profession.\n\n\u201cThey are working for the government and are part of the scheme of service, as enshrined in their appointment letters.\n\nOjekunle said that the association also demanded implementation of the Medical Residency Training Act and the release of the Acts fund for sponsorship of specialisation training.\n\nMeanwhile, a Consultant Family Physician LASUTH, Dr. Oluwajimi Sodipo said the consultants are overwhelmed and cannot render full medical services.\n\nSodipo, who is also the Chairman of Medical Guild, said, \u201cThe consultants are definitely overwhelmed because the resident doctors play a critical role in rendering health services.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to render full services because the backbone of every hospital especially the specialist centres are the resident doctors and even in the ratio, we have fewer consultants to resident doctors.\n\n\u201cSo, we have one consultant to about four senior resident doctors and it\u2019s impossible for consultants to do the work alone,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, speaking with PUNCH HealthWise, ARD President, LUTH chapter, Dr. Oluwafemi Hassan said patients\u2019 care has been handed over to the consultants.\n\n\u201cIt is consultants who manage patients; resident doctors are just special trainees. If you go to the ward, clinic and emergency unit, you will see that most areas will be deserted, but of course, it will only get worse as the strike continues.\n\n\u201cLUTH is one of the biggest chapters of NARD and we are 100 per cent in compliance with NARD directive.\n\n\u201cSo I can tell you that, if you go anywhere in the hospital, it will be deserted. We have told our members, that NARD has given the directive that all resident doctors should be on strike, and they are supposed to be on strike now, including the House Officers.\n\n\u201cThis strike is total and indefinite, which means all services provided by resident doctors including emergency services, will not be available at LUTH.\n\n\u201cOf course, you know that in the teaching hospitals, you still have the consultants, but the resident doctors are the majority as we are the first on call, we are the first contact when patients come into the hospital. So, once we are not available, it will affect service delivery in the hospital,\u201d he said.\n\nAdding, he said, \u201cAs doctors, we love our patients, we don\u2019t want to go on strike for any reason, but when all forms of dialogue have failed, that is when we usually go on strike\u201d.\n\nAlso, the Chairman, Medical and Dental Consultants\u2019 Association of Nigeria, Lagos University Teaching Hospital Chapter, Dr. Clement Oluwarotimi said the demands of the resident doctors are germane and there is a need for the Federal Government to meet their needs.\n\n\u201cThe resident doctors are the foot soldiers and they complement our work.\n\n\u201cWhere you have 50 people working and 10 is now working, then overwhelming is an understatement.\n\n\u201cAs the strike goes deeper, definitely we will be really overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nOluwarotimi, however, said the consultants will do their best to take care of the patients but it will have enormous effects on the health system.\n\n\u201cIn the wards, there\u2019s no way consultants will handle the patients that the resident doctors will handle especially as a surgeon, I can\u2019t operate alone and so without an assistant, there is little I can do.\n\n\u201cIt means I\u2019m going to be at work round the clock because those people are not there.\n\n\u201cTheir strike is extremely justified and before resident doctors will go on strike, they choose their fight.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost some of us and I don\u2019t have health insurance. God forbid anything happens to me.\n\n\u201cIf you read their communiqu\u00e9, what they are asking is too germane.\n\n\u201cMy hazard allowance is N5000, what do I do with it if anything happens to me,\u201d he said.\n\nThe MDCAN chairman urged the Federal Government to prioritise the health sector and meets the demands of the striking doctors.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a misplaced priority by the leadership of the health sector. They play politics with our lives.\n\n\u201cThe welfare of doctors is what they are fighting for and their demands are germane,\u201d he said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

Generally, it is expected that on employment, house officers should complete their postings within 12 calendar months.\n\n\u201cDuring the housemanship, doctors and dentists are required to undertake 12 weeks\u2019 uninterrupted postings in each of Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, and Paediatrics and other relevant specialties for dentistry.\n\n\u201cAny interruption for any reason, including embarking on strike actions, during any of the postings, will not be condoned and should be reported immediately to the Chief Medical Director, Medical Director, or Medical Superintendent of the housemanship of the institution.\n\n\u201cSection 2d paragraph (iii) of Guidelines on Registration (2003 ed.) prescribes that \u2018A supervising doctor who fails in his duties in this regard is liable to proceedings being commenced against him at the Disciplinary Organs of Council if his misdeed in the matter is brought to the notice of Council.\u2019\n\n\u201cEmbarking on strike actions by house officers will lead to repeat of the posting(s) afresh without remuneration. House officers are therefore advised to avoid participation in activities like industrial actions that could lead to interruption in their postings.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in an interview with PUNCH HealthWise, Chairman, NARD\u2019s Communication/Communique, Dr. Julian Ojebo said the association resumed its suspended strike because of the unwillingness and failure of appointees of the government to carry out their responsibilities months after signing the Memorandum of Action.\n\n\u201cTop of the ladder of this ineptitude and slothfulness is the Registrar of the MDCN who lacks requisite knowledge of current day practices of standardisation, use of technology and his failure of understanding that any family that kills her young is doom for extinction.\n\n\u201cLittle wonder as to why the Council cannot tell Nigerians the total number of doctors in Nigeria as seen in saner climes on her website.\u201d\n\nOjebo, who is also the immediate past First Vice President of NARD added that \u201cThe MDCN\u2019s only job since the appointment of T.A.B. Sanusi is exploiting doctors.\n\n\u201cWhilst NARD is focused on repositioning the health sector, the point man of the MDCN has turned himself into an obstacle as seen in the hardship fresh doctors faced in the process of getting their permanent licence.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, some of our younger colleagues (house officers) are still being owned salaries ranging from one to three months.\n\n\u201cA Click into the portal of MDCN shows how unproductive the leadership of the MDCN has been.\n\n\u201cWe would advise the MDCN arrowhead to focus on improving the visibility of the MDCN, use technology in solving present-day issues rather than decide who the members of NARD are, a professional body that he probably benefitted from when he was a young doctor.\n\n\u201cFor the purpose and intent of productive leadership, we shall advise the MDCN to stick to the Act that governs it rather than chasing shadows and embracing frivolities.\n\n\u201cA house officer is a bonafide member of NARD and NARD is fully responsible for their social, mental, and financial welfare, for we understand that a doctor whose social, financial, and mental welfare is threatened is not a safe doctor\u201d.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

House officers are therefore advised to avoid participation in activities like industrial actions that could lead to interruption in their postings.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in an interview with PUNCH HealthWise, Chairman, NARD\u2019s Communication/Communique, Dr. Julian Ojebo said the association resumed its suspended strike because of the unwillingness and failure of appointees of the government to carry out their responsibilities months after signing the Memorandum of Action.\n\n\u201cTop of the ladder of this ineptitude and slothfulness is the Registrar of the MDCN who lacks requisite knowledge of current day practices of standardisation, use of technology and his failure of understanding that any family that kills her young is doom for extinction.\n\n\u201cLittle wonder as to why the Council cannot tell Nigerians the total number of doctors in Nigeria as seen in saner climes on her website.\u201d\n\nOjebo, who is also the immediate past First Vice President of NARD added that \u201cThe MDCN\u2019s only job since the appointment of T.A.B. Sanusi is exploiting doctors.\n\n\u201cWhilst NARD is focused on repositioning the health sector, the point man of the MDCN has turned himself into an obstacle as seen in the hardship fresh doctors faced in the process of getting their permanent licence.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, some of our younger colleagues (house officers) are still being owned salaries ranging from one to three months.\n\n\u201cA Click into the portal of MDCN shows how unproductive the leadership of the MDCN has been.\n\n\u201cWe would advise the MDCN arrowhead to focus on improving the visibility of the MDCN, use technology in solving present-day issues rather than decide who the members of NARD are, a professional body that he probably benefitted from when he was a young doctor.\n\n\u201cFor the purpose and intent of productive leadership, we shall advise the MDCN to stick to the Act that governs it rather than chasing shadows and embracing frivolities.\n\n\u201cA house officer is a bonafide member of NARD and NARD is fully responsible for their social, mental, and financial welfare, for we understand that a doctor whose social, financial, and mental welfare is threatened is not a safe doctor\u201d.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Sanwo-Olu: Lagos Recorded 4,300 Cases, 30 Fatalities in July",
          "text": "\u2022Says only 1% of Lagos residents vaccinated\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, raised the alarm about the third wave of COVID-19 pandemic, saying in July alone, some 4,300 confirmed cases were recorded with 30 fatalities. Sanwo-Olu said the current figures were worse than what obtained at the height of the pandemic last year, when a total of 64,032 cases were recorded with 56,336 recovering and 320 death.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cFrom the beginning of July, we started to experience an increase in the number of daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Lagos State, with the positivity rate going from 1.1% at the end of June 2021 to 7% at the end of July 2021. As at the 1st of August 2021, the positivity rate in Lagos is 8.9%.\n\n\u201cThis is an 8-fold increase over the recorded figure a month ago, and it should rightly alarm all of us. This has resulted in 4,300 confirmed cases in July alone and 352 admissions into our isolation facilities. But let me make it clear that this necessary sense of alarm should not be responded to with panic, but instead with a firm resolve and determination to reverse the trend.\n\n\u201cWe have done it before and we can do it again. We dealt with the first and second waves and did our best to prevent a third wave. Now that it is fully upon us, we must dig deep into what we have learnt from the previous waves, as well as summon the will to do everything necessary to bring down the numbers, on the way to eventually defeating the virus once and for all.\u201d\n\nSanwo-Olu explained that with the epidemiology update from the beginning of the outbreak in February 2020 to date, Lagos State had recorded a total of 64,032 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and of this number, 56,336 had recovered in community, while 2,755 cases were currently being managed actively in community.\n\nHe added that while managing the COVID-19 pandemic, about 5,029 patients had been admitted into the various COVID-19 centres in the state.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have, sadly, recorded 390 fatalities in Lagos State, 30 of which have taken place in this current 3rd wave of the pandemic. Essentially, we have recorded on average 6 deaths per day since last week. With Home-Based Care Given the huge population of our state and the rising numbers of confirmed cases during the first and second waves of the pandemic, it became necessary for us to deploy telemedicine in managing positive patients.\n\n\u201cIn this vein, we launched a homebased programme, driven by our EKOTELEMED call center service. The home-based programme works by delivering care packs to symptomatic Covid-19 patients \u2013 those who do not require admission in a treatment facility \u2013 in the comfort of their homes, and making specialist care available over the phone.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sanwo-Olu, following the receipt of the first instalment of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the federal government, it was administered to a total of 404,414 first doses and 243,374 second doses of the vaccine to residents.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs of today, the percentage of residents of Lagos that have received two doses of the vaccine stands at one per cent. This is quite low, especially, considering that we are now confronted by a third wave, and we are exploring all avenues possible to ramp up access to vaccination so as to reach our herd immunity target of administering vaccines to at least 60 per cent of the population of Lagos State.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that experience from other regions of the world showed that a majority of the confirmed cases that resulted in death were in unvaccinated persons.\n\nThe governor stated, \u201cThis is why we are seriously looking to scale up vaccination coverage for our people. On the 1st of August 2021, Nigeria received 4 million doses of the Moderna vaccine. It is our expectation that as the epicentre of the epidemic, Lagos State will receive a sizeable amount of this allocation.\n\n\u201cThis vaccine cannot be mixed with the AstraZeneca vaccine, so it will ONLY be for people that have not been previously vaccinated.\n\n\u201cWe are still expecting the second five allocations of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and will inform you when it is received. We will ensure that all future vaccine administration exercises are based solely on appointment, to avoid a situation in which vaccine administration turns into a super-spreader event.\u201d\n\nDelta Variant May Spread to More States, Says NCDC\n\nThe National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) said the deadly Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus may spread further to many more states if conscious efforts were not made to curtail it. Confirming the mark-up in the number of cases of the Delta variant of COVID-19 in the country, Director General of NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, said current data showed that one in every 10 persons that were tested in Lagos State came out positive.\n\nIhekweazu, who spoke at a media briefing by PSC on COVID-19, said the positivity rate of the virus test in states, like Lagos and Akwa Ibom, had gone up to 10 per cent.\n\nHe said, currently, the national COVID-19 positivity rate was six per cent, adding that the detection of increases in positive cases in some state like Lagos, Rivers, Oyo and Akwa Ibom was an indication that the surveillance architecture put in place by NCDC had worked well.\n\nThe federal government said the four million and eighty thousand doses of Moderna vaccines donated by the US government would undergo efficacy test evaluation by the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, (NAFDAC) before their deployment. Executive Director, National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib, stated this while inspecting the vaccines that arrived the country since Sunday.\n\nHe said it would take up 48 hours for the evaluation results to be out before the commencement of the inoculation.\n\nShuaib, who led other top officials of the Federal Ministry of Health to inspect the vaccine doses at the National Strategic Cold Store, Abuja, said an effective cold chain management of any COVID-19 vaccine was key to ensuring the success of the national vaccination programme.\n\nHe stated, \u201cThe vaccines would assist in stepping up efforts to battle a third wave of COVID-19 infections. The donation was part of President Joe Biden\u2019s promise to give 500 million vaccines to the world by the end of 2022.\u201d\n\nShuaib said Nigeria had storage facilities that could store COVID-19 vaccines, including the Moderna vaccine.\n\nAccording to him, the federal government had earlier acquired an additional 60 ultra cold freezers that would accommodate both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines.\n\nShuaib said, \u201cThe Moderna vaccine was expected to remain stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F) for 30 days. Shipping and long-term storage conditions are at standard freezer temperatures of -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F) for six months while mRNA-1273 to be distributed using widely available vaccine delivery and storage infrastructure.\n\n\u201cOnce the vaccine is removed from the refrigerator for administration, it can be kept at room temperature conditions for up to 12 hours.\u201d\n\nRepresentative of the US government, Dr. Melissa Freeman, said the vaccine doses were part of a donation that was set up to boost the country\u2019s vaccination rollout campaign. Also, representative of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr Anne Baptiste, said Moderna\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine was effective against several variants of concern, including the Delta variant.\n\nUNICEF Representative in Nigeria, Mr. Peter Hawkins, said the donation would help the country implement its expanded vaccination programme by reaching more people.\n\nHawkins said the life-saving vaccines had arrived at a time, when Nigeria was seeking to vaccinate a total of 110 million citizens.\n\nStrike by Resident Doctors Disrupts Hospital Activities\n\nMeanwhile, the strike embarked upon by resident doctors on Monday morning adversely affected healthcare services at the hospitals. At some of the government hospitals visited by THISDAY in Abuja, doctors were seen going about without attending to patients. Only few ones, mainly the consultants that were in their offices, attended to patients.\n\nSpeaking on the development, Ehanire said the Federal Ministry of Health had started to engage the doctors with a view to quickly resolving the issues.\n\n\u201cWhile this is on-going, medical directors at federal and state hospitals are directed to ensure that service delivery is not disrupted in their centres,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "There is a popular saying: life is a flip. Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Abba Kyari just witnessed one.\n\nJust within 96 hours DCP Abba Kyari\u2019s life flipped. Just within 96 hours, his indictment by the American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was made public, Nigeria\u2019s Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba set up a four-man Special Investigation Panel (SIP) headed by DIG Joseph Egbunike, Deputy Inspector General of Police in charge of the Force Criminal Investigations Department (FCID)to investigate the indictment. The IGP recommended Kyari\u2019s suspension, the Police Service Commission (PSC) suspended Kyari, the IGP appointed DCP Tunji Disu as the new head of the elite-force, Police Intelligence Response Team IGP-IRT to replace Kyari. Just 96 hours changed many things about Kyari\u2019s 20 years promising career! This is a strong indication that some public jobs are difficult. When one accepts them, he or she has chosen to be a \u2018saint\u2019 and must labour to appear as one.\n\nPublic trust is the key in such kinds of jobs; once eroded, it can never be restored. For example, top security agents, anti-corruption czars, and people holding \u2018delicate\u2019 positions should rarely talk in public, but when they do, they should carefully choose their words. They should not wine and dine with just anybody, attend lavish wedding ceremonies, extravagant events -etc., and then expect complete public trust. One should be in a self-imposed restraint- what a life to live in!\n\nHowever, as humans, we have our weaknesses, but the point is, people holding delicate jobs can\u2019t preach fasting in the morning and practice gluttony in the night. They have chosen to be \u2018saints\u2019, and must labour to appear so.\n\nOn the other hand, one of the big lessons to public office holders from this Kyari-Hushpuppi saga is poor public relations management. Kyari\u2019s first public response was just unprofessional \u2013 it complicated the issue.\n\nTo be fair, before his arrest by the FBI, Ramon Idirs aka -Hushpuppi was a normal young businessman, he has interacted with many high-profile Nigerians. In fact, Hushpuppi was a role-model, an inspiration, and motivational speaker to many gullible young Nigerians.\n\nSo many Nigerians have commented for and against Kyari \u2013 all with conviction and valid points. However, many people wish and pray that DCP Kayri\u2019s next flip in life will be a positive one. His dilemma is heartbreaking, but the law must be respected. The IGP has promised Nigerians that the police will strictly follow the rule of law and the sanctity of the probe. The IGP also promised absolute respect for all the rights and privileges of DCP Kyari throughout the period of the investigations.\n\nZayyad I.

          "text": "The five activists arrested at the Dunamis International Gospel Centre, Abuja and detained by the Department of State Services (DSS) have finally regained their freedom.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the activists regained their freedom on Tuesday, 30 days after their arrest and detention in the custody of the DSS.\n\nThe five had filed a contempt suit against the Director-General of the Department of State Services (DSS), Yusuf Bichi, for disobeying the court order granting them bail.\n\nTheir lawyer, Tope Tomekun, filed the suit on their behalf at a Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday.\n\nJustice Obiora Egwuatu had on Monday, July 26, granted bail to five activists who were arrested and detained by the DSS since July 4, 2021 for wearing T-shirts with inscription #BuhariMustGo to the church.\n\nThe court notice warned that the DSS DG risked being jailed.\n\nThe DSS had arrested Ben Mannaseh; Emmanuel Larry; Victor Udoka Anene; a blind saxophonist, Samuel Gabriel Iwatonaiye and Henry Nwodohave on July 4 on the church premises in Abuja for wearing #BuhariMustGo branded shirts\n\nThe activists subsequently sued the DSS, the senior pastor of the church, Paul Enenche and others for their unlawful arrest and detention.\n\nThey also asked the court to award N10 million each in damages for the violation of their fundamental human rights.\n\nThe judge, Justice Anwuli Chikere in his ruling, had ordered that the DSS should release the applicants with immediate effect.\n\nThe activists had also filed Form 48 against the DSS boss seeking his committal to jail unless he obeyed the order of the court.\n\nForm 48, otherwise known as contempt of court sighted by SaharaReporters, is titled, \u201cNotice of Consequences of Disobedience to Order of Court.\u201d\n\nIt reads in part, \u201cTake notice that unless you obey the directions contained in this endorsed order (herein with endorsed). You shall be guilty of contempt of court and shall be liable to be committed to prison.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had reported last Thursday that instead of complying with the initial order, the lawless secret agency hurriedly arraigned the activists on charges of disturbance of public peace which was to earn a face-saving justification for keeping them in custody.\n\nBrought before the magistrate for arraignment on Wednesday, the defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nTheir lawyer subsequently applied for their bail.\n\nRuling, the magistrate, Mohammed Zubairu, granted bail to the defendants in the sum of N500,000 with a surety each but the DSS operatives hurriedly drove the activists away before before they could perfect the bail conditions.\n\nHuman rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, speaking after their release, noted, \"We want to appreciate everyone who stood firmly by these young men and the #Revolutionnow movement during their unjust incarceration-torture and dehumanisation in the hands of Dr. Paul Enenche\u2019s church security before they were handed over to the DSS.\n\n\"The lawsuit in pursuit of justice for the five revolutionaries will continue at the Federal High Court and administrative sanctions will be pursued against the Magistrate that ignored a superior court order ordering their release as well as the three DSS lawyers who flagrantly ignored the higher court orders to arraign them before the Magistrate.\n\n\"Their lawyers will also pursue a contempt of court proceeding against the DG of DSS, Yusuf Bichi Mogaji in coming days. Special thanks to the lead lawyer in the case, Barrister Tope Tomekun and his team for a marvellous job challenging the authoritarian regime relentlessly!\"",

          "text": "The five activists arrested at the Dunamis International Gospel Centre, Abuja and detained by the Department of State Services (DSS) have finally regained their freedom.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the activists regained their freedom on Tuesday, 30 days after their arrest and detention in the custody of the DSS.\n\nThe five had filed a contempt suit against the Director-General of the Department of State Services (DSS), Yusuf Bichi, for disobeying the court order granting them bail.\n\nTheir lawyer, Tope Tomekun, filed the suit on their behalf at a Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday.\n\nJustice Obiora Egwuatu had on Monday, July 26, granted bail to five activists who were arrested and detained by the DSS since July 4, 2021 for wearing T-shirts with inscription #BuhariMustGo to the church.\n\nThe court notice warned that the DSS DG risked being jailed.\n\nThe DSS had arrested Ben Mannaseh; Emmanuel Larry; Victor Udoka Anene; a blind saxophonist, Samuel Gabriel Iwatonaiye and Henry Nwodohave on July 4 on the church premises in Abuja for wearing #BuhariMustGo branded shirts\n\nThe activists subsequently sued the DSS, the senior pastor of the church, Paul Enenche and others for their unlawful arrest and detention.\n\nThey also asked the court to award N10 million each in damages for the violation of their fundamental human rights.\n\nThe judge, Justice Anwuli Chikere in his ruling, had ordered that the DSS should release the applicants with immediate effect.\n\nThe activists had also filed Form 48 against the DSS boss seeking his committal to jail unless he obeyed the order of the court.\n\nForm 48, otherwise known as contempt of court sighted by SaharaReporters, is titled, \u201cNotice of Consequences of Disobedience to Order of Court.\u201d\n\nIt reads in part, \u201cTake notice that unless you obey the directions contained in this endorsed order (herein with endorsed). You shall be guilty of contempt of court and shall be liable to be committed to prison.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters had reported last Thursday that instead of complying with the initial order, the lawless secret agency hurriedly arraigned the activists on charges of disturbance of public peace which was to earn a face-saving justification for keeping them in custody.\n\nBrought before the magistrate for arraignment on Wednesday, the defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nTheir lawyer subsequently applied for their bail.\n\nRuling, the magistrate, Mohammed Zubairu, granted bail to the defendants in the sum of N500,000 with a surety each but the DSS operatives hurriedly drove the activists away before before they could perfect the bail conditions.\n\nHuman rights activist, Omoyele Sowore, speaking after their release, noted, \"We want to appreciate everyone who stood firmly by these young men and the #Revolutionnow movement during their unjust incarceration-torture and dehumanisation in the hands of Dr. Paul Enenche\u2019s church security before they were handed over to the DSS.\n\n\"The lawsuit in pursuit of justice for the five revolutionaries will continue at the Federal High Court and administrative sanctions will be pursued against the Magistrate that ignored a superior court order ordering their release as well as the three DSS lawyers who flagrantly ignored the higher court orders to arraign them before the Magistrate.\n\n\"Their lawyers will also pursue a contempt of court proceeding against the DG of DSS, Yusuf Bichi Mogaji in coming days. Special thanks to the lead lawyer in the case, Barrister Tope Tomekun and his team for a marvellous job challenging the authoritarian regime relentlessly!\"",

          "text": "In 2019, Abubakar Yusuf saw his medical condition deteriorate rapidly. The 43-year old carpenter in Nigeria\u2019s Borno State has been suffering from Malaria and experiencing a deadly mix of fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting.\n\n\u201cI would go to the only public health centre in the area but I just don\u2019t think I can wait. There\u2019s likely going to be 20 or 30 people before me and they often attend those that arrived first. So there\u2019s no guarantee I will even see a doctor on time.\u201d\n\nAfter staying indoors for days, the bedridden Yusuf was visited by one of his closest clients who eventually told him about a mobile app that can help him find a doctor and get easy access to treatment.\n\nHe downloaded Zuri Health, booked an appointment for the day after with one of the doctors listed on the platform, and received confirmation by SMS. Through the app, Yusuf was instructed to take some initial measures to help alleviate his condition after which he met with the doctor with a wait time of just 10 minutes. He recovered fully a week later.\n\nYusuf is a fictional figure but his predicament is as real \u2013 for many Africans \u2013 as Zuri Health is. Without discovering the mobile app, he could easily have been one of the more than 400,000 Africans malaria killed in 2019.\n\nAfrica carries a disproportionately high share of the global burden of deaths from diseases: in the same year, the continent accounted for a troubling 94% of all malaria cases and deaths. Approximately 1.6 million Africans died of tuberculosis, malaria, or HIV-related illnesses in 2015 alone.\n\nWhat is even more worrisome is the fact that with proper medication, these diseases can be prevented, treated, or even cured. But there\u2019s a well-documented lack of access to healthcare in Africa.\n\nLess than 50% of people in Africa can access modern health facilities and 80% rely on the chronically underfunded public health services, which suffer from a shortage of everything from drugs to power blackouts.\n\nZuri Health mobile app.\n\nMobile-based healthcare to the rescue\n\nA number of startups have come up with innovative ways to solve the key challenge of accessing healthcare in Africa using technology. One such is Zuri Health, a relatively new player in the continent\u2019s nascent telemedicine (the use of digital devices such as mobile devices and computers to deliver health care) space.\n\nZuri Health is a mobile application that gives patients the opportunity to chat with a doctor, buy medication from a pharmacy, book labs and diagnostic tests or have a doctor visit them at home.\n\nThe company launched in Kenya earlier this year and aims to provide affordable and accessible healthcare solutions via mobile technology with dedicated apps, wap, and SMS services.\n\n\u201cZuri Health is very personal to me,\u201d said founder and CEO Ikechukwu Anoke, in an interview with TechCabal. \u201cThe app is named after my daughter, Zuri, who was born in 2013. Despite being at one of the best hospitals in Kenya, we could not get a doctor to attend to my wife on time while she was in labour.\u201d\n\nThe incident made Ikechukwu realise that even if an individual could afford medical care, the distribution and logistics of healthcare in the country still posed a challenge. But it wasn\u2019t until seven years later, when he himself had a life-threatening experience in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, that he started working on Zuri.\n\n\u201cI had personal health issues before the pandemic which made me even more vulnerable to the virus. With an underlying health problem in a Covid environment, it was vital to think about the provision of healthcare in a different way,\u201d Ikechukwu recalled.\n\nWith most hospitals shut and doctors unavailable in the heat of the pandemic, he says telemedicine and remote care became extremely important at that point.\n\n\u201cIt made sense to build an app through which people could get basic tests done without leaving the comfort of their home and further risk their lives. If we had known earlier, maybe we would have built apps and launched them during the pandemic. The experience of Covid helped what we\u2019ve built today.\u201d\n\nZuri Health launched a beta version in November 2020 and rolled out officially in Nairobi two months later. Since January, Zuri has onboarded more than 250 doctors, who earn extra income from the service they provide, onto its platform.\n\nArthur Ikechukwu Anoke and Daisy Isiaho, co-founders of the mobile app, Zuri Health.\n\nThe opportunity to chat with a doctor and receive diagnoses remotely helps thousands of subscribers that currently use the application save transportation and other logistical costs while receiving necessary medical care.\n\n\u201cZuri Health gives doctors a wider and easier platform to reach patients who need them while the underserved populace can now access affordable and sustainable healthcare,\u201d Ikechukwu said.\n\nThe company has secured partnerships in multiple African countries, which is expected to pave the way for a planned continental expansion. Over the next few months, Zuri wants to enter other markets \u2013 including Nigeria, Ghana, Tanzania, Zambia, Cote D\u00cdvoire, Mozambique, Angola, and Senegal.\n\nAfrica\u2019s e-health industry on the rise\n\nIncreasing mobile penetration and a thriving tech startup scene give hopes that technology can make a big impact in improving access to medical care in Africa.\n\nThe continent is slowly witnessing a proliferation of healthcare apps, which include South Africa\u2019s Hello Doctor, ChanjoPlus and M-Tiba in Kenya, Benin Republic\u2019s GoMedical, and mTrac in Uganda; and more recently, Zuri Health.\n\nThere are clear signs of a coming explosion in the use of mobile technologies in African healthcare similar to the one that\u2019s been seen in financial services. However, recurring key challenges still need to be addressed.\n\nPrevailing issues such as prohibitive smartphone costs for Africans, the majority of which live on less than $1.90 a day, could pose as barriers to the uptake of digital health. Phone penetration in the region stands at just 44% compared to the global average of 66%.\n\nThere is also a large rural-urban digital divide with the greater part of rural Africa suffering from low connectivity and low levels of digital literacy among dwellers in such areas.\n\nFixing healthcare is beyond just tech\n\nHealth sectors in Africa stand to benefit hugely from digital solutions. But more than just the technology is needed for these innovations to scale and make a significant impact across the continent.\n\nThe increasing number of apps that aim to make healthcare widely accessible have to be integrated into public healthcare systems and national health strategies. This is where support from the government is needed.\n\nBeyond just funding, public authorities have to come up with inclusive telemedicine or mobile health (mHealth) policies that address regulatory and data governance issues. Governmental policies will help hold digital healthcare companies accountable and protect the information and data of citizens that use the technologies.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nAs the field of mHealth matures, effective policy will become increasingly important, according to a World Health Organisation report.\n\n\u201cThere is an urgent need to drive more meaningful conversations in relation to frameworks around telemedicine because in Africa very few countries have these. Yet it\u2019s fundamental if we should achieve the Sustainable Development Goals,\u201d said Daisy Isiaho, Zuri Health Co-founder and Project Manager.\n\nWhile thousands of Africans like Yusuf continue to have their lives saved by mobile health applications, going forward, governments will have to \u201cplay an active role through regulation and setting up legal frameworks in the growing telemedicine space.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Policies & African startups is a monthly series written by Titi Akinsanmi. All musings are hers and attributable to TechCabal or any organisations she is serving, working or affiliated with.\n\nFirst of all, introduction\n\nIt has taken many years for me to put pen to paper \u2013 in this form. Why? Well I focused and hoped \u2018those\u2019 who have the expertise, the skills to write etc, etc, etc would get round to doing this. But\u2026the impactful change one seeks truly does begin with one. So here goes\u2026\n\nI write as I speak \u2013 painting pictures with words, sometimes rambling and stopping at bus stops to share an extra nugget, insight or to detour completely. And sometimes I will enter the rabbit hole of writing in formal academic language to address a specific issue.\n\nYou see, this \u2018column\u2019, my writing is not your typical treatise or intellectual exposition on the what, why and how of policy making in the digital economy. It\u2019s a peek into my perfectly imperfect policy wonk mind. A sharing of my thoughts in progress around shenanigans in this space \u2013 the good, bad and ugly.\n\nMusings.\n\nMy goal? Tripartite (that means in three parts!). First is to let the words out of my head beyond when I take the \u2018stage\u2019 and speak to a select few who know; second is to normalize conversations on policy implications of all the innovations happening \u2013 and if just 0.1%, get more innovators thinking on this before and when they hit the market! Third, and for me the most important is to bring this discourse to you \u2013 the end user, the customer, the target of all these innovations. So you understand, get it \u2013 and use the power to influence in an informed way. You see that latter? Well You have the power to be the instigator of the change you want to see.\n\nSo here goes: this first piece is like a get to know you more, more information gathering before a possible first date (I hope we make it to the latter ;-))\n\nBefore we go on though \u2013 what is Policy making? Again no assumptions made right?\n\nSee, Policy making is far from \u2018sexzy\u2019 work \u2013 except for wonks like me :-). It is typically a long and arduous \u2018figuring out\u2019, drafting, negotiations, convincing and consensus building. In plain english: It takes a good amount of time to get close to having the right policy backed by law \u2013 from development to influencing process to adoption, influencing, implementation and then impact tracking (and its measurement).\n\nThe policy making process\n\nIt can seem like it\u2019s overnight, that hardly the case \u2013 but it does happen. [For instance, the Murambatsvina policy and the \u2018look East\u2019 policy in Zimbabwe]. The thing you don\u2019t know, having not paid attention or invested time, resources or built a network, is that it\u2019s likely been brewing under the surface (think lava, volcano eruption; or an underlying like that catches you unawares). Or you have done all this yet still\u2026\n\nLet\u2019s make this practical\u2026use our imaginations (for some reading this is a reality I know).\n\nImagine: You are a startup in some city or town in a tier 2 African country. You practice some solid frugal innovation and come up with a needed product and or service. You worked hard (alone or with a small team) and hit the market. You have a frugal marketing and reputation building strategy that harnesses the power of social media across jurisdictions. You begin to see a return on investment, just a trickle at first and then it steadily (or maybe not \u2013 dips are normal!) and then wham! The government \u2018sees\u2019 you.\n\nJisoos!\n\nWell that imaginning is a reality lived by many businesses across our continent \u2013 in these times seemingly targeting Tech enabled StartUps. The world more than ever before is at terms with the fact that digitisation is important for the growth of the economy and society. For the economically disparate economies on our continent however it seems players are working in different directions \u2013 albeit looking to reach the same goal of a thriving digital economy, apart. With the Covid-enabled growth of the last 18 months these \u2018high IQ toddler\u2019 businesses have faced stiff regulatory actions and inconsistent policies, \u2013 regardless of the intentions behind them. This at a time when African startup ecosystem is garnering global recognition and investor confidence.\n\nHere are a few examples of shifts in policy based on laws (sometimes not!) across our continent in the last 18 months.\n\nFintech in Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya\n\nNigeria\u2019s technology sector was its second-fastest-growing sector from Q1 2018 to Q4 2019. A look at the well appraised Nigerian fintech sector reveals the recently released regulatory directory of the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which states that \u201cby the provisions of Sections 67-70 of the Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and Rules 414 & 415 of the SEC Rules and Regulations, only foreign securities listed on any Exchange registered in Nigeria may be issued, sold or offered for sale or subscription to the Nigerian public. Accordingly, CMOs who work in concert with the referenced online platforms are hereby notified of the Commission\u2019s position and advised to desist henceforth.\u201d\n\nThe South African Reserve Bank\u2019s (SARB) cautious attitude towards virtual currencies like Bitcoin, as stated in Article 5.1 in its Position Paper on Virtual Currencies NPS 02/2014 that \u2018the Bank does not oversee, supervise or regulate the VC (virtual currencies) landscape, systems or intermediaries for effectiveness, soundness, integrity or robustness. Consequently, any and all activities related to the acquisition, trading or use of VCs (particularly DCVCs) are performed at the end-user\u2019s sole and independent risk and have no recourse to the Bank.\u2019\n\nIn 2015 Central Bank of Kenya(CBK) with regard to the legal status of virtual currencies, issued a public notice cautioning the public that \u201cBitcoin and similar products are not legal tender nor are they regulated in Kenya. The public should therefore desist from transacting in Bitcoin and similar products\u201d. On 18 December, 2015 the CBK again issued Banking Circular No 14 of 2015, which cautioned, \u2018all financial institutions against dealing in virtual currencies or transacting with entities that are engaged in virtual currencies. Financial institutions are expressly advised not to open accounts for any person dealing in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Failure to comply with this directive would lead to appropriate remedial action from the Central Bank\u2019.\n\nJust like South Africa, Kenya also has no specific legal framework tailored specially for its Fintech sector. One therefore sees the fintech sphere being regulated by a variety of statutes and rules governing various financial products, services and market participants, as well as other provisions of more general application.\n\nThe lack of specifically tailored regulations to govern the fintech sector, seen in Kenya and South AFrica, leaves regulators at each point, responding to issues that arise individually. This leaves a gap for potential conflicts in regulating fintech, and reveals a situation where the regulatory environment would keep lagging behind technology.\n\nThe ban by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) negatively impacted thousands of Nigerians who have lately been drawn by technology to investing in foreign securities. Untoward hardship to fintech platforms such as Bamboo, Trove, and Risevest who work with local and foreign brokerage firms in allowing Nigerians to invest and trade in stocks listed on the Nigerian and foreign stock exchanges.\n\nLogistics policies in Nigeria\n\nThe Lagos State Government on 27 January 2020 enforced a regulatory ban which restricted the operation of commercial bikes and tricycles on major roads within the state, stating that \u201cafter consultations with stakeholders, the State Security Council, in compliance with the extant Transport Sector Reform Law 2018, has decided to commence enforcement of the law which bans the operation of Okada and Keke in six Local Government Areas and nine Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs)\u201d. This ban forced unplanned pivots and total shutdowns of services for hitherto thriving local organisations like Gokada and ORide. The regulatory blizz also extended to the regulation of online ride-hailing companies like Uber and Bolt with the enforcement of the requirement for a service entity regulatory permit provisional application/renewal \u2013 \u20a610 million licence fee for service entities with 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; \u20a625 million for those with more than 1,000 units of e-hailing taxi; with the provisional license subject to an annual renewal with a renewable fee of \u20a65 million for every 1000 and \u20a610 million for every 1001 and above unit of e-hailing taxi. It also mandated that 10% of every transaction by the passenger to the ride-hailing operators must be paid to the state government. At the national level the new guideline for the regulation of logistics and courier companies which increased the license fees for logistics companies and courier services was also approved on July 23, 2020. The amount mandated as licensing and renewal fees is shocking, as it creates an impediment for most players in the sector, who are mostly struggling MSMEs without the economic wherewithal to afford the fees.\n\nAn immediate implication of the ban of commercial bikes and tricycles was the drastic unemployment it resulted in across a broad base of lagos. Unemployment directly correlates to an upsurge in crimes and insecurity.\n\nData and Infrastructure in South Africa and Kenya\n\nThe draft National Policy on Data and Cloud which is generally aimed at \u201cexploiting opportunities presented by the digital economy, through the development of policy frameworks that harness the economic and social potential of data and cloud computing\u201d was recently released (April 1 2021) .\n\nThe Draft Data Protection (General) Regulations 2021 of Kenya also introduces data localisation, while among other provisions, requiring countries or territories to which personal data is transferred, to have ratified the African Union Convention on CyberSecurity and Personal Data Protection. This provision apart from restricting the free flow of data needed for a digital economy to thrive, includes a requirement for ratification of a convention which Kenya itself is yet to ratify.\n\nAlthough the goal of the policies might be applauded, their restriction on cross-border transfer of data through local storage and processing of data is capable of affecting productivity and innovation, and ousting the countries\u2019 startups.\n\nDigital Tax policies in South Africa, Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya\n\nSouth Africa was the first, in 2014, to tax digital services by imposing a 14% value added tax (VAT) on digital imports. Several African countries have since followed its steps.\n\nThe Nigerian Finance Act for instance imposes 5% VAT on online transactions.\n\nIn Uganda 74% of businesses reported a reduction in earnings following the imposition of digital tax \u2013 excise duty on over-the-top services over the internet \u2013 in the country. This same proposal for digital tax was only shut down by the Benin Government after a peaceful protest was staged by its people.\n\nIn 2013, the National Treasury of Kenya introduced a 10% excise duty on money transfer services.\n\nGovernments rightly claim taxing digital services helps to raise revenue for ailing economies \u2013 totally plausible IF funds raised were channeled into providing infrastructure and enabling more innovation. This has not been the case however \u2013 digital tax policies and laws have mainly been used to restrict digital activity of citizens, infringing on their digital rights.\n\nSo why should YOU care, I hear you ask? This long story, we know all about it \u2013 it\u2019s not stopping bread from getting to my table.\n\nQuestion is: is it not?\n\nFrom an increased cost in basic services you have come to take for granted \u2013 from hailing a bike by app, phone call or on the side of the road to the inability to afford to continue to feed your family with premium turkey or listen to your favourite artiste due to new Copyright rules that don\u2019t support Fair Use principles.\n\nWhy? Because hey you can no longer ride uber at an affordable rate (Hi, Hackney permit), through to it getting harder to shop for that item from Senegal since the taxes on it are higher (that\u2019s if the customs barriers are surmounted by AfCFTA) and it becoming significantly harder (if at all possible) for you to get timely help by raising a social media cry for help.\n\nSo you see, it matters. It touches you. Not just the \u2018big businesses\u2019 or the start ups \u2013 You. As Nigerians like to say, \u201c\u2026 o di kwa serious?!\u201c\n\nOver the next few \u2018musings\u2019 I will ponder on what we should be prioritising and why. If the data allows and my brain strings the words I will project on the impact \u2013 possibly speak to the future.\n\nTill next time \u2013 keep musing \ud83d\ude09\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Nigerian fintech startup, Kuda Bank, has raised $55 million in a Series B round at a valuation of $500 million. This comes after a recent Series A of $25 million announced by the company just a little over four months ago.\n\nThe latest round was co-led by existing investors Target Global and Valar Ventures, the firm co-founded and backed by PayPal co-founder, Peter Thiel. SBI Investment and other previous angels also participated.\n\nKuda plans to use the funds to build on its new services for Nigeria as well as prepare for a continental expansion. According to Co-founder and CEO Babs Ogundeyi, Kuda aims to build a new take on banking services for \u201cevery African on the planet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been doing a lot of resource deployment in our operational entity, in Nigeria. But now we are doubling down on expansion and the idea is to build a strong team for the expansion plans for Kuda,\u201d Ogundeyi told TechCrunch, without disclosing which countries Kuda is eyeing.\n\n\u201cFor Babs and Musty, it was always about building a pan-African bank, not just a Nigerian leader,\u201d said Ricardo Sch\u00e4fer, the partner at Target Global. \u201cThe prospect of banking over 1 billion people from day one really stood out for me at the beginning.\u201d\n\nOgundeyi co-founded Kuda with the now CTO, Musty Mustapha, in the second half of 2019. The startup launched in Nigeria as a no-fees, digital-only bank with $1.6 million pre-seed funding. It has since witnessed significant growth.\n\nAs of November 2020, Kuda had 300,000 customers and was processing an average of $500 million worth of transactions per month.\n\nBy March this year, Kuda\u2019s registered users had more than doubled to 650,000, after the startup processed $2.2 billion a month earlier. Presently, Kuda has 1.4 million people in its user base.\n\nBeyond just basic financial services, Kuda now offers credit to its users by way of an overdraft allowance, which the company pre-qualifies the most active users for.\n\nIn the second quarter of the year, Kuda disbursed $20 million worth of credit to over 200,000 qualified users, with a 30-day repayment period.\n\nAccording to Ogundeyi, Kuda has seen \u201cminimal\u201d default because of its approach. \u201cWe use all the data we have for a customer and allocate the overdraft proportion based on the customer\u2019s activities, aiming for it not to be a burden to repay,\u201d he said.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\n\u201cKuda is our first investment in Africa and our initial confidence in the team has been upheld by its rapid growth in the past four months,\u201d said Andrew McCormack, a general partner at Valar Ventures.\n\n\u201cWith a youthful population eager to adopt digital financial services in the region, we believe that Kuda\u2019s transformative effect on banking will scale across Africa and we\u2019re proud to continue supporting them.\u201d\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "The dawn of Ghana\u2019s tech ecosystem: Here\u2019s what you should know",
          "text": "What\u2019s the first thing that comes to mind when you think of Ghana?\n\nThe Ashanti kingdom? Relaxed and easy-going people? Jollof rice wars with Nigerians?\n\nFor many years the West African nation has been known for its prominent natural resources: Gold and Cocoa. It\u2019s the world\u2019s second-largest producer of cocoa and the only African country among the top ten gold producing countries.\n\nCompared to other continent heavyweights like Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya, Ghana has mostly been in the background in terms of tech in Africa. But Ghana\u2019s budding tech scene has caught the attention of many and appears to be on the way to becoming a major export.\n\nRecent moves by big tech companies \u2014 Twitter setting up its African headquarters in Ghana and the 2019 launch of Google\u2019s AI lab in Accra, the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 are roaring examples of the dawn of Ghanaian Tech.\n\nTechCabal visited Ghana in July to get a first-hand view of Accra by connecting with key players and rising stars.\n\nHere\u2019s what you should know about Ghana\u2019s tech ecosystem, beyond cliches.\n\nThe people and prospects\n\nWith a population of about 31 million people growing at 2.2% annually, Ghana is currently the 13th most populous African country. Approximately 57% of its population is under the age of 25, a sign that Ghana and other African countries will supply a disproportionate percentage of the world\u2019s working-age people in the coming years.\n\nAdult literacy at 79% (as at 2018) has eased the adoption of tech products by its population.\n\nFoster Akugri, the founder of Hacklab Foundation, a not-for-profit organization focused on preparing young people for future jobs, believes the population is becoming more tech-savvy.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing more Ghanaian tech talents being headhunted by global companies. Now there are two ways to look at this, you can call it brain drain or that Ghana is producing the quality talents for global firms to consider hiring. I choose the latter.\u201d Akugri told TechCabal.\n\nGhana has 16 regions but its leading tech regions are Accra and Kumasi, the country\u2019s most urban and commercial centres. Of course, this pattern of concentration happens in other African countries like Nigeria where Lagos is the hub or Kenya where it\u2019s Nairobi.\n\n\u201cIn the past three years,\u201d Jorge Appiah CEO Kumasi Hive said, \u201cother regions like Tamale, Cape-Coast, Takoradi, Volta and Wa have been developing.\u201d\n\nInternet connection and the use of smartphones help to create thriving tech markets. How does Ghana stack up in this regard?\n\nIts internet penetration stands at 46.5%, which is higher than the African average of 39.3% and its neighbouring West African countries. But it lags behind the world\u2019s average of 58.5% and Kenya\u2019s 85%.\n\nFunding: Cash Flow is increasing\n\nTech ecosystems are built with a lot of resources \u2014 time, people, and mostly money.\n\nVenture capital investment in Africa has grown over the past five years, from $400 million in 2015 to $2 billion in 2019, according to Africa-focused VC fund Partech Africa. But Ghana has been behind South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria and Egypt.\n\nBased on Partech\u2019s 2020 report, the top five were Nigeria ($307 million), Kenya ($304 million), Egypt ($269 million), South Africa ($259 million), and Ghana ($111 million) displacing Rwanda which was fifth in Partech\u2019s 2019 list.\n\nThe four markets above Ghana can refer to their population sizes as justification for why they have received more funding. But like other African countries, Ghana can do more to encourage startups to incorporate there and hence attract more venture investment.\n\nA major snag for foreign startups setting up a base in Ghana is the minimum capital requirement. In the case of a joint venture between a Ghanaian and non-Ghanaian, the non-Ghanaian has to contribute at least $200,000. For wholly-owned foreign startups, they need to have a minimum of $500,000 capital.\n\nThe threshold increases to $1,000,000 with a minimum of 20 skilled Ghanaians employed if they commence commercial activities in Ghana. Many startups that are bootstrapping do not have access to large amounts of capital.\n\nThat said, Ghana is beginning to live up to predictions that it is well-positioned to attract more capital.\n\nSo far about nine Ghanaian startups \u2014 mPharma, Jetstream, Zeepay, OZ\u00c9, AgroCenta, Redbird, Complete Farmer, BezoMoney and SFAN \u2014 have raised money this year, which suggests that more are on the way.\n\nBut as funding increases, it\u2019s important for local investors to back the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cI look forward to the first wave of founders becoming the next wave of angel investors. That\u2019s the next tipping point I\u2019m interested in seeing.\u201d Will Senyo, CEO Impact Hub Accra and Venture Partner at Ingressive Capital said.\n\nIn terms of local investors, we have the likes of Sangu Delle who runs Golden Palm Investment and Africa Health Holdings, Walter Baddo and Peter Orth of 4DX Ventures, Kwamina Afful of Pave Investments and Ato Bentsi-Enchill of Black Adam Africa Capital Management.\n\nBut beyond money, hubs and accelerators help shape an ecosystem. Who plays these roles in Ghana?\n\nStart-up ecosystem builders\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the country\u2019s leading hubs, accelerators, venture firms, leading entrepreneurs, and other power brokers.\n\nIn 2017, the Ghanaian government established the Accra Digital Centre equipped with two hubs \u2013 the Ghana Innovation Hub and the Ghana TechLab \u2013 to run incubation and accelerator programs for startups.\n\nA product of the Ghana digital centre project, the Accra Digital Centre provides an enabling environment for startups to run their operations. It currently houses 36 startups, which enjoy discounted rent costs (about one-third of the regular rates) with flexible payment plans. David Ofori, Head of Operations at the Accra Digital Centre, says it has become the nerve centre around which most digital innovations are driven in Ghana.\n\nLast year, the Bank of Ghana created an office for Fintech and Innovation, to drive the regulator\u2019s cash-lite, e-payments, and digitisation agenda. An indicator that the government means business. It also launched the Fintech sandbox which gives startups a springboard to try out products without being restricted by license and capital requirements. In September, the Apex bank plans to roll out the first of a three-pilot-phased nation\u2019s digital currency.\n\nIn terms of private endeavours, the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology (MEST) has supported startups for over a decade. In that time, they\u2019ve had startups move on to internationally acclaimed programs like YC, going on to raise significant funding and claiming some exits along the way. Closely related to this is the Catalyst Fund Inclusive Digital Commerce Accelerator, a program that helps six commerce startups scale by providing them with a $120,000 equity-free grant each along with a six-month venture acceleration support.\n\nEstablished in 2013, Impact Hub Accra is a co-working space that houses over 50 startups yearly and provides a venue for tech events. Beyond supporting startups, it has also inspired the creation of other hubs.\n\n\u201cWhen Impact Hub Accra started, we were pretty much the only Hub in town,\u201d Kelechi Ofoegbu, COO Impact Hub Accra, said. \u201cToday there are nearly 10 other hubs across Accra and easily over 30 hubs across the entire country.\u201d\n\nIn addition to these, the Stanbic Bank Incubator, a corporate social initiative by Stanbic bank Ghana, provides access to training, funding and market for startups. Kosmos Innovation Centre (KIC) is focused on supporting entrepreneurs building agritech solutions.\n\nOutside of Accra, the Kumasi hive which started in 2015, has trained over 1,000 startups so far. A number of established Ghanaian tech companies like Hubtel, Farmerline, Sayetech, Green Afro-Palms began in Kumasi. Notably, Kumasi has also produced a number of Hardware startups like Dext, SolarTaxi, Nastech, Sesi Technologies and Incas Diagnostics.\n\nTo increase the participation of women in tech, organisations like StemBees, Developers in Vogues and Soronko Academy are training young women in programming/software development, and connecting them with job opportunities.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nTop players and other power brokers\n\nMobile Money is a big deal in Ghana and telecom giant MTN is the market leader with 17 million registered subscribers and over 200,000 agents across the country. There are other telco players like Vodafone and Airteltigo.\n\nThe ride-hailing and logistics space is dominated by the likes of Bolt, Uber, Yango and new entrant Glovo, while Jumia dominates the eCommerce space.\n\nWhile there\u2019s yet to be a major exit, a few companies like mPharma, ZeePay and Appruv have broken out and achieved continental success. Earlier this year, healthcare startup mPharma entered its eighth market in Sub-Saharan Africa while Zeepay acquired a mobile money company in Zambia.\n\nmPharma CEO Gregory Rockson sees his company\u2019s success as a sign of what other Ghanaian startups can do. \u201cI consider our success as an endorsement of the Ghana ecosystem and the fact that startups from Ghana can expand and build market-leading solutions in other countries,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Future and opportunities\n\nBeyond what Ghana is today, there\u2019s a lot to look forward to.\n\nJorge Appiah, who is also the CEO of SolarTaxi, believes the Ghanaian tech ecosystem is in its early days. \u201cThe prevalence of fintech means that we\u2019re laying the foundation for other types of startups that will address lifestyle and social issues,\u201d he said.\n\nIdris Bello, the founding partner of Lofty Inc, a Pan-African investment firm that has invested in four Ghanaian Startups, is keeping a keen eye on the growing ecosystem.\n\n\u201cGhana has calm founders, maybe not as in hurry like their counterparts in Nigeria. If you\u2019re able to build a strong team you can launch into the rest of the continent from there. That\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m bullish about finding strong founders with great networks like the folks at Yemaachi and Tendo amongst others.\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhoever I\u2019m investing in has to be building for beyond Ghana. There has to be a way to attract diasporans back to build from Ghana for the continent and we\u2019re going to be deliberate about that.\u201d\n\nMiishe Addy, CEO of Jetstream, a cross-border logistic company believes that like Singapore or Switzerland, Ghana\u2019s relatively small domestic market size forces founders to be practical and creative \u2013 very early on \u2013 about reaching beyond political boundaries.\n\n\u201cGhanaians have a reputation for a calm temperament and unusual skill in diplomacy,\u201d Addy said.\n\n\u201cWhether the stereotype bears out or not, it\u2019s a thrill to watch Ghanaian founders build bridges into other African markets and continue our long history of bringing the continent together.\u201d\n\nExcited about the momentum so far, Gregory Rockson, CEO of mPharma, points to \u201ca good education system, stability in governance, and a desire to achieve greatness.\u201d\n\n\u201cGhana can become the Singapore of West Africa where we attract strong tech talent from other countries in the region to continue their career from Ghana,\u201d he said.\n\nSenyo of Impact Hub believes the big opportunities lie in taking tech to the mass market. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot that\u2019s designed for a class that\u2019s tech-savvy. The true win would be taking tech to reach a larger market,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This announcement comes with the launch of Khula\u2019s new app \u2014 KHULA! Inputs \u2014 allows farmers to purchase agricultural inputs like fertilisers and agrochemicals and also access services from local and international suppliers.\n\nFounded in 2016 by Karidas Tshintsholo, CEO, Matthew Piper, CPO, and Jackson Dyora, Khula kicked off operations as a platform that helps small-scale farmers transport their products to formal markets by offering them cost-effective logistics services.\n\nCurrently, the platform calls itself an ecosystem as a result of its triune offerings, the KHULA! Inputs app, Fresh Produce Marketplace and Funder Dashboard.\n\nWith Khula\u2019s Fresh Produce Marketplace, farmers can directly sell produce to local and international wholesalers. This way, there is direct engagement between farmers and suppliers, thereby reducing the need for intermediaries.\n\nAlso, using Khula\u2019s Funder Dashboard, commercial and subsistence farmers are provided funding and support to purchase infrastructure and connect with investors.\n\nKhula claims to have signed up more than 3,000 farmers connected to over 100 suppliers and has 132 depots across South Africa. The startup was among the 15 African companies accepted into the 6th Class of the Google for Startups Accelerator.\n\nPer TechCrunch, Tshintsholo believes that AECI\u2019s investment in Khula is beyond an investment. It\u2019s also a long term partnership, and its vast distribution network will help scale its platforms.\n\n\u201cWe wanted a long-term partner that would execute with us. A partner with a great reputation in the industry and an incredible distribution network. A partner whose long-term success was tied to a business model like ours. And AECI fits that description perfectly for us.\u201d\n\nThe agricultural sector in Africa grapples with many challenges, from lack of financial support, poor education and difficulties for low-class farmers towards expanding their businesses.\n\nAlthough a lot can be done, platforms like Khula can help tackle some of these challenges with products that help connect farmers in low-income areas with investors and formal marketplaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy Matthew Website Out here, trying so hard to maintain my faculty of wonder in a fast-changing world.

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s external reserves stand to increase by about 10 percent, and the naira stabilise as Africa\u2019s largest economy will by August 23, 2021, receive a $3.3 billion allocation from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of $650 billion Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) approved on Monday.\n\nThe Board of Governors of the IMF has approved a general allocation of SDRs equivalent to US$650 billion (about SDR 456 billion) on August 2, 2021, to boost global liquidity.\n\nSDRs are the IMF\u2019s Unit of account and are basically the Fund\u2019s reserve assets held by member countries.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic decision \u2013 the largest SDR allocation in the history of the IMF and a shot in the arm for the global economy at a time of unprecedented crisis. The SDR allocation will benefit all members, address the long-term global need for reserves, build confidence, and foster the resilience and stability of the global economy. It will particularly help our most vulnerable countries struggling to cope with the impact of the COVID-19 crisis,\u201d IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said.\n\nSri Lanka, Pakistan, and Nigeria are the biggest relative beneficiaries in Frontier Emerging Markets (FEM) from the SDR allocation, according to data from EFG Hermes, Investment Banking and the leading financial partner in FEMs.\n\nRead also: Naira bouncing back as uncertainty wanes\n\n\u201cWe see Nigeria as the largest relative winner within our coverage universe from the SDR allocation. A direct allocation of USD3.3bn would boost reserves by about percent, Mohamed Abu Basha, head of Macro Economy \u2013 EFG Hermes.\n\nThis, in addition to a planned minimum USD3bn Eurobond issuance in the coming few weeks, could boost reserves by about 20 percent to +USD40bn by end of summer. Such a boost would complement high oil prices to improve the country\u2019s FX position, though this remains contingent upon further Naira adjustment.\n\nCBN has recently taken a relatively symbolic move to unify exchange rates; possessing the ammunition to ease FX shortages later this summer would encourage further Naira weakness (EFG Hermes maintains a target of N430), together with further upward adjustment in domestic market rates.\n\n\u201cWe would turn way more bullish if Nigeria benefited from on-lending, but we see it as unlikely that this administration would engage in an IMF programme of any sort,\u201d Basha said.\n\nThe general allocation of SDRs will become effective on August 23, 2021. The newly created SDRs will be credited to IMF member countries in proportion to their existing quotas in the Fund.\n\nAbout US$275 billion (about SDR 193 billion) of the new allocation will go to emerging markets and developing countries, including low-income countries.\n\nAyodeji Ebo, head of retail investment, Chapel Hill Denham, said this is a positive development and this will give the CBN more buffer to support the naira.\n\n\u201cWe expect the CBN to clear the FX backlog once this fund is received coupled with the potential FX inflow from Eurobond before the end of this year,\u201d he said.\n\nThis development will put the CBN in a very comfortable position especially with the stoppage of FX to the BDCs which will minimize the depletion of the external reserves. This may imply that we may not see any major adjustment in the naira for this year,\u201d Ebo said.\n\nOn his part, Ayodele Akinwunmi, relationship manager, corporate banking at FSDH Merchant Bank Limited, said this will increase the inflow of FX to Nigeria to help shore up the value of Naira temporarily.\n\n\u201cWe will also continue to engage actively with our membership to identify viable options for voluntary channeling of SDRs from wealthier to poorer and more vulnerable member countries to support their pandemic recovery and achieve resilient and sustainable growth\u201d, Georgieva said.\n\nOne key option is for members that have strong external positions to voluntarily channel part of their SDRs to scale up lending for low-income countries through the IMF\u2019s Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT).\n\nConcessional support through the PRGT is currently interest-free. The IMF is also exploring other options to help poorer and more vulnerable countries in their recovery efforts. A new Resilience and Sustainability Trust could be considered to facilitate more resilient and sustainable growth in the medium term.",

          "text": "The naira is heading back to the level it was before the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)\u2019s shock move to stop selling dollars to the Bureau De Change (BDC) operators.\n\nThat\u2019s after the currency on Tuesday strengthened to N509 per dollar from N512 on Monday at the parallel market.\n\nTraders say there\u2019s more clarity over the CBN\u2019s new policy to discontinue dollar sales to BDCs and that has seen hoarders begin to sell dollars again after pulling back to digest the shock move last week.\n\nThe commercial banks, who the CBN will now channel the $5.7 billion sold to BDCs annually, have started setting up dedicated teller points at all their branches nationwide for eligible foreign exchange needs.\n\nIn emails to customers, the banks are vowing to treat foreign exchange requests instantly, subject to required documentation.\n\nTraders said the naira may strengthen further to N504 per dollar as uncertainty about the rate wanes.\n\nOn Monday, the naira has steadily pared losses to the dollar after hitting a fresh low following the CBN\u2019s announcement.\n\nRead also: Naira pares losses in parallel market as bank CEOs expect more gains\n\nThe naira had strengthened by 0.58 percent to N512/$ on Monday compared with N515 it closed on Friday, after falling sharply to N525 to the dollar last week after the CBN\u2019s move to discontinue the sale of dollars to BDC operators due to foreign exchange arbitrage.\n\nIn the last monetary policy committee (MPC) briefing held on 27 July, the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, announced that the CBN would discontinue the weekly allocation and sales of foreign exchange to BDC operators and would no longer process licenses for new BDCs. The apex bank accused BDC operators of engaging in graft and becoming a conduit for illicit financial flows and money laundering. Subsequently, the CBN will channel weekly allocations of dollar sales to commercial banks to meet legitimate FX requests \u2013 personal travel allowance (PTA), business travel allowance (BTA), tuition fees, medical payments, SME transactions, among others \u2013 in an attempt to maintain the country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves (currently at US$33.38bn).\n\nAccording to Coronation Research, the most common reaction is a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, given that the CBN had on 11 January 2016 made a similar announcement banning the sale of foreign exchange to BDCs. The apex bank stated at the time that \u201coperators in this segment have not reciprocated the Bank\u2019s gesture to help maintain stability in the market\u201d.\n\nAs a result, the naira, which was already under pressure due to the decline in oil prices and the depleting foreign reserves, maintained a steady downward trend in the parallel market \u2013 parallel market rates spiked by 3.55 percent following the announcement. In a bid to salvage the dire situation, the CBN reversed its position and resumed the sale of dollars to BDCs in November 2016, 10 months after the ban. Within the period, the naira weakened by 42.1% in the parallel market and the spread between the official and parallel rates widened from 38.1% to 54.0%. The CBN hoped that resuming sales would help to drive down, or at worst stabilize, the parallel rate. Unfortunately, that was not the case, as the rate continued its upward trajectory, peaking at N520/US$1 in February 2017.\n\nSimilar to 2016, this time, the initial market response to the ban was a 3.81% decline in naira in the parallel market to N525/US$1. However, since this initial decline, the naira has witnessed two days of successive appreciations.\n\nThe Committee of Bank Chief Executive Officers has predicted that the exchange rate to the U.S dollar will continue to recover. The Committed stated that the banking industry is ready to begin foreign exchange sales to customers and that banks are better equipped than BDCs, to meet customers\u2019 forex needs.\n\n\u201cWe expect the pressure on the parallel rate to persist, as regular individuals and businesses who do not meet the narrow criteria to access funds through the banks and the I&E window are likely to resort to the parallel market. Consequently, the spread between the I&E rate and the parallel market rate could continue to expand,\u201d analysts at Coronation said.",

          "text": "Despite the implementation of electronic call-up system, security officials known as \u2018enforcement team\u2019 employed by the government to monitor truck movement in and out of Apapa and Tin-Can Island ports, have been found compounding the traffic gridlock by creating multiple checkpoints to extort money from truckers.\n\nWith the introduction of the electronic call-up, truckers are expected to pay N10,750 Value Added Tax (VAT) inclusive of booking Eto ticket; N10,000 for marking out TDO (terminal delivery order), and N15,000 for pre-gate charges, amounting to about N35,000 per trip, BusinessDay finding shows.\n\nHowever, with extortion, a trucker spend as much as N80,000 to N100,000 per trip due to the multiple checkpoints created by the traffic enforcement team. Some insist the trucker must pay N5,000 or N10,000 despite having a call-up ticket, and if the trucker refuses, the person may be delayed or turned back, and in some cases, the truck would be towed.\n\nBala Mohammed, a truck owner, who points out that there are 34 checkpoints of extortion from Ijora-Olopa down to Apapa, which tends to create backward gridlock, says when a trucker refuses to pay at a particular checkpoint, the enforcement team could assault the driver, destroy the side mirrors or windshield.\n\nAccording to Mohammed, there are two lanes of trucks going to the ports and they are export and empty container lanes, but in some cases, there would be the third one called express lane for those that have paid the extortion money to the enforcement team.\n\n\u201cSpace may be available inside the port but security official would not pass trucks to enter the port until gridlock starts building on the road, and people would be approaching them individually with money to pass their trucks. Here, a truck could pay between N10,000 and N20,000 for express,\u201d Mohammed states on phone.\n\nConfirming this, Mohammed Bello-Koko, acting managing director, Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), states that the security officials including military men, policemen, officials of the NPA security department and others are sabotaging the smooth operations of the electronic call-up system by mounting several checkpoints.\n\nRead also: Haulage cost halves as electronic call-up eases port congestion\n\n\u201cAt night, military men escort vehicles (into the port), which is sabotage. Area boys are also involved in extortion and they find ways to divert trucks. We discovered a building not far from Apapa gate where one can get a number plate printed in less than 20 minutes. This number can be used to get an Eto ticket. Security agencies have raided the building and investigations are ongoing. This is why we are moving from the normal Eto that has digits to QR codes that are difficult to duplicate,\u201d Bello-Koko says in an interview in Lagos.\n\nItunuoluwa Shonibare, another truck owner, who discloses that extortion has not ended even with the introduction of Eto electronic call-up system, says the security officials benefiting from the gridlock are called \u2018Apapa Park Yahoo.\u2019\n\nShonibare states that such officials pay as much as N10 million to their superiors to come back to Apapa where each official earn close to N2 million per night.\n\n\u201cExport containers paying N200,000 each to access the port, multiply this by 200 export trucks that access the ports,\u201d she notes.\n\nOn fake Eto ticket, she says each code is sold for N5,000, which means that the six codes required to obtain Eto ticket goes for N30,000 while truckers also pay between N150,000 and N180,000 to avoid necessary pre-gates procedures.\n\nRemi Ogungbemi, chairman, Association of Maritime Truck Owners (AMATO), describes these checkpoints as tollgates where money is being collected from truckers.\n\n\u201cThese uniform personnel have seen truckers as their \u2018oil well\u2019 and \u2018ATM cards\u2019 that they can exploit,\u201d Ogungbemi explains.",

          "title": "Court orders EFCC to unfreeze Dokpesi\u2019s bank account",
          "text": "The Federal High Court in Abuja, on Tuesday, issued an order unfreezing the bank account of the Chairman of Daar Communications Plc, Raymond Dokpesi.\n\nDaar Communications is the parent company of African Independent Television (AIT) and Ray Power Radio.\n\nThe judge, John Tsoho, gave the order in a ruling on Mr Dokpesi\u2019s application for the unfreezing of the account.\n\nMr Tsoho, who is also the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, ordered that the account domiciled at First Bank be immediately \u201cunfrozen\u201d since the criminal charges which precipitated the restriction on the account had been dismissed and Mr Dokpesi discharged and acquitted by the Court of Appeal.\n\nMr Tsoho said that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, (EFCC) had no basis to put a post-no-debit order on the account in view of the subsisting and valid judgment of the Court of Appeal.\n\nHe held that there was no application by the EFCC for stay of execution of the appellate court\u2019s judgment which quashed the criminal charges against Mr Dokpesi.\n\nMr Tsoho said in the absence of a stay of execution, the court was bound by law to recognise the judgment of the appellate court.\n\nHe ordered that the freezing order and post-no-debit on the account be immediately removed in compliance with the appellate court\u2019s judgment.\n\nOn the claim by the EFCC that it had appealed the appellate court\u2019s decision at the Supreme Court, the judge held that the notice of appeal filed at the apex court could not in law stay the execution of the subsisting judgment.\n\nHe added that the anti-graft agency ought to have obtained a stay of execution of the judgment.\n\nHe further ordered that all documents seized from Mr Dokpesi should be immediately returned to him.\n\nArguments\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Mr Dokpesi\u2019s lawyer, Kanu Agabi, earlier in his argument on Tuesday, asked the court to issue an order unfreezing his client\u2019s bank account frozen on the strength of the alleged N2.1 billion fraud charge against him.\n\nThe senior lawyer had submitted that the criminal charges in respect of N2.1 billion had since been dismissed by the Court of Appeal Abuja division but the EFCC wanted to continue to hold his client in bondage.\n\nMr Agabi had further argued that the charge which led to freezing of the account no longer existed following the decision of the appellate court on the matter.\n\nHe tendered two judgements of the Court of Appeal to establish his claim that the criminal charges against Mr Dokpesi had been quashed.\n\nHe said until the judgments were set aside, the EFCC could not continue to freeze his client\u2019s account.\n\nHowever, EFCC counsel, Oluwaleke Atolagbe, had opposed the application on the grounds that the anti-graft agency had already filled a notice of appeal against the appellate court\u2019s judgment at the apex court.\n\nMr Atolagbe had urged the court not to unfreeze the account yet until the final decision of the Supreme Court in the matter adding that the N2.1 billion logged in the frozen account formed the basis of the charge.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe also opposed the request for the release of Mr Dokpesi\u2019s document in possession of EFCC on the grounds that no specific document was mentioned in the request.\n\nHow Dokpesi was set free by Appeal Court\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that on April 1, a three-member panel of the appeal court in a unanimous judgment freed Mr Dokpesi from the charges after it held that the prosecution failed to establish the ingredients of the charge.\n\nThe EFCC had in 2015 sued Mr Dokpesi, accusing him and his company of illegally receiving funds considered as proceeds of crimes from a former National Security Adviser (NSA), Sambo Dasuk, a retired colonel.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to the charges and went further to file a no-case submission after the prosecution closed its case in November 2018 after calling 14 witnesses.\n\nHowever, the trial judge, Mr Tsoho, rejected the no-case submission and ordered Mr Dokpesi and his firm to enter their defence.\n\nNot satisfied, the defendants then approached the Court of Appeal, with a request to nullify the decision and free him from the charges on the grounds that the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case against them.\n\nIn the unanimous judgment delivered by Elfreda Williams-Dawodu, the appellate court agreed with the appellants that the case of the respondents lacked merit having \u201cfailed woefully to establish a prima facie case against the appellant\u201d.\n\nAccording to the judgment, for any case to be established against the defendants, it is necessary to first prove the ingredients of offence in the predicate offences in counts 1 to 4 of the seven-count charge which bordered on criminal breach of trust, division of funds, money laundering and corruption.\n\nThe court further held that EFCC failed to prove that the N2.1 billion allegedly received by the appellant was a proceed of breach of trust and accordingly set aside the decision of the lower court which held that the appellants had a case to answer.\n\n\u201cNo case was made against the appellant in counts 1, 2, 3 and 4 to warrant his being called upon to open his defence.\n\n\u201cThere is no possibility that the appellant can be convicted because the evidence are manifestly unreliable.\n\n\u201cI am of the view that irrespective of the ingredients stated earlier, and those by the appellant and first respondent respectively, prior proof or establishment of the predicate offences in count 1,2,3 and 4 of the amended charge is sine qua non to the proof of the offences of money laundering specified in the said counts.\n\n(NAN)",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Tokyo 2020 Olympics showing has been near disaster, but change is happening",
          "text": "By OBINNA EZUGWU\n\nThe suspension of Nigeria\u2019s sprint queen, Blessing Okagbare, from further participation at the Tokyo Olympics last week, after testing positive for human growth hormone, coupled with an injury to Enoch Adegoke who pulled out of the men\u2019s 100 final on Sunday, appeared to have capped what had been shaping up to be an out-and-out disastrous showing by the ill-prepared Nigerian athletes at the games.\n\nThe above tragedies had come on the heels of the elimination of both the D\u2019Tigers and the D\u2019Tigress; the country\u2019s male and female basketball teams \u2013 the latter which had shown flashes of brilliance with stunning wins against the United States and Argentina prior to the games \u2013 as well as the disqualification of 10 athletes from the country for not meeting the minimum testing requirements. But the country\u2019s only wrestler at the event, Blessing Oborududu, and long jumper, Ese Brume, have ensured that it won\u2019t return empty handed, by winning silver and bronze medals respectively.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s been an embarrassing showing by Africa\u2019s most populous country; an eloquent testimony of the terrible state of sports and everything else in the country. Sacramento Kings and D\u2019Tigress player, Chimeze Metu, painted a succinct picture of the situation while narrating the experience of the basketball team and other athletes in the hands of Nigerian officials at the games.\n\nYet, the Tokyo outing says something more than the obvious poor state of sports in Nigeria and the terrible attitude of sports officials. It has shown that there is a gradual shift, which is attributable to the fact that the country\u2019s sports is no longer driven by local content, but the Diaspora population, and the face of Nigerian sports is changing as a result.\n\nConceded that there is really nothing strange about Nigeria feeding a team of mostly foreign based players for a global competition \u2013 at least, that\u2019s been true of the country\u2019s national football team for as long as anyone can remember \u2013 however, while that\u2019s been true of football, understandably so, because the best of the players ply their trade in Europe, it\u2019s not been true of other sports. But that\u2019s changing, too, and the reason is much deeper than one adduced to explain the preponderance of foreign based players in football.\n\nThe country\u2019s list of 60 athletes who headed to Japan tells an interesting story. Of the 60, about 36 were either born, raised or trained in the United States, or some other Western countries \u2013 overwhelming majority in the US \u2013 and that has reflected hugely on the nature of the country\u2019s sports; it\u2019s a paradigm shift.\n\nFor the first time in history, the world got to watch a Nigerian Olympic gymnast, in the person of 23-year-old Uche Eke. Dressed in a pair of fitting green Slimline Joggers, Eke wagged and wagged his legs to the administration of the scanty spectators at the Olympics arena, who could not help but clap for the young Nigerian.\n\nHe did not, however, go far in the games. He left almost as soon as he came, unable to compete with likes of the U.S., Russia, China, Japan and other nations that have been in the sport for ages. But it was a good debut, and part of the larger picture of the changing face of Nigerian sports, one driven by the Diaspora population.\n\nThere was 21-year-old Esther Tamaraebi Toko, the Canada based rowing sensation, and Abiola Ogunbanwo, coming from Australia to represent Nigeria in swimming; first, too, to represent the country in that category. But there is even the biggest of them all: basketball replaced football.\n\nIt\u2019s both heartwarming and sad story. On the one hand, the preponderance of foreign born or trained athletes speak eloquently to the strength of the country\u2019s Diaspora population, which can also be a catalyst for its development. But on the other hand, it lays bare the pathetic state of sports management in Nigeria, and how much things have deteriorated over the years.\n\nWhen in 1996, 50-year-old Chioma Ajunwa-Opara, jumped her way to gold medal at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta, aged 25, becoming not just the first the Nigerian, but also the first black African woman to win an Olympic gold medal in a field event, she made a clear point; the point that the country had all it took \u2026 that with the necessary facilities and grooming, Nigerian athletes can rule the world.\n\nThe police officer who started life as a footballer, had subsequently opted for athletics when she was denied a chance to excel in the game by then Falcons coach who she said wouldn\u2019t just let her play, even when it was obvious that she was the best player in the team, later applied herself to track and field, specializing in the 100m, 200m and long jump, and by dint of hard work, won bronze medal at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, gold medal at the 1991 All Africa Games before taking gold at the Atlanta Olympics.\n\nThe same Atlanta games, Nigeria\u2019s under 23 Dream Team, comprised of young players who had grown up playing in Nigeria, with little to no European experience, beat both Brazil and Argentina en route to winning gold medal in the football event. 1996 turned out to be Nigeria\u2019s golden year. The Relay Team of Olabisi Afolabi, Fatima Yusuf, Charity Opara and Falilat Ogunkoya won the silver medal, while Mary Onyali and Ogunkoya took bronze in their individual track events. The medal table was capped by Duncan Dokiwari who also boxed his way to bronze, bringing to the number of medals won by Nigeria to five.\n\nBefore 1996, the country had only managed eight medals since it started participating in the games in 1952, five of which came from boxing and three from athletics. Indeed, the country won its first medal in the 1964 games held in Tokyo, with Nojim Maiyegun winning bronze in boxing. This was followed in West Germany 1972, by another bronze won in boxing by Isaac Ikhouria. And in 1984 in Los Angeles, Peter Konyegwachie won the country its first silver medal in boxing, a feat matched by the Relay Team of Sunday Uti, Moses Ugbisie, Rotimi Peters and Innocent Egbunike which took silver, too, in the track event.\n\nThe 1984 record was yet bettered by the 1992 athletes in Barcelona \u2013 after the 1988 team that went to Seoul, South Korea returned empty handed \u2013 with the Relay Team of Chidi Imo, Olapade Adeniken, Davidson Ezinwa and Oluyemi Kayode winning silver; David Izontitei and Igbinegbu each winning silver in boxing and the Relay Team of Mary Onyali, Christy Opara-Thompson, Beatrice Utundu and Faith Idehen winning bronze.\n\nSo, when the country amassed five medals four years later in 1996, it must have seemed as though this African giant was now emerging into a sports powerhouse, poised to challenge the likes of the United States, Russia and China. But things went rather downhill, slowly but surely, like everything else about \u201cthe African Giant.\u201d\n\nIn the following event in Sydney 2000, the country managed three medals; one gold medal, courtesy of the Relay Team of Nduka Awazie, Fidelis Gadzama, Clement Chukwu, Jude Monye, Sunday Bada and Enefiok Udo-Obong; as well as two silver medals one by sprinter, Gloria Alozie and weightlifter, Ruth Ogbeifo.\n\nFour years later, in Athens 2004, it came down to two bronze, won by the Relay Teams of Olusoji Fasuba, Uche Emedolu, Aaron Egbele and Deji Aliu; as well as James Godday, Musa Audu, Saul Weigopuwa and Enefiok Udo-Obong. This was slightly bettered in Beijing 2008 by the four medals won by the country\u2019s athletes, including two silver medals won by Blessing Okagbare and the Relay Team of Gloria Kemasuode, Franca Idoko, Halimat Ismaila, Oludamola Osayemi and Agnes Osazuwa. Chika Chukwumerije and Mariam Usman won bronze in taekwondo and weightlifting respectively.\n\nThe country failed to win any medals in London 2012, and only managed bronze in football at the Rio de Janerio games in 2016.\n\nOf the total 25 medals won by Nigeria since 1952, for instance, boxing accounted for six, athletics 13, football three, weightlifting two and taekwondo, one. But of the 60 athletes representing Nigeria in Tokyo, there is no single boxer, and no single footballer, as both the male and female Olympic football teams failed to qualify for the games.\n\nFootball has always been Nigeria\u2019s favourite sport, with Olympic gold, silver and bronze to show for it, but the badly managed local football leagues has ensured that no football team represents Nigeria in Tokyo. The country had eyed basketball for glory, a radical departure from the usual. While both the male and female football teams failed to qualify, the two basketball teams; D\u2019Tigers and D\u2019Tigress, made it to the games.\n\nUnlike the football teams that featured players born and raised in Nigeria, almost all the country\u2019s basketball players are either born or raised in the United States. Indeed with the exception of Ike Nwamu, who plays for Samara, Russia; Obi Emegano who plays for Fuenlabrada, Spain; Caleb Agada, who plays for Hapoel Be\u2019er Sheva, Israel and Ekpe Udoh, who just completed a move Virtus Bologna in Italy, all other members of D\u2019Tigers squad, are based in the United States, and ply their trade in the NBA.\n\nThey include Josh Okogie (Minnesota Timberwolves), Miami Heat\u2019s trio of Gabe Vincent, KZ Okpala and Precious Achiuwa, Jahlil Okafor (Detroit Pistons) and Miye Oni (Utah Jazz), Jordan Nwora (Milwaukee Bucks) and Chimezie Metu (Sacramento Kings).\n\nNow, these are not Nigerians who simply went to the US or Europe to ply their trade. Most were born in the US, Canada or other western countries, or at least grew up there. It\u2019s same with the female basketball team, D\u2019Tigress. Only four of the 12 \u2013 Adara Elonu, Spain; Ify lbekwe, Italy; Ezinne Kalu, France; Aisha Mohammed, Kosovo; Pallas Kunaiyi-Akpanah, Italy; Atonye Nyingifa, Spain \u2013 are based in Europe, even as most were born in the states, where the rest \u2013 Promise Amukamara, Oderah Chidom, Erica Ogwumike, Nneka Ogwumike, Nnenna Amy Okonkwo and Elizabeth Olatayo Williams \u2013 ply their trade.\n\nThe athletics teams also saw a large contingent US born or trained athletes, including Chidi Okezie, Chioma Onyekwere, Favour Ofili, Ruth Usoro, Knowledge Omovoh, Tobi Amusan, Rosemary Chukwuma, among others. Nigerian sports is increasingly being driven by its Diaspora population. In a sense it\u2019s a crying shame that a country of over 200m people, cannot groom athletes that can compete for medals in the grandest stage of all. The hope of this ever happening, now increasingly lies with the Diaspora population, as sports like everything else, keep going downhill in Africa\u2019s most populous country.",

In the North West particularly, Nigeria is experiencing a crisis of armed banditry and kidnapping,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the region has remarkably witnessed five separate mass kidnapping incidents since November 2020, in which between tens and hundreds of children have been captured and carted away from public school premises.\n\n\u201cTheir negotiated release has cost the government as much as $2.4m, according to sources familiar with the details, although official sources insist that no ransoms were tendered.\n\n\u201cFor non-state armed groups, such payments will be used to sustain the war they have been waging against the state for over a decade.\u201d\n\nThe report also stated that the recurrent violence in different parts of the country had led to the destruction of property, agricultural losses, and human rights violations.\n\nCiting a report by the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa, it stated that Nigeria hosts 350 million or 70 per cent of the 500 million illegal arms in West Africa, noting that this further contributed to insecurity in Nigeria.\n\nMeanwhile, wife of the Kebbi State Governor, Dr Aisha Bagudu, has decried the high level of school abductions in the country while also calling for public private partnership in tackling the menace, PUNCH reported.\n\nBagudu, who spoke during a press briefing to commemorate the World Literacy Day in Abuja on Monday, also called on well-meaning individuals to contribute to the eradication of mass illiteracy in the country.\n\nShe said, \u201cThe rate of school abductions is high and very alarming and this makes us very sad. The truth is we are all sad about this.\n\n\u201cYou wonder if these people have children. The government alone cannot stop this. The host communities must come together to fight this.\u201d",

          "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF), has approved a general allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) equivalent to $650 billion (about SDR 456 billion) to boost global liquidity.\n\nThe latest approval, being the largest SDR allocation in the history of the IMF, could see Nigeria\u2019s external reserves rising by as much as 20 per cent, according to a Reuters estimate.\n\nSDR is an international reserve asset created by the United Nations specialised agency to supplement its member countries\u2019 official reserves.\n\nAccording to the IMF, a direct benefit of a general SDR allocation, and indeed the purpose of such an allocation under the Fund\u2019s Articles of Agreement, is to supplement existing reserve assets to help meet a long-term global need. This boosts buffers and bolsters international economic resilience.\n\nThe IMF also explains that once allocated, members can hold their SDRs as part of their foreign exchange reserves or sell or use part or all of their SDR allocations.\n\n\u201cMembers can exchange SDRs for freely usable currencies among themselves and with prescribed holders; such exchange can take place under a voluntary arrangement or under a mandatory designation plan on members with sufficiently strong external positions, which serves as the ultimate backstop for the SDR market. Since 1987, the SDR market has functioned through voluntary arrangements, without the need to activate the designation plan.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIMF members can also use SDRs in a range of other authorized operations among themselves (e.g., loans, payment of obligations, pledges) and in operations and transactions involving the IMF, such as the payment of interest on and repayment of loans, or payment for quota increases,\u201d the Breton Woods Institution further explained on its website.\n\nThe value of the SDR is based on a basket of five currencies \u2013 the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Japanese yen, and the British pound sterling. They are units of account for the IMF, not a currency per se.\n\nThe IMF board of governors which gave the approval on Monday in Washington DC, said that the general allocation of SDRs would become effective on August 23, according to a statement released yesterday.\n\nThe Fund said that the newly created SDRs would be credited to IMF member countries in proportion to their existing quotas in the fund while about 275 billion dollars (about SDR 193 billion) of the new allocation will go to emerging markets and developing countries, including low-income countries.\n\nManaging director, Ms Kristalina Georgieva, said it was a historic decision.\n\nAccording to her, it is the largest SDR allocation in the history of the IMF and a shot in the arm for the global economy at a time of unprecedented crisis.\n\n\u201cThe SDR allocation will benefit all members, address the long-term global need for reserves, build confidence and foster the resilience and stability of the global economy.\n\n\u201cIt will particularly help our most vulnerable countries struggling to cope with the impact of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n\u201cWe will also continue to engage actively with our membership to identify viable options for voluntary channeling of SDRs from wealthier to poorer and more vulnerable member countries.\n\n\u201cThis is to support their pandemic recovery and achieve resilient and sustainable growth\u201d, Georgieva said.\n\nThe IMF said that one key option was for members that had strong external positions to voluntarily channel part of their SDRs to scale up lending for low-income countries through the IMF\u2019s Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT).\n\nIt also said that concessional support through the PRGT was currently interest free as the IMF was also exploring other options to help poorer and more vulnerable countries in their recovery efforts.\n\nA new Resilience and Sustainability Trust could be considered to facilitate more resilient and sustainable growth in the medium term, it said.",

          "text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF), has approved a general allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) equivalent to $650 billion (about SDR 456 billion) to boost global liquidity.\n\nThe latest approval, being the largest SDR allocation in the history of the IMF, could see Nigeria\u2019s external reserves rising by as much as 20 per cent, according to a Reuters estimate.\n\nSDR is an international reserve asset created by the United Nations specialised agency to supplement its member countries\u2019 official reserves.\n\nAccording to the IMF, a direct benefit of a general SDR allocation, and indeed the purpose of such an allocation under the Fund\u2019s Articles of Agreement, is to supplement existing reserve assets to help meet a long-term global need. This boosts buffers and bolsters international economic resilience.\n\nThe IMF also explains that once allocated, members can hold their SDRs as part of their foreign exchange reserves or sell or use part or all of their SDR allocations.\n\n\u201cMembers can exchange SDRs for freely usable currencies among themselves and with prescribed holders; such exchange can take place under a voluntary arrangement or under a mandatory designation plan on members with sufficiently strong external positions, which serves as the ultimate backstop for the SDR market. Since 1987, the SDR market has functioned through voluntary arrangements, without the need to activate the designation plan.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIMF members can also use SDRs in a range of other authorized operations among themselves (e.g., loans, payment of obligations, pledges) and in operations and transactions involving the IMF, such as the payment of interest on and repayment of loans, or payment for quota increases,\u201d the Breton Woods Institution further explained on its website.\n\nThe value of the SDR is based on a basket of five currencies \u2013 the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Chinese renminbi, the Japanese yen, and the British pound sterling. They are units of account for the IMF, not a currency per se.\n\nThe IMF board of governors which gave the approval on Monday in Washington DC, said that the general allocation of SDRs would become effective on August 23, according to a statement released yesterday.\n\nThe Fund said that the newly created SDRs would be credited to IMF member countries in proportion to their existing quotas in the fund while about 275 billion dollars (about SDR 193 billion) of the new allocation will go to emerging markets and developing countries, including low-income countries.\n\nManaging director, Ms Kristalina Georgieva, said it was a historic decision.\n\nAccording to her, it is the largest SDR allocation in the history of the IMF and a shot in the arm for the global economy at a time of unprecedented crisis.\n\n\u201cThe SDR allocation will benefit all members, address the long-term global need for reserves, build confidence and foster the resilience and stability of the global economy.\n\n\u201cIt will particularly help our most vulnerable countries struggling to cope with the impact of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n\u201cWe will also continue to engage actively with our membership to identify viable options for voluntary channeling of SDRs from wealthier to poorer and more vulnerable member countries.\n\n\u201cThis is to support their pandemic recovery and achieve resilient and sustainable growth\u201d, Georgieva said.\n\nThe IMF said that one key option was for members that had strong external positions to voluntarily channel part of their SDRs to scale up lending for low-income countries through the IMF\u2019s Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT).\n\nIt also said that concessional support through the PRGT was currently interest free as the IMF was also exploring other options to help poorer and more vulnerable countries in their recovery efforts.\n\nA new Resilience and Sustainability Trust could be considered to facilitate more resilient and sustainable growth in the medium term, it said.",

          "text": "The Federal Government has vowed to deal decisively with all perpetrators of Rape and other Gender-Based Violence (GBV) in the country.\n\nThe vice president, Prof Yemi Osibanjo, made this known at the official launch of USAID\u2019s Momentum Country and Global Leadership.\n\nThe vice president, who was represented by the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq, said that the declaration by the federal government of zero-tolerance to rape and other forms of gender-based violence was a step in the right direction in fighting GBV in Nigeria.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cMr. President directed the Inspector-General of Police to deal with all perpetrators further to the declaration of Zero tolerance to Rape and other Gender-Based Violence as well as constant engagement with the Police on the need to promptly address issues of Gender Based Violence.\n\n\u201cThis declaration of Zero Tolerance to Rape and other forms of Gender Based Violence, including Harmful Traditional Practices is a giant stride and a step in the right direction in fighting Gender Based Violence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is time we rise up to the challenges posed by this menace and constantly speak out against this evil perpetrated by mindless individuals. As such, I want to join my voice to all the voices gathered here today to say no to Gender-Based Violence in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt would be recalled that the Federal Executive Council on 10th June, 2020 had unanimously declared zero tolerance against Gender-Based Violence in the country in view of the hues and cries that trailed the unacceptable spike in Gender-Based Violence during the Covid-19 pandemic lock-down.\n\n\u201cThis resulted in the inauguration of an Inter-Ministerial Gender-Based Violence Management Committee on 23rd June, 2021 to proffer a synchronized approach to address all forms of violence against women and children in the country,\u201d Osinbajo said.\n\nHe noted that violence against women has not only impacted on the society and the economy but also restricted women due to limited access to education, employment and finances.\n\n\u201cAs a nation, we will continue to boldly condemn Gender-Based Violence (GBV), so long as it continues to impact negatively on survivors, victims, families, broader society and economies of Nations.\n\n\u201cFrom available information, we are more than ever convinced that Gender Based Violence is driven by structural inequalities and unequal power relations that render women subordinate to men due to limited access to education, employment, finances, healthcare and opportunities to contribute to their families, communities and the nation\u2019s economic growth,\u201d he added.\n\nThe representative of the vice president praised the Minister of Women Affairs, Dame Pauline Tallen, for her doggedness and advocacy against gender-based violence in the country while thanking USAID and other donors.\n\nShe also called on well-meaning Nigerians to support the course of ending GBV in Nigeria.\n\nThe Charge D\u2019Affairs of the US Embassy, Kathleen FitzGibbon; representative of Ebonyi State governor, Chief Emmanuel Umezurike; representative of the Sokoto State governor; the Permanent Secretary of the Women Affairs Ministry; Head of USAID, Dr. Anne E. Patterson; Country Director of UN, civil society organisations, heads of agencies and other dignitaries attended the official launch of the USAID\u2019s Momentum Country and Global Leadership.",

You will be charged with contempt of court and may be sentenced to prison.\u201d\n\nInstead of following the initial order, the lawless secret agency swiftly arraigned the activists on accusations of disruption of public peace in order to get a face-saving reason for keeping them in detention, according to SaharaReporters.\n\nThe defendants pled not guilty to the accusations when they were brought before the magistrate for arraignment on Wednesday.\n\nTheir lawyer then asked for their release on bail.\n\nThe magistrate, Mohammed Zubairu, granted the defendants bail in the sum of N500,000 with a guarantee each, but the DSS operatives swiftly drove the activists away before the bail terms could be perfected.\n\n\u201cWe want to thank everyone who stood firmly by these young men and the #Revolutionnow movement during their unjust incarceration-torture and dehumanisation in the hands of Dr. Paul Enenche\u2019s church security before they were handed over to the DSS,\u201d human rights activist Omoyele Sowore said after their release.\n\n\u201cThe lawsuit in pursuit of justice for the five revolutionaries will continue at the Federal High Court and administrative sanctions will be pursued against the Magistrate that ignored a superior court order ordering their release as well as the three DSS lawyers who flagrantly ignored the higher court orders to arraign them before the Magistrate.\n\n\u201cTheir lawyers will also pursue a contempt of court proceeding against the DG of DSS, Yusuf Bichi Mogaji in coming days. Special thanks to the lead lawyer in the case, Barrister Tope Tomekun and his team for a marvellous job challenging the authoritarian regime relentlessly!\u201d",

They contribute to comprehensively advancing digital inclusion, focusing on multiple dimensions of human rights, open Internet, quality of access, and inclusive multi-stakeholder governance for building resilient West Africa and achieving SDGs.\n\nDorothy Gordon, Chair of UNESCO\u2019 Information for All Programme, reaffirmed the need for strong advocacy from national and regional stakeholders to implement the national assessment of IUIs across the West-African countries. She further called for more engagement from civil society to represent vulnerable and marginalized groups, such as disabled people, women, or the youth.\n\nProfessor Alain Kiyindou pointed out that the assessment of the ROAM-X indicators in countries like Benin and Niger offers tremendous opportunities to push forward the development of the Internet in West Africa. This framework empowers national stakeholders to gain a better understanding of their digital landscape and engage in the digital transformation and inclusion process.\n\nRepresenting Development House, Kafui Aheto introduced the initial findings of the ongoing national assessment of ROAM-X indicators in Ghana. He highlighted the importance of multi-stakeholders in guiding the overall assessment process and building policy development in Ghana.\n\nROAM-X indicators assessments have been progressing in 28 countries, including the following African countries: Benin, Senegal, Kenya, Ghana, Niger, Ethiopia, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Cabo Verde, Burkina Faso. All participants agreed on the importance for African countries to mainstream ROAM principles and the urgent need to expand advocacy, capacity-building, resource mobilization, and multistakeholder partnerships to scale up national assessment projects across the region.\n\nUNESCO encourages all countries in the West-African sub-region to continue using the ROAM framework and join the Dynamic Coalition on Internet Universality Indicators (IUIs) to bring the Internet forward in the region.",

The SDR is defined by the US dollar, Euro, Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, and the British Pound.\n\nSupporting Pandemic Recovery\n\nThe amount allocated to Nigeria is as a result of the exchange rate of reference which is 0.702283 SDR to a dollar as of July 1, 2021, and Nigeria has 2.4545 billion SDRs.\n\n\u201cThe SDR allocation will benefit all members, address the long-term global need for reserves, build confidence, and foster the resilience and stability of the global economy,\u201d the IMF managing director added.\n\n\u201cIt will particularly help our most vulnerable countries struggling to cope with the impact of the COVID-19 crisis.\u201d\n\nAccording to the IMF, the general allocation of SDRs will become effective on August 23 and the newly created SDRs will be credited to IMF member countries in proportion to their existing quotas in the Fund.\n\nIt stated that about $275 billion (about SDR 193 billion) of the new allocation will go to emerging markets and developing countries, including low-income countries.\n\nGeorgieva promised that the fund would continue to engage actively with its membership to identify viable options for voluntary channelling of SDRs from wealthier to poorer, and more vulnerable member countries to support their pandemic recovery and achieve resilient and sustainable growth.\n\nOne key option is for members that have strong external positions to voluntarily channel part of their SDRs to scale up lending for low-income countries through the IMF\u2019s Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT).\n\nThe IMF said the concessional support through the PRGT was currently interest-free, adding that it was exploring other options to help poorer and more vulnerable countries in their recovery efforts.\n\nA new Resilience and Sustainability Trust could be considered to facilitate more resilient and sustainable growth in the medium term, it stated.",

          "text": "By Akionla Ajibola\n\nNigerian duo Blessing Oborududu and Ese Brume gave their fellow compatriots back home some reasons to cheer as they hope for more medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games in Japan.\n\nThis followed a week of bad news for Team Nigeria ranging from the declaration of 10 athletes as ineligible to participate in the games, to the suspension of Olympic medallist, Blessing Okagbare, among others.\n\nAmid the fears of shattered dreams at the Olympics, Oborududu revived the hopes for Nigerians following a brilliant performance in the semi-final of the women\u2019s freestyle 68kg wrestling.\n\nPaired with Battsetseg Soronzonbold, the 32-year-old beat her Mongolian opponent on Monday to reach the next round and guarantee Nigeria its first medal at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nShe later went on to face Stock Mensah Tamyra Marianna of the United States of America to jostle for the gold medal in that category in a keenly-watched final.\n\nOborududu, however, lost 4-1 to the American.\n\n25-Year Long Jump Record Crushed\n\nBut the defeat was not enough to deter the 10-time African champion from being proud of her achievement after becoming the world\u2019s number two woman wrestler.\n\nShe also made history on Tuesday as the first wrestler to win an Olympic medal representing Nigeria at the Olympics.\n\nThe Olympian won a silver medal \u2013 the second for her country after Brume who made the country proud earlier by winning a bronze medal in the women\u2019s long jump category.\n\nBrume leaped a best jump of 6.97m behind Germany\u2019s Malaika Mihambo and Brittney Reese of the United States of America who claimed the gold and silver medals respectively.\n\nThe 25-year-old Nigerian had won bronze at the 2019 World Championships in Doha and later jumped a distance of 7.17m at the Chule Vista Festival in California in May.\n\nBy this time, she had crushed Chioma Ajunwa\u2019s 25-year long jump record of 7.12m which won her a gold medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.\n\nBrume was also the only Nigerian athlete who reached the final of her event at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio, Brazil where she finished fifth.\n\nApart from the brilliant performances from Oborududu and Brume, Nigerians are hoping for more medals as second-seed Odunayo Adekuoroye begins her quest for an Olympic medal in the 57kg weight category at the ongoing games.\n\nAlso within the medal range is Chukwuebuka Enekwechi who will be competing in the men\u2019s Shot Put final.\n\nMore Money For Medallists\n\nMeanwhile, praises have been pouring in for Oborududu and Brume from various individuals and groups \u2013 including Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the government and people of Delta, I congratulate our daughter and Nigerian wrestler, Blessing Oborududu, for winning a silver medal in the ongoing Tokyo 2020 Olympics.\n\n\u201cDeltans and Nigerians are very proud of this great achievement,\u201d the governor said of the feat recorded by the wrestler.\n\nHe also commended Brume whom he said he called on Monday before her athletics event to bring home Nigeria\u2019s first medal at the Olympics.\n\n\u201cShe did! I am sure that I spoke on behalf of all Deltans and Nigerians when I said that we are all extremely proud of her for bringing home Nigeria\u2019s first Olympics track and field medal since 2008.\n\n\u201cWell done Ese!\u201d he concluded.\n\nAs a way to motivate the athletes, Nigerian authorities announced that medallists at the ongoing games would be paid triple of their prize money.\n\nA senior official of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, Simon Ebohdjaiye, explained that the move was to appreciate the impressive and historic performances put up by the athletes.\n\n\u201cGold medallist will now be rewarded with $15,000 while silver and bronze medal winners will each get $10,000 and S7,500 respectively,\u201d he said\n\n\u201cThe earlier award is $5,000 for gold, $3,000 for silver, and $2,000 for bronze. The gesture is to drive home the point that the Federal Government rewards superlative efforts.\u201d",

          "text": "US President Joe Biden joined leading Democrats Tuesday in calling on powerful New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to resign after an independent investigation concluded that he sexually harassed multiple women.\n\nCuomo, who drew praise nationwide for his early pandemic response, denied inappropriate conduct and resisted immediate calls to quit after the probe found he harassed current and former New York state employees.\n\nBut his position was looking increasingly untenable late Tuesday after Biden and House speaker Nancy Pelosi said the three-term governor should step down and state lawmakers moved to impeach him.\n\n\u201cI think he should resign,\u201d Biden told reporters in Washington.\n\nThe explosive report detailed allegations by 11 women that paint a \u201cdeeply disturbing yet clear\u201d picture of a pattern of abusive behavior by Cuomo and his senior staff, state Attorney General Letitia James said, announcing the findings.\n\nIt was not clear if the governor would face criminal prosecution, with James saying the investigation was \u201ccivil in nature,\u201d but US media reported that the district attorney\u2019s office in state capital Albany had opened an investigation.\n\nThe five-month investigation \u201cconcluded that Governor Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women and in doing so violated federal and state law,\u201d James told a news conference.\n\nShe said Cuomo engaged \u201cin unwelcome and non-consensual touching and making numerous comments of a suggestive sexual nature that created a hostile work environment for women.\u201d\n\nThe investigation also found that Cuomo and his senior team took retaliatory action against at least one former employee for coming forward with her story, she added.\n\nCuomo issued an unequivocal denial.\n\n\u201cI never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances,\u201d he said in a pre-recorded televised statement.\n\n\u201cI am 63 years old. I have lived my entire adult live in public view. That is just not who I am. And that\u2019s not who I have ever been.\u201d\n\nAnd he suggested that resignation was not on his mind, saying: \u201cWhat matters to me at the end of the day is getting the most done I can for you.\n\n\u201cAnd that is what I do every day. And I will not be distracted from that job. We have a lot to do.\u201d\n\nCuomo also published a response to every allegation made by the women against him on his website, adding: \u201cPlease take the time to read the facts and decide for yourself.\u201d\n\nDefending his actions, he included photos of prominent Americans, including Biden and ex-president Barack Obama, kissing and hugging people.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Climate of fear\u2019 \u2013\n\nOne former employee said Cuomo slipped his hand under her blouse last year, while a trooper on Cuomo\u2019s protective detail said he inappropriately touched her stomach and hip.\n\nHis conduct was \u201cnot just old fashioned affection and behavior as he and some of his staff would have it, but unlawful sex-based harassment,\u201d said Anne Clark, one of the lawyers heading the investigation.\n\nNone of the women welcomed his attentions, the other lawyer leading the probe, Joon Kim, said. \u201cAll of them found it disturbing, humiliating, uncomfortable and inappropriate.\u201d\n\nClark detailed one incident where Cuomo prepared a letter he wanted to release to the press attacking one of the alleged victims, though he was ultimately persuaded not to.\n\nAnd Kim said Cuomo and his staff fostered a \u201cclimate of fear\u201d that kept women from speaking out.\n\nThe investigators said that at least one report has been made to police about Cuomo\u2019s behavior, and that their findings could be used in any criminal investigations.\n\nThe women involved can also decide whether they want to sue Cuomo, they said.\n\n\u201cI am inspired by all the brave women who came forward. But more importantly, I believe them,\u201d said James.\n\nThe charismatic Cuomo, a moderate who still enjoys considerable support amongst voters, had hoped to go one better than his father Mario Cuomo by winning a fourth term in November 2022 elections.\n\nBut it looked increasingly likely that he could be forced out before then as state assembly speaker Carl Heastie announced that Cuomo had \u201clost the confidence\u201d of its Democratic majority and \u201ccan no longer remain in office.\u201d\n\nAFP",

          "title": "US President Biden Urges New York Governor Cuomo to Resign Over Sexual Harassment Accusations",
          "text": "An investigation found that Gov. Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed nearly a dozen women in and out of state government and worked to retaliate against one of his accusers, New York\u2019s attorney general announced Tuesday, hastening calls for the Democrat\u2019s resignation or impeachment.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was among those who said Cuomo should resign, a high-profile condemnation from a onetime close ally.\n\n\u201cI think he should resign,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday.\n\nThe governor remained defiant, saying in a taped response to the findings that \u201cthe facts are much different than what has been portrayed\u201d and that he \u201cnever touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances.\u201d\n\nThe nearly five-month investigation, led by two outside lawyers, concluded that 11 women who said that Cuomo had touched them inappropriately, commented on their appearance or made suggestive comments about their sex lives were telling the truth.\n\nThose accusers included an aide who said Cuomo groped her breast at the governor\u2019s mansion and a state trooper on his security detail, who said he ran his hand or fingers across her stomach and her back.\n\nAnne Clark, who led the probe with former U.S. Attorney Joon Kim, said the allegations were corroborated to varying degrees, including by other witnesses and contemporaneous text messages.\n\n\u201cThese interviews and pieces of evidence revealed a deeply disturbing yet clear picture: Gov. Cuomo sexually harassed current and former state employees in violation of federal and state laws,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James said at a press conference on Tuesday.\n\nMany of the women said they feared retaliation if they reported the governor\u2019s behavior, investigators said. On at least one occasion, the probe found, Cuomo\u2019s staff took action \u201cintended to discredit and disparage\u201d an accuser \u2014 Lindsey Boylan, the first former employee to publicly accuse him of wrongdoing \u2014 including leaking confidential personnel files and drafting a letter attacking her credibility.\n\nThe investigation\u2019s findings, detailed in a 165-page public report, turn up the pressure on the 63-year-old governor, who just a year ago was widely hailed for his steady leadership during the darkest days of the COVID-19 crisis, even writing a book about it.\n\nSince then, he\u2019s seen his standing crumble with a drumbeat of harassment allegations, questions in a separate, ongoing inquiry into whether state resources went into writing the book, and the discovery that his administration concealed the true number of nursing home deaths during the outbreak.\n\nThe revelations, most of which were initially made public last winter, led to a chorus of calls then for Cuomo\u2019s resignation from many top elected Democrats in New York. U.S. Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand said after the report\u2019s release Tuesday that it reinforces a call for his resignation they first made last March.\n\n\u201cNo elected official is above the law. The people of New York deserve better leadership in the governor\u2019s office. We continue to believe that the Governor should resign,\u201d they said in a joint statement.\n\nWhile James concluded the investigation without referring the case to prosecutors for possible criminal charges, local authorities could use its evidence and findings to mount their own cases. Albany District Attorney David Soares said he will be requesting material from James\u2019 office and welcomed victims to contact his office with information.\n\nThe investigation\u2019s findings are also expected to play an important role in an ongoing state Assembly inquiry into whether there are grounds to impeach Cuomo, who has been raising money for a potential fourth term in office. The Assembly hired its own legal team to investigate myriad allegations regarding harassment, his book, nursing homes and special access to COVID-19 testing.\n\nSeveral Cuomo accusers demanded swifter action, calling on the governor to leave office immediately. Some Democratic and Republican state lawmakers joined them, along with one-time Cuomo allies including county executives and leaders of left-leaning political groups.\n\nLt. Gov Kathy Hochul, who would succeed Cuomo is he is removed or resigns, called the behavior detailed in the report \u201crepulsive and unlawful behavior\u201d and said, \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d\n\nIn his taped response, Cuomo apologized to two accusers: Charlotte Bennett, who said the governor asked if she was open to sex with an older man after she confided in him that she had been a victim of sexual assault, and a woman he kissed at a wedding \u2014 an incident reported in a front-page story in The New York Times. Cuomo said he was hiring an expert to reform sexual harassment training for state employees, including the governor.\n\nBut he denied other allegations as fabricated and lashed out at the investigative process, saying it was rife with \u201cpolitics and bias.\u201d He explained that he\u2019s been physically embracing people his whole life, that his mother and father, former Gov. Mario Cuomo, had done the same and that the gesture was meant to \u201cconvey warmth.\u201d\n\nCuomo\u2019s lawyer issued a written rebuttal to the investigation\u2019s findings, arguing in most cases that serious allegations, like the alleged groping, didn\u2019t happen, or that his actions were misconstrued.\n\n\u201cFor those who are using this moment to score political points or seek publicity or personal gain. I say they actually discredit the legitimate sexual harassment victims that the law was designed to protect,\u201d Cuomo said.\n\nBennett called the governor\u2019s apology to her \u201cmeaningless.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he were sorry, he would step down. That\u2019s how accountability works,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he will resign. I think it\u2019s the speaker\u2019s job now to begin impeachment proceedings.\u201d\n\nThe report detailed, for the first time, allegations that Cuomo sexually harassed a female state trooper on his security detail. It said that in addition to touching the trooper, Cuomo kissed her on the cheek, asked for her help in finding a girlfriend and asked why she didn\u2019t wear a dress.\n\nMORE ON THE CUOMO INVESTIGATION NY law has long let officials use campaign funds for defense\n\nCuomo questions neutrality of AG investigators\n\nCuomo faces questioning, other fallout from harassment probe\n\nThe report also included an allegation from a woman who worked for an energy company who said Cuomo touched her chest at an event. The woman said Cuomo ran his fingers across the lettering on her shirt, reading the name of her company aloud. Then he leaned in and said: \u201cI\u2019m going to say I see a spider on your shoulder,\u201d and brushed his hand in between her shoulder and breasts, the report said.\n\n\u201cThese brave women stepped forward to speak truth to power and, in doing so, they expressed faith in the belief that although the governor may be powerful, the truth is even more so,\u201d Kim said at the press conference.\n\nCuomo faced multiple allegations last winter, starting with Boylan, who said Cuomo kissed her on the lips after a meeting in his office and \u201cwould go out of his way to touch me on my lower back, arms and legs.\u201d\n\nAfter Boylan went public, Cuomo\u2019s staff released personnel memos to the media revealing that she left the administration after being confronted about complaints she belittled and yelled at her staff. Boylan has said the leaked was \u201can effort to smear me.\u201d\n\nIn an 11-hour interview with investigators last month, Cuomo admitted to certain behavior while denying other allegations, investigators said. For example, Clark said, he conceded asking Bennett whether she had been involved with older men and said he may have kissed the state trooper at an event but denied touching her.\n\nAsked about an allegation that he grabbed a woman\u2019s breast at the executive mansion, according to the report, Cuomo responded: \u201cI would have to lose my mind to do such a thing\u201d to a woman he hardly knew with multiple staff members around.\n\nThe probe, which involved interviews with 179 people including the governor himself, also found that Cuomo\u2019s administration was a hostile work environment \u201crife with fear and intimidation.\u201d\n\nCuomo always denied inappropriate touching, but he initially said he was sorry if his behavior with women was \u201cmisinterpreted as unwanted flirtation.\u201d He got more combative in recent months, saying he did nothing wrong.\n\nHe has also questioned the neutrality of the lawyers leading the probe. Kim, was involved in previous investigations of corruption by people in Cuomo\u2019s administration.\n\nNew York state regulations say sexual harassment includes unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature \u2014 from unwanted flirtation to sexual jokes \u2014 that creates an offensive work environment, regardless of a perpetrator\u2019s intent.\n\nCuomo championed a landmark 2019 state law that made it easier for sexual harassment victims to prove their case in court. Alleged victims no longer have to meet the high bar of proving sexual harassment is \u201csevere and pervasive.\u201d",
