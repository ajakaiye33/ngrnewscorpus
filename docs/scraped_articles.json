          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nMaternal health experts have warned against not taking all necessary precautions before engaging in labour induction during child delivery, noting that the procedure can cause serious complications and fatality.\n\nThey also stressed that private health facilities without skilled birth attendants should not carry out a caesarean section or perform labour induction.\n\nAccording to the experts, labour induction is never an emergency procedure, noting that it can lead to maternal and neonatal deaths when poorly performed.\n\nThe maternal health experts stated that labour induction is usually planned and also done based on certain reasons and indications.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with PUNCH HealthWise, the gynaecologists warned traditional birth attendants and private hospitals without safe CS delivery facilities to desist from carrying out labour induction.\n\nOne of the experts, a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi-Araba, Dr. Babasola Okusanya, says labour induction is not what anybody can do.\n\nOkusanya explained, \u201cThere are indications for labour induction. The most common indication is for a prolonged pregnancy. Other indications could be hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, intrauterine growth restriction and diabetes mellitus in pregnancy.\n\n\u201cInduction of labour has reasons and when the reasons have been met, it is usually planned. It is never an emergency procedure. The main reason for labour induction is to achieve vaginal delivery.\n\n\u201cBefore you start it, you must be sure that there is nothing in that woman that will prevent her from delivering vaginally. You must make sure that the baby is lying straight and not lying across the woman\u2019s abdomen. You must make sure that nothing is blocking the birth canal. You must be sure that the baby is of normal size.\u201d\n\nThe gynaecologist noted that labour induction should not be performed on pregnant women with big babies, warning that it could lead to the rupture of the uterus.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t do induction on a woman whose baby has been assessed to be very big and may not be able to pass through the birth canal of the woman.\n\n\u201cIn any place where labour induction should be done, that facility should be able to perform safe caesarean delivery. While we hope and plan that induction of labour will succeed, there are instances where you have to have a very good and quick recourse to CS.\n\n\u201cFor instance, all has been well with the baby while induction of labour has started, then the foetal heart rate of the baby shows that the baby cannot tolerate the induction anymore, you have to go for CS. Again, maybe you have started the induction and the woman is bleeding, you have to go for CS\u201d, he said.\n\nOkusanya urged pregnant women not to put their lives and the lives of their unborn babies at risk by patronising health facilities without skilled birth attendants and by allowing themselves to be induced by quacks.\n\nThe gynaecologist cautioned, \u201cTBAs should not even think of labour induction. Private health facilities that don\u2019t have skilled birth attendants and cannot do CS should not induce labour. Women should patronise qualified hospitals where they can get quality care. If labour induction is poorly managed, it can lead to maternal and neonatal deaths.\u201d\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, induction of labour is the process of artificially stimulating the uterus to start labour. It is usually performed by administering oxytocin or prostaglandins to the pregnant woman or by manually rupturing the amniotic membranes.\n\nWHO says induction of labour should be performed only when there is a clear medical indication for it and the expected benefits outweigh its potential harms.\n\nThe United Nations health agency recommends induction of labour for women who are known with certainty to have reached 41 weeks of gestation.\n\n\u201cInduction of labour should be performed with caution since the procedure carries the risk of uterine hyperstimulation and rupture and foetal distress. Wherever induction of labour is carried out, facilities should be available for assessing maternal and foetal well-being.\n\n\u201cFailed induction of labour does not necessarily indicate caesarean section. Wherever possible, induction of labour should be carried out in facilities where caesarean section can be performed\u201d, WHO says.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says sometimes, labour induction does not work.\n\n\u201cA failed attempt at induction may mean that you will need to try another induction or have a caesarean delivery. The chance of having a caesarean delivery is greatly increased for first-time mothers who have labour induction, especially if the cervix is not ready for labour.\n\n\u201cThere are risks associated with labour induction. With some methods, the uterus can be overstimulated, causing it to contract too frequently. Too many contractions may lead to changes in the foetal heart rate, umbilical cord problems, and other problems,\u201d ACOG says.\n\nAlso speaking, another Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at LUTH, Dr. Ephraim Ohazurike, says labour that is being induced is high risk and should be managed by experts.\n\n\u201cThe commonest risk that we see around here is the rupture of the uterus. The baby can die. Injudicious use of drugs for induction can cause rupture of the uterus and the woman can die from it.\n\n\u201cLabour that is being induced is high risk. It is not even a labour that you do without the presence of a gynaecologist or an obstetrician because it is a high risk labour. Once you start inducing labour, that labour can go in any direction.\n\n\u201cSo, it is something that an obstetrician should do or somebody who is skilled in CS and all kinds of surgeries so that when an issue comes up, it can be effectively handled. Labour induction is not something you do where there is no obstetrician\u201d, Ohazurike said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "Adeoye Oyewole\n\nSexual assault is an act of violence that is by definition against the victim\u2019s will. The victim is forced to submit to genital, oral and/or anal sexual acts and often due to aggression, abuse and degradation.\n\nThe attacker controls the situation by the use of physical force, threats of harm and intimidation. The victim fears she is going to be killed or injured and feels that survival is dependent on compliance and submission to the offender\u2019s demands.\n\nSexual assault is an emotionally charged issue with medical, social, political and legal undertones. Many definitions abound depending on the circumstance and context of the assault.\n\nThe terms childhood sexual abuse and adulthood sexual violence are based on definitions developed by the American Medical Association (1992); childhood sexual abuse consists of contact abuse ranging from fondling to rape and non-contact abuse; such as modeling inappropriate sexual behavior, forced involvement in child pornography or indiscriminate exposure of the genitals.\n\nAdulthood sexual violence includes contact and non-contact acts performed without the survivors\u2019 consent.\n\nSexual violence is defined as completed or attempted contact between the penis and the vulva or the penis and the anus involving contraction; contact between the mouth and the penis, vulva or anus; penetration of the anus or genital opening; and intentional touching of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh or buttocks.\n\nNon-contact acts include indecent exposure of the genitalia, verbal and behavioral sexual harassment. These acts are considered sexual violence if they are non-consensual or committed against someone unable to provide consent.\n\nThere are many different terms for sexual violence but I prefer sexual trauma which refers to one or multiple sexual violations that invoke significant mental distress.\n\nThis term is recommended and used by many clinicians and advocates in response to the observation that some victims do not label their experiences as assault due to the familiarity with the perpetrator or the absence of force. The sexual trauma designation is apt because it considers the infringement of the victim\u2019s psychological space and its consequences.\n\nThis paradigm broadens the scope of the definition of sexual assault as it interrogates the impact on the psyche much beyond the physical observable dramas. It is in this context that rape is deemed possible within the context of marriage.\n\nThe object of concern here is consent which definitely must have been involved at the inception of the marital relationship as a statutory requirement but equally crucial in the dynamic living out of the contracted relationship.\n\nConsent in the context of mental health and possibly in the eye of the law must be dynamic since it provides the psychological visa for a partner to explore the body of the giver within a consensual framework that insulates the partner from mental distress.\n\nThis paradigm overrules a lot of our draconian, primitive, cultural and religious values as it guarantees mental wellbeing. Sexual assault is not only a physical experience but has concomitant psychological consequences.\n\nSurvivals of childhood sexual trauma are at high risk of post-traumatic stress disorder characterised by intense fear, helplessness, horror, reoccurring recollections or dreams of the event, persistent avoidance of all things associated with the trauma, lack of responsiveness and increased alertness to perceived threats. They are also more likely to suffer depression, suicide, drug abuse and eating disorders.\n\nAdult survivors of childhood sexual abuse report problems with low sexual interest and few close relationships. In other cases, some survivors display high-risk sexual behaviors (e.g. promiscuity) that may be attributed in part to modeling some of the behaviors shaped earlier in life by the perpetrator. Such folks adopt maladaptive coping mechanisms to induce changes in consciousness and memory; producing perceptions that one is living in a dream or a movie.\n\nThese experiences are capable of impairing abilities to work or socialise. Extreme experiences of victimization are also associated with symptoms of borderline personality disorder characterized by enduring patterns of instability in relationships, goals, values and mood; non-fatal suicidal behavior and suicidal threats and other harmful impulsive behaviors.\n\nOther forms of personality disorders may be distinguished by enduring patterns of suspiciousness, grandiosity and morbid craving for admiration, social inhibition and feelings of inadequacy or submissive and clingy behavior. Victims of adult sexual trauma are vulnerable to immediate distress, fear, anxiety and confusion.\n\nThey also experience emotional detachment, flashbacks and sleeping problems. Some develop depressive illness, physical symptoms without medical conditions, severe preoccupations with physical appearances, sexual dysfunction and extreme body piercing and tattooing. Some may have deliberate self-harm and abuse illicit drugs.\n\nParents, mental health workers, nongovernmental organizations and other stakeholders should provide platforms for the referral and care of victims as we encourage disclosures reduce stigma and raise awareness of available interventions for victims. Parents also must be vigilant to protect children from sexual victimisation.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, HMSPR, Chief Timipre Sylva by a self-acclaimed group, calling for the withdrawal of the nomination of Dr Samuel Ogbuku for the position of Managing Director of the NDDC, as \u201chighly vexatious and insultive to the people of Bayelsa East Senatorial District.\u201d\n\nReacting to the ultimatum issued by Chief Preye Olomu, of the Niger Delta Oil and Gas Producing Communities, NDOGPC, Chief Egba-Ologo, said: \u201cIt is very unfortunate that some people have mastered the art of constantly working hard to divide our people instead of seeing such situations as opportunities for unity amongst us.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the people of Bayelsa East Senatorial District have been oppressed, marginalised and disrespected for too long by the powers that be in the State despite their significant contributions to the revenues and physical growth of the State.\n\nChief Egba-Ologo warned against the ugly trend, stating that if allowed to continue, the actions of such individuals and groups would destroy the string of unity and brotherhood that bind Bayelsa people together.\n\nHis words: \u201cQuite a number of people in Bayelsa State have become so used to the idea of relegating Bayelsa East Senatorial District to the background, in the scheme of things in the State, that if anything good comes to the area, they automatically become hostile and seek all possible avenues to destroy it.\n\n\u201cIt is very wrong for the group to accuse Chief Timipre Sylva of nominating only people from Bayelsa East into federal appointments, no other political leader from Bayelsa State has fixed people from other parts of the State in federal positions more that the HMSPR and the facts are available for anybody to cross-check.\u201d\n\nDescribing the former Bayelsa Governor, as a man that believes and practices justice and equity, Chief Egba-Ologo said, the nomination of Chief Samuel Ogbuku to head the NDDC was designed to correct the long standing injustice against the Bayelsa East Senatorial District, from which nobody has ever been appointed to represent the State, in any Executive position in the Commission since its creation.\n\nHe commended the choice of Dr Samuel Ogbuku who is from Ogbia Local Govt area, where oil was first struck in commercial quantities in 1956, Chief Egba said the nominee is eminently qualified both academically and in experience, based on his many years as student leader, an Ijaw youth activist, as well Chief of Staff at Bayelsa State Government House and SA to the Deputy Senate President.\n\nThe former Commissioner who called on the Petroleum Minister, Chief Timipre Sylva to remain firm and focused on nominating people of the State into federal positions based on qualifications and need for balance, also advised Bayelsans to continue to give the leaders all necessary support to enable them work for the growth and development of the State.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "\n\n\n\nNestoil\n\nBy Elizabeth Adegbesan\n\nChief Executive Officers (CEOs) across Africa are anticipating increase in taxes caused by government efforts to address rising public debts.\n\nThe above is one of the highlights of the PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Africa Business Agenda 2021 Report which also indicate that the rising trend in government debts across Africa could trigger tax aggression, increases in tax rates or introduction of new taxes.\n\n\n\nREAD ALSOFIRS introduces online naira tax-filing platforms\n\nSpeaking at the virtual media presentation of the report, Taiwo Oyedele, Fiscal Policy Partner & PwC Africa Tax Leader, said: \u201cPlummeting government revenues and fragile economic growth are fuelling an increase in government debt across Africa. This could result in tax aggression by government, increases in tax rates or introduction of new taxes. These could include, for example, digital taxes on platform-based companies that have profited during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cSolving the government revenue challenge will require making tough but informed decisions, which should include stopping wastage in government spending, rationalisation of incentives and subsidies, and boosting tax morale through accountability and transparency. Undue aggression against businesses and new or higher taxes will harm economic recovery and discourage investments.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Oyedele, \u201cIn the wake of the pandemic and its impact on government revenues in African economies, it is no surprise that tax policy uncertainty made a notable rise on the list of threats. In Africa, it is ranked third, up from seventh last year.\n\n\u201cChief Executive Officers (CEOs) are undoubtedly watching debts accumulate as governments intervene with stimulus packages, and realise that the public will expect businesses to pay their fair share. In Africa, 56 per cent of CEOs are already factoring increasing tax obligations into their strategic risk management activities.\u201d\n\nThe Africa Business Agenda which draws on the results of PwC\u2019s 24th Annual Global CEO Survey showed that 68 percent of CEOs in Africa believe global economic growth will improve in 2021 (Global: 76 percent).\n\nIt stated: \u201c56 percent of CEOs in Africa are extremely concerned about tax policy uncertainty (Global: 31 percent).\n\n\u201c54 percent of CEOs on the continent are extremely concerned about cyber-security, up significantly from 38 percent last year.\n\n\u201c74 percent of CEOs are concerned about supply chain disruption and trade conflicts, less so about protectionism (Global: 62 percent) and 44 percent of CEOs in Africa are changing their workforce strategy to improve competitiveness.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the report, Uyi Akpata, Regional Senior Partner PwC West Africa, advised CEOs to re-imagine every aspect of their operating model.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the light of the concerns that Africa\u2019s CEOs have on policy uncertainty, tax policy uncertainty, cyber threats, and over-regulation, this is an opportunity for African business leaders to re-imagine every aspect of their operating model.\n\n\u201cFurther, companies and countries in West Africa should take advantage of the Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement, which came into force on January 1st 2021, to drive growth and bolster their economies through increased continental trade.\u201d",

          "text": "Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has come under serious bashing on social media immediately after saying he took photos of his projects to President Muhammadu Buhari at the Aso Rock Villa in Abuja.\n\nNigerians, especially Ogun residents, have expressed their displeasure with the action of Gov Abiodun as they describe it as unnecessary.\n\nFollowers, who commented under the governor\u2019s post on his Facebook page, queried if he is accountable to President Buhari or the people of the state, who elected him into office.\n\nAbiodun had said he was on a working visit to the President, saying he also showed Buhari the level of work done on a number of projects in the state.\n\nDAILY POST reports that this is Abiodun\u2019s second time taking photos to Buhari in Aso Rock.\n\nThis time, hundreds of comments under the governor\u2019s post suggested that many are not happy with the development.\n\nSee their comments:\n\nAhmed Oyewole: \u201cVery disgraceful! Can\u2019t believe this.Your colleagues do call the President to commission projects for God sake, not paper work achievement. You followed the same Buhari to commission projects in Lagos. He should have branched in Ogun State to do the same, not you carrying paper to Abuja. In fact, I am short of words.\u201d\n\nOladimeji Tosin: \u201cYou can deceive him, but you can\u2019t deceive those of us staying here in Ogun State. Your performance is very poor. You have no zeal to lead. Everyone in Ogun township never prays for you but always curses. I will implore you to change and prove to the people of Ogun State that you are capable. No good road network in Ogun State. Do something!\u201d\n\nOmileye Sunday: \u201cThe body language of the president, the way he was looking at the pictures said it all. To me, k just be focused on service delivery and forget about Abuja.\u201d\n\nOgun: Abiodun takes photos of his achievements to Buhari in Abuja\n\nAbdulAziz Oluwasesan: \u201cSo Mr governor, is it Buhari you are accountable to? Honestly, DA, you don\u2019t even need to tell Mr president your achievements, rather you can show it to the APC as a party to measure it with your manifesto you submitted during the campaign.\u201d\n\nAyorinde Oladiran: \u201cSir because you wanted to show someone your achievements, you had to travel down to see him? This is a complete waste of resources. You are not accountable to that grandpa but Ogun people who voted you into power. That grandpa doesn\u2019t care, the earlier you know this the better.\u201d\n\nLijofi Oluwole: \u201cMr governor sir, you said you\u2019re showing the President your achievements so far, but no one apart from the President is there to see if you\u2019re lying or not. Stop playing to the gallery, let your people do the appraisal. Till now, the one Sanwo-Olu showed him after EndSARS didn\u2019t see anything that came out.\u201d\n\nLawal Akinwunmi: \u201cOgun people should probably watch out for Tunji Egbetokun as their next governor. I think the real reason for Mr Governor\u2019s visit to Abuja is to introduce him to the president. Other things contained in the write up are just cover up.\u201d\n\nTaiwo Columbus: \u201cMr governor, I am very sorry sir, you have not impressed us. Please learn from Sanwo-Olu in Lagos. Stop all these ceremonial shows. Let your work speak for you, time is flying. The whole of Ijebu is in a mess, no good road. Remember this Yoruba adage, \u2018Ile labo isi mi oko, oro di e to fun omoluwabi\u2019.\u201d\n\nOluwatoyin Adepegba: \u201cAfter watching Mr president\u2019s interview on Arise TV, I don\u2019t see why anybody will still come and meet him for anything concerning his state.\u201d\n\nNofiu Ibrahim: \u201cWhile people in Ijoko, Sango-Ota, Ota, Abule Iroko, Agbado, Lambe, Matogun, Adiyan, Akute are living in a state of chronic hopelessness, our Governor is in Abuja showcasing his \u2018acheivements\u2019 to the President. O God of mercy.\u201d\n\nPatrick Odiaka: \u201cYou should be very ashamed of yourself. He didn\u2019t elect as a governor, unless you\u2019re telling Ogun state people you are not answerable, owe no loyalty or not to their governor. You\u2019ve sold Ogun people out.\u201d\n\nAlabi-Ariyibi Samuel: \u201cWhat do you expect from an emergency governor? He doesn\u2019t want to bite the finger that feeds him, and he knows they have the power to do and undo; and he is competing with Amosun for Buhari\u2019s trust. Good luck, our governor.\u201d\n\nDele Ali: \u201cYou should also intimate him about the state of Agbado Ijoko road. Mr President will be so proud of you sir.\u201d\n\nBabarinde Oyewole: \u201cPhoto speaks, as you can see Mr Governor, Buhari is just looking at it for looking sake. He is not even paying a serious attention to you and he is less concerned about what you brought to him.\u201d\n\nSegun Erinoso: \u201cWhy are you reporting to the President, sir? Is he the one that elected you? PMB doesn\u2019t appreciate eye service.\u201d\n\nAdejoke Akinleye: \u201cHaaaaaaa, my able Governor, why can\u2019t you show the whole world Alagbole, Ojodu Abiodun, Agbado to Sango Ijoko roads? The Olusegun Osoba to Toyin Ishaga road that your contractor was working on since April, we have not seen any tangible work done on this road since. Just one heavy rain last week, everybody on that axis was looking for where to pass before you can link Toyin Ishaga road. People living in this area, are they not human beings that you are treating them like this? Please find time to come to these areas and see for yourself what people are going through.\u201d\n\nAdams Bello: \u201cI don\u2019t know the motive behind the governor going to Ask Rock at any little move he makes while many things are demanding for his attention in his state. I can\u2019t imagine any other governor lobbying Aso Rock like that. Little wonder, Mr president said two governors from South West approached him on security challenges in their states when they appeared unaccountable to the people of their states who voted them in. Go round and see the deplorable roads that would have been better done by the local government if given the autonomy. They appeared to be friends but they are the greatest enemies.\u201d\n\nBaba Tee: \u201cHe (Buhari) will later tell the world that he pursued one SW Gov who came to show him pix, just like he did to Sanwo-Olu during Endsars era. Una no get sense kawai.\u201d\n\nBiyi Ogunfidodo: \u201cNothing can shock me again in this country. When you think you have seen enough, you will see another dimension of craziness. What do we call this one now, is it a case of a student taking his homework for the teacher to mark?\u201d\n\nGeneral Bazo: \u201cDear Nigerian governors, stop visiting Buhari to showcase your achievements, it adds nothing rather than a request of infrastructure development to be scattered across your state. This makes totally no sense.\u201d\n\nEric Oke chukwu: \u201cIncompetent governor, did Katsina governor take album to Buhari to see what he has done or achieved?\u201d",

If truly democracy is the government of the people, by the people and for the people, as such the people must be allowed to have a say. They must be part of the decision over their own destiny.\n\n\u201cLet there be a referendum. I don\u2019t see a sovereign national conference coming into reality now but if we want a constitutional reform, let us conduct a plebiscite and decide how we want to be run. It will bring down tensions and the agitations of secessionists will be reduced,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the June 12 Democracy Day celebration, he explained that it was a procession and not a protest.\n\nAdebisi regretted that security agencies and the government were confused as to distinguish between a rally and a protest.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cthe situation on Saturday, June 12 was a reminder of the military era. Regrettably, the government too is living in fear. They did not encourage the people to come out. People only came out when they observed how peaceful the procession was.\u201d\n\nWhile differentiating between June 12 and EndSARS protests, Adebisi noted that the former is for the attainment of democracy and the presidential recognition given to M. K. O. Abiola.\n\nHe was quick to add that the resultant effects of the June 12th, 1993 election annulment is yet to be healed.",

This is a commendable effort by President Buhari.\n\n\u201cWith this now, there is light at the end of the tunnel because if the materials and necessary military hardware and equipment are immediately purchased, and handed over to the military, I am sure that the Nigerian Army who are known for their gallantry in international assignments will be able to do more to defend the internal security challenges confronting Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe All Progressives Congress (APC) senator (Borno South), commended Buhari on his Democracy Day broadcast, saying Nigerians had been eager and worried over his continued silence on critical national issues in recent times.\n\nHe congratulated Nigerians on the commemoration of the June 12 Democracy Day, and urged the President to continue to update Nigerians on issues of national importance on quarterly basis.\n\nNdume said: \u201cI commend the President, Muhammadu Buhari, for his decision to be speaking out to Nigerians because the people have been eager and worried over his continued silence on critical national issues in recent times.\n\n\u201cMany Nigerians are now happy that their President has started talking to them once again. I therefore encourage him to be doing that intermittently, if possible, on quarterly basis.\u201d\n\nHe urged the Federal Government to spend borrowed money on critical infrastructure and possibly agriculture and not on payment of salaries and other recurrent expenditure.\n\nThe senator said: \u201cConcerning the issue of foreign borrowings, the problem is not about borrowing because the idea is not bad. Even developed nations also do the same thing.\n\n\u201cIt is what the government do with the money that is important. The concentration on infrastructure development by the Buhari administration, especially in the area of railway and roads is commendable.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government should look at the possibility of borrowing for agricultural development so that our people will move from subsistence farming to a mechanised one.\n\n\u201cIf that is achieved, it will generate employment and guarantee food security. Also, there would be no need for Nigeria to spend foreign exchange on food importation.\n\n\u201cWe can produce all types of food in Nigeria only if the farmers are well funded. The borrowings should be spent on purchase of farm implements and other farming machinery and make it available to farmers.\n\n\u201cThe external loans should also be used to fund moribund industries especially textile and spare part manufacturing among others.\n\n\u201cIt is only through that the government can guarantee borrowings because the manufacturing industries will come up again through the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe government can serve as a guarantor for the loans so that MAN would coordinate the process of rescucitating the moribund industries that had been closed down.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe loans should be borrowed from the international lending agencies whose terms are very good in order to develop our road infrastructure and mount toll plazas in order to generate revenue to pay back the loans.\n\n\u201dBorrowings should not be made to defray recurrent expenditure like payment of salaries. Funding for such purposes should be sourced locally from taxes and other internally generated revenues.\u201d",

          "title": "Uproar over plan to reopen grazing route",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu Noah Ebije, Kaduna and Paul Osuyi, Asaba\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s pronouncement last week that his administration would reinstate cattle routes and grazing areas across the country to ensure herders have free access for their animals have continued to generate flaks\n\nIn apparent response to the ban on open cattle grazing by the 17 Southern governors, the president said when the governors gave the directive that open grazing would be banned, he referred them to the gazette that makes provisions for cattle routes and open grazing areas. He then said he has resolved to revive those routes and grazing areas in the country to resolve the issue.\n\n\u201cWhat I told the governors was to ask them to go and dig up the gazette. There are certain routes and grazing areas so that when cattle rearers were moving from the north to the west, they were allowed to go through there. But if you allow your cattle to stray into any farmer\u2019s farm, you are arrested and the farmer is invited to submit his claims. Those who encroach on these cattle routes and grazing areas would be dispossessed.\u201d\n\nHowever, in separate reactions, Arewa, Igbo and Yoruba groups roundly condemned the statement saying the move rather than resolve the issue would exacerbate it.\n\nAs far as the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) is concerned, reactivating open grazing routes may cause legal and security problems.\n\nSpokesman forf the group, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, in a telephone interview, reminded the president that the 1999 Constitution gives state governors powers cover land and to even revoke federal land.\n\n\u201cThe reactivation of open grazing routes in southern part or any other parts of the country is problematic both in legal terms and security. I would have said the best way to go is for us to seek legal interpretation beyond the Office of the Attorney General. The Federal Government can actually sue governors that ban open grazing and the court will rule whether they are right or wrong.\n\n\u201cI will reserve final judgment on the president\u2019s position. We caution that there is more to open grazing than availability of land and routes. It is not about opening the grazing routes, it is also about the security of the cattle and herders, and getting the support of communities that they will go through. Our open grazing requires political will. The Federal Government has already adopted the National Livestock Transformation programme to equip the Fulani. We, in the North, are in favour of ban of open grazing but we want it to be done in phases, in an orderly manner that does not harm the cattle and the Fulani. We also support the active intervention of the Federal Government, the northern governors and everybody to make sure that in the next one year or two, open grazing is abolished completely. I think this is the way to go.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Association of South East Town Unions (ASETU) in collaboration with other respected Igbo groups, including Nzuko Umunna, Aka Ikenga, Igbo World Assembly (IWA), World Igbo Congress (WIC), Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), Ekwe Nche, European Igbo Communities, Igbo Board of Deputies, Council of Igbo States in America, Nkata Ndi Inyom Igbo and South East Community Youth Leaders, rose from a one-day emergency security meeting with a vow to resist open grazing in the region.\n\nThe coalition warned that governors in the zone who fail to implement the ban would be treated as foes.\n\nNational President, ASETU, Chief Emeka Diwe who made their position known, said the meeting totally condemned the continued attacks by killer herdsmen in Igbo communities and urged governors to rise to the occasion and protect their people.\n\nStressing that the primary purpose of political governance was the security of lives and property, the Igbo groups charged governors who had not kick-started the processes of enacting anti-open grazing laws, to as a matter of urgency, send Executive Bills to their respective Houses of Assembly.\n\n\u201cOur position is very clear, which is the stand of Ndigbo; we say no to open grazing and are not making any pretences about that. We insist that any cattle in the South East must be ranched. So, we urge all nomadic herders to leave our land. We also urge our governors to do everything possible to implement the ban on open grazing. In fact, Ndigbo will treat any governor who fails to carry out this heartfelt desire and demand as an enemy. We equally urge each state to have forest guards with legal backing to ensure that our forests do not harbour terrorists and criminals,\u201d Diwe said.\n\nThe groups regretted that President Muhammadu Buhari who had never spoken strongly against the atrocities of Fulani herdsmen and bandits was threatening to visit another festival of blood on the Igbo.\n\nADF recalled that it had been in the forefront of the agitation for the banning of open grazing in Igboland since 2015, hence its insistence on the enactment of anti-open grazing laws as the most potent strategy to prevent armed Fulani herdsmen from overrunning the Southern states.\n\nIts spokesman, Abia Onyike, said the law to be passed in the State Houses of Assembly should be accompanied by clear modalities, instrumentalities and machineries for their enforcement. He added that the effectiveness of this move depended on the synergy between the governors, the legislators and the people, including the civil society organisations.\n\nSimilarly, the pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, said the president\u2019s pronouncements fell far short of what was expectation.\n\n\u201cWe have some questions for Mr. President and the Attorney General in this respect. One, who created the so-called grazing routes? At what time in our history did our founding fathers gather to designate specific routes from the north to the south as \u2018grazing routes\u2019? Two, assuming without conceding, that there were so-called grazing routes, what would now happen to structures that have been built in areas where the so-called routes are to be re-opened? Would such structures, including residences and factories be pulled down so that cows would have places to graze? Compared to what would be lost economically, socially, politically and in security terms if these structures are to be pulled down, is it not better to encourage the building of ranches? We can go on and on.\u201d\n\nAfenifere claimed President\u2019s pronouncement on open grazing and his confession on how he determines who occupy positions at the national level seems to indicate that Buhari\u2019s government is operating a constitution that is different from the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Section 2 of the Land Use Act, the law governing land matters in the country, vests the administration and control of lands in a given state in the hands of the governor of the state. It is such that even when the Federal Government wants to use a portion of land, it has to seek the consent of the governor of the state concerned. Since most governors in the country have outlawed open grazing in their respective states, on which land does the Federal Government want to \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018re-open\u2019 its vaunted grazing routes? Why talking of grazing routes in this age when ranching is the fad in all civilised climes?\u201d\n\nThe group claimed President Buhari seems to derive pleasure in shifting blames and responsibilities when pressed on what his government ought to do.\n\nUnknown persons threaten mayhem in Delta\n\nMeanwhile, unknown persons, yesterday, raised the tension in Delta State as they threatened to attack Asaba, the state capital, and Agbor, if Governor Ifeanyi Okowa does not withdraw his support for the ban on open grazing within 72 hours.\n\nAn unsigned letter containing the threat was pasted in strategic locations in Asaba including the fence of the Living Faith Church (Winners Chapel) at Infant Jesus Road.\n\nThe letter titled \u2018Fulani Jihadist Warning: An Open Message of 2 Paragraphs to Delta State\u2019 dated June 13, 2021 warned that \u201cfailure to adhere to this demand for been the host of the 17 governors, Delta State, most likely the city of Asaba and Agbor, shall encounter severe consequences than that of Bornu, Kebbi, Kastina, Kaduna, Enugu, Benue, Oyo and many more that will not respect the Fulani\u2019s heritage, as we take responsibility for the detonate explosive uncovered in the state capital secretariat, which should serve as warning to the Delta State Government for what is to come, should the governor fail to abide to our demand.\u201d",
          "summary": "As far as the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) is concerned, reactivating open grazing routes may cause legal and security problems.\n\u201cThe reactivation of open grazing routes in southern part or any other parts of the country is problematic both in legal terms and security.\nThe Federal Government can actually sue governors that ban open grazing and the court will rule whether they are right or wrong.\nAt what time in our history did our founding fathers gather to designate specific routes from the north to the south as \u2018grazing routes\u2019?\nSince most governors in the country have outlawed open grazing in their respective states, on which land does the Federal Government want to \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018re-open\u2019 its vaunted grazing routes?",

          "text": "From Agaju Madugba, Katsina\n\nKatsina Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has faulted President Muhammadu Buhari on reasons for worsening insecurity in the country.\n\nThe president had during a television interview last week attributed the menace to failure of states and local governments across the country to manage security issues in their respective domains.\n\nBut citing Constitutional provisions, Masari said it was wrong for anybody to blame states and local governments.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the Federal Government to ensure protection of lives and property of citizens in all nooks and cranny of the country. When you look at the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the issue of security is under the Exclusive List. So, it is the responsibility of the Federal Government and states can only complement and that\u2019s what we have always done and are still doing.\n\n\u201cFrom the local governments, we assist the police, the DSS, the NSDC. There may be states that do not complement efforts of the security agencies and perhaps those are the states that the president was referring to.\n\n\u201cBut sincerely speaking, based on provisions of the Constitution, the blame should go to the Federal Government for the general state of insecurity in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMasari said he was 100 per cent in support of the clamour for restructuring and devolution of more powers to states which should also entail enhanced revenue to the tiers of government to enable them adequately perform their constitutional roles.\n\nAccording to him, the establishment of a state police would enhance general security as the personnel will be expected to perform their defined roles without infringing on duties of the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cThe issue of a state police is part of what we are talking about and I am for it. All we need to do is to formalise activities of the vigilance groups and community policing and give them clear definitions on their limits and those of the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cWe have the Nigerian police and the NSDC that we currently support their operations and nothing stops a state police from coexisting side by side with the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cThe issue of security is actually the responsibility of everybody as we all have roles to play. It\u2019s not about the president or the governor or local government chairman or a legislator or minister.\n\n\u201cThese bandits and their informants have addresses. They live within the communities and the people know them and security has no colorations in terms of political party affiliations or religion.\n\n\u201cI am also 100 per cent for restructuring and devolution of powers or whatever you call it. If you devolve, states and local governments will have more financial independence. We should earn resources according to the size and economy of our states.\n\n\u201cDuring the First Republic, Emir of Kano was the highest paid because of the state\u2019s revenue base. What we have today as Katsina State was a province made up of Katsina and Daura emirates. They ran their civil service and police and prisons and judiciary then were under the Native Authority and they did well.\n\n\u201cThey built and managed schools. If it was done successfully then, who says it cannot be done today? We ought to take another look at the Constitution. With the right leadership and proper arrangement, these things are still possible.\n\n\u201cThere are some federal ministries with so many parastatals under each one. How can one person as minister provide effective oversight for these parastatals?\n\n\u201cWe should devolve more power to the states but in such a way that we don\u2019t have to weaken the authority of the Federal Government in terms of performing its constitutional responsibilities.\u201d",

Lukman, in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nThe former Edo governor said the earlier the APC-led government addressed the escalating agitations, the better to diffuse the kind of stresses the nation is passing through.\n\n\u201cLet me refer to just one aspect of what Governor Atiku Bagudu said. That is the document on true federalism which the party put together that passed through all the organs of the party. The executive of the party, the NWC, the Caucus, the NEC which is the highest organ of the party.\n\n\u201cWhy did we do it at that time? We did it because like, it is happening today, there was this cacophony of voices. Two people in the party could not agree on what they meant by restructuring. So, the party needed to take control of the debate, define the issues, proffer solutions and went so far as to have some drafts legislation. It is not by any chance a perfect document.\n\n\u201cBut it reflects then the thinking and the desires of the Nigerian people. Everybody kept quiet after we brought that document out, publicised it, held press conferences over it and most Nigerians were very, very happy. But once again, we did not make the kind of progress that we could have made and it has become once more, the topical subject in the Nigerian polity.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it has gone beyond us, we now have one or two things that did not happen before, people now wanting to disengage from the federation, which did not happen before and that is a warning sign. If a child ask for garri today you don\u2019t give him, tomorrow he may decide it\u2019s cake he wants and we must not, as political party, we must not as the government of the federation, give the impression that only military governments can fundamentally tamper with the basic structure of this nation.\u201d",

          "title": "Report: $15bn Investments Lost Annually to Non-passage of PIB",
          "text": "\u2022OPEC: Nigeria\u2019s oil production hit record low in May\n\nBy Emmanuel Addeh\n\nA new report by Financial Derivatives Company Limited (FDC) has indicated that Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry loses as much as $15 billion in investments annually due to the delayed passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), currently before the National Assembly.\n\nThe bill, which seeks to overhaul the oil and gas industry and offer new fiscal incentives to investors, according to the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, and Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Lawan, is set to be passed this month.\n\nHowever, FDC in its latest bi-monthly publication stated that even if the PIB is passed today, the country has already lost investment opportunities due to the lack of urgency attached to the passage of the legislation which was first transmitted to the lawmakers over 14 years ago.\n\n\u201cIts delay has sparked a great deal of uncertainty and led to an estimated loss of over $15 billion annually in lost investments to Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry. With the global shift from fossil fuels to renewable forms of energy picking up pace, the passage of the PIB may just be too little, too late,\u201d the FDC report added.\n\nIt said it was unlikely that Nigeria would be able to make up for either the lost time or the lost investment, adding that information available to it suggests that the bill is currently undergoing last-minute modifications in three key areas to enhance its effectiveness.\n\nIt listed the areas as the deregulation of the price of gas supplied to power plants, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation\u2019s (NNPC\u2019s) public offer and the adoption of a single regulator for the industry.\n\nAccording to the report, price deregulation of gas supplied to power plants is a key ingredient in incentivising power output in Nigeria.\n\nHe added that while this is likely to translate to increased tariffs for electricity, it is needed to attract investment in both the gas and electricity generating industry.\n\nOn the NNPC\u2019s public offer, it stated that selling shares to the public will mean that the corporation will be able to source its own funding and come under a higher level of corporate governance and scrutiny.\n\nBesides, it said while the adoption of a single regulator would ensure more efficiency and allow for enhanced cohesion in regulating the entire industry value chain, the PIB as currently constructed, recommended two regulators-one for the upstream and another for the midstream and downstream sectors.\n\nFDC said it envisaged a situation where the PIB could also become a source of acrimony as it gives legal backing to the complete price deregulation of the downstream segment of the oil and gas industry.\n\nIt said: \u201cThe Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), made up of the governors of the 36 states, has proposed the implementation of the full deregulation of the downstream oil industry and determined that the pump price of petrol will be somewhere around N385/litre (137.65 per cent above the current fuel pump price of N165/litre).\n\n\u201cWhile this will bring relief to the state governments that have been grappling with lower revenues, the chance of the federal government allowing such a spike in the near term is slim because of the negative impact on the poor.\n\n\u201cThe subsidy will cripple the government\u2019s finances if sustained, but deregulation is the only way to unlock domestic refining. There is simply no easy way around or through the dilemma. Something is going to have to give.\u201d\n\nThe report said the International Oil Companies (IOCs) were already squarely in the thick of the energy transition, while some were on well laid-out paths that would see them fully evolve to clean-energy companies.\n\nFor instance, it stated that Royal Dutch Shell is in talks with the federal government to divest from its onshore oil fields and focus on its offshore and gas operations citing recurring incidents of theft, sabotage, and oil spillage.\n\n\u201cThe IOCs have stated that Nigerian onshore business is incompatible with their long-term strategy, which focuses on climate change and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,\u201d the FDC document said.\n\nFDC added that foreign oil companies have been gradually disposing of their onshore assets over the last decade, emphasising that beyond the obvious reasons of insecurity and unrest in the Niger Delta stated by Shell, the protracted stalemate in passing the PIB remains a major factor in the oil giant\u2019s decision to exit its onshore operations in Nigeria.\n\nWith slightly under 40 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s crude and condensate production capacity, FDC stated that while Shell\u2019s move to offload its onshore oil fields could have implications on Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas output, it could also send wrong signals to international investors considering doing business in Nigeria.\n\nIt added: \u201cOther IOCs, Chevron and Mobil, have also begun to gradually dispose of their Nigerian assets in response to their changing goals and strategies, which have been influenced by climate change and the need to go green. A number of questions arise.\n\n\u201cWhat will happen to Shell\u2019s onshore assets? Are they going to be acquired by the NNPC through its upstream arm, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) or does the government invite bids from indigenous and foreign producers?\n\n\u201cDo the indigenous producers have the capacity to acquire these assets even as we expect more divestments in the future across the continent? Does this create an opportunity for indigenous players in the oil and gas sector to grow the continental footprint?\u201d\n\nThe report noted that it remains uncertain how the events will play out, adding that what is certain is that the passage of the PIB should have happened at least a decade ago and would have been crucial in the federal government\u2019s drive to achieve production of 4mbpd and domestic oil refining for regional exports.\n\nOPEC: Nigeria\u2019s Oil Production Hit Record Low in May\n\nMeanwhile, Nigeria\u2019s crude oil production output hit record low levels in May, the June Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), has shown.\n\nThe monthly report indicated that in the first quarter of 2021, Nigeria\u2019s average production was 1.410 million barrels per day.\n\nApril production stood at 1.460mbpd and it was 1.388 barrels per day in May, leading to the loss of 72,000 daily barrels during the month.\n\nBut based on direct communication with OPEC, the cartel put the figure at 1.429 million barrels per day in March, 1.372 barrels per day in April and 1.344 mbpd in May, resulting in a shortage of 28,000 barrels between April and May.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear why production has remained low even after the country announced earlier in the year that it had fully complied with the OPEC cuts after defaulting initially and the cartel\u2019s decision to gradually open the taps since April.\n\nThe country\u2019s average crude oil production based on secondary sources was 1.78 Mbpd in 2019 and 1.57mbpd in 2020, while total OPEC 13-member crude oil production averaged 25.46 mb/d during May.\n\n\u201cIn May 2021, production was up by 0.39 mb/d m-o-m. Crude oil output increased mainly in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iran, while production decreased primarily in Nigeria and Angola,\u201d OPEC said.\n\nIn terms of oil rig count, Nigeria\u2019s total was 13 in 2018, 16 in 2019 and 11 in 2020, according to the report, but the number of operational rigs fell to five in April and rose by one to six rigs last month.\n\nThe OPEC report showed that Africa\u2019s demand for crude oil was 3.43 million bpd in 2019, which fell to a 4.37million bpd in Q1, 2020.

The current growth was powered by the agriculture sector, which expanded by 2.3 per cent y-o-y.\n\n\u201cIndustrial activity moved back into the growth of 0.9 per cent y-o-y, after dropping by 5.6 per cent on average in 2020. Moreover, the annual inflation rate declined to 18.12 per cent in April 2021, from a four-year high of 18.17 per cent in March, but producer inflation accelerated to a significantly high level, amid raw material shortages and unfavourable exchange rate depreciation.\u201d\n\nThe report said Nigeria\u2019s business sentiment remained optimistic, driven by the current expansion in manufacturing operations as well as higher oil prices.\n\nBut OPEC stuck to its prediction of a strong world oil demand recovery in 2021 led by the United States and China despite uncertainties stemming from the pandemic, pointing to a need for more oil from the producer group.\n\nThe cartel said demand would rise by 6.6 per cent or 5.95 million barrels per day this year, remaining unchanged for a second consecutive month, despite a slower-than-expected recovery in the first half of this year.\n\n\u201cGlobal economic recovery has been delayed due to the resurgence of COVID-19 infections and renewed lockdowns in key economies, including the Eurozone, Japan and India.\n\n\u201cOverall, the recovery in global economic growth, and hence oil demand is expected to gain momentum in the second half,\u201d OPEC said in the monthly report.\n\nThe cartel stated that it sees 2021 world economic growth at 5.5 per cent, unchanged from last month, assuming the impact of the pandemic will have been \u201clargely contained\u201d by the beginning of the second half.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing vaccination efforts, a growing share of recovered cases leading to increasing herd immunity, and the easing of lockdown restrictions lend optimism that the pandemic could be contained in the few months to come,\u201d OPEC said.\n\nIn April, OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, had agreed to gradually ease oil output cuts from May to July and confirmed the decision at a meeting on June 1.\n\nThe report showed higher OPEC oil output, reflecting the decision to pump more and gains from Iran, which is exempted from making voluntary cuts due to U.S. sanctions, increasing May output to 390,000 bpd to hit 25.46 million daily production from the oil cartel.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Public perception of Buhari changed after ARISE Television interview, says Tinubu\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nA former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, has said that the federal government must restructure the country in the interest and the survival of the nation.\n\nOyegun spoke in Abuja on Saturday night at the public presentation of a book titled, \u2018APC\u2019s Litmus Tests\u2019 written by the Director-General of Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Dr. Salihu Lukman.\n\nThe former Edo State governor said it was vital that these issues should be addressed as the country cannot continue to allow the subject to become a recurring threat.\n\nAlso, National Leader of APC, Senator Bola Tinubu, said the public perception of President Muhammadu Buhari had changed after his interview with ARISE NEWS Channel. He added that the face-off between Odigie-Oyegun\u2019s successor, Mr. Adams Oshiomhole, and Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, was a collateral damage for the party.\n\nOdigie-Oyegun stated that there was no question that the nation and its political parties were going through difficult times, adding that all those at the formation of the APC knew the uniqueness of the party\u2019s constitution and its manifesto that promised change.\n\nAccording to him, the forces of economics have made things, not quite the way the party wanted them to be.\n\nHe said the document the APC produced on true federalism, which passed through all the organs of the party was produced because there was a cacophony of voices over the issue of restructuring.\n\nHe said at that time, just as it is happening now, two people could not agree on what they meant by restructuring and the party needed to take control of the debate, define the issues, proffer solutions and went as far as having some drafts legislation.\n\nOdigie-Oyegun said it was not by any chance a perfect document, but it reflected the thinking and the desires of Nigerians.\n\nHe stated: \u201cUnfortunately, it has gone beyond that. We now have one or two things that did not happen before. People now want to disengage from the federation, which did not happen before and that is a warning sign. If a child asks for garri today you don\u2019t give him, tomorrow he may decide it is cake he wants and we must not as a political party, we must not as the government of the federation give the impression that only military governments can fundamentally tamper with the basic structure of this nation.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cAs a progressive government, it is proper that we show the nation that when the people want some degree of change, the party should be responsive to it and should address it.\u201d\n\nOdigie-Oyegun added: \u201cCompromises have to be made, there\u2019s no question about that. The report itself is not final. It still has to go through the litmus test of compromises. The ideas of people from different parts of the country will be different up to the extent they want to go with the proposals in the document, but it is necessary. It must be mandatory in the interest of the survival of our nation, that these issues be addressed. We cannot continue to allow the subject to become something that threatens our nation at any turn.\u201d\n\nChairman of PGF and Governor of Kebbi State, Senator Atiku Bagudu, said the party was not shy to acknowledge that the country\u2019s constitution was not perfect hence the setting up of Governor Nasir el-Rufai Committee on true federalism.\n\nHe said: \u201cAPC believes in letting us amend the constitution because society is dynamic not because somebody has been wronged and cheated. If that is the basis for correction, then the agitation will never stop but if it\u2019s based on let us make it better.\u201d\n\nBagudu stated that there are fundamental challenges to be addressed, stressing that the ruling party will not shy away from acknowledging them and providing transparent leadership.\n\nHe said there was a need to increase Nigeria\u2019s budget to $300 billion or $500 billion to be able to fix the nation\u2019s challenges in the various sectors.\n\nComparing Nigeria\u2019s budget with the United States, a country with 331 million people, Bagudu said you would find that in 2019, the US budget was over $3.5 trillion and one per cent of $3.5 trillion is $35 billion.\n\nAccording to him, that means Nigeria\u2019s budget is less than one per cent of the US\u2019 budget despite having a population that is about 70 per cent of the United States population.\n\nThe governor added: \u201cIf one considers the actual distribution of revenue, it even reflects the truth. For example, from January to May, the Federation Allocation Account Committee meetings, there is no month yet, where the equivalent of $2 billion has been distributed. So, if things go this way that means $24 billion will be distributed by the three tiers of government.\n\n\u201cBut our quest includes expanding our horizon so that we can see how we will move the $35 billion federal budget to $300 billion or $500 billion federal budget because only then, can we meet some of our expectations, some of our aspirations in all sectors.\u201d\n\nThe governor said that before then, the country would continue to struggle to find enough money for security, health, education, stressing that part of APC\u2019s litmus test was to communicate this properly to Nigerians so that in making choices, they would not be blinded by promises.\n\nRepresented by former National Legal Adviser of APC, Mr. Babatunde Ogala (SAN), Tinubu said the public perception of the president had changed since last Thursday\u2019s interview aired by ARISE NEWS CHANNEL, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers.\n\nHe stated: \u201cAfter the interview of the president with ARISE NEWS, the perception of the public has changed. Yet those who will not see good will never see it.\n\n\u201cHave we sold our party and the achievements of this government enough \u2013 I think not.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 devastated the whole world. It\u2019s even a bigger form of insecurity than even the banditry that we have made a big issue of. We all saw India, we saw Ecuador where people were counting corpses of their relatives as their own luggage. We all knew their predictions for Africa, how well have we sold these achievements to the public.\u201d\n\nOn the clash between Oshiomhole and Obaseki that cost APC Edo State in the last governorship election in the state, Tinubu said he was one of those who facilitated behind-the-scene visits to Lagos \u2013 by Obaseki and by APC governors \u201cbecause we knew the consequences for our party. Whether you like it or not, it was collateral damage for all of us.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhatever our party has gone through in the last eight years, we are still facing a lot of challenges. They\u2019ve called our party different names, some even predicted that we are not going to have 12 months or 24 months.\n\n\u201cAnd if I must say, a party that has gone through eight years, it\u2019s still an infant. There will still be more of these tests \u2013 disagreement, misunderstanding, realignment but one thing is that you are part of the intellectual content of our party.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

As if the unprovoked attack was not enough the Police brutalised and arrested scores of protesters in Lagos, Abuja and Calabar.\n\n\u201cSince the protesters who were arrested during the peaceful rallies did not commit any offence, they have since regained their liberty. But the Police Authorities ought to apologise for violating the fundamental right of the protesters to freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cMore so that the police had deliberately contravened Section 83 (4) of the Police Establishment Act 2020 which provides that \u2018Where a person or organization notifies the police of his or its intention to hold a public meeting, rally or procession on a public highway or such meetings in a place where the public has access to, the police officer responsible for the area where the meeting rally or procession will take place shall mobilize personnel to provide security cover for the meeting, rally or the procession.\u201d\n\nThe senior lawyer commended the protesters for \u201cconducting themselves in a peaceful manner\u201d and condemned \u201cthe official lie that the protesters were teargassed to prevent hoodlums and miscreants from hijacking the peaceful rallies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy were the scanty pro-government protesters who were reported to have fought openly in Abuja over their booty not arrested for breach of the peace in the Federal Capital Territory?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cThe lessons of the unfortunate event of yesterday should be learnt by all sides of the debate on human freedom.

          "text": "In May 2021, the prices of major food items across the world rose to their highest level in 10 years \u2014 and Nigeria is no different. A visit by TheCable to some markets in Lagos and Ogun states have shown a greater increase in food prices in the last six months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe increase has further reduced the purchasing power of most consumers who are already cash-strapped due to the stuttering economy, high unemployment rate amid ballooning inflation.\n\nIn its latest monthly price index, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said the world food price index increased in May \u2014 highest level since 2011.\n\nIn the monthly index, cereal prices rose six percent in May month-on-month and 36.6 percent year-on-year. Maize prices led the surge and are now 89.9 percent above what they were earlier in the year. It also noted a jump in vegetable oil index by 7.8 percent in May \u2014 lifted by rising palm oil, soya.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA BAG OF GARRI UP 54 PERCENT , ONION INCREASED BY 46 PERCENT\n\nAt Ile-Epo market and Ota market (Oja-Ota) both in Lagos and Ogun states respectively, TheCable noted sharp increase in prices of onions, garri, vegetable (groundnut) oil, beans, and rice.\n\nThe price of a bag of onion at the markets increased by 46.67 percent from N15,000 to N22,000; a medium-sized bag of onions jumped high by 100 percent from N4000 to N8000; a basket of onions now costs N4000 from N2000, while a bucket (small rubber) costs N2000 from N1000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, the Onion Producers and Marketers Association of Nigeria (OPMAN) had announced plan to stop the supply of onions to south-south and south-west states. This followed the suspension of the supply of the item to the southeast over alleged attacks on members\u2019 trucks by gunmen in Imo state.\n\nMohammed Aliyu, a trader at Ile-Epo market, told TheCable that the increase in the price of onion is due to supply shortage.\n\nHowever, Yakubu Musa, another onion seller at Oja-Ota, said, \u201cthe price increased because it\u2019s seasonal\u201d.\n\nThe price of bread has also gone up to N350 from N250 in major supermarkets visited by TheCable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, in less than a year, a bag of garri went up by 54.55 percent to N17,000 from N11,000 while beans now costs N32,000 from an average of N15,000 to N16,000 per bag.\n\nBiola Adekanbi, an investment analyst, said insecurity in major parts of the country has also affected food production in the country forcing demand to outstrip supply.\n\n\u201cFor Garri, Nigeria is the largest producer of cassava in the world but states with huge production are currently battling with farmer-herder crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite being the 14th leading rice producer globally according to the UN food agency\u2019s biannual report, a bag of rice (local) rose from N19,000 to N22,000 while foreign (imported) rice now cost N25,000 from N21,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChuks Samuel, a trader at Ile-Epo market, said: \u201cThe price of foreign rice always fluctuates, before it was N21,000, it increased to N25,000, some even sell it for N27,000 and it can drop anytime too\u201d.\n\nMama Ireti, also a trader at Oja-Ota, said: \u201cBig Kings (25 litres of groundnut oil) is now N21,500 before it was between N18,000 to N19,000; 10 litres (Kings groundnut oil) is now N9,500 but before it was N6,500\u201d.\n\nAlso the price Kings oil increased by 42.86 percent from N3,200 to N5,000; while Laziz oil for the same litre is now sold for N4900 from N3500.\n\nMeanwhile, a bag of sweet potatoes slightly increased to N14,500 from N13,000, while a rubber (small) sells for N3,500 from N3,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn both markets surveyed, tomatoes were scarce (sold in small quantities); however, the price range for a bucket (small) is N3,000, while a rubber costs N1000.\n\nFAO: COUNTRIES LIKE NIGERIA TO FEEL THE IMPACT MORE\n\nThe FAO noted that food prices are expected to rise in developed and least developed countries this year on food import cost. It explained that these countries are the most exposed to rising import expenditures, especially in their fiscal and macroeconomic capacity to meet higher expenses.\n\n\u201cFood import bills of economically disadvantaged groups of countries, such as Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Low-Income Food-Deficit Countries (LIFDCs) and countries situated in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are expected to rise in 2021 by varying degrees,\u201d FAO said.\n\n\u201cThe bills of LDCs are forecast to increase with 4 percent, while those of SSA and LIFDCs could increase by 11 and 20 percent, in tandem with the global increase.\u201d\n\nThe food agency further said the global food import bill is projected to reach $1.71 trillion this year, up from $1.53 trillion in 2020.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the composite food index rose by 22.72 percent in April 2021 compared to 22.95 percent in March 2021.\n\nNBS said the rise in the food index was caused by the increase in prices of coffee, tea and cocoa; bread and cereals; soft drinks; milk; cheese and egg; vegetable; meat; oils and fats; fish and potatoes; yam and other tubers.",

This followed the suspension of the supply of the item to the southeast over alleged attacks on members\u2019 trucks by gunmen in Imo state.\n\nMohammed Aliyu, a trader at Ile-Epo market, told TheCable that the increase in the price of onion is due to supply shortage.\n\nHowever, Yakubu Musa, another onion seller at Oja-Ota, said, \u201cthe price increased because it\u2019s seasonal\u201d.\n\nThe price of bread has also gone up to N350 from N250 in major supermarkets visited by TheCable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimilarly, in less than a year, a bag of garri went up by 54.55 percent to N17,000 from N11,000 while beans now costs N32,000 from an average of N15,000 to N16,000 per bag.\n\nBiola Adekanbi, an investment analyst, said insecurity in major parts of the country has also affected food production in the country forcing demand to outstrip supply.\n\n\u201cFor Garri, Nigeria is the largest producer of cassava in the world but states with huge production are currently battling with farmer-herder crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite being the 14th leading rice producer globally according to the UN food agency\u2019s biannual report, a bag of rice (local) rose from N19,000 to N22,000 while foreign (imported) rice now cost N25,000 from N21,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChuks Samuel, a trader at Ile-Epo market, said: \u201cThe price of foreign rice always fluctuates, before it was N21,000, it increased to N25,000, some even sell it for N27,000 and it can drop anytime too\u201d.\n\nMama Ireti, also a trader at Oja-Ota, said: \u201cBig Kings (25 litres of groundnut oil) is now N21,500 before it was between N18,000 to N19,000; 10 litres (Kings groundnut oil) is now N9,500 but before it was N6,500\u201d.\n\nAlso the price Kings oil increased by 42.86 percent from N3,200 to N5,000; while Laziz oil for the same litre is now sold for N4900 from N3500.\n\nMeanwhile, a bag of sweet potatoes slightly increased to N14,500 from N13,000, while a rubber (small) sells for N3,500 from N3,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn both markets surveyed, tomatoes were scarce (sold in small quantities); however, the price range for a bucket (small) is N3,000, while a rubber costs N1000.\n\nFAO: COUNTRIES LIKE NIGERIA TO FEEL THE IMPACT MORE\n\nThe FAO noted that food prices are expected to rise in developed and least developed countries this year on food import cost. It explained that these countries are the most exposed to rising import expenditures, especially in their fiscal and macroeconomic capacity to meet higher expenses.\n\n\u201cFood import bills of economically disadvantaged groups of countries, such as Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Low-Income Food-Deficit Countries (LIFDCs) and countries situated in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are expected to rise in 2021 by varying degrees,\u201d FAO said.\n\n\u201cThe bills of LDCs are forecast to increase with 4 percent, while those of SSA and LIFDCs could increase by 11 and 20 percent, in tandem with the global increase.\u201d\n\nThe food agency further said the global food import bill is projected to reach $1.71 trillion this year, up from $1.53 trillion in 2020.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the composite food index rose by 22.72 percent in April 2021 compared to 22.95 percent in March 2021.\n\nNBS said the rise in the food index was caused by the increase in prices of coffee, tea and cocoa; bread and cereals; soft drinks; milk; cheese and egg; vegetable; meat; oils and fats; fish and potatoes; yam and other tubers.",
          "summary": "A visit by TheCable to some markets in Lagos and Ogun states have shown a greater increase in food prices in the last six months.\nIn its latest monthly price index, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said the world food price index increased in May \u2014 highest level since 2011.\nIt also noted a jump in vegetable oil index by 7.8 percent in May \u2014 lifted by rising palm oil, soya.\nFAO: COUNTRIES LIKE NIGERIA TO FEEL THE IMPACT MOREThe FAO noted that food prices are expected to rise in developed and least developed countries this year on food import cost.\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the composite food index rose by 22.72 percent in April 2021 compared to 22.95 percent in March 2021.",

It was number 7 in KPMG\u2019s 2016 survey and rose to third place in 2018. It\u2019s now the number one risk for private businesses, especially those in financial services.\n\nThe risk hierarchy for tech, media and telecommunications companies differs from the general top 10 above. Customer attrition, cybersecurity and foreign exchange volatility risks are most pressing, while regulatory risk was ranked sixth.\n\nOlanrewaju Odunowo/TC Insights\n\nLet\u2019s clarify that 77% of the companies in this survey have an annual turnover of over $15 million and 48% have over 300 employees. Most Nigerian startups are not at these marks, hence the risk maps may not be an exact match.\n\nHowever, these signposts give a sense of what VC\u2019s can expect when they plan to invest with the goal of reaping multimillion-dollar returns.\n\nAfricArena projects that VC funding in Africa will be between $2.25 billion and $2.8 billion this year. That will be a huge recovery from the $1.43 million in 2020 (according to Partech).\n\nNigeria raised $307 million of that 2020 total.

          "text": "Seven months after taking up an initial 20% stake in BetKing, South African pay TV operator MultiChoice plans to increase its shareholding in the online gambling company to 49% in a $281.5 million deal.\n\nBetKing is the trading name of Blue Lake Ventures Limited, a pan-African sports betting and entertainment business with major operations in Nigeria. The value of MultiChoice\u2019s initial investment in BetKing was said to be worth more than $100 million.\n\nThe decision to double down on the gambling company, approved by the MultiChoice board on Thursday, is in line with the company\u2019s strategy to expand its entertainment ecosystem and develop meaningful drivers of future value, a statement from the South African entertainment giant reads.\n\n\u201cConsumers have a growing abundance of entertainment options available to them. It is therefore important for MultiChoice to maintain its relevance and grow its share of engagement time and consumer spend by expanding its entertainment platform with a more comprehensive offering and a greater number of products and services,\u201d the company said, explaining the rationale behind its increased investment in BetKing.\n\nAccording to MultiChoice, pursuing an adjacency such as sports betting creates a \u201cnatural extension\u201d to its video entertainment platform to further enhance its product offerings. In other words, sport betting augments the company\u2019s business given sports is a major revenue source.\n\nWidely known as one of the leading sports betting sites in Nigeria, BetKing was founded by CEO Byron Petzer and Adekunle Adeniji, who once served as Bet9ja\u2019s virtual product manager.\n\nBetKing\u2019s annual statement for the financial year ended December 2020 shows a growth in revenue to $77.9 million, from $54.7 million in the previous year. Meanwhile, net asset value stood at $100.2 million.\n\nIt is thus not hard to see the appeal in investing in the major sports betting company also considering that the market is growing significantly globally. Between 2020 and 2024, the industry is expected to grow by more than $134 billion, a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 10%, according to Technavio.\n\nSeveral sports betting companies currently operate in this part of the world too. In Nigeria, some popular names apart from BetKing include Bet9ja, Nairabet, Naijabet, Sporting Bet, Surebet24, etc.\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that an estimated 60 million Nigerians between the ages of 18 and 40 were involved in active sports betting. Also, almost \u20a62 billion was spent on sports betting daily in Nigeria, equivalent to nearly \u20a6730 billion in a year. Yet, Africa accounts for only 2% of global sports betting revenue. As the regional market begins to play catch up, it is poised for significant growth.",

          "text": "With decentralised digital currencies like bitcoin becoming increasingly popular, the world\u2019s central banks have \u2013 in the past two years at least \u2013 been working towards developing government-backed digital currencies.\n\nNigeria may pilot an official digital currency in 2021, going by the words of Rakiyat Mohammed, a Central Bank Director in charge of the Information Technology Department, who revealed on Thursday that the banking regulator will soon launch a digital currency.\n\nA Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) represents a country\u2019s official currency in digital form. As against printing money, the apex bank issues electronic coins and notes that are backed by the government, unlike existing cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria has made \u201ctremendous progress\u201d exploring the technology for digital currency for over two years now, Mohammed revealed at a press briefing after a meeting of the Bankers\u2019 Committee. \u201cBefore the end of the year, the Central Bank will be making a special announcement and possibly launching a pilot scheme in order to be able to provide this kind of currency to its populace.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes on the back of efforts by Nigerian authorities targeted at regulating the use of decentralised cryptocurrencies in the country. The apex bank in February directed all local banks to close accounts linked to crypto platforms.\n\nDespite the clampdown, Nigerians continue to use digital currencies as a store of value and remittance tool and in a change of tone, the CBN governor later clarified that crypto trading is not banned in the country.\n\nWhy would the CBN get into virtual currencies?\n\nAccording to the CBN director, about 80% of central banks in the world are currently exploring the possibility of issuing central bank digital currency and Nigeria could not be left behind.\n\nChina in April 2020 became the first major economy to pilot a digital currency and is working towards achieving a wide, domestic use of the digital yuan by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n\nLast year, the Bahamas launched the world\u2019s first central bank digital currency. Other countries where national digital currency trials are ongoing include Indonesia, Norway, Japan, Sweden and South Korea and in Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Ghana, Morocco and Kenya are exploring the technology\u2019s feasibility.\n\nBeyond just following the global trend, there are lots of potential reasons for the planned rollout of an official digital currency in Nigeria later this year.\n\nThe CBN director particularly cited the need to make remittances travel easier from abroad to Nigeria as one motivation. \u201cWe all know how money has to travel for someone to send money from Nigeria to abroad and it is a huge money in Africa,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nWhen it eventually becomes operational, the digital currency will complement the existing forms of currency in the country and could help reduce the high cost of managing and transferring cash.\n\nDigital currency could also boost financial inclusion as those unbanked can get easier and safer access to money through their phone. A recent report by the Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFiNA) shows that Nigeria did not meet its financial inclusion targets for 2020 and at the current rate, they might not be achieved anytime soon.\n\n\u201cWe know that the recent report by EFiNA was that our target was to achieve 80% financial inclusion. We are about 60% and at the rate at which we are going, we are not going to meet this target,\u201d Mohammed said, adding that the Central Bank digital currency could \u201caccelerate\u201d the CBN\u2019s ability to meet this target.\n\nAfter the announcement, the apex bank will now explore technological options and engage various industry players, as well as move to the next stage of proof of concept to pilot the scheme, according to the CBN director.",

          "title": "Why Digital Banking Is The Key To Transforming Nigeria\u2019s Financial Landscape",
          "text": "Before Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and mobile money, Nigerians were often cash-strapped if unable to conclude their transactions at a physical bank before the weekend. Every itinerary had a \u201cbank visit\u201d at least once a week!! Long and frustrating queues in banking halls were the norm, and access to value-added banking services seemed exclusive to the influential and connected.\n\nFast-forward to the adoption of ATMs, where Nigerians welcomed the idea of transacting with a plastic-looking card with a chip on it \u2013 this brought a bit of relief to users as customers gradually migrated to interfacing with a machine, rather than waiting in long queues. Ever since then, it has been a case of innovative solutions, for example, USSD, Online/Web payments, Mobile Money, and then the most disruptive form of banking \u2013 Digital Banking.\n\nToday, that hurdle is almost history as the financial landscape becomes increasingly digitized. In 2019, Nigeria recorded over 370 million mobile money transactions from 15.3 million customers. Self-service banking options, process automation and web-based services are almost taken for granted. And the trend has only just begun, as social distancing and other health concerns brought on by the coronavirus push Nigerians to adopt digital banking in increasing numbers.\n\nThis new-fangled digital adoption is not just a pastime. Nigerians\u2019 growing preference for trusted platforms that aggregate all their financial affairs, solves their problems, and helps them achieve their goals necessitates it. The McKinsey Financial Insight Pulse survey conducted in October 2020 reinforces this. It found that the pandemic has produced consumers for whom digital and mobile banking services have become a necessity. They prefer banking with financial institutions aligned with this preference to deliver seamless digital transactions.\n\nWema Bank keyed into this growing trend long before the McKinsey report. In 2017, it launched ALAT, a full-service digital bank that helps customers access financial services without visiting a physical bank. This was a first of its kind, in Nigeria. Such fintech innovations have in the past few years, changed the face of Nigeria\u2019s financial landscape, and prospects are good there will be more in the short to medium term.\n\nMeanwhile, digital banking continues to deepen financial inclusion across the value chain. This is significant, because, in 2018, an EFINA survey found that 36.8% of Nigerian adults were unbanked, excluded from financial services that might grow their businesses and create income opportunities for others. While digital illiteracy may be partly responsible for this scenario, Nigerians\u2019 aversion to convoluted documentation processes and long wait times in banking halls should rank a close second. Who wouldn\u2019t be fazed by this? Customers stand to lose productive working hours taking time off work or business to conduct mundane transactions like account openings. Not with ALAT, surely. They designed the app to conclude this process in a matter of minutes, with a Biometric Verification Number (BVN) and phone number as the only requirements. Simplifying this process obviously means plugging more Nigerians into the financial network and possibly assisting the CBN in its quest to bank 95% of the adult Nigerian population by 2024.\n\nBut financial inclusion is just one part of the equation. Inflation has hit record highs and customers are looking out for investment options with reasonable interest rates. Unsurprisingly, Ponzi schemes cash in on the situation with enticing but unsustainable returns. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently announced over 3 million Nigerians have lost an estimated N18 billion to such schemes over the past few years.\n\nDigital finance is slowly but surely thwarting this setback, helping customers differentiate legitimate investments from their Ponzi variants. It has democratized investment in stocks, cryptocurrencies, treasury bills, and forex, such that the average investor is eligible for participation just as much as the High Net Individuals.\n\n(HNIs). The Nigerian fintech industry continues to produce a host of micro-investing platforms linked with customers\u2019 bank accounts for hitch-free deposits, withdrawals and standing orders. Some fintech platforms like ALAT even offer annual interest rates as high as 10% and facilitate group savings with family members and friends. This nudges customers towards deferring immediate gains for long-term goals and passing on the tradition to their peers. If it keeps up, it will integrate savings into the psyche of the upwardly mobile youth, and cascade to other demographics.\n\nBut will digital banking continue to define Nigeria\u2019s financial landscape? The answer is yes. Digital banking is no longer just a series of transactions, but a lifestyle adopted by the millennials and Gen Zs \u2013 most of whom grew up using the internet, computers, mobile phones, and smart television sets. The make up 60% of the Nigerian population and set the tone for traditions many consider hip. Nowadays, this means a digital-first culture involving USSD withdrawals/transfers and flight or movie tickets purchased online. It also demands access to the finer things of life, such as personal loans without collateral, luxury items bought in, installments and payday offerings to meet basic needs before the monthly paycheck. No excuses given, none taken. The youth has digital banking to thank for these opportunities and may not be settling for less soon.\n\nWema Bank had long foreseen digital banking becoming more of a lifestyle than a transaction. That\u2019s why we tailored ALAT towards facilitating seamless transactions, instant loans, discount offerings, and, of course, helping customers achieve their goals with attractive interest rates and investment education. Small wonder, in the first year following its launch, ALAT gained a whopping 250,000 customers with well over N1.6 billion deposits. We were subsequently named \u2018Best Digital Bank in Nigeria\u2019 and \u2018Best Mobile App in Nigeria\u2019 for leading the charge in the Nigerian banking sector\u2019s digital revolution at the prestigious World Finance Awards 2017.\n\nLong story short, digitization is here to stay. It\u2019s up to forward-looking financial institutions to align with the revolution or risk losing relevance. In the next few years, we should continue to see the Banking as A Platform (BAAP) concept gaining ground, as banks increasingly build partnerships with fintech and leverage data analytics to help customers make informed financial decisions. Rather than view Blockchain with scepticism, we should see financial institutions adopting the technology to facilitate faster and relatively inexpensive payment processing, stock trading, paperless international trade, and onetime identity verification for online transactions.\n\nFor existing digitized platforms like ours, continuous innovation is no longer an option, but a mandate. Customers will continue to demand improved mobile interfaces and experiences. They will always prefer hassle-free account openings, loan requests, and complaint resolution processes. We are growing and should get to a point where artificial intelligence is fully integrated into our digital banking applications such that online scheduling, video consultations, personalized financial recommendations, and reminders become the hallmarks of what we do. The future of digital banking is already with us, and only apps that catch the buzz and stay innovative will win! \u2013 Olusegun Adeniyi is the Chief Digital Officer at Wema Bank.",

          "text": "The Future of Hiring Lawyers During COVID-19 and Beyond for 200 Million Nigerians\n\nChristian Nwachukwu, Cofounder of TalkCounsel\n\nWith the spread of COVID-19, most industries have adjusted their standard practices of conducting business. The legal profession is no exception, with TalkCounsel at the helm redefining the legal experience for countless Nigerians. TalkCounsel\u2019s digital workspace hosts vetted lawyers that offer a comprehensive range of services equipped to cater to the multifaceted Nigerian community\u2019s ever-changing needs.\n\nIt\u2019s often the case in human affairs that the most relevant lessons emerge from the most devastating times. The onslaught of COVID-19 has made apparent the critical role technology plays in business and our day-to-day lives. The new reality arising from the ongoing pandemic is the importance of digital systems and solutions. Some organizations were in the throes of digital\n\ntransformations pre-pandemic. COVID-19 accelerated their efforts and forced others to implement digital capabilities for the first time as a means of survival. This unprecedented period made room for rifts to be addressed by the likes of Zoom and Slack that offered tech-solutions to a world reeling from the abrupt and rapid shift to virtual operations and interactions.\n\nThe legal community in Nigeria was not spared of the growing need to adopt tech-solutions in the advancement of lawyering. As evidence of such, several courts sitting in Nigeria adopted Zoom or Skype for court proceedings. The pandemic and restriction of human contact resulted in a burden for both the legal community and the public. Multiple clients expressed difficulty finding, hiring, and collaborating with lawyers in Nigeria remotely. The inability to do so prompted a decline in legal services requests, which affected the revenue stream for attorneys in Nigeria.\n\nIn addressing this setback, TalkCounsel was birthed by a Nigerian-trained attorney, Christian Nwachukwu, and Gina Onyiuke in the United States. TalkCounsel is a cloud-based legal workspace that enables businesses and individuals within and beyond Nigeria to find, hire and collaborate with attorneys in Nigeria remotely without ever visiting a law office. With TalkCounsel, requesting and finding legal help has never been easier.\n\nAs legal practice in Nigeria continues to grow in size and capacity, and considering the current state of the world, it is evident that a conflation of law and technology should take place. By merging the two, quality legal services can be made accessible to the average Nigerian and prospective foreign clients in need of legal services in Nigeria during this challenging time and beyond. And all from the comfort of one\u2019s couch using your device of choice. In altering the Nigerian legal landscape, TalkCounsel seeks to ensure that Nigeria\u2019s legal digital future is more robust coming out of COVID-19 than it was coming in.\n\nThus far, TalkCounsel has accumulated more than 1,000,000 impressions and still counting. Moreover, our strategic partnership with partners in North America and Europe will, in turn, boost the income stream for Nigerian lawyers, as well as the nation\u2019s GDP.\n\nTo learn more about TalkCounsel, visit our website at www.talkcounsel.com",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "Good day,\n\nToday I\u2019m discussing,\n\nSouth Africa regulating cryptocurrency\n\nNigeria\u2019s new International Termination Rates\n\nToptal suing Andela\n\nSouth Africa inching closer to regulating cryptocurrency\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group (IFWG) has released a position paper calling for the regulation of the country\u2019s cryptocurrency ecosystem.\n\nEstablished in 2016, the IFWG is a regulatory sandbox set up by the South Africa Reserve Bank (SARB) \u2014 the country\u2019s apex bank \u2014 to understand the growing role of fintechs and innovation in its financial sector and explore how regulators can assess emerging risks and opportunities in the market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe working group outlined 25 recommendations on a policy, legal, and regulatory framework for crypto assets and related activities.\n\nNot an endorsement: True to form, IFWG makes no deviations from its initial stance. It still does not recommend the use of cryptocurrency and advises caution.\n\nAny major difference? Probably not. Several African countries \u2014 Nigeria, Ghana, Mauritius, Kenya and South Africa \u2014 have been known to take a critical stance in the cryptocurrency arena. However, the government seems to be making moves to codify its intentions faster than others.\n\nInterestingly, this comes after the Central American nation of El Salvador announced the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender in the country last week. It also follows the decision of countries such as Nigeria, China, Venezuela, Russia, North Korea to launch digital currencies.\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure, The crypto space will continue to see more controversies dog its steps.\n\nFor a more in-depth read, Check out South Africa Working Group Releases New Position Paper Calling for Regulation of Crypto Asset Providers\n\nNigeria\u2019s new International Termination Rates\n\nThe Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) has concluded plans to roll out a new Mobile International Termination Rate (ITR).\n\nThe Commission has finalised the process of determining the cost-based price of ITR to ensure healthy competition on traffic handling for voice services between local and international operators in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s ITR though? They are charges paid to local operators by international operators to terminate calls in Nigeria. Say your family member calls from America, the foreign telco has to pay a certain amount for ending the call on your local network.\n\nThe rates were last reviewed in 2016 from \u20a63.90/min to \u20a624.40/min (0.0095 cents/min to 0.059 cents/min) pending the result of the just concluded cost-based study.\n\nWhy does this matter? In 2018, Per The Punch call masking and SIM boxing fraud cost Nigeria $3 billion, and as Vice Chairman NCC, Umar Danbatta explained, investigations revealed the issue began immediately after it increased ITR in 2016\n\nCall masking and SIM boxing involve rerouting international calls illegally using a specialised box connected to the internet. The calls appear to be from local Nigerian numbers. You\u2019ve probably received such a call before.\n\nThis has been a long time coming. Although the NCC has not revealed the exact amount to be paid by foreign operators, this is undoubtedly good news for local operators who have suffered significant losses due to call masking and SIM boxing.\n\nToptal sues Andela\n\nPlentyWaka bus. Source: PlentyWaka Twitter\n\nToptal, a freelancing platform for software engineers, project managers, designers etc, has filed a lawsuit against direct competitor Andela and several ex-employees, alleging theft of trade secrets to create a perfect clone of its business.\n\nThese ex-employees include, Andela\u2019s current Vice President of Enterprise, Head of Talent Operations, Vice President of Product, and Executive Vice President of Talent Operations.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about this is the fact that up until 2020, Andela\u2019s business model differed from Toptal\u2019s. The Nigerian-founded company decided to pivot into fully remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIt had struggled with its initial model of creating physical hubs to train needed talents, laying off 420 junior developers in 2018 in three different African countries.\n\nIronically, Toptal and Andela\u2019s business model are pretty on par with freelancing platforms such as Fiverr, Upwork, Freelancer.\n\nThe US-based company is, however, claiming that its ex-employees, apart from revealing trade secrets, have stolen Toptal personnel, clients and talent.\n\nFear of competition? Toptal disagrees, but with a history that includes possibly disgruntled investors and employees, there might be more than meets the eye here.\n\nRead: Freelancer marketplace Toptal sues Andela and ex-employees, alleging theft of trade secrets\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nFrom ballot paper to blockchain ledger, can the tech behind Bitcoin heal Nigeria\u2019s democracy?

          "text": "Elections are perhaps the core of democracy, a process where people have a say in who leads and how they are led. It\u2019s the point where citizens exercise their power.\n\nIn Nigeria, however, rather than exercise their power during the democratic process, Nigerians have to exhibit courage and bravery. The annulled presidential election of June 12, 1993, is widely regarded as a constant reminder of how democratic power was, and perhaps still is, stripped from the people.\n\nFor Jerry Ojumah, a blockchain developer and designer, election season in Nigeria is a time of anxiety; the focus is on surviving the process and not on the election outcome.\n\n\u201cHow can performing your civic right be an endangerment to your life?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was a recurring question as Ojumah narrated how he lost his friend, a National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member, during the 2011 Nigerian presidential election.\n\nThe country\u2019s 2019 general election claimed 626 lives, according to a Premium Times report.\n\nGiven the violence and conflict that characterise Nigerian elections, questioning election results isn\u2019t out of place. Unfortunately, election violence isn\u2019t the only problem plaguing Nigeria\u2019s democracy.\n\nAccording to a report by the Law Library of Congress Global Research Center, the 2007 elections observed by the National Democratic Institute reported an obscene amount of irregularities such as underage voting, ballots without names of some candidates, errors in voter registration, and inadequate polling stations.\n\nThe report also highlighted the observations of the European Union Election Observation Mission (EU EOM), which found out that the election did not meet basic regional and international standards.\n\nIt cited lack of organisation, absence of basic transparency, \u201cwidespread procedural irregularities and significant evidence of fraud.\u201d\n\nTo bring transparency and safety back to elections, perhaps a technological intervention, a process that is immutable and free of external influence, should be considered.\n\nBlockchain technology is often tied to the flagship cryptocurrency \u2014 Bitcoin. But in truth, cryptocurrencies are only an application of blockchain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlockchain is to Bitcoin what the Internet is to email. It is just the technology upon which cryptocurrencies work.\n\nAlso known as distributed ledger technology (DLT), blockchain has been considered an answer to election problems.\n\nIn a Forbes article, Frank Palermo advocated blockchain voting in the US after an alleged hack of the current voting system in 2016. He says with blockchain, hackers will need to do the impossible \u2014 hack through a network of computers.\n\nFrom ballot paper to blockchain ledger\n\nBlockchain has been used for elections in some countries, but the technology is very far from mainstream adoption.\n\nPer tech publication Hacker Noon, blockchain was used for voting in Sierra Leone, Japan, and Russia.\n\nIn Sierra Leone, the exercise was controversial as it turns out the blockchain company contracted for the job might not have used blockchain at all.\n\nThe tech was also introduced in Tsukuba City, Japan. However, it has only been used to vote for social development proposals.\n\nIt was in the US, however, that the use of blockchain began to look like a real replacement for the current system of elections.\n\nIn May 2018, according to NBC News, West Virginians living abroad were able to send their votes in for a primary election with a blockchain voting system. The news says it was a success as over 140 people voted.\n\nBlockchain is a relatively new technology. This raises the question of how people who are not familiar with the technology will use it during the elections.\n\ni-Elect is a blockchain voting platform with a use case in Nigeria created by blockchain developer and designer Jerry Ojumah. It was made for the Covenant University Alumni Association (CUALA) election.\n\nAccording to Ojumah, the platform will be easier to access than traditional voting methods, with people voting from the comfort of their homes.\n\nVoters can access the platform with a computer or Internet-enabled mobile device. All they have to do is click on their preferred candidate, and the information goes into the blockchain network.\n\nInterestingly, Ojumah adds that blockchain-powered voting will reduce the cost of running elections tremendously. The Guardian reports that \u20a6245 billion was budgeted for elections in 2019.\n\nA large portion of the budget went to logistics and security. Ojumah believes that without the need for logistics and security costs, less than a fraction of that budget would be required to conduct a blockchain-powered election.\n\nNevertheless, usability and scalability remain crucial considerations. Ojumah\u2019s response to this is; a simple user interface, available in most Nigerian languages combined with text to speech features for those who cannot read or are visually impaired.\n\n\u201cThanks to new generation blockchain networks, the platform will be able to process large amounts of data simultaneously,\u201d Ojumah says.\n\nIn cases of poor Internet coverage or lack of smartphones, Ojumah submits that Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) can be integrated.\n\nCan it work in Nigeria\u2019s political space?\n\nSegun Amure, a one-time aspirant for councilorship in one of the local governments in Osun State, believes that the government should consider anything that will keep elections free and fair.\n\n\u201cIf blockchain technology can guarantee ease of voting in elections, the safety and will of the people I think is good,\u201d Amure says.\n\nOrowale Triumph, a young politician with dreams of one day becoming president, says, \u201cIt sounds like a process that is not faulted by humans; the creator of the platform or the government cannot influence the data. I think the credibility and transparency of the technology can be vouched for, so why not?\u201d\n\nThough Triumph is sure that blockchain will change Nigeria\u2019s current political climate, he doesn\u2019t think Nigerian politicians will adopt such technology.\n\n\u201cThe entire system needs a change\u2026most politicians will stop at nothing to make sure elections go their way. In such a political situation, they will not succumb to a technology that assures free and fair elections.\u201d\n\nClamouring for electoral reform, Triumph says, \u201cThe power again lies with the masses. If they push for the electoral reform act, then there is a possibility that such a technology will be adopted to foster free and fair elections.\u201d\n\nArguments against blockchain elections\n\nA report by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), published November 2020, sees blockchain elections as a threat to democracy.\n\nClaiming that online voting would increase cybersecurity concerns, the MIT says \u201cVoatz\u201d \u2014 the platform used for elections in the 2018 West Virginia in the US \u2014 suffers from security vulnerabilities.\n\nIt also says the growing proposals for blockchain elections is borne out of the enthusiasm to improve and modernise elections.\n\nThe report also cites crypto investors\u2019 losses over the years as a reason to distrust blockchain.\n\nAccording to the report, voter verifiability and contestability are some problems blockchain cannot solve. It, therefore, called for a return to the paper balloting system as it is safer than online voting.\n\nConsidering that money can be stolen online and physically, MIT\u2019s report somewhat strangely predicts that the vulnerabilities associated with online shopping and banking will affect voting with blockchain.\n\nCould these positions and submissions result from a misunderstanding of how a blockchain-powered election works?\n\nHow a blockchain powered-election works\n\nAdedayo Adebajo is the Managing Director of Jelurida Africa, the African arm of Jelurida, the Swiss company behind the creation of Ardor, a blockchain network with smart contracts capability.\n\nAccording to Adebajo, creating a poll on the Ardor network requires all voters to have a funded Ardor account. This new generation of blockchain gives the option of KYC for users. So, various conditions can be set before a person is allowed to vote. However, voting is not free.\n\n\u201cEvery single vote is a transaction,\u201d he says.\n\nA transaction needs to be made to vote, and a voter needs at least one Ignis \u2014 a child chain of Ardor and a cryptocurrency \u2014 to vote.\n\nAlternatively, the creator of the polls could pay for everyone\u2019s vote. This means that if the federal government creates polls on the Ignis network, they could pay for everyone to vote.\n\nResponding to whether Jelurida will make money if Nigeria holds elections on its platform, Adebajo says, \u201cWe can not really say they make profit from this because it is still made free and the amount paid is merely for usability purposes.\u201d\n\nAt the time of writing this piece, one Ignis was approximately 30 cents. Voting for a population of say 150 million people will cost approximately $45 million, which translates to \u20a621.5 billion \u2014 a fraction of the \u20a6245 billion budgeted for the 2019 election.\n\nWhen it comes to the safety of this data, he reveals that in a scenario where 51% of the nodes running Ardor suffer an attack, data could be compromised.\n\nHowever, there are 2,000 Ardor nodes spread across different parts of the world, making the possibility of an attack very slim.\n\nAs a Nigerian, Adebajo feels Nigeria should adopt blockchain voting but he believes it will not happen anytime soon because \u201cthere are a lot of people who benefit from the lack of transparency and lack of digital trails\u201d in elections.\n\nAdebajo suggests that a way to adopt this system of voting is to start small. From voting within associations to voting in local government elections before getting to the national level.\n\nFor Nigerians, adopting a technological solution to solve election problems transcends a desire for ease and convenience during voting. It is perhaps the only alternative to reviving a dying democracy.\n\nNews reports give statistics of lives lost during elections in Nigeria; the pain, however, is inestimable.",

          "title": "Nigeria outshines peers as largest real estate investment by country",
          "text": "An analysis of institutional acquisitions and disposals in real estate investment valued at $1.8 billion across Africa in the past two decades reveals that Nigeria has the largest real estate investments by country.\n\nThe country has, within this period, attracted $523 million investment into the sector, ranking ahead of Mozambique and Mauritius that were ranked second and third with $268 million and $256 million investment, respectively.\n\nWhat this means is that opportunities abound in the Nigerian real estate market and savvy investors are not glossing over that. The country is almost a green field for investors. The size/value of real estate opportunity in the country is estimated at $56 billion.\n\nThis is, however, understandable in a country of 200 million population where housing demand-supply gap is well over 20 million while annual housing output is between 50,000 and 100,000 units. Homeownership level in the country, according to experts, is a little above 20 percent.\n\nThe investment analysis looks further at the value of investments by cities and reveals that Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s commercial capital, tops the list with $523 million, followed by Accra, the Ghanaian capital, with $230 million while Maputo in Mozambique comes third with $201 million investment.\n\nBismarck Rewane, CEO, Financial Derivative Company (FDC), who provided this information in his June Breakfast Conference in Lagos, also hinted that in terms of market segment and value, retail was most preferred, attracting $687 million investment and offering 8.6-10 percent yield.\n\n\u201cThe top destination for investment is Nigeria which accounts for $260million while the top city is Lagos with $260 million worth of investment,\u201d Rewane noted.\n\nFor the office space market, the value of investment is $485 million and the yield is 7.2-10.4 percent. Nigeria is the top destination for investors who committed $140 million while the top city is Lagos, accounting for $140 million investment.\n\nFor the hospitality segment of the market, $480 million investment has been made with 7.5-7.6 percent yield. The top destination here is Mauritius which corners $195 million. Nigeria is third with $98 million. The top city is Accra with $100 million. Lagos is third with $98 million investment.\n\nThe value of investment in Industrial real estate is $58 million with 7.5-9.6 percent yield. Top destination is Nigeria which accounts for $25 million while Lagos is the top city with $25 million investment.\n\nThe real estate sector in Nigeria is not doing badly despite economic headwinds in the country. The first quarter (Q1) 2021 GDP figures which were released recently by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) shows that the sector grew by 6.52 percent to 1.77 percent compared to -4.75 percent in Q1\u201920.\n\nThe sector, however, recorded a marginal dip compared to Q4\u201920 when it recorded 2.84 growth, partly due to the improving interest rate environment.\n\nDespite these positives, vacancy factor was reducing, according to Rewane. He noted that rents were increasing as replacement cost of buildings was higher than market value on the mainland and island of Lagos.\n\nHe did not see promising outlook for the sector as new investments are to decline as interest rates go up and vacancy factor are to widen on low consumer disposable income.\n\n\u201cLagos to remain the real estate hub but Ogun state is gaining momentum as land and properties are cheaper in Ogun,\u201d he said, noting that housing deficit, currently estimated at 22 million units, was to remain a trivial issue.\n\nAccording to him, private developers will increase promotional offers to boost sales, recommending that government regulations should be imperative to clamp down on fake/Ponzi real estate investments.\n\nOver all, due largely to poor performance of other investment assets like government Treasure Bills, bonds and equities, the real estate sector remains the asset of choice in terms of investment.\n\nEmeka Eleh, an estate surveyor and valuer, noted in a recent report that despite ending 2020 in the red, \u201cthe sector appears to hold potential for 2021. The opportunities created amid the pandemic have raised optimism that 2021 will be a good year for the. The collapse of money market instruments as viable options has more or less assured this.\u201d\n\nExpectation is that the residential, construction, and industrial segments of the market where, by default, Covid-19 has brought about demand, because of the new normal, are expected to drive the sector\u2019s growth with good returns for developers, investors and landlords.\n\nThe demand for residential real estate is expected to increase, as work from home becomes a major driver for space demand. The increase in demand for warehousing amid a surge in e-commerce and online trading is expected to drive growth in the industrial subsector.\n\nConstruction of projects that were put on hold amid COVID-19 lockdown and the rebuilding of vandalized properties during the ENDSARS protest is expected to boost expansion in the construction sector and thus, drive the growth of the sector in 2021.\n\nFor investors still unsure of where to invest and get good yield, experts bet on residential real estate. They note that locations like Chevron, Agungi and Osapa which reported an average rental value of 6percent in 2020 are expected to give investors good return this year. The same is expected in Yaba, the tech hub for start-ups.\n\nMixed-use projects with well planned residential components are also expected to perform well following the projected surge in the demand for shelter even at a period of economic downturn. This will hold true for Lagos Island, Lekki, Ikoyi and Victoria Island.",

          "title": "JOB SCAM (2): How fly-by-night firms fleece unemployed graduates, lure them into \u2018marketing\u2019",
          "text": "In late 2019, months after PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 reporter submitted data across recruitment platforms while posing as a job applicant, Gboyega Alabi, an old friend and job applicant, sent in an application from a recruitment agency called Primix Consult. Located on Number 6, Remilekun Street, off Ogunlana Drive, Surulere, Lagos, the company claimed to be recruiting on behalf of banks and other companies in Lagos and other parts of the country.\n\nSince this reporter did not get the invitation directly, he was advised to \u201cgate-crash\u201d \u2013\u2013a popular catchphrase among job seekers, which implores one to attend a job interview even when uninvited for such\u2013\u2013 but declined. Many desperate job seekers do \u2018gate-crash\u2019 quite often, and a few lucky ones get picked for job opportunities.\n\nMr Alabi and one other job seeker who attended the interview at Primix Consult office in Surulere told this newspaper they paid N5,500 at the interview venue and were given assurance of job placements. They were also asked to enroll for \u201cEmpowerment training scheme\u201d, while anticipating their job calls.\n\nOver a year after the \u2018interview\u2019 was conducted, they never heard from Primix Consult, according to Mr Alabi, who now works with an IT firm in Yaba. He added that the telephone details given to them were also no longer reachable after some months.\n\nIn February, PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 reporter visited the office address used by Primix Consult at No 6, Remilekun Street, Surulere, but there was no trace of any such company operating from the building. A middle-aged man who sat in the only office space inside the building told PREMIUM TIMES that such company never operated from the building.\n\nSurprisingly, at the front of the same building used by Primix Consult, PREMIUM TIMES found yet another signpost by an unnamed firm announcing vacancies for different job positions. When this reporter requested details of the new \u201cunnamed\u201d firm from the man found inside the building, he claimed to know nothing about it.\n\nMeanwhile, further checks by PREMIUM TIMES showed that Primix Consult has no digital footprint whatsoever.\n\nMusiliu Akande, an Ibadan-based career coach, told PREMIUM TIMES in an interview that many of the firms often change their location addresses and corporate names over time, in order to defraud unsuspecting job seekers.\n\n\u201cMany unsuspecting job seekers are likely to fall victim to the antics of the same fraudulent recruitment firm more than once,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is because the firms often change their names and location address and other identities with which people can trace them.\u201d\n\nLike Primix, like ONeal\n\nLike Primix Consult, ONeal is one other recruitment agency that suddenly disappeared from its old base on the same Surulere axis of Lagos. Located on Number 1, Babatunde Street, Off Ogunlana Drive, Surulere, the company boasted of recruiting for top firms in the country.\n\nBiola Ibidapo, an applicant who got invitations from the company when it operated from its Surulere address told PREMIUM TIMES the firm suddenly exited its office location, months after they had been promised job.\n\nThey never heard anything about it afterwards, said the applicant. Another applicant who does not want her name in print said she declined to go for their interviews after she heard complaints that ONeal was recruiting for GNLD marketing.\n\nWhen PREMIUM TIMES visited the office address used by O\u2019Neal in February, this reporter found that the building had been abandoned and the gate shut.\n\nA trader who sold from a kiosk opposite the building told this reporter nobody had any idea of what went wrong with the company. She added that they also had no clue about its new office address or the whereabouts of its founders.\n\nIn Abeokuta, Ogun State, Deborah Ashade and two other graduates of the National Open University (NOUN) told PREMIUM TIMES of a similar ordeal in the hands of one Best Consult, a recruitment firm operating from the Adigbe end of the Ogun State capital. According to Ms Ashade and her friends, in 2020, the company sent them invitations for job interviews and they paid N5,000 on the day of the said interviews. They never heard from the company thereafter.\n\nWhen PREMIUM TIMES visited the location of the company in Abeokuta last March, residents said the recruitment firm suddenly vacated the space and nothing was heard of its founders\u2019 whereabouts afterwards.\n\nIn Nigeria\u2019s chaotic job market, the experience of Mr Alabi, Ms Ashade, and others in the hands of fly-by-night recruitment firms appears commonplace, as PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 investigation showed. Unscrupulous companies working as recruitment firms often trick unsuspecting applicants into paying \u201cfees\u201d for jobs they hardly get.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFly-by-night\n\nOne clammy evening in January 2015, Subomi Samuel said he received a text message from a certain recruitment firm called \u2018CEO Resource\u2019 directing him to come for a job interview. Mr Samuel, a 2012 Engineering graduate of The Polytechnic Ibadan, had spent two years of post-NYSC life seeking employment across Lagos and different parts of the South-west.\n\n\u201cI thought that was the end of my unemployment frustration,\u201d he quipped, \u201cBut I was wrong!\u201d\n\nMr Samuel recalled that the first sign of danger he noticed was the poor grammatical structure of the invite message. But he was too desperate to care, he admitted.\n\nUpon getting to the venue of the \u201cinterview\u201d at Pen Cinema, Agege, he noticed yet again that the interviewers looked quite \u201chaggard and hungry.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they spoke eloquently and were able to convince many of us to part with our money,\u201d he said.\n\nBy the time the company was done, Mr Samuel said he and numerous other young people had parted with N10, 500 each, to secure employment in various organisations.\n\nTheir ordeals began two months after they attended the \u2018interview\u2019 and nothing was heard from the \u2018organisers\u2019. Mr Samuel said whenever he placed a call through to demand clarification, he was assured that they would help him secure a job.\n\n\u201cSince I was teaching at the time, and I had some money to survive, I had hope that things could indeed get better,\u201d he said. \u201cBut few months after the interview, I could no longer reach them on phone.\u201d\n\nMr Samuel said when he finally visited the company\u2019s office at Pen Cinema, Agege, they had vacated the place.\n\n\u201cI was devastated,\u201d he told PREMIUM TIMES. \u201cBut luckily for me, I got another job shortly after.\u201d\n\nIn December 2019, four years after Mr Samuel\u2019s ordeal, PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 got details of yet another company named Fad Consult which had many graduates pay for job placement using the same address as \u2018CEO Resource\u2019 at Pen Cinema, Agege. Two graduates who fell victim told this reporter that they were fleeced of N10,000 each and never got any job.\n\nLocated opposite Oando fuel station on the ever-busy Pen Cinema axis of Agege in Lagos, the company was able to convince many job seekers with its strategic office address.\n\nBut when this newspaper visited the office location, shop owners said the firm had vacated the building. A trader told this newspaper that many disappointed job seekers had visited the plaza to lament the disappearance of the phony companies in the past.\n\nGNLD \u2018Marketing\u2019\n\nApart from fly-by-night recruitment firms, PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 findings showed that many job seekers have also fallen victim of being lured into different forms of \u2018marketing\u2019 jobs, notably for GNLD products.\n\nGolden Neo-Life Diamite International (GNLD) says it is a pioneer in whole food nutrition supplementation, with a commitment to end the trend of poor wellness and poverty. It has footprint in different parts of the world.\n\nIn Nigeria, however, promoters of the brand rely heavily on marketers to sell their products. PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 findings revealed that they recruit young unemployed people and convince them to become distributors who would then purchase the products on discounted rates. The young marketers would share these products and earn profits from them, while the income realized is determined by the number of products sold.\n\n\u201cToo many fraudulent recruitment firms latch on Nigeria\u2019s unemployment situation to lure desperate job seekers into the GNLD network,\u201d says Charles Ike, a job seeker who claimed to have paid N10,000 at a recruitment agency in Ogba before being lured into the \u2018GNLD marketing\u2019 scheme. Mr Ike said there was nothing wrong with the GNLD marketing scheme itself, but many fraudulent companies deceive young graduates with promises of \u2018lucrative\u2019 jobs only to lure them into the marketing scheme.\n\n\u201cI never wanted to participate in GNLD because I find it very stressful. But these guys (recruitment firms) would not tell you the job invitation is for GNLD product marketing. You\u2019d only know this when you get to the interview venue, and often after making payment,\u201d he lamented.\n\nAnother job seeker told this reporter that he had a similar experience at a recruitment firm in Isolo area of Lagos after paying N8,500 for \u201clicense\u201d and \u201ccertification\u201d as a nutritionist. The payment, he was told, was to certify him as an eligible marketer of GNLD products.\n\nAt least two other applicants told this newspaper of their experience at ONeal recruitment firm wherein many job seekers were lured into marketing of different nutrition products.\n\nChecks by PREMIUM TIMES revealed that ONeal has no known physical address and no functional website, since its old office at Surulere is now abandoned and under lock.\n\nIn May, PREMIUM TIMES called a telephone number listed by the recruitment firm in its job invitation messages to some young job seekers but it was received by a lady who claimed to have left the company since 2016. She also claimed she knew nothing about the company or its founders\u2019 whereabouts.",
          "summary": "Since this reporter did not get the invitation directly, he was advised to \u201cgate-crash\u201d \u2013\u2013a popular catchphrase among job seekers, which implores one to attend a job interview even when uninvited for such\u2013\u2013 but declined.\nMany desperate job seekers do \u2018gate-crash\u2019 quite often, and a few lucky ones get picked for job opportunities.\nMeanwhile, further checks by PREMIUM TIMES showed that Primix Consult has no digital footprint whatsoever.\n\u201cMany unsuspecting job seekers are likely to fall victim to the antics of the same fraudulent recruitment firm more than once,\u201d he said.\nPREMIUM TIMES\u2019 findings revealed that they recruit young unemployed people and convince them to become distributors who would then purchase the products on discounted rates.",

          "title": "T. B Joshua\u2019s death sparks cries of woes",
          "text": "By AYOOLA OLAOLUWA\n\nCries of woes and lamentations, particularly from individuals, institutions, communities and states who benefited from the late founder of Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), Prophet T.B Joshua, and will miss his kind gestures, have continued to trail the untimely death of the popular pastor.\n\nProphet Joshua, it would be recalled, died in the early morning of Sunday, June 6th 2021 after falling ill during a church service.\n\nTraditional rulers from his Akokoland birth place, widows, the poor and needy, community leaders in Lagos, Ondo, Oyo and others where he left indelible impressions, traders and shop owners who benefitted from patronage from pilgrims to his church, as well as church members who spoke on the painful demise of the \u2018Man of God\u2019, all lamented that they were going to miss him.\n\nBusiness Hallmark investigation revealed that the SCOAN economy whike TB Joshua was alive was quite huge, as residents and landlords from Egbeda, Idimu, Ikotun Egbeda, Igando and environs benefitted from the church activities.\n\nFor instance, many landlords rented their houses out to Christian pilgrims from far and wide who could not find accommodation in the limited spaces inside the Synagogue church.\n\nFindings revealed that landlords and hotels around the church facility charge between N2,000 and N35,000 per night on their facilities, depending on their state and conditions.\n\nFor instance, while a regular room in a \u2018face me I face you\u2019 apartment cost between N2,000 and N3,000 per night, a one-room self contained goes for between N3,500 and N5,000 per night.\n\nChecks revealed that majority of those who patronise these facilities are poor and low income earners from the North, South East and South South states, as well as from neighbouring countries of Benin Republic, Togo, Ghana and Liberia in need of one form of miracle or deliverance from Prophet Joshua and could not get a space in the church or not afford to stay in very expensive lodges and hotels.\n\nOn the other hand, the relatively better off go for more comfortable single rooms, challets and apartments around the church at a going rate of between N5,000 and N35,000.\n\nMost of the people in this range are foreigners from Europe and America, Asia, Southern African countries, as well as top civil servants, professionals, businessmen and politicians who could not secure accomodation in the church or prefer to stay outside the church\n\nMost landlords in the church neighborhood, it was observed, have converted their houses to room and parlor self contained and challets which are more in demand\n\nA top retired civil servant, Pa. Isaac Orimolade, lamented the death of the prophet, wondering if his death will not affect his real estate investment in the area.\n\n\u201cI acquired some houses, three in all, in this area (Ikotun) two years ago for N105million. I renovated it to taste, spending another N100million.\n\n\u201cAnd business had been good in the last one year when I opened the places up to SCOAN visitors mostly from Southern African countries of South Africa, Zambia and Lesotho. Some Nigerians also patronise the facilities.\n\n\u201cOn a normal day, we make between N3.5million and N4million. But that was before the prophet\u2019s death. Since his death, traffic to the church and the need for our services had drastically reduced.\n\n\u201cFor instance, we only made around N700,000 yesterday (Sarturday). And the situation may get worse. While most of our tenants who came into the country to see the prophet are jetting out, new ones are not coming in.\n\n\u201cSeveral of my mates who introduced me to the accomodation business made tons of money before the sudden crash.\n\n\u201cI used all my retirement benefits and loans from a bank to build up this place. I just hope I won\u2019t live to regret joining the race very late\u201d, Pa. Orimolade lamented.\n\nAnother landlord who spoke to our correspondent on the death of Prophet T.B Joshua, Mrs. Ngozi Orji, though admited that she had made fortune from the presence of Synagogue church in the area, she prayed that his demise will not affect her much.\n\n\u201cI built a twelve-room apartment popularly called \u2018face-mei-face-you\u2019 in this area in 1978 after relocating from Abia to Lagos with my husband.\n\n\u201cBut it used to be war to get overdue rents of N500 monthly from my tenants. However, that changed with the coming of Synagogue church to this area.\n\n\u201cI started giving out a room at the rate of N100 per day back in the late eighties. Today, I collect N2,500 daily for the twelve rooms, totalling N30,000 in a day.\n\n\u201cFrom the proceeds of that house, I was able to acquire two plots of land and build others apartments and was making an average of N100,000 daily before the tragedy of June 6.\n\n\u201cThough most of the tenants are still staying put, probably hoping for a miracle and praying for the prophet to resurrect, I am a realist and know that he won\u2019t come back after his body had being pumped full of chemicals to preserve it. The situation will soon dawn on them (lodgers)and they will soon start leaving one after the other\u201d, Mrs Orji lamented.\n\nAlso, several traders and commercial drivers disclosed that they benefitted from the church activities while the founder was alive.\n\nAccording to them, they used to realise more than what they make in six days of the week on one Sunday alone.\n\n\u201cAs you can see, my shop is just beside the church. And I benefitted immensely from it. I sell cold water and drinks and used to sell around 50 crates on a daily basis and around 200 crates every Sunday.\n\n\u201cFrom this trade, I have trained five of my six children in the university. Two are in Canada right now. Can you believe that! And I was able to achieve that from this trade\u201d, declared a trader who simply identified herself as Chinyere.\n\nSeveral church members who at one time or the other benefitted from the philanthropic gestures of the late prophet were also seen weeping openly.\n\n\u201cWho is going to cater for me now. I lost my last child ten years ago and things became tough for me. But when I met man of God, my situation changed. He said he would have set me up but that I was too old to work.\n\n\u201cApart from paying my house rents, he also give me N50,000 monthly to cater for my needs. My benefactor is gone. God, why, why, why? Where do I start from, an octogenarian member of SCOAN wept bitterly.\n\nBH reliably gathered that the late prophet bought and installed most of the electrical transformers around Ikotun-Egbe, Egbeda, Idimu and environs.\n\nApart from that, he constructed roads, built health centres, and sunk boreholes in several communities abandoned by government.\n\nThe chairman of Progressive Community Development Association (CDA) in Ikotun, Alhaji Tunji Sulaiman, disclosed that the late prophet alone bought and installed over 50 transformers in the community.\n\n\u201cNEPA, PHCN and later Ikeja Electric all abandoned us to our fate. Before now, some of the communities within the CDA used to live in darkness for three years and more. But when the man of God built his church in this area, our fortune changed for good.\n\n\u201cHe was our everything, government, aid agencies, just name it. What is going to happen now when this facilities are old or develop major faults! Are we not going to be at the mercy of the government and power company again\u201d, the community leader lamented.\n\nIt is not only in Lagos that the impacts of the late prophet was felt. From Oyo, to Ogun, Osun, Ekiti and his home state of Ondo, stories abound of his good deeds.\n\nHis people from Akokoland, while lamenting the death of their benefactor, spoke glowingly on his socio, religious and economic contribution to the development of not only his homrtown of Arigidi Akoko, but the entire Akoko Division.\n\nAkoko is a division in Ondo State comprising of four out of the 18 local governments that made up the state. The four local governments are Akoko South-West (Oka), Akoko North-East (Ikare), Akoko South-East (Isua) and Akoko North-West (Oke Agbe).\n\nWhile the prophet came from Arigidi under the purview of Akoko North-West, his contribution to the entire Akoko is overwhelming.\n\nFor instance, electricity was recently restored to the whole four local governments in Akokoland after the prophet coughed out N200m to defray their electricity bill which necessitated the local governments to be cut off from the national grid.\n\nWhile he built and aquired several police stations and patrol vehicles to stem the high rate of armed robberies in Anokoland, a first class university costing $1billion he is building in his native home of Arigidi-Akoko is nearing completion.\n\nAlart from that, many Akoko indigenes have benefitted from his philanthropic gestures, including scholarships and other empowerment programmes.\n\nThe traditional ruler of Arigidi Akoko, Oba Yisa Olanipekun; lamented that all the plans the late prophet had for Akokoland are now all gone.\n\n\u201cHis contribution to the development of Arigidi Akoko is countless. He was a person that did not want people to suffer. I can count the number of times he used trailers to deliver bags of foodstuffs to us in the Akoko area. He would ensure the foodstuffs were distributed town by town, village by village.\n\n\u201cWe, in the Akoko North West Local Government Area, were disconnected from the national grid due to our indebtedness but he paid the money we owed \u2013millions of naira \u2013 and electricity supply was restored. We still have some local government areas in the state that lack electricity today because of their debt. There is nothing we requested from him that he did not do for us. I can\u2019t count them. They are numerous. During festivals, he would send cows and bags of rice to all streets for us to enjoy the festivities.\n\n\u201cAll the buses used in our four local government areas today, he provided them for us. He called me some time ago and said he wanted to buy us tractors to help boost our agriculture. He said the tractors would be under the control of the traditional rulers. So, he really tried for us.\n\n\u201cWe are really going to miss him. I tell you, since the night I received the sad news, I have not been able to sleep. Before now, he told me he would soon come back home; he had asked for land, that he wanted to move his church down here and that he would buy buses that would bring his international guests and worshippers from Akure Airport to Arigidi with full security. Now, all these plans are gone\u201d, the monarch wailed.\n\nMeanwhile, monarchs in the four local government areas in Akokoland have demanded that the remains of Pastor Joshua be buried in his hometown of Arigidi Akoko.\n\nIn the communique issued at the end of the meeting made available to BH, the traditional rulers said the late prophet had done well for the people of the Akokoland and deserved to be buried in Arigidi Akoko.\n\nThe monarchs of Oka Akoko and that of Ikaramu Akoko, Oba Yusuf Adeleye and Oba Andrew Momodu, both signed communique.\n\nAccording to the monarchs, there was the need for late Joshua to be immortalised in order to make the whole world know that Akoko people were appreciative of his robust contribution to the growth and development of the Akokoland.\n\n\u201cUndoubtedly, Pastor Joshua\u2019s death came as a rude shock. The pains are not mere emotional flashes but a piercing sting. He was a great philanthropist whose death has created a vacuum difficult to fill.\n\n\u201cHe demonstrated humility with a large heart to accommodate the feelings of the downtrodden, hence the need to bring his body to his place of birth in Arigidi Akoko.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis financial intervention can be seen in electricity and security; he provided patrol vehicles for both police and army and he also created employment at various projects he embarked upon just to mention a few\u201d, the monarchs noted.",
          "summary": "Prophet Joshua, it would be recalled, died in the early morning of Sunday, June 6th 2021 after falling ill during a church service.\nBH reliably gathered that the late prophet bought and installed most of the electrical transformers around Ikotun-Egbe, Egbeda, Idimu and environs.\nIt is not only in Lagos that the impacts of the late prophet was felt.\nThe four local governments are Akoko South-West (Oka), Akoko North-East (Ikare), Akoko South-East (Isua) and Akoko North-West (Oke Agbe).\nThe traditional ruler of Arigidi Akoko, Oba Yisa Olanipekun; lamented that all the plans the late prophet had for Akokoland are now all gone.",

          "title": "S/East and the ominous orgy of violence",
          "text": "President Buhari\u2019s now infamous statement on the rising violence in the South east and his determination to respond to it appropriately, sparking outcry from Nigerians and international community, reflects the escalation of the situation. His outburst came in the wake of the recent assassination of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak, a former presidential aide, in Imo state, which marked new height in the orgy of violence since the attack on the Police command and Nigeria Correctional centre in Owerri by unknown gunmen.\n\nAlthough, the region was not completely insulated from the spectre of insecurity pervading the country, the present situation seems out of place and leaves many questions unanswered. So when suddenly the police command and the Correctional centre were attacked, followed by frequent killings of policemen and other security agents, there was immediate cause for concern. The perplexing questions are: Who are these unknown gunmen; and what is their objective or purpose?\n\nWe are troubled by the conflicting and apparently orchestrated reactions from both the federal government and some northern groups. Although government had been quick to point accusing fingers at IPOB and its affiliate, the Eastern Security Network, it was an allegation without proof, which, those involved, have also denied.\n\nThough the threat by the president to deal with the perpetrators of these dastardly acts is welcomed, there is growing anxiety that we may be working toward a predetermined script, which could lead to further escalation. It is not enough for government to promise to deal with the situation without unraveling those behind it.\n\nIn fact the travel advisory to northerners by the Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF, is also worrisome and perhaps an indication of a mindset that the situation may further degenerate. It seems there is a deliberate and premeditated plan to clamp down and castrate the region on the pretext of curbing agitations for Biafra. The fact is that such agitations have never been violent.\n\nAll these issues have created a puzzling uncertainty. The climax of this came in the wake of the Gulak\u2019s murder. While the federal and Imo state governments were still asking for investigations, the police came out with a strange announcement that the assailants of Gulak had been accosted and gunned down \u2013 all of them, 10 in number. The question is how did the police quickly encounter these people and instead of arresting them decided to eliminate them, which appeared like a cover up.\n\nThis, in our opinion, is inexplicable, because without the testimony of the alleged murderers of Gulak, the reason for the killing and the masterminds will never be known. Why was Gulak killed? Who are those killing security agents? Nigerians need to have a logical and conclusive answer to douse its ethnic undertones and save the country from any unintended consequences.\n\nAgain both the federal and state governments claimed that the killing was the result of a political fight between some politicians; this is also strange. If the governments already knew the source of the killing, why have they not invited the suspected politicians for questioning? Is it because, they are powerful and likely to be APC members? Is there a nexus between his killing and the violence in the region?\n\nMeanwhile, the region has been on lockdown as attacks on security agents spiraled. Many innocent people have been killed and about 3,000 detained in apparent police and military reprisals, leaving an atmosphere of fear and insecurity across the entire space, as nobody knows where next the attack would occur and the likely reactions from security agents.\n\nThe deployment of troops and a special police squad to the region with an ostensible order to shoot at sight the perpetrators of attacks on security agents cannot be the solution to this spate of violence. Why is the same order not applied in other areas of the country, such as Kaduna, Niger, Benue etc where violence has been on the upsurge? How can we hope to resolve the cause of the violence without knowing those responsible for it?\n\nIn our considered view, the South east situation is becoming a security conundrum that is spinning out of hand, which may consume the nation; and the time is apposite to take stock. We are not unmindful of the conspiracy theories trailing this development. Yet there is palpable impression that the violence is external to the region because it does not make sense that its people would be attacking policemen who in turn kill innocent people.\n\nThe federal government cannot absolve itself the responsibility of what is going on the South east. It has been long in coming but the government pretended indifference and aloofness to the simmering fire until it snowballed into an inferno. Local authorities had warned of the influx of strange people in lorry loads being transported to the region for undeclared reasons even when the nation was on lockdown.\n\nThe region has consistently and bitterly complained of marginalization since the return of democracy in 1999, which has progressively worsened with the passage of time, and particularly under this government. Such a situation is creating increasing resentment and anger among the youths, who have found themselves in utter abandonment by the government. Although no situation could justify violence, yet it makes secessionist agitations attractive, which is the excuse being used by government to militarize the region.\n\nWe believe that the spiraling security issue in the region clearly raises the stake for the demand to restructure the country so that people can effectively be in charge of their security, especially at the local levels. Although many people have expressed reservations over the current constitution amendment, we believe it is the most viable step to address urgently the security situation confronting the country through the introduction of state police.\n\nIt will be a sad development and lost opportunity if we failed to utilize the present exercise to enable this country overcome the present challenge, and to retrace its steps from the precipice that potentially awaits it. Nigeria cannot survive as a united and peaceful country on terms pre-determined and imposed by one part or group. It will only sow the seed of crisis which end cannot be easily predicted given emerging trends in communication and military technology.\n\nThe current insurgency ravaging the country is sufficient evidence that the rules of war have drastically changed and nobody has the monopoly of violence any more as non state actors have generally stalemated the largest army in Africa. We share Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe\u2019s sentiment that were Biafra civil war to take place today, there would have been no Nigeria.",

          "text": "The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), an Islamic human rights organization, has claimed that the June 12 demonstrators were ungrateful to President Muhammadu Buhari after he acknowledged June 12 in the same way as nine lepers were ungrateful to Jesus Christ.\n\nThe Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, was also chastised by MURIC for participating in the June 12 rally in Ibadan, the state capital.\n\nThe South-West area was also chastised for participating in the June 12 protest against President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration, according to the group.\n\nNigerians in many regions of the country, mainly in the south-west, held demonstrations on June 12 to commemorate Democracy Day.\n\nMURIC stated that the protestors had no moral justification to demonstrate on June 12 because it was President Muhammadu Buhari who provided official status to the day after all previous governments had refused.\n\nThe organisation\u2019s position was contained in a statement signed by its director, Professor Ishaq Akintola on Monday.\n\nAkintola said, \u201cSome Nigerians in the Southern part of the country, particularly the South West marked Independence Day on Saturday, June 12, 2021, with demonstrations. Although in negligible numbers, the protests took place in Abuja, Lagos, Ibadan and a few other places.\n\n\u201cWe commend the police for handling the protests with maturity and professionalism as no casualties or brutalities were reported. However, the protesters exposed themselves as certificated ingrates, unrepentant rebellious subjects and articulated enemies of peace.\n\n\u201cJune 12 should be a day for all Nigerians to celebrate Chief M.K.O. Abiola for his sacrifices on the altar of democracy. He was the man who paid the supreme sacrifice after winning the presidential election held on June 12, 1993, which was criminally annulled by the military.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian civil society, including MURIC, had been clamouring for the official recognition of that day as Democracy Day but none of our past rulers listened, not even Chief Olusegun Obasanjo who hails from the same city of Abeokuta like M.K.O. The former had all the chance in the world to declare June 12 as Nigeria\u2019s Democracy Day having ruled for eight years (1999 \u2013 2007) but he bluntly refused to do so.\n\n\u201cIt was a northerner, a Fulani, President Muhammadu Buhari, who eventually proclaimed June 12 as Nigeria\u2019s Democracy Day. It is our contention that for that alone, the people of the South West should show gratitude to Buhari. But what do we see?\n\n\u201cIt was demonstrations galore. The most shameful, most reprehensible and most preposterous was the open participation of Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State who marched on the streets of Ibadan with protesters chanting \u2018Buhari Must Go\u2019.\n\nREAD ALSO: DashMe: Osinbajo praises NYSC certificate forger Kemi Adeosun\n\n\u201cIt is most na\u00efve for a sitting executive governor who came into office riding on the back of democracy to join a group seeking the removal of a democratically elected president through undemocratic means. It was a great disservice to the memory of M.K.O. Abiola. Seyi Makinde is an ingrate nulli secundus. He should apologise to Nigerians for his immature behaviour.\n\n\u201cThose protesters definitely missed the point and lost their bearing because Nigerians, particularly people of the South West, should be showing gratitude to Buhari for declaring June 12 as Democracy Day instead of partaking in an unnecessary protest.\n\n\u201cThe Qur\u2019an gives immense honour to those who appreciate goodness. Allah says, \u2018If you are grateful, I will increase my favours on you. But if you disbelieve, certainly my punishment is indeed severe\u2019 (Glorious Qur\u2019an 14:7).\n\n\u201cOn his way to Jerusalem, while passing between Samaria and Galilee, Jesus (may peace be upon him) was met by ten lepers who begged him to heal them. Although he cured them all, only one of them, a Samaritan, a \u2018foreigner\u2019, came back to show gratitude and he was asked, \u2018Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine?\u2019 (Luke 17:11-17).\n\n\u201cMURIC calls on President Muhammadu Buhari to ignore those who are ungrateful to him. He should continue his good work. We ask him to reflect on the words of Allah where He said, \u2018What does Allah stand to gain if you show gratitude and belief? Allah is the One who shows gratitude (i.e. Allah is the One who knows how to reward good deeds) and He knows everything\u2019 (Glorious Qur\u2019an 4:147).\u201d",

In all, they took eight people from our residence. We also saw some of their colleagues bringing out other people mostly males from our neighbourhood and later went away with them.\n\n\u201cAbout seven gunmen stormed our residence, those that I saw with my eyes and two of them outside were about 30-year of age while those that came to pick us from our rooms were between ages 15 and 20,\u201d Hafsat said.\n\nSpeaking further on Sunday morning, Hafsat Kusfa confirmed the release of her father and mother, whom she said were immediately hospitalised because none of them could speak.\n\n\u201cFrom their condition, it is evident that they received severe beating from their abductors which made them ill,\u201d she said.\n\nUnconfirmed report, however, has it that a former bank manager was also abducted at his residence at Graceland area of Kwangila, Zaria, at about 9pm Friday night.\n\nN30m ransom on Ekiti farmer\n\nAlso, kidnappers of a successful farmer at Iyemero Ekiti in Ikole local government area of Ekiti state, Alhaji Jimoh Olodan, have demanded N30 million ransom for his release.\n\nOlodan was abducted Friday night when suspected herders invaded Elegure farm settlement, some few kilometres to Iyemero-Ekiti.\n\nIt was gathered that his captors, who wielded guns, had contacted the Olodan family and demanded a N30million ransom.\n\n\u201cThe people who kidnapped Alhaji Olodan had contacted the family asking for money that has caused a serious problem for the victim\u2019s relations.\n\n\u201cThey were asking for a sum of N30 million, which the family found to be too outrageous and they were not comfortable with such demand.\n\n\u201cThe family and the entire town are very cautious of the safety of the man, because of his role in the community. He is a successful farmer and one of those people looked up to in the community.\n\n\u201cThey are running around to be able to raise some money so that the man can be freed. The negotiation is still on with the abductors,\u201d said a source.\n\nBut spokesman of the state police command, Sunday Abutu, said the police were not aware of any negotiation.\n\n\u201cWe are not aware that they had contacted the family and asked for ransom. But I know that our men are combing the surrounding bushes in collaboration with local hunters and Amotekun corps,\u201d Abutu said.\n\nNiger on education\n\nMeanwhile, the Niger state government has said it would continue to give priority to the provision of high quality education and motivation of teachers despite the insecurity and attacks on educational institutions by bandits.\n\nThe state\u2019s Deputy Governor, Mohammed Ahmed Ketso stated this at the weekend in Minna.\n\nSpeaking at the Teachers Award Day ceremony organised by the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), the deputy governor said such situation won\u2019t deter the administration from sustainable development of the education system in the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe empowerment of teachers is a priority to us because we cannot raise the quality of students without first standardising the quality of those to impart knowledge and character on them.\u201d\n\nHe explained that government had taken adequate measures to provide security in schools and also secure lives and property, adding that teaching and learning can only flourish in peaceful atmosphere.\n\nSpeaking with journalists, chairman of the board, Dr. Isa Adamu, said pupils displaced by bandits have been placed under special learning arrangements whereby they receive lessons from teachers.\n\nUnder the arrangement, he said, pupils have contacts with teachers and \u201cthis is made possible by the fact that most of them are in the IDPs located in other school.\u201d\n\nHe said the board decided to honour some of the teachers with excellent records of performance as motivation, adding that some head teachers, principal and education secretaries were also honoured.",

          "text": "Chairman Senate Committee on Army Ali Ndume has counselled the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration against using foreign loans to finance recurrent expenditure like salaries and overhead.\n\nThe lawmaker, who represents Borno South Senatorial District in the National Assembly, stated this Sunday in a statement, to commemorate June 12 as the nation\u2019s Democracy Day.\n\nAs at the end of the first quarter of 2021, the nation\u2019s debt profile stands N33.10 trillion, a development that has remained a source of worry for Nigerians at both the high and low places.\n\nThe figure is an increase of N191billion, thus shooting it up from the N32.91trillion as at December 2020.\n\nJust last Wednesday, the Debt Management Office (DMO), said the figures include the debt stock of the federal, state governments and that of the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA).\n\nNdume warns\n\nSounding some warning, however, the former Senate Leader, Senator Ndume said, there was absolutely nothing wrong with a country taking foreign loans but that such should be spent to boost agriculture and the revival o moribund industries.\n\nNdume also said the loans meant to provide infrastructure should be obtained from international lending agencies with favourable terms.\n\nThe lawmaker further advised government to ensure that roads infrastructure were made to generate revenue by erecting toll plazas on them.\n\n\u201cConcerning the issue of foreign loan borrowings, the problem is not about borrowing because the idea is not bad. Even developed nations also do the same thing. It is what the government do with the money that is important.\n\n\u201cThe concentration on infrastructural development by the Buhari administration, especially in the area of railway and road infrastructure is commendable.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Government should look at the possibility of borrowing for agricultural development so that our people will move from subsistence farming to a mechanised one.\n\n\u201cIf that is achieved, it will generate employment and guarantee food security. Also, there would be no need for Nigeria to spend foreign exchange on food importation. We can produce all types of food in Nigeria only if the farmers are well funded.\n\n\u201cThe borrowings should be spent on purchase of farm implements and other farming machinery and make it available to farmers.\n\n\u201cThe external loans should also be used to fund moribund industries, especially textile and spare part manufacturing among others. It is only through that the government can guarantee borrowings because the manufacturing industries will come up again through the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe government can serve as a guarantee for the loans so that MAN would coordinate the process of resuscitating the moribund industries that had been closed down.\n\n\u201cThe loans should be borrowed from the international lending agencies whose terms are very good in order to develop our road infrastructure and mount toll plazas in order to generate revenue to pay back the loans.\n\n\u201cBorrowings should not be made to defray recurrent expenditure like payment of salaries and overhead costs. Funding for such purposes should be sourced locally from taxes and other internally generated revenues,\u201d he said.\n\nThe lawmaker commended the Buhari administration for the move to fund the nation\u2019s security and military services for the purpose of tackling insecurity.\n\nNdume said: \u201cOn the issue of insecurity, I have been advocating an increase in the military funding but that has now been done by the recent submission of the supplementary budget of over N800bn by the executive arm of government to the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cMajority of the money is meant to address the security challenges in the country. This is a commendable effort by President Buhari.\n\n\u201cWith this now, there is light at the end of the tunnel because if the materials and necessary military hardware and equipment are immediately purchased, and handed over to the military, I am sure that the Nigerian Army who are known for their gallantry in international assignments will be able to do more to defend the internal security challenges confronting Nigeria.\u201d\n\nWhile congratulating Nigerians on the commemoration of the June 12 as Democracy Day, the lawmaker \u201ccommend the President, Muhammadu Buhari, for his decision to be speaking out to Nigerians because the people have been eager and worried over his continued silence on critical national issues in recent times.\n\n\u201cMany Nigerians are now happy that their President has started talking to them once again. I therefore encourage him to be doing that intermittently, if possible, on quarterly basis.\u201d",

          "text": "Former governor of Edo State and One-time National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, John Odigie Oyegun, has warned President Muhammadu Buhari and the leadership of the ruling party not to wait till agitations from different sections of the country on restructuring snowball into a threat to national unity before addressing them.\n\nThe party chieftain said the earlier those issues are addressed the easier it is to diffuse the tensions currently building across the country.\n\nOyegun, who stated this at the public presentation of a book titled \u201cAPC\u2019s Litmus Tests\u201d written by the director-general of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGD) Mallam Salihu Moh. Lukman, stressed that the APC as the government of the federation, \u201cmust not give the impression that only military governments can fundamentally tamper with the basic structure of this nation.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe ideas of people from different parts of the country will be different up to the extent they want to go with the proposals in the document, but it is necessary.\n\n\u201cIt is vital that it is in fact, mandatory in the interest of the survival of our nation, that these issues be addressed. We cannot continue to allow the subjectto become something that threatens our nation at any turn.\n\n\u201cSo, the earlier we address it, the earlier we show that as a party we are responsive to the feelings of the people, the desires of the people and the wants of the people. \u201d It becomes easier then to diffuse the kind of stresses that the nation is passing through today. Look at what is happening. Well, it is recommended there should be State Police.\u201d\n\nOn the need to rebuild the APC from bottom to the top approach, Chief Oyegun warned against bending the party\u2019s rules.\n\n\u201cYou can stretch the rule. Never break it. Secondly, it is very fundamental that in all we do, the ranks-and-file members of the party and of parties generally, are able to see that even when they lose, they have been treated fairly, they have been treated decently because what I observed, I was made the Chairman of the reconciliation group in the South-south and in every single case, you have a situation where during elections, the civil war within the party alone, makes it impossible to think of it. Why is it civil war? Civil war because critical stakeholders in the party see that they have not been fairly, justly treated.\u201d\n\nFor the chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum and Kebbi state governor, Atiku Bagudu, said the APC is awared that there are fundamental challenges to be addressed and it will not shy away from acknowledging them and providing transparent leadership.\n\nBagudu said: \u201cThe party is not shy to acknowledge that our constitution is not perfect and again under John Oyegun, the El-Rufai Committee on True Federalism was created to look at those issues that we should do better about. APC believe is let us amend constitution because society is dynamic not because somebody has been wronged and cheated. If that is the basis for correction, then the agitation will never stop but if it\u2019s based on let us make it better, I believe the proposal which have been submitted to the National Assembly will help to produce amended Constitution that will meet most of the aspirations.\n\nIn her goodwill message, the mother of day and a former Nigerian envoy, Fatima Balla Abubakar, who said APC\u2019s popularity can be attributed, significantly, to President Muhammadu Buhari, called on the government to quickly address the growing social unrest for the party to regain confidence.\n\n\u201cAs the party in power which also has control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the APC must redouble its efforts to regain public confidence and trust which have been eroded in these deeply trying times. We cannot regain public confidence in our party as well as the government if we do not seriously address the growing social unrest due to growing mistrust between citizens main|y induced by poverty, lack ofjobs and livelihood. It is only when trust is rebuilt that we can restore peace.\n\n\u201cAs a government in power, APC needs to start thinking and doing things differently so that it can begin to deploy more people oriented policies to boost socio-economic growth and development and to provide more relief to the people.\n\n\u201cThe present situation in the country calls for more robust intellectual and policy oriented discussions and engagements by our party. We must engage with a spirit of transparency and inclusiveness. We must create a big tent where different views and positions are discussed without bitterness.\u201d\n\nWhile appreciating the APC government for his opportunity to serve, the author of the book, Salihu Moh. Lukman, said APC leaders have been working to address some of the foundational issues of democracy and that the book \u201cis a contribution to support initiatives of our leaders. All leaders and members of APC are therefore invited to engage challenges facing the party, government and the nation with every confidence and belief in the capacity of Nigerians to support every patriotic and nationalistic initiative. We much never allow the loud noise of selfish political entrepreneurs to hoodwink Nigerians into believing that our party and governments produced by our party have failed.\n\n\u201cIt will be a mockery of our political history to allow any narrative in the public space, which suggest that comparative to previous administrations since 1999, APC controlled administration led by President Muhammadu Buhari has failed. Like President Muhammadu Buhari himself has acknowledged, there are no doubt challenges facing the country, but no administration since 1999 has succeeded in completing projects, whether initiated by previous or current governments.\n\n\u201cJust on Thursday, June 10, 2021, President Buhari commissioned the Lagos \u2013 Ibadan railway, a project started and completed by his administration. And because leaders of PDP are shameless, they had the temerity to make a public statement calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to \u2018stop taking credit for projects not initiated by him.\u2019 May be they also want President Buhari and APC to acquire all their scandalous records, which include abandoning the construction of the PDP National Secretariat after mobilising billions on Naira.\u201d",

          "text": "Former National Chairman of the APC, John Odigie-Oyegun, has asked the federal government to take immediate steps to address the twin issues of restructuring and secession, saying if allowed to fester, more Nigerians could come up with fresh demands.\n\nOdigie-Oyegun gave the charge at the weekend in Abuja at the public presentation of APC\u2019s Litmus Tests, a book written by the Director General, Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum PGF, Salihu Mohammed Lukman.\n\nOdigie-Oyegun said Nigerian leaders must purge themselves of the belief that it was only the military that could tamper with the basic structure of the country, saying as a progressive party in power, the APC could also do it.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet me refer to just one aspect of what the governor (Bagudu) said.\n\nThat is the document on true federalism which the party put together that passed through all the organs of the party, the executive of the party, the National Working Committee, the caucus, the NEC which is the highest organ of the party. Why did we do it at that time?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe former Edo State governor, however, commended the President Muhammadu Buhari APC-led administration, saying if Nigerians could look wider, they would see that the incumbent administration had done a lot.\n\nNational Chairman of the APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee CECPC, Gov. Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State, on his part, said though the party was eight years old and six years in power, it still has no fewer than 54 years to go on the \u201cfirst tranche\u201d.\n\nRepresented by a member of the committee, Ismail Ahmed, the governor said: \u201cAPC is eight years in existence but we have been in government for the last six years and by God\u2019s grace, we have 54 more to go on the first tranche.\n\n\u201cAPC has gone through a lot, it is an amalgamation of different political parties. I want us to give a standing 20 second ovation to author of this book because he has done what a lot of people, simply, could not catalogue in a book.\u2019\u2019\n\nAlso speaking, Chairman of the Progressive Governors\u2019 Forum PGF and Governor of Kebbi State, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, said part of APC\u2019s litmus test had been in its ability to accept electoral outcomes, even when they do not favour the party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said: \u201cI scanned through the book and many issues the author has reflected upon and as to the title : APC\u2019s Litmus Test, I believe has shown APC to be different. It is not just that we won an election and defeated an incumbent party,\n\n\u2018\u2019Mr President led us to accept that it is okay for a ruling party to lose an election because even as APC, we lost bye-elections and we lost in general elections and we accepted the outcome. That is a litmus test, I believe, for the progression of democracy.\u2019\u2019\n\nGov. Bagudu added that the Governor Nasir el-Rufai Committee Report on True Federalism could help produce an amended constitution for Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe party is not shy to acknowledge that our Constitution is not perfect and again under John Oyegun, the El-Rufai Committee on True Federalism was created to look at those issues that we should do better about.\n\n\u2018\u2019APC belief is, let us amend the Constitution because society is dynamic not because somebody has been wronged and cheated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf that is the basis for correction, then the agitation will never stop but if it is based on let us make it better, I believe the proposal which have been submitted to the National Assembly will help to produce an amended Constitution that will meet most of the aspirations\u201d, he stated.\n\nOn Nigeria\u2019s inadequate budgetary provision for its developmental aspirations, Gov. Bagudu said: \u201cWhen one compares it (Nigerian budget) with the United States, a country with 331 million people, you find that in 2019, the United States federal budget was over $3.5 trillion and 1 per cent of $3.5 trillion is $35 billion.\n\n\u2018\u2019That means our budget is less than 1 per cent of the United States budget and yet, we are looking after a population that is about 70 per cent of the United States population. If one considers the actual distribution of revenue, it even reflects the truth.\n\n\u2018\u2019For example, from January this year to May, the Federation Allocations Account Committee meetings, there is no month yet, where the equivalent of $2 billion has been distributed. So, if things go this way, that means $24 billion will be distributed by the three tiers of government. Our spending per person is about $98 to $103 which is in the same league with Niger and Chad.\u2019\u2019\n\nAuthor of the book, Salihu Moh. Lukman for his part, made a dichotomy between the APC and the PDP, saying contrary to the position of some Nigerians, the APC was fundamentally different from the PDP.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said; \u201cMany would argue that both PDP and APC are the same, which is not valid. Between 2006 and 2013 alone, it was reported that N1.34 trillion was stolen by about 50 people; N146.84 billion by 15 former state governors; N654 billion by 11 people in business; N524 billion by eight bankers; N146 billion by 12 federal and state civil servants; and N7 billion by 4 former Ministers.\n\n\u201cFrom these accounts, what is very clear is that while under PDP\u2019s 16 years in control of the Federal Government, the country witnessed long lists of suspected cases of corruption, endless investigations, low convictions, and hardly any recovery, in the case of four years of APC, it is a different narrative.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the evidence speaks for itself as best summarised by the EFCC Chairman\u2019s account of the recoveries so far made which comprise N871 billion, 407 mansions and 703 convictions.\n\n\u201cA realistic estimation of the differences between the PDP and APC is represented by how the two parties handled the challenge of acquiring their National Secretariats.\n\n\u201cAfter ten years of work, the PDP abandoned the 12-storey National Secretariat project having expended over N6 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn contrast, within three years of existence (between 2013 and 2016) as a party, the APC was able to acquire a National Secretariat at the cost of N2.5 billion and has paid more than N500 million with about N1.9 billion outstanding\u201d.",

Among them, four will be missions with people on board, potentially propelling up to 12 Chinese astronauts into space \u2013 more than the 11 men and women that China has sent since 2003.\n\nThe craft will also carry into space the hopes of some in Earth\u2019s most populous nation.\n\n\u201cThe motherland is powerful,\u201d one person wrote on Chinese social media, which has lit up with well-wishes for the Shenzhou-12 crew. \u201cThe launch is a gift to the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party.\u201d\n\nChinese astronauts have had a relatively low international profile. A United States law banning NASA from any connection with China means its astronauts have not been to the more-than-two-decade-old International Space Station, visited by more than 240 men and women of various nationalities.\n\nChina, which aims to become a major spacefaring power by 2030, in May became the second country to put a rover on Mars, two years after landing the first spacecraft on the far side of the moon.\n\nIt also plans to put astronauts on the moon.\n\nThe Shenzhou-12 crew is to live on the Tianhe, \u201cHarmony of the Heavens\u201d, a cylinder 16.6 metres (55 feet) long and 4.2 metres (14 feet) in diameter.\n\nThe planned three-month stay would break the country\u2019s record of 30 days, set by the 2016 mission \u2013 China\u2019s last crewed flight \u2013 of Chen Dong and Jing Haipeng to a prototype station.\n\nThree men from China\u2019s first and second groups of astronauts will be on this mission, Yang Liwei, director of the China Manned Space Engineering Office and China\u2019s first astronaut, told the state-run news agency Global Times last month.\n\nChina\u2019s space bloggers speculate the astronauts will be Nie Haisheng \u2013 who at 56 would be the oldest Chinese astronaut sent into space, Deng Qingming, 55, and Ye Guangfu, 40.\n\nThe authorities typically do not announce a mission\u2019s crew until near or after the launch. China Manned Space did not respond to a Reuters news agency fax request for comment.\n\nThe oldest human in space was John Glenn, who flew on the space shuttle at age 77 in 1998 \u2013 after having been the first American to orbit the earth in 1962, a US senator and a presidential candidate.\n\nWhile no women are scheduled for the Shenzhou-12 mission, they are expected to participate in every following mission, Yang told the Global Times.\n\nTwo women, Liu Yang and Wang Yaping, were selected in 2011 among China\u2019s second cohort, after the first batch of 14 men in the mid-1990s. Liu was China\u2019s first woman in space in 2012, while Wang was the youngest, at 33, in 2013.\n\nChina began building its space station in April with the launch of Tianhe, the first and largest of its three modules. This year it aims to send a robotic cargo resupply spacecraft and three more astronauts, this time for a six-month stay.",

          "title": "Myanmar\u2019s Detained Aung San Suu Kyi to Face Court",
          "text": "After five years as the de facto leader of Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi finds herself in a familiar place: under house arrest while facing trumped-up charges levelled by a military dictatorship, with her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), on the verge of dissolution.\n\nOn Monday, four months since the military seized power in a coup, the hugely popular politician will face trial in a Naypyidaw court on five charges including the illegal possession of walkie-talkies and breaking coronavirus restrictions while campaigning for elections. Military officials have also accused her of corruption and violating the colonial-era Official Secrets Act.\n\nThere is a sense of finality about this showdown between Aung San Suu Kyi, and army chief and coup leader, Min Aung Hlaing.\n\nAt 75-years-old, Aung San Suu Kyi is facing prison sentences that could put her in jail for the rest of her life, permanently sidelining her from a political arena she has defined for decades. Meanwhile, many of her supporters have moved beyond her past calls for non-violent resistance and gradual reform, instead endorsing armed revolt and the total overthrow of the military regime.\n\n\u201cThis time around, there is no indication that the regime plans to release Aung San Suu Kyi, allow her to communicate with her supporters, or use her as a bargaining chip in its relations with the outside world. Rather, Min Aung Hlaing wants to have a free hand to shape the political landscape free from the influence of her and the NLD,\u201d said Richard Horsey, a political analyst with decades of experience in Myanmar.\n\nDespite being largely shut off from the outside world for the last four months, she still occupies a central role in the continuing political crisis. Before the generals violently cracked down on protests, killing more than 850 civilians, posters and banners featuring Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s face were a mainstay at most demonstrations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s far too early to write her off. She is without a doubt by far the most popular political figure in the country, no one else even comes close,\u201d said Thant Myint-U, historian and author of the Hidden History of Burma.\n\nAung San Suu Kyi emerged as a political force during the 1988 uprisings against a previous military regime, perfectly primed to take the helm of Myanmar\u2019s pro-democracy movement during a period of instability. The daughter of independence icon Aung San, she had just returned from the United Kingdom, where she studied at Oxford and had married a British man.\n\nShe became synonymous with Myanmar\u2019s pro-democracy movement and earned the respect of millions by sacrificing her freedom and safety for the cause, winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. She spent years in and out of house arrest and survived an assassination attempt in 2003 that left dozens, possibly hundreds, dead. Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s education and international recognition was also a source of admiration for many of her followers.\n\nBut while this was a strength in the eyes of many, it was an insult to the ultra-nationalist military, also known as the Tatmadaw, which often insulted the \u201cforeigner\u2019s wife\u201d.\n\nIn 2008, before allowing elections, the military regime drafted a new constitution that allowed it to retain control of several key institutions and guaranteed it 25 percent of the seats in parliament. It also added a clause banning anyone with a foreign husband or children from serving as president, which many saw as being directly aimed at Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nWith the help of a constitutional lawyer named Ko Ni, she found a way around this prohibition, taking on the role of state counsellor after the NLD\u2019s first election victory in 2015. Two years later, Ko Ni was shot dead.\n\nBut while she was a global superstar as an activist, many of her biggest supporters were disappointed once she was in power.\n\nIn 2017, hundreds of thousands of mostly Muslim Rohingya fled into Bangladesh as the military unleashed a brutal crackdown in the western state of Rakhine.\n\nThe Nobel Prize winner did not condemn the military\u2019s actions and, after a case of genocide was brought before the International Court of Justice in The Hague, she travelled to the Netherlands to defend what the generals had done.\n\n\u201cAung San Suu Kyi\u2019s domestic popularity only grew as she transitioned from dissident to national leader. Internationally, she fell spectacularly from grace as a result of the violence against the Rohingya, in which she was seen as complicit by denying the extent of abuses and defending the military,\u201d said Horsey.\n\nActivist and protest leader Thinzar Shunlei Yi is one of many young human rights defenders who grew up idolising Aung San Suu Kyi, only to be let down by her time in power.\n\n\u201cShe was the reason why I became a woman human rights defender,\u201d she said. But as violence against the Rohingya grew, Thinzar Shunlei Yi became one of the only people to speak out against it, putting her at odds with her hero and her throngs of supporters.\n\n\u201cI was outspoken against her and got a lot of backfire,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was not just during the Rohingya crisis where Aung San Suu Kyi failed to live up to expectations. \u201cShe was also seen as deserting her human rights principles when in government in other ways, including her treatment of the free media, civil society and ethnic minority rights,\u201d Horsey explained.\n\nWhen two Reuters journalists were arrested for exposing the military killings of Rohingya civilians, Aung San Suu Kyi said the case \u201chad nothing to do with freedom of expression at all\u201d. During her time in power, journalists and Facebook users faced criminal charges for criticising NLD politicians.\n\nWith NLD leadership scattered or in prison after the coup, more progressive activists like Thinzar Shunlei Yi found themselves spearheading the initial resistance movement. They called for increasingly radical change, like abolishing the military-drafted 2008 constitution, the complete removal of the military from politics, the reform of the discriminatory 1982 Citizenship Law which helped render the Rohingya stateless, and armed revolution rather than non-violent resistance.\n\nThese positions were eventually endorsed by the National Unity Government, a parallel government set up by elected legislators in defiance of the military regime. Thinzar Shunlei Yi recognised that Aung San Suu Kyi is still \u201cso influential\u201d in the pro-democracy movement, but also worried that her influence could be double-edged.\n\n\u201cEven in this revolution where many people go starving and running for their lives, people still think about her situation and weep for her,\u201d she said. This can help motivate people even when they are beleaguered and losing hope.\n\nBut Aung San Suu Kyi might not agree with the armed revolt, abolishing the constitution, or accepting the Rohingya as citizens. \u201cWe wonder what if she says something against the current revolution, things would go upside down,\u201d Thinzar Shunlei Yi said.\n\nWhile some have argued that Aung San Suu Kyi backed the military on the Rohingya crisis due to a fear of a coup or a need to appeal to a nationalist voter base, others say her position simply reflected her genuine beliefs on the issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not at all clear that her position on the Rohingya was driven by political considerations,\u201d Horsey said. \u201cBut it certainly meant that, at the time of the coup, she had a much-diminished international reputation at a time when she needed international support the most.\u201d\n\nAltogether, Aung San Suu Kyi is facing seven criminal charges; five in the capital city of Naypyidaw, one at the Supreme Court and a recently added corruption accusation.\n\nHer lawyers are among the only people who have had access to the detained leader since her arrest in February. The leader of her legal team, Khin Maung Zaw, told Al Jazeera they met with Aung San Suu Kyi and deposed president Win Myint on Monday, June 7. Khin Maung Zaw said the five cases in Naypyidaw were classified as \u201csimple\u201d, with hearings to be held every Monday and Tuesday until the end of the month.\n\nFor the Supreme Court case, he said the court marked Aung San Suu Kyi down as defending herself, something Khin Maung Zaw said was done \u201cwithout her knowledge and consent\u201d.\n\n\u201cShe further said that she told the persons who kept her in custody that she wouldn\u2019t defend her cases without a lawyer,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that while Aung San Suu Kyi has not been satisfied with the military\u2019s arrangement to deliver her medicine regularly, she and the other two politicians \u201cseemed to be in good health\u201d.\n\nWhen asked about her spirits, Khin Maung Zaw said, \u201cUnlike me, she\u2019s full of optimism\u201d.\n\nOn Wednesday, the military revealed new corruption charges against Aung San Suu Kyi for allegedly taking bribes and leasing land at discounted rates, which carry an additional prison sentence of 15 years.\n\nKhin Maung Zaw said the latest accusation is \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cgroundless\u201d. \u201cShe might have defects but personal greed and corruption is not her traits,\u201d he said, calling her \u201cincorruptible\u201d.\n\nGiven the nature of the trials, Thinzar Shunlei Yi has encouraged Aung San Suu Kyi to \u201cjoin CDM\u201d by \u201cboycotting the judicial system\u201d. CDM stands for the Civil Disobedience Movement, a mass strike of civil servants refusing to work under the military regime.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust the domestic judicial system and I don\u2019t think the [military] will do a fair trial for her and other leaders,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile the outcome of the trial appears inevitable, Thant Myint-U says that what happened in Myanmar was not.\n\n\u201cThere was no way the army was going to agree to constitutional reform,\u201d Thant Myint-U said. \u201cBut a visionary economic agenda that brought in billions in fresh investment and created millions of new jobs, together with measures to fight discrimination, build a more inclusive national identity, and work closely with civil society, could have outflanked the army leadership, and perhaps even won over many in the officer corps.\u201d",

          "title": "CNN: Twitter Needs India and Nigeria to Grow. It\u2019s Running into Trouble in Both",
          "text": "Twitter is under siege in two countries that are critical for its global growth plans.\n\nThe social media giant has been ensnared in a battle with the Indian government for months over free speech and other issues, and is contending with restrictive new rules pushed by New Delhi. If that wasn\u2019t enough, even more dramatic events are unfolding thousands of miles away along Africa\u2019s Western coast.\n\nNigeria last week \u201cindefinitely\u201d blocked Twitter (TWTR) after the company deleted a post from President Muhammadu Buhari that threatened a brutal clampdown on unrest in Africa\u2019s most populous nation. The Nigerian government also ordered federal prosecutors to arrest users of the app.\n\nThe restrictions in India and the ban in Nigeria are troublesome for Twitter. While the company does not break down user data for these countries, independent research suggests India is among its top five markets. Asia\u2019s third-largest economy \u2014 with its 700 million internet users and many more yet to come online \u2014 is also Twitter\u2019s top growth market. Meanwhile, nearly 20% of Nigeria\u2019s population of 200 million have Twitter accounts, according to NOI Polls.\n\nNow that Nigeria has shown it isn\u2019t afraid to ban Twitter, some worry India might be next if the tussle between New Delhi and the company can\u2019t be resolved.\n\n\u201cIf this continues, the Indian government\u2019s China Envy will become Nigeria Envy,\u201d tweeted internet activist Nikhil Pahwa, the Delhi-based founder of tech website MediaNama.\n\n\u201cYou may see more calls for banning Twitter in India, if it continues to defy the government,\u201d Pahwa told CNN Business.\n\nThe Silicon Valley-based company\u2019s response to political pressure in these countries will decide its trajectory in fast-growing economies that are critical to any global expansion strategy. Successfully navigating the tensions could give other American technology firms a roadmap for dealing with governments that have increasingly authoritarian tendencies.\n\nNew challenges abroad coincide with strains at home, where Washington has shown a willingness to rein in American tech giants. And it doesn\u2019t help that former US President Donald Trump \u2014 who is currently banned from Twitter and Facebook (FB) \u2014 has urged other countries to follow Nigeria\u2019s example.\n\nMonths of tensions have led to Twitter\u2019s problems in both Nigeria and India.\n\nNigerians felt snubbed by Twitter when the company decided earlier this year to set up its first Africa base in Ghana, instead of the continent\u2019s largest economy.\n\nEven though almost 40 million Nigerians have a Twitter account \u2014 more than the entire population of Ghana \u2014 there are some geopolitical considerations that might have influenced Twitter\u2019s decision. Ghana ranked 13 places higher than Nigeria in 2019 on the World Bank\u2019s \u201cEase of Doing Business Index.\u201d When announcing the decision in April, Twitter described Ghana \u201cas a champion for democracy, a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet.\u201d\n\nTensions escalated this month when Twitter deleted the post by Buhari for violating its policies on abusive behavior.\n\nThe country countered Twitter\u2019s decision by banning the platform for allowing the use of \u201cactivities that are capable of undermining Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence,\u201d according to Nigeria\u2019s Ministry of Information and Culture. In an interview with news agency AFP, the ministry said it would reinstate Twitter if it \u201cregisters as a company in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe company, meanwhile, has said it \u201cwill work to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to communicate and connect with the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria ban will definitely get many other emerging economies thinking about how to also get the attention of platforms,\u201d Gbenga Sesan, executive director of Paradigm Initiative, which works on digital inclusion and rights in Africa, told CNN Business. He added that if Twitter meets Nigeria\u2019s new registration requirements, \u201cthen such countries could try the same approach in order to get tax revenues.\u201d\n\nIn India, tensions were ignited in February as protesters used Twitter to voice their opinions against Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s new agriculture laws. The company clashed with the government over an order to take down accounts at the IT Ministry\u2019s behest, ultimately complying in part but refusing to take action against journalists, activists or politicians.\n\nIn May, police turned up at Twitter\u2019s office in New Delhi after the company decided to label a tweet from a spokesperson for Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party as \u201cmanipulated media.\u201d Police said the visit was \u201cpart of a routine process\u201d to get Twitter to cooperate with its investigation. The social media company blasted the move as \u201cintimidation tactics\u201d and said that it was \u201cconcerned\u201d about the safety its employees in the country.\n\nIndia\u2019s new rules for social media have only intensified the chill. They include demands that companies create special roles in India to keep them in compliance with local law, and for firms to stay in contact with law enforcement 24/7. There are also requirements that services remove some types of content, including posts that feature \u201cfull or partial nudity.\u201d\n\nTwitter has said it has concerns about \u201ccore elements of the new IT Rules,\u201d and the \u201cpotential threat to freedom of speech\u201d in the country. But Modi\u2019s government says the company is trying to \u201cundermine India\u2019s legal system\u201d by its \u201cdeliberate defiance\u201d of the rules.\n\n\u201cTwitter needs to stop beating around the bush and comply with the laws of the land,\u201d the government said in a statement in May. \u201cLaw making and policy formulations is the sole prerogative of the sovereign and Twitter is just a social media platform and it has no [place] in dictating what \u2026 India\u2019s legal policy framework should be.\u201d\n\nFor many in India, the debate around social media usage in the country is not so much about freedom of speech but rather about a foreign company challenging the might of the Indian government, Pahwa told CNN Business. He added that the ban in Nigeria \u201cadds more fuel to that fire.\u201d\n\nIn order to survive and thrive in these emerging economies, companies like Twitter may have to invest more in local teams and understanding local laws, experts said.\n\nAnd government pressure may already be weakening Twitter\u2019s resolve.\n\nAfter signaling its reservations with the new social media rules last month, the company has now said it remains \u201cdeeply committed\u201d to India, which is among its largest markets in the world.\n\n\u201cWe have assured the Government of India that Twitter is making every effort to comply with the new guidelines, and an overview on our progress has been duly shared,\u201d the company said in a statement this week. \u201cWe will continue our constructive dialogue with the Indian government.\u201d\n\nFor Vivan Sharan, partner at Delhi-based tech policy consulting firm Koan Advisory Group, the Nigeria shutdown and the debate in India may be a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for western social media companies to \u201cgrow local capacity to moderate content, and devolve decision making to country offices.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is of course a tall order for new-age companies that are used to global scale and presence, without commensurately large investments on the ground,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMost social media majors spend the largest share of their operational bandwidth on developed markets. This paradigm is untenable and is now beginning to shift,\u201d he added. \u201cCompanies that don\u2019t double down on localization in emerging markets, may find themselves on the wrong side of the splinternet.\u201d",

          "title": "With Military Victory Elusive, West African Nations Quietly Back Talks with Islamists",
          "text": "Two years after local emir Djibril Diallo fled his home in northern Burkina Faso following death threats from Islamist militants, he received an unexpected request: to return and take part in peace talks with the same people who wanted him dead.\n\nAdama Ouedraogo, deputy mayor of Diallo\u2019s hometown of Thiou, called him in January to help negotiate an end to years of attacks by jihadists against local militias and civilians that forced thousands of people to flee the area.\n\n\u201cI told them that if everyone was sincere, I could return,\u201d said Diallo, a traditional chief to Fulani herders.\n\nFor a decade, West African armies and their international allies have fought against militant groups active in the Sahel region, some linked to the al Qaeda and Islamic State networks.\n\nThey have had limited success. Attacks on civilians still occur most weeks and large areas remain outside government control. Hundreds of soldiers have been killed since militants first seized control of swathes of Mali in 2012.\n\nNow, in the worst-hit parts of Burkina Faso and neighbouring Mali, local leaders are pursuing unofficial talks with militants. The governments do not publicly acknowledge the discussions, but five sources involved in them told Reuters the authorities have been quietly supportive.\n\nMilitary ally and former colonial power France, which has 5,100 troops in the region supporting local forces, says the militants will exploit truces to regroup, rearm and recruit.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron reiterated his opposition to talks on Thursday, telling reporters that French troops would not conduct joint operations with countries that \u201cdecide to negotiate with groups that \u2026 shoot at our children\u201d.\n\nYet there are tentative signs that the outreach may be helping stem bloodshed in localities where it is happening.\n\nData collected by the U.S-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) for the Nord, Sahel and Boucle de Mouhoun regions show significant reductions in conflict-related fatalities, although other factors, including recent military offensives, could have played a role.\n\nIn the Nord, the number of deaths from battles and violence against civilians dropped from 65 in the first quarter of 2020 to 26 in the first quarter of 2021. In the Sahel, they fell from 487 to 191 and in the Boucle de Mouhoun, from 66 to zero.\n\nMahamadou Sawadogo, a researcher on security issues and former Burkinabe gendarme, said such truces had led to an easing of violence, but cautioned that their scope was limited to specific localities.\n\nA June 4-5 attack on Solhan village near the border with Niger, in which at least 132 people died, underlined how dangerous the region remains. The village was not known to have negotiated an agreement with jihadists.\n\nIn Thiou, located on an expanse of arid scrubland about 20 km from the Malian border, Diallo and others struck a truce in February with militants who say they are connected to al Qaeda\u2019s regional JNIM affiliate.\n\nCommerce is flowing freely again and thousands of displaced people have returned, Diallo said.\n\nIdrissa Diallo, a restaurant owner in town who is not related to Djibril Diallo but shares a last name common among Fulanis, fled to Ivory Coast in 2019 after the jihadists began clashing with local vigilante groups.\n\nHe came home following the talks.\n\n\u201cCalm has been restored,\u201d he said, shifting small pieces of meat and onions over smouldering charcoals. \u201cI started to work a little, and there are lots of clients who come.\u201d\n\nThe first meetings took place in December in the secrecy of a forest outside Thiou, in Burkina Faso\u2019s Nord region, according to deputy mayor Ouedraogo.\n\nThey were organised by Ouedraogo, who said he had kept in touch with some people who joined the militants. He was accompanied by the head of a group of volunteer fighters who are backed by the army and oppose the jihadists.\n\n\u201cAt the start of the negotiations, it wasn\u2019t at all easy,\u201d Ouedraogo recalled. \u201cThe jihadists came with lots of weapons.\u201d\n\nThey met seven times before both sides agreed to more formal talks. Ouedraogo informed the mayor, village chiefs and Diallo, an authoritative figure among Fulani herdsmen whom the jihadists considered a worthy interlocutor despite having threatened him.\n\nDiallo joined the process and, after another meeting, jihadists reported back to their superiors, he said.\n\nThiou\u2019s mayor updated the regional governor, a federal government appointee, according to Diallo and two others who participated in the talks but asked not be named.\n\nThe mayor declined to comment when asked about the contacts, and the governor did not respond to requests for comment. A government spokesperson said the negotiations were a local initiative and declined to respond to specific questions.\n\nThen, in February, about 400 jihadist fighters, including some from Mali where al Qaeda\u2019s powerful JNIM branch is based, came to seal the peace, said Ouedraogo.\n\nThe jihadists\u2019 main condition was that the volunteer fighters, whom the jihadists accused of stealing motorcycles and cattle and killing civilians suspected of sympathising with the Islamists, cease their patrols.\n\nThe negotiators agreed and allowed the jihadists and their family members to trade at the market and receive medical care in town, according to Ouedraogo and Diallo.\n\nThe jihadists vowed to cease attacks and to lift blockades.\n\nFRENCH OPPOSITION\n\nAuthorities have been constrained by French opposition to negotiating with militants, said a source involved in talks in Burkina Faso and Mali, adding that time was of the essence while contact with militants appeared to be bearing fruit.\n\nAt a news conference on Thursday where he announced France would end its military operation in the Sahel and incorporate its forces into a broader international campaign, Macron threatened to stop working with countries that negotiate with jihadists.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to explain to the parents of a French soldier who fell on the battlefield that I am sending back his brothers in arms to fight alongside an army that has decided to negotiate with his assailants,\u201d Macron said.\n\nDecrying \u201cambiguity\u201d on the matter, Macron said one condition for France to resume joint military operations with Mali\u2019s army \u2013 suspended after a coup last month \u2013 would be a Malian commitment not to negotiate with the militants.\n\nMali\u2019s leaders have publicly endorsed the idea of talks, but they have kept concrete moves to pursue negotiations quiet.\n\nIn the Niono Circle in central Mali, representatives of the High Islamic Council (HCI), the country\u2019s main Muslim body, led negotiations earlier this year with al Qaeda-linked militants that resulted in a peace deal in March, said Bocary Diallo, one of the HCI negotiators.\n\nDiallo said the organisation was given the go-ahead at a meeting attended by religious leaders and four government ministers, but that the government never officially signed off on it.\n\nMali\u2019s presidency and the ministry of national reconciliation did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nReuters",
