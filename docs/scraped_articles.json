The OPC, Gani Adams, and the agitation for the Oduduwa Republic on the eve of June 12 made the North support Obasanjo; he did not even win his polling booth.\n\n\u201cThe militancy in the South-South and the kidnapping in the region led a president from the South-South in the person of Goodluck Jonathan; they were even demanding for the Niger Delta Republic. They were violently abducting expatriates from the Niger Delta.\n\n\u201cCome to the North, a lot of foreign hoodlums and criminals were imported into Nigeria to ensure that Jonathan\u2019s regime was abrogated; even the Governor of Kaduna confessed that foreign elements were imported for a purpose and these foreign elements are responsible for these insecurities. These were what led to the emergence of Buhari as President.\n\n\u201cBoko Haram was demanding for the Islamic Republic, so what has Nnamdi Kanu done that is different from what others did. Remember that Kanu was non-violent until the Nigerian security started killing them; there were massacres across Igboland.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget that Nnamdi Kanu and his group were very peaceful; before him was Uwazuruike, who was very peaceful in their \u201cagitation, but the Nigerian security that is largely untrained started killing them.\n\n\u201cSo, if Nigeria is a nation that wants to move forward, this could have been the best time to prove to the world that they want to build an inclusive nation. Nnamdi Kanu\u2019s agitation should have catapulted them and made it very easy and necessary for the Igbos to have the Presidency for eight years. So, to say that Nnamdi Kanu made it impossible is not true.\n\n\u201cThe sinister ways of doing things in Nigeria and the conspiracy that has not allowed Nigeria to progress is what caused it and not Nnamdi Kanu.\u201d",

          "text": "By Wilfred Eya\n\nFormer Vice President Atiku Abubakar may have won Saturday\u2019s presidential primaries of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) but it would take him some time to recover from the challenge he got from the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike.\n\nA former National chairman of the PDP who did not want his name mentioned told Daily Sun that even in the early hours of the day of the primaries, members of Atiku\u2019s camp were jittery that the Rivers governor, also an aspirant in the race, would carry the day.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nHe said that unlike in 2019 when Atiku was easily the favoured aspirant because of his deep pocket, Saturday\u2019s exercise was a different ball game as Governor Wike had the war chest which the PDP candidate could not match.\n\nHe said that Atiku became so afraid of Wike\u2019s popularity that he told his close allies that the PDP governors had ganged up against him.\n\nOur source said that when Atiku literally saw his routing by the Rivers governor starring him in the face, he raised the alarm with the Northern Elders.\n\nBreaking!!!

Click Here For Details .\n\nLed by a former National Security Adviser, Gen Aliyu Gusau (rtd.), and a former governor of Sokoto State, Attahiru Bafarawa, he said the leaders went into the crucial meeting to try and reduce the number of northern aspirants to one.\n\nIt was learnt that the northern leaders insisted that a particular candidate from the southern part of the country should not be allowed to win the election.\n\nOur source which was privy to the meeting told Daily Sun that the aspirants from the North were asked to step down for Atiku, who they considered as having national spread more than the others.\n\nIt was gathered that Gusau, who was also in Port Harcourt, Rivers State four years ago when Atiku was elected as the party\u2019s presidential candidate, told the aspirants that he was speaking the minds of the entire northern leaders.\n\n\u201cThe northern leaders felt that Atiku would be better in managing the country and that there is nothing the ruling party or the Federal Government would say about him that had not been said.\n\n\u201cThey were of the opinion that no anti-corruption agency will harass him anymore and that he also has national spread\u201d, our source said.\n\nIt was also gathered that Hayatu-Deen agreed to step down after the meeting, but Tambuwal and others said they would consider it.\n\n\u201cTambuwal said he would speak at the convention ground, while others said they would speak to their delegates on what to do,\u201d the source added.\n\nImmediately after Tambuwal announced his withdrawal, he said Atiku took to his Twitter handle to hail the decision.\n\nHe also said he was looking forward to working with the former Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\nAtiku tweeted: \u201cThank you, H.E @AWTambuwal, for your spirited campaign. I look forward to working with you as we unite our party and our country.\u201d\n\nThe announcement was said to have come as a shock to Wike, who was a solid supporter of Tambuwal when the latter vied for the same ticket in 2019. The outcome of the 2019 national convention which was hosted in Port Harcourt, was said to have irked the governor, who allegedly felt that a former National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus, ought to have helped to sway in favour of his friend, Tambuwal.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nThe unresolved crisis between Wike and Secondus as a result of the 2019 convention was said to have resulted in the removal of the former national chairman of the party, which was engineered by the governor.\n\nA source close to the party\u2019s top hierarchy said: \u201cIt is better we have someone like Atiku.\n\n\u201cHe is calm and has listening ears. He is experienced and has his supporters everywhere in the country. That\u2019s why we gave him the ticket.\u201d\n\nAfter the initial shock and horse-trading in the build up to the exercise, Atiku eventually beat 12 other challengers to emerge the candidate of the PDP for the 2023 presidential election.\n\nThis is the second time in a row that he would win the PDP\u2019s nomination, having won it also in 2019.\n\nThe former Vice President won the primary by 371 votes to defeat his closest challenger, Governor Wike, who poled 237 votes, while a former President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki, scored 70 votes.\n\nGovernor Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom State got 38 votes; Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, scored 20 votes; a former Senate President, Pius Anyim, got 14 votes, while a former President of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria, Sam Ohuabunwa, polled only one vote.\n\nIn his acceptance speech after he was pronounced as the PDP candidate by the Chairman of the Convention Planning Committee, Senator David Mark, Atiku extended a hand of fellowship to the defeated aspirants and pledged to work with them to ensure victory for the party.\n\nHe described the primary as one of the freest elections to be conducted by the party, saying, \u201cToday marks another milestone in the process to consolidate our democratic gains.\u201d\n\nAtiku said if elected President, he would unify the country, deal with insecurity and revamp the economy.\n\nHe accused the APC government of polarising the country, stating, \u201cI pledge to unify the country that is why I refer to myself as a unifier. Unity is very important because the government of the APC has disunited Nigerians completely.\u201d\n\nThe PDP presidential candidate could be likened to a cat with nine lives. His political trajectory is a story of ups and downs.\n\nAs a veteran politician, Mr. Atiku doesn\u2019t seem to have lost an ounce of his zeal, despite several setbacks in his quest to occupy Aso Rock, since the days of the erratic political transitions during the army-led polity of the late 1980s, no thanks to the long-winding transition programme of the then Head of state, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida.\n\nAtiku cut his teeth under the wily and politically astute Gen. Shehu Musa Yar\u2019Adua, a strategist and power wheeler-dealer. Of all the folks who had their tutelage under the late Katsina-born general, Atiku has turned out to be the most enduring, politically. He is also the most successful, becoming the VP under President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\nOn July 16, 1999, Atiku and his running mate had just won the governorship election of Adamawa State under the platform of PDP in an election conducted by INEC.\n\nHowever, before their swearing in, the then PDP Presidential candidate, Chief Obasanjo, just out of prison and desperately in need of a strong political machinery to realize his presidential ambition saw the usefulness of Atiku as head of the political structure of late Musa Yar\u2019Adua and thus, persuaded him to renounce his mandate and be appointed his running mate.\n\nUpon his acceptance of the offer from Obasanjo as running mate by Atiku, INEC as the electoral umpire officially wrote to Atiku of its decision to conduct a Bye_Election to fill the governorship vacancy he had left behind. However, Boni Haruna, the Deputy governor Elect, and the PDP, would have none of the INEC decision to conduct another election, as according to them, the fact of Boni Haruna\u2019s victory at the poll had already conferred on him certain constitutional rights that entitled him to be automatically sworn in as the governor following Atiku\u2019s abandonment of his mandate.\n\nAnd so, to the court they all went to ventilate their grievances. The matter commenced at the Federal High court and raged on until it finally berthed at the apex court. At the Supreme Court, it became necessary for the court to interpret Section 45 of the then Decree 3 of 1999 (now the 1999 constitution) which provides for the conditions under which a Deputy Governor may be sworn in as governor. It is clear when a deputy governor could be sworn in to replace the governor.\n\nIt never contemplated such abandonment as in the case of Atiku. However, finding itself in such a challenge demanding the assertion of its role of social engineering, the Supreme Court, in a split decision, felt a need to advance a remedy for the situation. At the end, While Atiku headed to Abuja as vice president, Boni Haruna became the governor of Adamawa State.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

If you ask me, I cannot say, I will not be convinced by any argument by anybody on why we were not given the ticket. I made it clear that it is a very bitter pill for the South East to swallow and we are looking forward to how the PDP will ameliorate that decision it took\u201d, he said.\n\nNwodo, former governor of Enugu State during the aborted Third Republic regretted that despite the appeals by eminent members of the party that the zoning arrangement of the PDP, by which it is the turn of the south, particularly, the South East to produce the presidential candidate for 2023, the party\u2019s National Working Committee (NWC), decided to throw the contest open to all.\n\n\u2022Tinubu seeks issues-based campaigns\n\nFrontline APC presidential aspirant, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, charged Atiku to base his campaigns on issues.\n\nIn a statement in Abuja, he commended him for his patriotism and commitment to Nigeria\u2019s progress, but warned that Nigerians would ask him pertinent questions during the campaigns.\n\nHe said Abubakar must be prepared to tell Nigerians how he planned to reverse his party\u2019s ruination of Nigeria\u2019s prospects during its 16 years governance between 1999 and 2015.\n\nTinubu said he expected Abubakar, who was also the 2019 presidential candidate of the PDP, to be his worthy opponent, \u201cby the grace of God and the support of APC\u2019s delegates at the coming 2023 president election\u2019.\u2019\n\nHe said the PDP and its candidate would unfortunately be burdened to explain why Nigerians should give it another opportunity, after being in government at the centre for 16 years without much to show.\n\nAccording to Tinubu, Nigerians are yet to forget the national ruin and mismanagement of the country for 16 years by successive PDP administrations.\n\nThe two-term Lagos State governor stressed that this bad memory would dog the campaign of the PDP candidate.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, I once again congratulate our former vice-president for his victory at his party\u2019s primary election,\u2019\u2019 Tinubu said.\n\nHe added that Abubakar\u2019s victory did not come as a surprise to Nigerians because of his vast experience as a statesman and veteran of many presidential contests since 1993.\n\nHe welcomed the PDP candidate to the race, stressing that the 2023 election campaigns should be about issues that would improve the quality of life of Nigerians.\n\nHe added that the election should also bring peace, progress, political stability and solve myriad of the socio political challenges and insecurity currently facing the country.\n\n\u201cI welcome the victory of Alhaji Atiku Abubakar as the candidate of the PDP at the just-concluded primary election. I look forward to squaring up with him as a worthy opponent at the coming election.\n\n\u201cI have known the former vice-president as a formidable politician and a patriot who believes in the unity and progress of our dear country.\n\n\u201cAs we move further into the election season, I charge the PDP presidential candidate and all political actors across party lines that we should make this election season one that is devoid of bitterness, rancour and strife.\n\n\u201cWe should make our campaigns peaceful and issues-based; election season should be a festival of ideas that will uplift our country and improve the living condition of all our people,\u2019\u2019 Tinubu stressed.\n\nHe also congratulated the other PDP contestants for the orderly and peaceful way they conducted themselves and their resolve and pledge to rally round the Abubakar in the true spirit of democratic sportsmanship.\n\nHe said the party jettisoned the zoning agreement that power should rotate to the south, particularly the South East in 2023 when the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party decided to throw the race open to all.\n\nHe said aspirants from the South East participated in the primary but regretted that the outcome was painful and left a sour taste in the mouth of the South East, which has shown unflinching loyalty to the PDP since 1999.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

This licensing follows a visit to Nigeria by the company\u2019s team in May last year to discuss the possibility of obtaining a licence. Starlink which currently operates in 36 countries has over 400,000 subscribers around the world.\n\n\u201cThe company received two licenses, which include the International Gateway license and Internet Service Provider (ISP) license, and will be trading as Starlink Internet Services Nigeria Ltd. According to NCC, the International Gateway license has a 10-year tenure while the ISP license is to last for five years. Both licenses take effect from May 2022 and may be renewed after the expiration,\u201d per Nairametrics.\n\nStarlink approved by Nigeria \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec & Mozambique \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddffhttps://t.co/Q1VvqVmJ2i \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 27, 2022\n\nStarlink is a low latency broadband internet system created to meet the needs of consumers in rural areas with low internet penetration across the globe. In simpler terms, it delivers super-fast internet via satellites to rural areas. It is theoretically capable of delivering 150Mbps internet speeds to any place on the planet. All the customer needs is a clear view of the sky.\n\nStarlink enters a Nigerian Internet service provider space that is dominated by telcos like MTN and Airtel, as well as individual ISPs such as Spectranet, SMILE and others.\n\nCompared to existing similar internet plans in Nigeria which cost an average of $50, Starlink is a more expensive option costing $599 (~\u20a6330,000) for a full kit, including a terminal, mounting tripod, and Wi-Fi router, then a $110 (~\u20a660,500) for preorder and monthly subscription. Its premium service costs about $2,500 (~\u20a61.375 million) for the full kit and $500 (~\u20a6275,000) monthly.\n\nThis price range is deemed expensive for the average Nigerian, except it introduces a different offering for the Nigerian Market.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn How I Work, we talk to some of the smartest people across various fields in Africa to understand how they use technology to enhance their productivity.\n\nAfter a long hiatus, we\u2019re back! And we\u2019re beginning with Peace Itimi. Peace needs no introduction to players in the digital marketing space. She has built a reputation for herself through her work with several local and international brands, her training programs, and more famously, her YouTube show Founders Connect. She talks about how her career started as an undergraduate, juggling multiple projects, and how she stays productive.\n\nCurrent role : Head of Growth for Stax, an offline payment super-app for Africans\n\n: Head of Growth for Stax, an offline payment super-app for Africans Location : London, UK\n\n: London, UK Current computer : 14\u2011inch MacBook Pro \u2013 Space Grey \u2013 M1 Pro\n\n: 14\u2011inch MacBook Pro \u2013 Space Grey \u2013 M1 Pro Current mobile device : iPhone 12 Pro\n\n: iPhone 12 Pro Camera : Sony Alpha 6400 | APS-C Mirrorless Camera\n\n: Sony Alpha 6400 | APS-C Mirrorless Camera Describe how you work in one word: Efficiently\n\nTell us briefly how you started out and how you got where you are today\n\nBack in school, I was a Google Student Ambassador (GSA). We would attend workshops on Google Business Groups and go back to school to teach people about Google products. So I focused everything I was doing on Google Ads \u2013 Google Adwords at that time. We also applied for some challenge programs like Google Online Marketing Challenge. That\u2019s kind of just really how I got into digital marketing; from being a GSA.\n\nBy the time I was graduating, a lot of people in school knew me as this \u2018Google girl\u2019 \u2013 this digital marketing person. So, I started getting some gigs running ads for businesses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can\u2019t remember how I learnt about Fiverr and Upwork, but at some point, I saw it and I got into it. I started freelancing there, handling social media accounts for people, writing blog articles, and I got an associate job with a company in the US as well.\n\nSo when I graduated in 2015, while I was waiting for service, I went fully into freelancing. I was also working at GTECH Designs as a marketing associate, just really handling social media, running some ads here and there.\n\nWhen it was time for service, because I studied Biochemistry, I didn\u2019t want to get thrown somewhere in the North or in a school to go and teach Biology, or like a medical lab. So, I made a few calls, and I got an internship with Webcoupers, so I could then do my NYSC there and that officially launched my career.\n\nI remember that it was easy for me to pass the interview. I even started working for them remotely when I was still in Benin City at that time. That was about four months before I got deployed for NYSC but they were so impressed with me, and the whole reason why they were impressed was because it was like, for somebody who just graduated, I already had a portfolio, I had a track record, I had run ads. I showed them my Fiverr and Upwork. I had taken lots of online courses \u2013 every Google online course, every Hubspot free course, if it was a free course and it had to do something on digital marketing, I would take it. They were just so impressed that even though they had never worked with anybody remotely, they were willing to try it out with me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does your work entail? Walk us through a typical workday.\n\nI don\u2019t have a typical work day. First, I work remotely and I juggle a bunch of things. I\u2019m the head of growth for Stax. I joined as the first growth hire and I\u2019m just building a growth team and leading go-to-market strategy, user acquisition and retention, anything that has to do with growth, that\u2019s my headache and my job all day.\n\nIt\u2019s a very dynamic role. I do data analytics, a lot of marketing, and I also intersect a lot of products, so I regularly speak with the product team, do Quality Assurance, and sometimes keep track of the roadmap.\n\nI\u2019m always checking out data, I do monthly presentations on what our current analytics is, and then just doing all the marketing with my team, as well. Then on the side, I have a newsletter that I write every now and again, and a YouTube channel to keep track of.\n\nSo, my life itself is very dynamic, but mostly the key element is that my work is very flexible, so there\u2019s no start time and end time. It\u2019s not a fixed nine to five.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m a late sleeper and late riser. I typically will sleep late like around 2 am and will most likely wake up around 7 am, but I don\u2019t get out of my bed until 9 or 10 am, except I have an early morning meeting, which is not often. So, most times, I\u2019ll end up having breakfast and then basically just open my laptop. That\u2019s literally how my day starts.\n\nThe whole day is just me shuffling between different Chrome windows of different things. It\u2019s mostly calls, emails, but sometimes I\u2019m brainstorming, researching, or reading, and other times I\u2019m writing stuff. I usually shoot videos either at the end of my day, if I wanted to, or most times on weekends.\n\nWhat apps, gadgets or tools can you not do without?\n\nMy laptop and my mobile phone are the number one gadgets. Then my iPad and my camera.\n\nSometimes what I do while I\u2019m on my bed in the morning is to go through Slack, emails, and social media. I don\u2019t like using my laptop for those, so I have my Slack and my emails open on my phone. I have an iPad which I use mostly when I\u2019m in the mood to scribble. When I\u2019m brainstorming or thinking, I\u2019m not able to brainstorm and type on my phone because it feels small and my laptop feels too big, but the iPad is in the middle, and I like to scribble a lot.\n\nThe next gadget would be my Camera but that\u2019s not an everyday thing, though it\u2019s a very important part of my life because I\u2019m a content creator.\n\nTalking about apps: Gmail, Slack, YouTube Studio, LinkedIn, Google Ads, Meta Ads Manager, Amplitude, AppsFlyer, Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, and Google Tasks (TasksBoard on web).\n\nWhat would you say is your favourite shortcut or hack for getting things done?\n\nI think it\u2019s a to-do list. It sounds cliche but it\u2019s my productivity hack. Using Google Tasks to put down what I want to achieve each week just helps me stay focused. Any week I don\u2019t have a to-do list set, I\u2019m not very productive because it\u2019s easier for me to get distracted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s a task that you dislike but still have to do?\n\nI dislike anything that is manual and requires me to do them one after the other. Things that cannot be automated or done at scale are quite annoying. And I have a couple of those tasks but they\u2019re very work specific so I may not be able to share examples. Anything like that is something that I typically put off until I absolutely have to do it.\n\nHow do you recharge or take a break from work?\n\nMovies, music, parties, hanging out with friends, just having dinner (I eat a lot these days), and swimming. When I swim, it\u2019s a whole routine though, and it just really helps me decompress. When it comes to hanging out with friends, there\u2019s a bunch of things that we do, so it can be just having a game night, brunch, dinner, going for a party or just staying in somebody\u2019s house to chill. But generally, just hanging out with friends always really helps.\n\nI like to sleep as well. I don\u2019t sleep a lot \u2013 except you count my \u2018sleep late and wake up early\u2019 routine. I also don\u2019t always take naps during the day, so what I do is to make up for sleep over the weekend. I don\u2019t stand up on Saturdays before 1 pm, except I have a call.\n\nI also try not to shoot every weekend. I bulk-create my contents so I can use the other weekends to sleep, hang out, edit the videos, and so on. Also, I\u2019m lucky to have gotten to this point because there was a time when I had to do everything by myself, when I first started. But in the last one year, I\u2019ve built a better support system.\n\nAwesome! So what are you currently watching, reading and listening to?\n\nI\u2019m watching The Royals, a show on Netflix that talks about the British royal family. It\u2019s fiction but is centred around the british royal family.\n\nFor music, you\u2019d either catch me listening to Asa\u2019s album or Kizz Daniel\u2019s album. Those are the two consistent things I\u2019ve listened to in the last one month. They\u2019re also the two people whose concerts I\u2019ve gone to in the last one month.\n\nThere\u2019s Bren\u00e9 Brown, who I\u2019m really a big fan of. She has a TEDx, a couple of YouTube specials, Netflix shows, and she\u2019s the author of Dare to Lead. She has these videos called F*cking First Times (FFTs), and Dare to Lead, so I\u2019m currently just rewatching them as well as her TEDx talk on vulnerability.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best advice you\u2019ve ever received?\n\nI think it\u2019s \u201cfail fast\u201d and \u201cgive yourself grace.\u201d\n\nI was speaking to someone whom I look up to and I was like, \u201cwhat tip would you give to somebody that wants to be like you?\u201d And he said, \u201cfail fast.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile you\u2019re still at this age, the best thing you can do for yourself is to try as many things and just fail fast.\u201d And I held on to that.\n\nAnd the second one was by my first therapist who used to say, \u201cgive yourself grace.\u201d\n\nPeople will disappoint you, you will disappoint yourself but at the end of everything, always give yourself grace because you can.\n\nWhat\u2019s a problem you\u2019re still trying to solve?\n\nI think one thing that I still want to keep doing, because I don\u2019t think I have done it to the extent where I\u2019m like \u2018I\u2019m done\u2019, is to keep telling stories. That\u2019s because there are just so many stories to tell and everybody\u2019s story is unique. And there are so many ways that these stories can inspire people.\n\nI have done a lot of just teaching and sharing in the last couple of years, just building my personal brand and my career, but I realise that at the core of everything is to be able to tell the stories. Because the more you tell stories, the more you just inspire a whole generation of people who want to work in a similar line.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a problem. I think that it\u2019s just like a gap that exists.\n\nWho would you like to see answer these questions?\n\nMitchelle Chibundu, Product Designer at Wise; Seun Runsewe, Product Manager at Chipper Cash; Aisha Owolabi, a Digital Content Marketer; and Adora Mbelu, founder of Lumination Global Network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamuel Okike I write about media, technology and internet culture.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnyeonghaseyo,\n\nIt\u2019s the end of May! And not to be cliche, but how are your New Year resolutions coming along?\n\nIt seems it was only yesterday we wished our loved ones a Happy New Year and welcomed 2022. While some of us made plans and set goals for the year, others went into the year with vigour, hoping that 2022 would be a good year.\n\nAnd as we approach the halfway point of the year, I hope you are doing well and are still hanging in there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m not going to say anything inspiring today; I just want to remind you to keep up the good work. And if you think you need motivation, I\u2019m encouraging you to be your push even when things don\u2019t appear to be moving in the right direction.\n\nToday, I\u2019ve got two stories:\n\nHow Peace Itimi works\n\nStarlink\u2019s approval in Nigeria\n\nHow does Peace Itimi work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore I joined Techpoint Africa, the series, How I Work was the only thing I went through on the website.\n\nI didn\u2019t use the word \u201cread\u201d because reading involves looking at, understanding and mentally interpreting the texts that make up written or printed material. Well, that\u2019s not the case for me.\n\nI do not retain the things I read. How can I when, after \u201creading\u201d one sentence, I\u2019ve forgotten what I saw in the first?\n\nHowever, I went through Samuel\u2019s series, and I liked it. For the record, I went through three or four stories in the series, which was remarkable because I get bored quickly.\n\nThe series, which began in 2019, featured interesting people like Odunayo Eweniyi, PiggyVest Co-founder and Chief Operations Officer; Joseph Akinfenwa-Donus, aka Joeboy, singer and songwriter. We also saw Fisayo Fosudo, content creator; Eyitayo Ogunmola, Utiva CEO, and Dr Ola Brown, founder of Flying Doctors Healthcare Investment Group. All building and doing amazing things.\n\nBut Samuel was unable to continue due to the pandemic. Nonetheless, I came bearing good news, people. \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude01 I know you know it, but I\u2019m still going to tell you anyway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrum rolls: The series is back!!! And today, Samuel will feature someone you should definitely be interested in. Give it up for Peace Itimi, ladies and gentlemen! (Look at the sky, there are fireworks everywhere.) \ud83d\ude02\n\nBefore we get to how she works, do you know Peace? Before now, I only knew her as a YouTuber who hosts Founders Connect, a platform that documents the stories, journeys and ideologies of leading and emerging African entrepreneurs and operators.\n\nI assumed she didn\u2019t have another job because she is good at what she does and shouldn\u2019t be doing more than one thing at a time? That appears strange now that I think about it. Why box someone, after all?\n\nPlus, last Saturday, I watched her most recent video of Njoku Emmanuel, CEO and Co-founder of Lazerpay, and the dialogue was flawless. So, why does she need a job? That could be a job, too.\n\nWell, I was wrong. Apart from being a YouTuber, she\u2019s currently the Head of Growth for Stax, an offline payment super-app for Africans. She\u2019s also a digital marketing professional and a Udemy trainer. She has two courses titled \u201cCustomer Centric Marketing | Know, Woo & Win Your Audience\u201d and \u201cExcellence in Customer Service.\u201d\n\nWith this, you should know that she has a huge passion for growing people and businesses. So, how does she work? How does she combine all these? Be on the lookout for her story today by 12 p.m. for answers.\n\nStarlink\u2019s approval in Nigeria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarlink was one of the trending topics on Twitter over the weekend. Even if you don\u2019t use Twitter, I believe you must have heard the word Starlink. You haven\u2019t? Oh, you have, but it\u2019s still not clear? Well, I got you.\n\nFirst off, here\u2019s the gist: Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, a US-based space exploration company, announced that SpaceX\u2019s satellite Internet service, Starlink, has been approved in Nigeria and Mozambique on Friday, May 27, 2022.\n\nSo, what\u2019s the big deal about Starlink? Aside from its unlimited data, Starlink offers low latency and high-speed broadband internet access in areas where it was previously unreliable or unavailable.\n\nThis means that if you\u2019re in a rural area, you will enjoy faster Internet speed. All you need is a clear view of the sky because the Internet is transmitted directly from space rather than fibres.\n\nHow does Starlink work? First off, you have to subscribe to Starlink. You\u2019ll receive a kit that includes a satellite dish and a router when you do that. To make the connection, simply install the satellite dish in your home, and it receives the signal and forwards it to your router.\n\nThere\u2019s an Android and iOS app for Starlink that uses augmented reality to help you choose the best location and position for your receivers.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Starlink Internet costs $599.00 (~\u20a6330,000) for a complete kit that includes a terminal, mounting tripod, and Wi-Fi router, and an additional $110 (~\u20a660,500) when you preorder and for the monthly subscription.\n\nA complete kit of Starlink Business or its Premium plan costs $2,500.00 (~\u20a61.3 million). Its monthly subscription is priced at $500 (~\u20a6275,000).\n\nThis begs the question of how many Nigerians can pay for these services. In a country with 109.2 million Internet users as of January 2022, the average monthly data subscription fee is $50 (\u20a620,761), per TechCabal.\n\nStill, I think Musk and the team will review the price in the country because Nigerians are poor, with over 83 million people living in extreme poverty.\n\nSo, although this approval poses a threat to the country\u2019s existing telco companies, I think it comes at an inopportune time, as they plan to raise data, voice calls, and SMS charges by 40%. Does this imply that telco companies will lower their data rates?\n\nNonetheless, Starlink has the potential to create jobs in rural areas, lifting people out of poverty. But, can they afford it?\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on last week\u2019s stories\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe African Leadership Group and Udacity are offering 5,000 scholarships to African citizens who want to advance their careers in tech. by learning new digital skills. Scholarship recipients will enrol in one of the following Udacity Nanodegree programmes: Data Analyst, Full-Stack Web Developer, or Cloud Developer.

You however seek more information in the hope that you get all the clarity and green light you need.\n\nA third possibility could be that you know someone who is at that phase of their life\u2014yearning for a career change and real opportunities for growth. This piece answers some of your questions about pursuing a career in tech and how to transition.\n\nBefore we dive in, what is your \u201cWhy\u201d?\n\nThe tech space undoubtedly holds a myriad of opportunities for skilled talent worldwide. Global ecosystems continue to witness exponential growth. In Africa, solution-driven startups keep springing up & raising rounds to help drive growth and expansion.\n\nTech news platforms are often inundated with announcements of funds raised by startups which sometimes run into several millions of dollars. More jobs are getting created. Top tech talents are being enticed with juicy compensation packages and then poached. Junior employees are now taking up more responsibility and securing promotions. It\u2019s Career Christmas!\n\nHowever, it\u2019s quite easy to get distracted by this zeitgeist. Away from the exciting announcements and fascinating Twitter conversations, the growth and successes of these tech ecosystems are powered by the blood and sweat of deeply passionate and hardworking people who put in their absolute best to make things work.\n\nIn other words, working in tech is not a walk in the park. Your \u201cwhy\u201d mustn\u2019t be influenced by the current ecosystem zeitgeist, but by a genuine readiness to learn, contribute and grow.\n\nYou also must define what you want to do going forward. Are you looking for core tech/code roles (e.g Software Engineering) or no-code roles like Product Design, Product Management, Product Marketing, Technical Writing, Customer Success, Recruitment etc,?\n\nHave you looked into what it takes to be successful in this new path and are you ready to give what it takes?\n\nAnswer these questions as truthfully as you can. Don\u2019t worry if you fear your answers aren\u2019t convincing enough at the moment. You can always look up more information on these roles to guide your final decision.\n\nWith that said, here are 5 Proven Tips to Help You Transition Into Tech:\n\n1. What transferable skills do you have?\n\nA sizeable number of people that transition to tech do so by leveraging their previously acquired skills\u2014though these skills are mostly no-code or non-technical. For instance, a Customer Service Representative at a local bank could easily transition to a similar role at a FinTech startup. A journalist or creative writer could try out technical writing and pick up really fast. Human Resource Managers/Recruiters in conventional companies would easily settle in as technical recruiters after a few months of training. The list goes on.\n\nWhat you should do is identify the skills you already possess and see what roles those could get you in tech. If you have your eyes set on an entirely different role (one that doesn\u2019t align with your current skills), check out the skills required for that role and how to go about acquiring them. Then go for it.\n\n2. Search for opportunities in industries where you have prior experience\n\nThis is in many ways similar to what we discussed above\u2014about seeking opportunities in tech where your previously acquired skills are a match. Say you\u2019re a Risk & Compliance Officer at a local bank; you can work the same job at a FinTech startup. A seasoned chartered accountant can head the Accounts & Finance unit at a tech startup. Medical doctors could, for instance, work as consultants at HealthTech startups offering home services. Product Managers can easily function across numerous industries. Conventional journalists and content creators could niche down and focus on reporting/producing content on tech and so on.\n\n3. Take courses & write a certification exam\n\nOne of the sure-fire ways to transition to tech is to learn the skill(s) required to function in specific areas of interest. A great way to achieve this is by taking online courses, registering for and joining boot camps and writing certification exams. Thanks to the internet, there now seems to be unlimited access to information allowing us to learn on our own.\n\nThe democratization of the internet has also brought about a rise in the number of digital platforms that help people acquire knowledge and learn new skills. Within a few months, you can go from being a complete outsider to becoming an entry-level professional, anywhere in the world.\n\nThis is where AltSchool Africa comes in. At AltSchool Africa, you can learn some of the world\u2019s most sought after tech skills and earn a top-rated diploma within 12 months. The school runs a number of coding and no-code learning programs that are stand-alone specialisations under its School of Engineering and School of Product respectively.\n\nFor instance, when you apply to the School of Engineering, you will have to select a specific area of specialisation among the following:\n\nFrontend Engineering Backend Engineering & Cloud Engineering\n\nHowever, for the no-code School of Product, you can choose to learn either Product Design, Product Management or Product Marketing.\n\nIs it possible to land a job in tech by just taking courses without certification? Yes. However, earning a certification badge from an institute of repute certainly opens more doors and gets you in much bigger rooms.\n\n4. Be on the lookout for Internships\n\nMany careers that began as internships have blossomed into highly successful vocations. Some of the most revered, most admired professionals today, started out as interns and managed to build their careers into the success we currently know them to be.\n\nInternships offer great learning opportunities and direct pathways to getting your first job in tech. Not only do you get the opportunity to learn directly from much more experienced professionals\u2013you could also be on your way to getting your first offer of employment. This, of course, is dependent on how well you perform during the period.\n\n5. Network. Network. Network\n\nThe opportunities you seek aren\u2019t coming to pay you a visit in the comfort of your home. You have to get out there and grab them. Your social capital will, to a large extent, influence your career trajectory.\n\nWho do you know? Who do they know? What do they know? What do they do?\n\nUnderstanding the power of networking and actively making time to build connections will help you grow personally and professionally. So, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll do:\n\nIf your LinkedIn has been inactive, it\u2019s time to power it up: That is a good place to start. Find people doing great work in your preferred field and connect with them. Genuinely engage them in conversations and keep an open mind during these discussions.\n\nYou could also look up startup founders and hiring managers in companies you have an interest in: Try to connect with them and send a properly worded message. Briefly introduce yourself and why you\u2019re reaching out. Remember to be courteous.\n\nAttend tech events: These events are the perfect place to network as attendance is primarily physical. You can walk up to stakeholders, politely introduce yourself and tell your story. If you\u2019ve completed all the necessary training and are now in search of a job, that would be a perfect place to pitch to startup founders and execs too.\n\nYou should also consider volunteering: A good number of startups are in the business of building communities and organizing events. Due to the workload which sometimes could get overwhelming, these startups seek to onboard volunteers to help out on a project temporarily. In some cases, volunteers are paid a stipend for the work they do. In reverse scenarios, they aren\u2019t. However, monetary benefits shouldn\u2019t be your primary concern here. Your focus must be on learning as much as you can, gaining insights into the workings of the space, identifying key players and expanding your social circle.\n\nVolunteering, when done right, puts your name on the lips of persons that have the capacity to get you your next job.\n\nJoin Tech Communities: As the ecosystem grows, stakeholders are beginning to appreciate the power of community; the need to bring key players and intelligent outsiders together to look inwards and map out strategies for continued growth.\n\nOne of the strategies designed to ensure said growth is the creation of smaller groups or communities dedicated to knowledge sharing, resource sharing, mentorship and access to opportunities. The primary targets of these communities are entry-level & intermediate professionals who are then guided by more experienced tech talent. Members of these communities often have a shared sense of responsibility to help each other grow.\n\nThere are communities for everyone. So, whether you\u2019re a Software Engineer, Data Analyst, Product Manager or Technical Writer, there is a place for you.\n\nOn a final note:\n\nIt is very much possible to transition into tech within one year. As a matter of fact, some have managed to make the switch in just a few months. Bear in mind that if you must transition and do it fast, you will have to simultaneously employ more than one of the methods mentioned above. For example, you could have direct, transferable skills but you may have to network and volunteer to access even bigger and better opportunities.\n\nThese methods also aren\u2019t set in stone. You could come up with other creative, honest ways to move several steps further and get to work.\n\nIn the meantime, let\u2019s circle back to where we began:\n\nA quick guide on How to Transition into Tech in 1 Year?\n\nApply to AltSchool Africa\n\nApplications to the School of Product are currently open.\n\nReady to begin that journey?

          "text": "As part of activities to commemorate the Open Government Partnership Global week, Kaduna State Government launched the Community Development Charter. What is it all about?\n\nThe Community Development Charter (CDC) is a written document containing the development needs of a community listed in the order of communal priority, as drawn up by all groups within the community. It\u2019s a tool for citizens-state engagement and participation as it contains the representative needs of the community, gathered and compiled in an inclusive and participatory manner, to aid our budgeting process, to ensure that our budgeting process speaks to the communities\u2019 needs.\n\nDid your ministry conduct some kind of survey before drawing up this priority needs of communities?\n\nYes, we did. Before the charter was developed, the civil societies and donor parties did community mapping to identify community gatekeepers and influencers, to get their buy-in into the process. Afterwards, community sensitisation was carried out to enable the communities know how to prioritise their projects. So, there was full community participation.\n\nAre you sure that this mapping is broad and wide enough for effective participation, because it\u2019s like you concentrated on sample focal groups?\n\nWhen we go into the communities, we actually speak to the community leaders, influencers, traditional leaders, religious leaders and the leaders within the communities; the Imams, the pastors etc, just to get everybody involved. These are the leaders of communities, those that really have the ears of the community. We usually sit with them and ask what the communities\u2019 priorities are. What are their needs and how do they think the needs can be achieved?\n\nIn 2018, Kaduna State Government was the first subnational to sign onto the Open Government Partnership initiative. Four years after, how has the journey been and what are the key takeaways and achievements?\n\nThere is a new Action Plan for Kaduna state 2021 to 2023. We are done with the 2018 to 2020 Action Plan. Now, we have sat down and developed another Action Plan for 2021 to 2023 with five thematic areas. It addresses open budget, which is really to ensure that our budget speaks to people\u2019s need; that the budget is transparent, and it addresses community needs. We also have the open contracting which means that the Kaduna State Public Procurement Agency (KADPPA\u2019s) contracting process, procurement processes are transparent.\n\nNow we have gone into the e-procurement model in Kaduna state, whereby our contracts are published for the public to see. We advertise all these contracts even before we award them. So, that helps. Citizens engagement is where we do a lot of back and forth with the citizens. Our Eyes and Ears project also falls in here, the citizens hold us accountable for what the state is doing. We have strengthened the social protection system in Kaduna state to ensure that our social registers are ready for anyone coming in with an intervention in the state to improve the poverty indices and service delivery in education and health services.\n\nWhat is this Eyes and Ears project all about and how has it impacted on transparency in government?\n\nThe Eyes and Ears is a homegrown initiative. And it is one of the budget performance tools that we use to track performance of MDA projects across the state. It provides evidence-based feedback to policy makers, to track budget implementation processes. The Eyes and Ears project has the citizens\u2019 and government component.\n\nThe citizens\u2019 component is made up of citizen feedback App, a toll-free line and there is also \u2018Gani ya kori ji,\u2019 which is an Hausa programme on radio, where different heads of agencies speak to the people about their mandates and what they are doing in various communities. People ask questions on that programme about projects.\n\nThe Eyes and Ears App helps us to monitor our projects across various locations. With the size of Kaduna state, it is very difficult, very time consuming and very expensive for us to sit here in the capital and send our people to the 23 local governments to monitor the projects. So, instead, we find volunteers in the various communities that will talk to us on these project and the App is the platform for it. All you need do is register on it, take pictures of the project and then report on it. All the projects that we have in Kaduna state are uploaded onto the App. In your community, within a certain radius, from where you are, the App shows you the projects that are available in that location. So, you can only report on projects that are around a certain radius of your location.\n\nWe let you know the details of the project, who the contractor is, what the project is all about, when it was awarded, when it was supposed to be completed, a lot of information around the achievables of that project are online. So, you just provide us with your observations, like whether the contractor is on site, the stage at which the project is, the quality of the project and so on. And that helps us in the monitoring of these projects.\n\nThen we have a toll free line 080001235444, where you can just call, introduce yourself, let us know where you are calling from and the project that you are reporting on and then we get our guys to check on that project and what you are reporting on and then we get back to you.\n\nHas there been adequate feedback on the Eyes and Ears App?\n\nWe are happy with the feedback so far, we get a lot of reports, though the numbers are not up to where we want them to be. Civil Society Organisations go to various communities and engage the people and inform them.

So, the lady tweeted about it and the Global Open Partnership picked it up and it was one of the projects that was highlighted during its programme last year.\n\nHow has the Open Government Partnership impacted on health and education sectors, in terms of mortality rate and enrolment figures in schools and overall scores in external exams?\n\nThis administration continues to prioritise education and health. Every year, education and health take about 40% of our budget size. In 2022, the spendings for education was about N68.4 billion which is about 29% of the total budget size of the state. You will also recalled that we inherited about 4,200 primary schools across the state, which were in very bad conditions with pupils learning on the floor. Major steps were taken to improve enrolment by investing massively in infrastructure, personnel and incentives in the education sector.\n\nWhen the administration assumed office, the first thing we saw was that even the teachers in the schools didn\u2019t have the capacity to teach the learners. There was a lot of noise when incompetent teachers were retrenched.

The enrolment ratios have continued to improve; there has been an increase in the pre-primary enrolment to about 74.4%; primary enrolment, 92.4%. Junior secondary school enrolment, by gender, boys enrolment is 45%, girls 55%; senior secondary school enrolment by gender boys 59%, girls 41%.\n\nThese figures are from our annual school census that was done in 2020/2021. In the area of health, the 2022 budget has increased this year to N25.4 billion, which is 15% of the total budget size.

          "text": "As part of activities to commemorate the Open Government Partnership Global week, Kaduna State Government launched the Community Development Charter. What is it all about?\n\nThe Community Development Charter (CDC) is a written document containing the development needs of a community listed in the order of communal priority, as drawn up by all groups within the community. It\u2019s a tool for citizens-state engagement and participation as it contains the representative needs of the community, gathered and compiled in an inclusive and participatory manner, to aid our budgeting process, to ensure that our budgeting process speaks to the communities\u2019 needs.\n\nDid your ministry conduct some kind of survey before drawing up this priority needs of communities?\n\nYes, we did. Before the charter was developed, the civil societies and donor parties did community mapping to identify community gatekeepers and influencers, to get their buy-in into the process. Afterwards, community sensitisation was carried out to enable the communities know how to prioritise their projects. So, there was full community participation.\n\nAre you sure that this mapping is broad and wide enough for effective participation, because it\u2019s like you concentrated on sample focal groups?\n\nWhen we go into the communities, we actually speak to the community leaders, influencers, traditional leaders, religious leaders and the leaders within the communities; the Imams, the pastors etc, just to get everybody involved. These are the leaders of communities, those that really have the ears of the community. We usually sit with them and ask what the communities\u2019 priorities are. What are their needs and how do they think the needs can be achieved?\n\nIn 2018, Kaduna State Government was the first subnational to sign onto the Open Government Partnership initiative. Four years after, how has the journey been and what are the key takeaways and achievements?\n\nThere is a new Action Plan for Kaduna state 2021 to 2023. We are done with the 2018 to 2020 Action Plan. Now, we have sat down and developed another Action Plan for 2021 to 2023 with five thematic areas. It addresses open budget, which is really to ensure that our budget speaks to people\u2019s need; that the budget is transparent, and it addresses community needs. We also have the open contracting which means that the Kaduna State Public Procurement Agency (KADPPA\u2019s) contracting process, procurement processes are transparent.\n\nNow we have gone into the e-procurement model in Kaduna state, whereby our contracts are published for the public to see. We advertise all these contracts even before we award them. So, that helps. Citizens engagement is where we do a lot of back and forth with the citizens. Our Eyes and Ears project also falls in here, the citizens hold us accountable for what the state is doing. We have strengthened the social protection system in Kaduna state to ensure that our social registers are ready for anyone coming in with an intervention in the state to improve the poverty indices and service delivery in education and health services.\n\nWhat is this Eyes and Ears project all about and how has it impacted on transparency in government?\n\nThe Eyes and Ears is a homegrown initiative. And it is one of the budget performance tools that we use to track performance of MDA projects across the state. It provides evidence-based feedback to policy makers, to track budget implementation processes. The Eyes and Ears project has the citizens\u2019 and government component.\n\nThe citizens\u2019 component is made up of citizen feedback App, a toll-free line and there is also \u2018Gani ya kori ji,\u2019 which is an Hausa programme on radio, where different heads of agencies speak to the people about their mandates and what they are doing in various communities. People ask questions on that programme about projects.\n\nThe Eyes and Ears App helps us to monitor our projects across various locations. With the size of Kaduna state, it is very difficult, very time consuming and very expensive for us to sit here in the capital and send our people to the 23 local governments to monitor the projects. So, instead, we find volunteers in the various communities that will talk to us on these project and the App is the platform for it. All you need do is register on it, take pictures of the project and then report on it. All the projects that we have in Kaduna state are uploaded onto the App. In your community, within a certain radius, from where you are, the App shows you the projects that are available in that location. So, you can only report on projects that are around a certain radius of your location.\n\nWe let you know the details of the project, who the contractor is, what the project is all about, when it was awarded, when it was supposed to be completed, a lot of information around the achievables of that project are online. So, you just provide us with your observations, like whether the contractor is on site, the stage at which the project is, the quality of the project and so on. And that helps us in the monitoring of these projects.\n\nThen we have a toll free line 080001235444, where you can just call, introduce yourself, let us know where you are calling from and the project that you are reporting on and then we get our guys to check on that project and what you are reporting on and then we get back to you.\n\nHas there been adequate feedback on the Eyes and Ears App?\n\nWe are happy with the feedback so far, we get a lot of reports, though the numbers are not up to where we want them to be. Civil Society Organisations go to various communities and engage the people and inform them. At our own end, we ensure that we engage everybody that has brought a report to us, we make sure that we give every person a feedback on what government has done about it. We encourage people to also disseminate when they get feedback from government on it. So, it is work in progress and we are moving on.\n\nWe\u2019ve introduced a WhatsApp line also, aside the toll-free line, just for people to also send information. For people that don\u2019t have the Android phones to access the WhatsApp group, they can just call or send a text message. We recently introduced the volunteer Eyes and Ears WhatsApp group, with members from the 23 local governments. We are using volunteers across the various MDAs who have volunteered to do such work. We have trained them and we will continue to train them. We\u2019ve given them a simple template on how to report on these projects. All they need do is to list the name of the project, where they are reporting from, the quality of the project, the extent of the execution of the project and send a few pictures. That has also helped us in improving the monitoring process.\n\nCan you give a specific instance where this reporting has helped to salvage a particular project?\n\nO yes. Kaduna state won an award on the Global Open Partnership platform last year, when a lady reported on a primary healthcare project in her location. The contract had been awarded but the project had been abandoned. So she reported it on the Eyes and Ears App and it came to us and we directed the Primary Healthcare Board to check the project. They realised that the contractor has absconded from the project and we got him back to site. The project was completed and we were commended for it. So, the lady tweeted about it and the Global Open Partnership picked it up and it was one of the projects that was highlighted during its programme last year.\n\nHow has the Open Government Partnership impacted on health and education sectors, in terms of mortality rate and enrolment figures in schools and overall scores in external exams?\n\nThis administration continues to prioritise education and health.

You will also recalled that we inherited about 4,200 primary schools across the state, which were in very bad conditions with pupils learning on the floor. Major steps were taken to improve enrolment by investing massively in infrastructure, personnel and incentives in the education sector.\n\nWhen the administration assumed office, the first thing we saw was that even the teachers in the schools didn\u2019t have the capacity to teach the learners. There was a lot of noise when incompetent teachers were retrenched. But I\u2019m happy to say that we have engaged qualified teachers to teach the students and our success rate has really improved across various exams. The enrolment ratios have continued to improve; there has been an increase in the pre-primary enrolment to about 74.4%; primary enrolment, 92.4%. Junior secondary school enrolment, by gender, boys enrolment is 45%, girls 55%; senior secondary school enrolment by gender boys 59%, girls 41%.\n\nThese figures are from our annual school census that was done in 2020/2021.

          "text": "The Supreme Court of Nigeria has demolished and dismissed the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike \u2018s probe panel white paper report that indicted his predecessor Rt. Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi of alleged fraud in several government financial transactions while he(Amaechi) was governor. The apex court judgment ends the contention and controversy over Amaechi\u2019s alleged criminal indictment by Wike\u2019s probe commission, in favour of Amaechi, the leading Presidential aspirant of the All Progressives Congress(APC)\n\nThe apex court in its ruling on the matter described Wike\u2019s Judicial Commission of Inquiry\u2019s work as a mere report that is \u201cnot enforceable\u201d in law, with absolutely \u201cno legal force.\u201d The Supreme Court went further to rule that Wike\u2019s Commission clearly had \u201cno judicial powers or power to adjudicate\u201d; ruling categorically that the Commission\u2019s probe is \u201cnot a civil or criminal trial\u201d of Amaechi or anyone else, and that \u201cits findings (whatever it is) is not a conviction(of Amaechi or anyone else) but a mere investigation.\u201d The apex court also pronounced that Wike\u2019s commission \u201cis not a criminal investigation agency such as EFCC, ICPC and the Police\u201d, which further diminishes and demolishes the value of the work of the probe panel.\n\nAll these details are contained in the detailed written 75-page judgment of the apex court in its ruling on the appeal filed by Amaechi against Wike and nine others on the Wike\u2019s Judicial Commission of Inquiry\u2019s probe. The detailed written judgment of the 7-man Supreme Court panel dated May, 27, 2022 was delivered and signed by Justice Emmanuel Akomaye Agim, in the appeal marked SC/911/2017. Other Justices in the panel are Olukayode Ariwoola, Amina Adamu Augie, Uwani Musa Abba Aji, Mohammed Garba Lawal, Abdu Aboki and Adamu Jauro.\n\nIn the written judgment, the Supreme ruled that, \u201ca Commission of inquiry is a fact finding or information seeking body. It is not an adjudicatory body and so does not try or determine disputes as to any rights or obligations of liabilities. The purpose of the(Commission\u2019s) investigation is to find out the facts or gather facts on the subject matter of inquiry. In doing so, it is not trying any person for the commission of any misconduct or crime. It does not engage in the trial of any person for anything. It merely gathers facts on the subject of the inquiry.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven if it (the commission) makes findings of facts that are adverse to a person(Amaechi), such adverse findings do not amount to a conviction for an offence or determination of his right and obligation. They remain mere finding of facts on the basis of which it would make recommendations to the appointing authority who may accept or reject them. If it rejects them, the matter ends there. If it accepts them and decides to take necessary action on the accepted recommendation, the white paper accepting the recommendation can be challenged in court.\u201d\n\nHowever, the apex court also rule that, \u201cthe accepted recommendations (of the Commission) are not enforceable like a court decision. So a Commission of Inquiry is not a court. It is not a criminal investigation agency such as EFCC, ICPC and Police.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe designation of the commission of inquiry set up as a Judicial Commission of Inquiry and the fact it was headed by a serving or retired Judicial Officer cannot invest it with judicial powers or character and did not change its nature as a fact finding or information seeking body with no power to adjudicate, or in any manner determine any rights or obligations or try any person for the commission of a crime. It is not a civil or criminal trial. The purely fact finding function of a commission of inquiry is what defines its nature and character as an administrative investigation and a non judicial body.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is also our very view and we hold that the 3rd respondent(the Judicial Commission of Inquiry) is a fact finding and an investigative body. Generally, a body exercising powers which are merely investigative in character and which do not have any legal force\u2026 The description of such body as a judicial commission of inquiry does not change its character from being a fact finding body.\u201d\n\nWith this judgment, the Supreme Court has clearly vindicated Amaechi and cleared him of all purported or alleged indictment by the Governor Wike\u2019s Commission.\n\nFrom the onset, it was obvious to any discerning mind that the Commission was set up to embarrass, denigrate and humiliate Amaechi. The apex court judgment further buttressed this stance. A Commission purportedly set up to investigate past financial transactions was actually a Commission to personally witch-hunt Amaechi.",

The FCMB auto loan supports acquiring brand new and pre-owned vehicles (popularly known as \u201cTokunbo\u201d), with N500,000 as the minimum loan amount that a customer can access for a repayment duration of up to 5 years.\n\nThis affirms FCMB\u2019s commitment to improving the social well-being of individuals and enhancing access to credit for higher standard of living for families.\n\nCommenting on the unique value proposition, Divisional Head, Personal Banking of the Bank, Mr Shamsideen Fashola, said, \u201cvehicle ownership is one of the most exciting moments in a person\u2019s life. Yet, many people struggle to save up for a long time to make this dream come true. To bridge this gap, we created a value proposition that is flexible, convenient and empowers individuals, families and businesses to achieve the dream of vehicle ownership. Nigerians can now finance their dream vehicle with an auto loan from FCMB at a low-interest rate with monthly or yearly payment options depending on their income. We, therefore, urge the populace, including, but not limited to salaried individuals, to take advantage of this opportunity to fulfil their vehicle ownership dream\u201d.\n\nFCMB Auto Loan empowers qualified Nigerians to part-finance the purchase of brand-new and pre-owned vehicles while spreading the repayment between one and five years. The loan, which is dependent on the type of vehicle to be purchased, is open to salaried individuals and self-employed Nigerians.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the number of registered vehicles in Nigeria is 13 million. However, vehicle ownership in the country has been declining because of increased prices. This is due to foreign exchange and importation challenges, leading to a drastic reduction in purchasing power and sales decline in the auto industry.\n\nA purpose beyond profit commercial banking institution, First City Monument Bank is a member of FCMB Group Plc, led by Ladi Balogun as Group Chief Executive. The Bank is committed to COVID-19 recovery, income equality and poverty reduction by easing credit constraints to disadvantaged individuals and small businesses. The intervention of FCMB in the automobile sector aligns with Goals 3 and 10 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which focus on well-being and reduced inequalities.",

          "text": "The Federal High Court in Abuja has remanded a former governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, in the custody of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC).\n\nJustice Inyang Ekwo ordered his remand on Monday following the arraignment of the former governor in court by the anti-graft agency.\n\nHe also adjourned the case until Tuesday for a hearing of the bail application filed by Okorocha, who currently represents Imo West senatorial district in the National Assembly.\n\nThe former governor is being tried on a 17-count charge to the tune of N2.9 billion filed against him by the anti-graft agency.\n\nHe was accused of conspiring with others, including a member of the APC and five companies to steal from public coffers, although he has since denied any wrongdoing.\n\nNot Guilty Plea\n\nChannels Television had reported that the courtroom was already filled to capacity as of 9am before the commencement of the proceedings, with several others standing as they await the arrival of the judge.\n\nWhen the proceedings began, the lawmaker took a stand in the dock after which the charges were read to him.\n\nIn his response, he pleaded not guilty to the charges. The second defendant in the suit, Anyim Chinenye, as well as the five companies also pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nAfter taking their plea, Okorocha\u2019s lawyer, Mr Okey Amaechi, prayed the court to release his client on bail, pending the determination of the case against him.\n\nAmaechi also drew the attention of the court to the fact that his client was roughly arrested before the screening of the presidential aspirants of the APC.\n\nBut the EFCC, through its lawyer, Mr Gbolahan Latona, told the court that Okorocha raised some issues in his bail application that would require its response.\n\nJustice Ekwo, thereafter, adjourned the matter until Tuesday to hear the bail applications of the defendants and ordered that they should remain in EFCC custody, pending the determination of their bail applications.\n\nA Seventh Night\n\nFollowing his remand by the judge, Okorocha will be spending his seventh night in EFCC custody since he was picked up by a team of operatives who stormed his residence in the Maitama area of Abuja last Tuesday.\n\nThe team, who insisted that Okorocha must submit himself for arrest or honour a long-standing invitation to their office, later barricaded the residence of the presidential aspirant.\n\nFollowing a series of drama at the scene, gunshots were heard as the anti-graft agency\u2019s team broke into Okorocha\u2019s house and left with the presidential aspirant to their office.\n\nOn Friday last week, he lost his request to the court to be admitted on bail, pending the determination of a suit he had instituted against the Federal Government.\n\nThe lawmaker had predicated his bail request on the ground that he was a presidential aspirant, stressing that his political ambition would be jeopardised unless he was granted bail.\n\nBut Justice Ekwo, in a brief ruling on Okorocha\u2019s bail application at the time, said he was not inclined to admit the applicant to bail.\n\nRather, the judge ordered Okorocha to put the Federal Government on notice to come and defend his detention.",

          "text": "Nigeria has recorded its first death from monkeypox disease since the beginning of the year 2022, the nation\u2019s disease outbreak management agency has said.\n\nIn the last five months, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) revealed that it has 21 cases from nine states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nThese include Adamawa \u2013 five, Lagos \u2013 four, Bayelsa \u2013 two, Delta \u2013 two, Cross River \u2013 two, FCT \u2013 two, Kano \u2013 two, Imo \u2013 one, and Rivers \u2013 one.\n\n\u201cThe death was reported in a 40-year-old patient who had underlying co-morbidity and was on immunosuppressive medications,\u201d NCDC Director-General, Dr Ifedayo Adetifa, said in a statement on Sunday.\n\n\u201cGenomic surveillance is ongoing at NCDC\u2019s National Reference Laboratory in Abuja and so far, all of the cases have been confirmed to be caused by West Africa clade Monkeypox virus.\n\n\u201cAmong the 21 cases reported in 2022 so far, there has been no evidence of any new or unusual transmission of the virus, nor changes in its clinical manifestation documented (including symptoms, profile and virulence).\u201d\n\nAdetifa stated that the NCDC activated a national multisectoral Emergency Operations Centre for Monkeypox (MPX-EOC) at level two last Thursday, to strengthen and coordinate ongoing response activities in-country while contributing to the global response.\n\nThis, he explained, was based on the report of a preliminary risk assessment done by a group of Subject Matter Experts from the NCDC, as well as relevant government Ministries, Departments and Agencies, and partner agencies.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nPrior to the activation of the MPX-EOC, a multi-agency Technical Working Group (TWG) coordinated at the NCDC led Nigeria\u2019s efforts to improve the detection, prevention, and control of monkeypox, the NCDC chief said.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria\u2019s national surveillance system \u2013 the Surveillance Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System (SORMAS) \u2013 was first deployed in response to the 2017 monkeypox outbreak to improve the timeliness and completeness of case reporting, as well as facilitate the overall response.\n\n\u201cIn addition, this pilot project informed the nationwide scale-up of SORMAS to enable real-time reporting of surveillance data for prompt public health response to infectious disease outbreaks including COVID-19,\u201d said Adetifa.\n\n\u201cFollowing the detection of the index case on September 22, 2017, and the effective containment of the 2017 outbreak in Nigeria, the NCDC through the Monkeypox TWG worked on various interventions to gain a better understanding of the epidemiology of the virus to inform preparedness and response in-country.\u201d\n\nThe NCDC said Nigeria\u2019s risk of exposure to the monkeypox virus was high based on the recent risk assessment conducted.\n\nIt, however, noted that the current situation in-country and globally has shown no significant threat to life or the community that can result in severe disease or high case fatality rate., while the EOC would continue to monitor the evolving situation to inform public health action accordingly.\n\nSymptoms of monkeypox include sudden fever, headache, body pain, weakness, sore throat, enlargement of glands (lymph nodes) in the neck and under the jaw, followed by the appearance of a rash (often solid or fluid-filled at the onset) on the face, palms, soles of the feet, genitals, and other parts of the body.\n\nThe NCDC emphasised that members of the public should remain aware of the risk of monkeypox and adhere to public health safety measures and report to the nearest health facility if they notice the known signs and symptoms of the disease.\n\nHealthcare workers were also advised to maintain a high index of suspicion for monkeypox and report any suspected case to the relevant state Epidemiology Team for prompt public health intervention, including sampling for confirmatory testing.",

          "text": "Nepali rescuers on Monday retrieved 16 bodies from the mangled wreckage of a passenger plane strewn across a mountainside that crashed in the Himalayas with 22 people on board.\n\nAir traffic control lost contact with the Twin Otter aircraft operated by Nepali carrier Tara Air shortly after taking off from Pokhara in western Nepal on Sunday morning headed for Jomsom, a popular trekking destination.\n\nHelicopters operated by the military and private firms braved poor weather to scour the remote mountainous area all day Sunday, aided by teams on foot, but called off the fruitless search when night fell.\n\nAfter resuming on Monday, the army shared on social media a photo of aircraft parts and other debris littering a sheer mountainside, including a wing with the registration number 9N-AET clearly visible.\n\n\u201cSo far, 16 bodies have been recovered and teams are searching for the remaining six. Chances of survival are low but our efforts continue to find them,\u201d Civil Aviation Authority spokesman Deo Chandra Lal Karn told AFP.\n\nThere were about 60 people working at the crash site, including army, police, mountain guides and locals, most of whom trekked for miles on foot to get there.\n\nThe authority said that the plane \u201cmet an accident\u201d at 14,500 feet (4,420 metres) in the Sanosware area of Thasang municipality in Mustang district.\n\n\u201cAnalysing the pictures we received, it seems that the flight did not catch fire. Everything is scattered on the site. The flight seems to have collided with a big rock on the hill,\u201d said Pokhara Airport spokesman Dev Raj Subedi.\n\nFamilies\n\nFour Indians were on board, as well as two Germans, with the remainder Nepalis including a computer engineer, his wife and their two daughters who had just returned from the United States.\n\nThe four Indians were a divorced couple and their daughter and son, aged 15 and 22, going on a family holiday, Indian police official Uttam Sonawane told AFP.\n\n\u201cThere was a court order for (the father) to spend time with the family for 10 days every year, so they were taking a trip,\u201d Sonawane said.\n\nPradeep Gauchan, a local official, said that the wreckage was difficult to reach and that poor weather was hampering the operation.\n\n\u201cOne team has been dropped close to the area by a helicopter but it is cloudy right now so flights have not been possible,\u201d Gauchan told AFP earlier in the day.\n\n\u201cHelicopters are on standby waiting for the clouds to clear,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the Aviation Safety Network website, the aircraft was made by Canada\u2019s de Havilland and made its first flight more than 40 years ago in 1979.\n\nPast crashes\n\nTara Air is a subsidiary of Yeti Airlines, a privately owned domestic carrier that services many remote destinations across Nepal.\n\nIt suffered its last fatal accident in 2016 on the same route when a plane with 23 onboard crashed into a mountainside in Myagdi district.\n\nNepal\u2019s air industry has boomed in recent years, carrying goods and people between hard-to-reach areas as well as foreign trekkers and climbers.\n\nBut it has long been plagued by poor safety due to insufficient training and maintenance.\n\nThe European Union has banned all Nepali airlines from its airspace over safety concerns.\n\nThe Himalayan country also has some of the world\u2019s most remote and tricky runways, flanked by snow-capped peaks with approaches that pose a challenge even for accomplished pilots.\n\nThe weather can also change quickly in the mountains, creating treacherous flying conditions.\n\nIn March 2018, a US-Bangla Airlines plane crash-landed near Kathmandu\u2019s notoriously difficult international airport, killing 51 people and seriously injuring 20.\n\nThat accident was Nepal\u2019s deadliest since 1992 when all 167 people aboard a Pakistan International Airlines plane died when it crashed on approach to Kathmandu airport.\n\nJust two months earlier a Thai Airways aircraft had crashed near the same airport, killing 113 people.",

But he said Ukrainian forces had driven the Russians out of the village of Toshkivka to the south, potentially frustrating Moscow\u2019s push to encircle the area.\n\n\u201cCapturing Sievierodonetsk is a fundamental task for the occupiers \u2026 We do all we can to hold this advance,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a televised speech.\n\n\u201cSome 90% of buildings are damaged. More than two-thirds of the city\u2019s housing stock has been completely destroyed.\u201d\n\nEuropean Union leaders were due to meet on Monday and Tuesday to discuss a new sanctions package against Russia, potentially including an oil embargo.\n\nBut EU governments have been unable to reach agreement in a month of talks, with Hungary in particular saying it cannot afford to shut off the Russian oil that supplies its refineries through the huge Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline, whose name means \u201cFriendship\u201d.\n\nAhead of the summit, German Economy Minister Robert Habeck expressed fears that EU unity was \u201cstarting to crumble\u201d. Draft conclusions, seen by Reuters, indicated there would be little in terms of new decisions.\n\nBut EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that \u201cthere will be an agreement in the end\u201d, with a deal on the next sanctions package by Monday afternoon.\n\n\u2018UNCONDITIONAL PRIORITY\u2019\n\nAfter failing to capture Kyiv in March, Russia announced that the focus of its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d was now to seize the entire Donbas region, consisting of two provinces, Luhansk and Donetsk, that Moscow claims on behalf of separatist proxies.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Sunday said the \u201cliberation\u201d of the Donbas was an \u201cunconditional priority\u201d for Moscow. read more\n\nCapturing Sievierodonetsk and its twin city Lysychansk on the opposite bank of the Siverskyi Donets river would give Russia effective control of Luhansk province, a point at which the Kremlin might be able to declare some form of victory.\n\nBut by focusing its effort on a battle for the single small city \u2013 Sievierodonetsk housed only around 100,000 people before the war \u2013 Russia might be leaving other territory open to eventual Ukrainian counterstrikes.\n\nThe past few days have seen initial signs of a potential Ukrainian counteroffensive in the south, where Moscow is trying to consolidate its control of Kherson province, captured in the early weeks after it launched its invasion in February.\n\nKyiv says its forces pushed back Russian troops in recent days to defensive positions in three villages \u2013 Andriyivka, Lozove and Bilohorka \u2013 all located on the south bank of the Inhulets River that forms the border of Kherson.\n\nThe Institute for the Study of War think tank said this Ukrainian counterattack so far did not appear likely to retake substantial territory in the near term, but could disrupt Russian operations and force Moscow to reinforce the area.\n\nJust to the north of the Kherson front, a suspected Russian strike damaged the centre of the Ukrainian-held town of Novyi Buh overnight, the town council said on Telegram.\n\nRussia said it had also struck a shipyard in Mykolayiv, a major Ukrainian-held port just west of Kherson.\n\nSeparately, French Foreign Affairs Minister Catherine Colonna was due to meet Zelenskiy in Kyiv later on Monday to offer more support, the French foreign affairs ministry said.\n\nThe Ukrainian government urged the West to provide more longer-range weapons to turn the tide in the war, now in its fourth month. Zelenskiy said he expected \u201cgood news\u201d in the coming days.\n\nA Ukrainian soldier on patrol in trenches near the town of Bakhmut, southwest of Sievierodonetsk, spoke of a nagging fear that his government could be drawn into negotiating an end to the conflict that would result in Ukraine losing territory.\n\n\u201cYou know now what I\u2019m most afraid of, now that the fighting is so intense, so tough?\u201d Dmytro, a former English language teacher, told Reuters television. \u201cThat we would be told: That\u2019s it, stop it, we have a ceasefire.\u201d\n\n\u201cA negotiated settlement can only happen on Ukrainian terms, and at present if it happened it would be a horror.\u201d\n\nReuters",
