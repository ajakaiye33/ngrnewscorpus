          "text": "The House of Representatives\u2019 Ad Hoc Committee on Assessment and Status of All Recovered Loots Movable and Immovable Assets from 2002 to 2020 by Agencies of the Federal Government of Nigeria for Effective Efficient Management and Utilisation has urged the Federal Government to return the $40.379m said to have been recovered by the disbanded Special Presidential Investigation Panel for the Recovery of Public Property to Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.\n\nThe acting Chairman of the committee, Sada Soli, made the call at an investigative hearing in Abuja on Tuesday.\n\nAccording the committee, the money was recovered from Keystone Bank and deposited into the Federal Government Recovery Account domiciled with Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nThe Managing Director of Keystone Bank, Lawal Ahmed, said the new management of the bank had since taking charge \u201ctransferred part of the money in four tranches into the NNPC\u2019s TAS account with the CBN.\u201d\n\nThe committee also resolved to place the sums of N356m and N1.1bn promissory notes transferred by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to the Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria on status inquiry.\n\nIn his presentation, AMCON\u2019s Head of Enforcement, Mr. Usman Abubakar, noted that the two promissory notes were wrongfully issued in favour of EFCC and was rejected. He, however, noted that EFCC returned the promissory notes to DMO, which acceded to issue fresh promissory notes in favour of AMCON, in the sums of N328m and N866m.\n\nThe committee, therefore, directed AMCON\u2019s representative to \u201cforward copies of the promissory notes re-issued to it by DMO.\u201d The committee also resolved to \u201cinvestigate the actual amount recovered by the presidential panel based on the N35bn recovered on behalf of the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria against the N43bn worth of post-dated cheques issues by some of the debtors.\u201d\n\nThe FMBN, in the documents submitted to the committee, showed that the sum of N15.3bn was recovered by the SPIP.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

According to Mr Oriaku, \u201cthe Paris Refund came in three trenches of N10.6bn, N5.7bn and N5.7bn. All these funds except N1.7bn were used exclusively for payments of arrears owed Abia State workers partly before the Ikpeazu administration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s laughable that Otti believes the state government should now re-investigate matters before the EFCC or courts even after his primary source, Oriaku, stated publicly that our administration didn\u2019t endorse any contract with the named aggrieved consultant and that, indeed, Governor Ikpeazu refused to pay any 30% or 20% of it to anyone.\n\n\u201cWhatever role played by anybody in the recovery of Paris Club Refunds to Abia must have been stated in whatever contract document Mr Otti and Oriaku made reference to, which the current administration refused to pay. It\u2019s therefore not our duty to re-litigate a matter that\u2019s before the courts and the EFCC.\n\n\u201cAs can be expected from any responsible Government, we\u2019re awaiting the outcome of the EFCC investigation and the civil suit in Abuja to determine our next course of action.\u201d",

There are a lot of stories about kidnappers going to schools; we want to be well ahead of them. The Federal Government has given us money to do this and we want a situation whereby people are free to move.\n\n\u201cWe have spent a lot of money on the security fencing but it is not enough yet because what we need is billions to do the fence but we have gotten close to a billion. We are really struggling to make sure all the fences are completed.\n\n\u201cWe continue to receive support for fencing, a few weeks ago we got about an additional support of N16 million because the Federal Government understands that this public university in the Federal Capital Territory must be secured and safe.\n\n\u201cOur students exposure to insecurity is very serious but we are not resting and we have strategies we have put in place to make sure our students are secured and there is no going back on the fencing but since we know we can\u2019t get all the money we need instantly, we are working with security operatives regularly to keep them safe and ad we get the money because we need these funding, we will do more in addition to what we are doing.\u201d\n\nNa\u2019Allah, who noted that his greatest achievement in the last two years was the establishment of a vibrant portal for the university added that in addition to the many infrastructural development, a grant of N850 million has been received from the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) to construct more hostels for students.\n\nHe explained that the TETFund funded hostels which were different from those to be undertaken by ten private investors through the public-private partnership arrangement of the Federal Government, were primarily to provide more campus accommodation for all students of the university, in line with a grooming policy, to have all students live on campus.\n\nThe V-C said: \u201cThe hostels we have are less than 20 per cent of the population of the students. In the last year, we are strengthening that to ensure we have more hostels on campus and we received 23 formal investors who applied and 10 were shortlisted whom we are working with following the Federal Government\u2019s arrangement on PPP.\n\n\u201cThe investors will move into campus and begin to build, we are developing a policy that students should be able to stay on our campus especially, under-graduates throughout their studies in the university.\n\n\u201cWe are also looking at grants to make this happen and TETFund has given us N850 million to build hostels on our campus and we are already in the process to begin implementation of the hostels. This will be different from the private hostels.\u201d",

          "text": "First runner up at the primary election of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) held in Awka, Dr Obiora Okonkwo, has expressed his reservations about the poll.\n\nOkonkwo, in a statement, yesterday, alleged that there was a foul play in the process that produced the party\u2019s candidate. He asked his teaming supporters to wait for the next line of action which would be disclosed to them soonest.\n\n\u201cWe went into the election full of hope and expectation. Our hope was that our party, the PDP, and members of our party will conduct themselves in a manner that will prove that we are ready to do the right thing, devoid of subterfuge. Our expectation was that the wishes of the people would be allowed to prevail.\n\n\u201cFrom the result announced by the Committee led by His Excellency, Philip Shaibu, the deputy governor of Edo State, it is obvious that the outcome of that exercise did not reflect your wishes and desires. Just like you, our campaign team expected a different outcome which would be a true reflection of your choice and the reality on the ground.\n\n\u201cObviously, there were a number of serious issues and irregularities regarding the primary election. First, in response to conflicting court judgments the party decided to use super delegates in clear breach of its own constitution and in the process disenfranchised its statutory delegates who are the soul of PDP in Anambra state and who have been working in the past three years to reposition the party and sensitise the people for the simple reason that they were afraid of the choice that they might have made.\n\n\u201cHowever, there was a court judgement and order validating the Ndubuisi Nwobu-led executive which the party ought to have upheld and respected as the first in time.\n\n\u201cThe National Working Committee of the party decided, at the last minute to limit the voting to a small number of super delegates. Even with that, the list of the super delegates kept changing such that voting was unduly delayed after the first round of accreditation where 179 super delegates had been accredited. There were no explanations on why this should happen.\n\n\u201cThe second round of accreditation, done after the list had been changed again and many super delegates removed from the initial list, and many new ones added, turned in 218 super delegates. Again, there were no explanations about the increase.\n\n\u201cThere also were no explanations of the criteria used to exclude some hitherto approved super delegates while adding new ones, some of who are not eligible under the party\u2019s constitution. This prompted my question on the discrepancy which is yet to be answered.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, the most blatant of the irregularities came in the collation of votes. For instance, a total of 218 super delegates were finally accredited for the exercise. The tally of votes cast for the candidates, along with voided votes came to 200.\n\n\u201cA full week after the primary election, nobody has satisfactorily explained what happened to the other 18 votes cast by duly accredited super delegates. We expect those who conducted the election to provide the answer to this obvious discrepancy, particularly given the razor-thin margin of victory of the declared result.\n\n\u201cWhile we await the answer to this question and clarification on other matters relating to the primary election, I humbly urge you my teeming supporters, disenfranchised statutory delegates and the good people of Anambra State, including those in the Diaspora, who were intensely surprised by the outcome of the PDP primary election, to be calm and steadfast and faithful for only the Almighty God has the final say.\n\n\u201cFrom the time we started this journey, we have methodologically engaged the process, employing wide consultation and consensus to arrive at what we consider to be in the best interest of our people. This has never been about me as a person, even more so now that our efforts have morphed into a powerful grassroots political movement for the good governance of Anambra State.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been more than a week since the primary election was conducted; a period we have used for sober reflection and deep introspection about the process which also enabled us to consult widely with our teeming supporters, associates and critical stakeholders. We plead for your patience and understanding as that consultation will continue, for at least another week, after which we will make our position clear with respect to the event of June 26.\n\n\u201cWe solemnly assure that our decision, when it is made, will be based on principle and in the best interest of our people who have always been the driving inspiration of our project- Maka Ilu Olu Oma (doing the good work)\u201d, Okonkwo said\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

If this is not done, the Niger Delta people may be forced to take their destiny into their own hands and all IOCs may find themselves denied access to their oil activities in such communities.\n\n\u201cIt is important to state clearly here to all well-meaning Nigerians that the demand of the oil bearing communities of the Niger Delta region was for a minimum of 10 per cent equity participation. But you Mr. Senate President, the Right Honourable Speaker and some of your colleagues in the National Assembly, have further shown your disdain to the Niger Delta people by redefining host communities to include pipeline-bearing pathway communities, in which case states where pipelines pass through to aid them with the privilege of cheap supplies of Niger Delta petroleum products could also be entitled to the ridiculous and unacceptable percentages that the legislators are willing to cede to oil-bearing communities.\n\n\u201cWe want to warn seriously, that the people of the Niger Delta have had enough of this colonial and oppressive mentality of our Northern brothers and friends.

          "text": "Former Head of State, General Yakubu Gowon; former President, Chief Olusegun Obasanjo; former Head of Interim National Government, Chief Ernest Shonekan; and former President Goodluck Jonathan have condoled with the Aig-Imoukhuede family over the death of their matriarch, Pastor Emily Aig-Imoukhuede.\n\nEmily Imoukhude, former Secretary of State (Minister) for States and Local Government Affairs died on June 8, 2021.\n\nA condolence letter jointly signed by General Yakubu Gowon and his wife, Victoria, urged the family to stay strong and be comforted knowing that she had played well her part and the family also played the roles expected of them to ensure everyday of her life was very well spent.\n\nGowon\u2019s letter read: \u201cAt a time like this, it\u2019s difficult to find the right words to express the depth of the loss of such a fine-spirited woman leader who made sincere and wholesome contribution to nation-building as a former National President of the National Council for Women Societies, NCWS (1988-1993). Her voice on behalf of Nigerian women was strident and hard to ignore. Her appointment as honorable Secretary of State (junior Minister) for States and Local Government Affairs in the Federal Executive Council in 1993 affirmed that women are no pushovers.\n\n\u201cAs a mother, she raised phenominally successful children, Erekpitan, Aigboje, Kemi and Aigbovbioise who have also made indelible marks in their personal and professional callings.\u201d\n\nThe former head of state and his wife also said, \u201cAs an ordained pastor, she worked tirelessly to win souls for God\u2019s Kingdom,\u201d adding, \u201cwe are confident that her good works will remain an everlasting legacy of her time here on earth.\u201d\n\nFormer President Obasanjo, in his condolence letter addressed to her son, Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, described the late Emily Imoukhuede as an \u201dillustrious daughter of Africa.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we mourn the passing of this illustrious daughter of Africa, we must resolve that her great labour of love shall not be in vain,\u201d the former president said.\n\nNoting that the late Emily Aig-Imoukhuede served the nation loyally and with distinction, the former President said her enormous contributions to the nation in particular earned her an eminent position in the nation\u2019s gallery of unforgettable public servants.\n\nObasanjo\u2019s condolence letter read: \u201cIt is with a deep sense of loss that I wish, on behlf of my family and on my behalf, to commiserate with you and the entire members of the Aig-Imoukhuede family on the passing of your dear matriarch, Pastor Emily Okheren Aig-Imiukhuede, on June 8, 2021\n\n\u201cOn occasions like this , it is indeed difficult to find the appropriate words to soothe the anguish of the irreparable loss. She was arguably a great lady who was to her children a mother in a million and one who served variously as a public servant, women\u2019s champion, teacher, confidant, counselor and pillar of strength to you all through her lifetime. Her enormous contributions to the nation in particular earned her an eminent position in the nation\u2019s gallery of unforgettable public servants.\n\n\u201cShe served her country committedly, loyally and with distinction, notably as the Honourable Secretary of State (minister) for States and Local Government in 1993, among others. Indeed she left her mark indelibly in whatever she was called upon to do. Indeed, she was a dutiful and hardworking fellow and gave her very best to the end in the service of her fatherland. In all the assignment she was called upon to do. She was a dutiful and hardworking fellow and gave her very best to the end in the service of her fatherland.\n\n\u201cIn all the assignments she was given, quality and integrity were her imprint and legacy, while she left an indelible mark in her national assignments at the federal level and various facets of the private sector. Her life was, indeed, a clear testimony of divine favour as well as the power of a devoted, loving upbringing on the fortunes of her children. There is no doubt that her memory will remain evergreen well beyond the family. But we must encourage you to accept the inevitable with faith in God\u2019s unfailing love according to His will and purpose.\u201d\n\nChief Ernest Shonekan, in whose government she served as secretary of state for States and Local Government Affairs, described her as \u201can elegant, very kind and good woman.\u201d\n\nHis letter read: \u201cIt is with a very deep sense of loss, yet, with gratitude to God for a life well spent, and also an immense honour for me to be afforded the opportunity on behalf of my wife and children, to pen a tribute to a recently departed, most treasured friend, wife, mother and grandmother.\n\n\u201cEmily and my wife, Margaret began their lifelong friendship as contemporaries at the University College lbadan, in 1951. They both distinguished themselves in their subsequent careers, with Emily as the Curator of the National Museum, and Margaret at the West African Examinations Council. Through them, our children became and have remained friends. Subsequently, they both were appointed as Trustees of the Chrisland University, Abeokuta.\n\n\u201cI remember with fondness and gratitude a beaded walking stick she gave me on my fiftieth birthday, when she also divulged to me that I share the same birthday as one of her sons. lt was such a beautiful work of art, which I have kept to this day. ln 1993, I was privileged to work with her directly when she served in the lnterim government which I led, as the Secretary of State for States and Local Governments.\n\n\u201cEmily always had a smile for everyone. She would have built just as distinguished a career as a diplomat. She was a friend to amazingly diverse people, a devoted family woman, and a most decent human being. Almost all who had the privilege of meeting her in life will acknowledge her extreme kindness, generosity and a very large heart. I have met very few people in my own life, who have matched her capacity to go out of her way to be of assistance wherever she could, even to complete strangers. lt would have come as no surprise to those who knew her well, of her later calling in life to evangelism and expansion of the kingdom of God.\u201d\n\nAlso condoling with the Imoukhuede family, former President Jonathan in his condolence letter addressed to Mr. Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, described her as \u201can accomplished public servant and philanthropist.\u201d\n\nJonathan said her legacies and contributions to national development, especially in the health, education and energy sectors, would continue to endure.\n\nFormer President Jonathan\u2019s letter read: \u201cI learned with deep compassion, the news of the passing on of your dear mother, Mrs. Emily Oheren Aig-Imoukhuede, to eternal glory.\n\n\u201cYour mother was very special to you and your family for which her death would have left a deep void in your heart and in the hearts of all those she dearly loved.\n\n\u201cPlease be comforted by the fact that Mrs. Aig-Imoukhuede was an accomplished public servant and philanthropist whose legacies and contributions to national development, especially in the health, education and energy sectors, will continue to endure.\n\n\u201cShe will also be remembered as an exemplary matriarch and epitome of motherhood, having nurtured and brought up distinguished Nigerians and successful netrepreneurs like you and your siblings.\u201d\n\nThe former President prayed God to grant her soul eternal repose and the family the fortitude to bear her absence.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The forum disagrees that the company be vested in the Federal Ministry of Finance but should be held in trust by Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) since all tiers of government have stakes in that vehicle.\n\n\u201cIn order to consolidate our democracy and strengthen the Electoral process, the Southern Governors\u2019 Forum rejects the removal of the electronic transmission of the election result from the electoral act; and also rejects the confirmation of exclusive jurisdiction in pre-election matters on the Federal High Court.\n\nThey unanimously chose Lagos State as the forum\u2019s permanent secretariat.\n\nGovernors present at the meeting include Senator Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State, Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, Akeredolu of Ondo State, Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State, Udom Emmanuel of Akwa Ibom, Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, Douye Diri of Bayelsa State and Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, and Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State.\n\nGovernor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State was represented by his deputy, Placid Njoku; while Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo was represented by his deputy, Philip Shaibu.\n\nThe deputy governor of Ebonyi State, Kelechi Igwe, represented Governor David Umahi, while the deputy governor of Abia State, Oko Chukwu, represented Governor Okezie Ikpeazu.\n\nThe governors of Anambra and Cross River States were not represented at the meeting.\n\nMeanwhile, the Yoruba Ronu Leadership Forum has thrown its weight behind yesterday\u2019s resolutions of the southern governors.\n\nPresident of the forum, Mr. Akin Malaolu said in a statement yesterday that the southern \u201cgovernors took landmark decisions that may put the nation on a good road to the recovery of her beauty in African\u2019s eyes and the world.\u201d\n\nHe said the governors\u2019 objections on what host and producing communities will take for government mining of oil on their indigenous lands and as stated in the petroleum industry bill, including the reconfiguration of the NNPC deserves scrutiny once again by the two chambers of the National Assembly.\n\nHe called on the Senate and House of Representatives to revisit their versions of the bills to address some disagreement, especially in the area of the percentage that should be allocated to host communities.\n\n\u201cWe support the governors for recognizing the need for respect and regard for their positions as the chief security officers of their individual state. Their approval to enact anti-open grazing laws as legal teeth to reduce famine in the land and curb incessant conflicts deserve praises,\u201d the forum said.\n\nThe forum condemned what it described as the Gestapo-style known to belong to Hitler\u2019s era perpetrated against Chief Sunday Igboho, saying it was an incident that the Governor of Oyo State, Mr. Seyi Makinde, should take up officially and persuade the federal government to apologise for their criminal actions.\n\nAfenifere, Ohanaeze Back Govs\u2019 Demands\n\nReacting to the governors\u2019 demands, Afenifere, yesterday said since the North would have ruled consecutively for eight years by 2023, the next president would come from the South.\n\nThe National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Jare Ajayi, while speaking with THISDAY, said it was imperative that the next president must come from the South if only for the sake of equity, fairness and justice.\n\nHe, however, maintained that what is important to the group is the restructuring of the country before the next election, noting that every section of the country has people who are capable of occupying any position in the country, including the presidency \u201cin order to ensure that every section of the country has a sense of belonging.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, to us in Afenifere, political parties should ensure that their presidential candidates are picked from the South. But beyond the issue of where the next president comes from, it must be a condition that restructuring takes place before the next elections in Nigeria! Restructuring that encapsulates true federalism and confers the leverage for self-determination on the constituent components of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nAlso reacting to the communiqu\u00e9, the Ohanaeze Ndigbo\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Chief Alex Ogbonia, who spoke to THISDAY, appealed to the governors to move a step further by conceding the presidency to the South-east in the spirit of justice, equity and fairness.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe outcome of their meeting in Lagos is a welcome development because the issue of the presidency moving to the South-east should be non-negotiable.\n\n\u201cThis was part of the gentleman agreement reached between Northern and Southern leaders in 1998 to the effect that the Presidency should alternate between the North and the South.\n\n\u201cThe South-west have had their full share through President Olusegun Obasanjo while the South-south have equally had their share through President Goodluck Jonathan; it is, therefore the turn of the South East.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe governors should therefore be magnanimous enough to reciprocate the kindness of the people of the South-east by boldly declaring that 2023 is for the South-east.\u201d\n\nPANDEF Hails Southern Govs\n\nPANDEF has also hailed the unanimous resolution on the Southern presidency.\n\nThe group\u2019s spokesman, Hon. Ken Robinson, in a reaction, expressed happiness that the Southern governors met again, less than two months, after their historic Asaba meeting, to further accentuate the wishes and aspirations of the people of Southern Nigeria.\n\nPANDEF, he said, is happy that the Southern governors have now added their voice to the critical matter, given the irrational proposals by some mischievous persons that the presidency should be open to all zones of the country in 2023\n\nThe group congratulated the Southern Governors and commended them for the demonstration of solidarity, and the commitment to consolidate the Unity of Southern Nigeria adding that \u201cwe hope that they would sustain this spirit of understanding and congruence, in the best interest of our people and the country\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "The House of Representatives has passed for second reading, a bill seeking to amend the 1999 Constitution to allow creation of state police and legalise regional security outfits. The current police system will be decentralised by moving police from the Exclusive Legislative List to the Concurrent List.\n\nThe Chairman of the House Committee on Judiciary, Onofiok Luke, who sponsored the bill, said in the explanatory note that the bill seeks to alter the Constitution \u201cto provide for state police and other state government security services to enhance security and preservation of lives and properties in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe bill especially proposes an amendment to Section 197(1) by inserting new Paragraphs \u2018e\u2019 and \u2018f\u2019 to provide for \u2018State Police Council\u2019 and \u2018State Police Service Commission,\u2019 respectively.\n\nThe Second Schedule to the Constitution will also be altered in Part I by deleting Item 45 from the Exclusive Legislative List; and in Part II by inserting after Item 30 on the Concurrent Legislative List, new Items 31 and 32.\n\nThe proposal reads, \u201c(31) The National Assembly may make laws for the establishment of the federal police and other federal government security services;\n\n\u201c(32) A House of Assembly may make laws for the establishment of state police and other state government security services.\u201d\n\nThe Third Schedule to the Constitution will also be altered by inserting new Paragraphs 9 to 12\n\nThe new paragraphs read, \u201c(9) A State Police Council shall comprise the following members: (a) the governor, who shall be the chairman; (b) the chairman of the State Police Service Commission; and (c) State Commissioner of Police.\n\n\u201c(10) The functions of a State Police Council shall include (a) the organisation and administration of a State Police Force and all other matters relating thereto (not being matters relating to the use and operational control of the Force or the appointment, disciplinary control and dismissal of members of the Force); (b) the general supervision of a State Police Force; and (c) advising the governor on the appointment of State Commissioner of Police.\u201d\n\nLeading debate on the bill, Luke said, \u201cMany years after independence, Nigeria has continually been beset with insecurity ranging from terrorism, kidnapping, armed robbery and domestic violence. Granted that there is no society without crime or manifestation of criminal behaviour, our inability to bring to the barest minimum crime is a scathing indictment on the current security architecture and structure in the country.\n\n\u201cThe federal structuring of our security does not encourage community policing or localisation of policing. Recruitment and subsequent deployment of police officers in their local area is one of the major ways of curbing crime. Such officers understand the area, terrain, language, behaviour and attitude of the people he or she is policing.\n\n\u201cNigeria, a country with over 201 million people, is grossly under policed with about 400, 000 police personnel. This number falls far short of the United Nation\u2019s recommendation of ratio 1 per 400 citizens.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution envisages Nigeria as a federal state. Granting allowance to state governments to establish police force and other security apparatuses will bring Nigeria into original constitutional contemplation of a federal state.\u201d\n\nThe Deputy Minority Leader, Toby Okechukwu, stated that creation of state police is long overdue with the current security crises across the country.",

The current police system will be decentralised by moving police from the Exclusive Legislative List to the Concurrent List.\n\nThe Chairman of the House Committee on Judiciary, Onofiok Luke, who sponsored the bill, said in the explanatory note that the bill seeks to alter the Constitution \u201cto provide for state police and other state government security services to enhance security and preservation of lives and properties in Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe bill especially proposes an amendment to Section 197(1) by inserting new Paragraphs \u2018e\u2019 and \u2018f\u2019 to provide for \u2018State Police Council\u2019 and \u2018State Police Service Commission,\u2019 respectively.\n\nThe Second Schedule to the Constitution will also be altered in Part I by deleting Item 45 from the Exclusive Legislative List; and in Part II by inserting after Item 30 on the Concurrent Legislative List, new Items 31 and 32.\n\nThe proposal reads, \u201c(31) The National Assembly may make laws for the establishment of the federal police and other federal government security services;\n\n\u201c(32) A House of Assembly may make laws for the establishment of state police and other state government security services.\u201d\n\nThe Third Schedule to the Constitution will also be altered by inserting new Paragraphs 9 to 12\n\nThe new paragraphs read, \u201c(9) A State Police Council shall comprise the following members: (a) the governor, who shall be the chairman; (b) the chairman of the State Police Service Commission; and (c) State Commissioner of Police.\n\n\u201c(10) The functions of a State Police Council shall include (a) the organisation and administration of a State Police Force and all other matters relating thereto (not being matters relating to the use and operational control of the Force or the appointment, disciplinary control and dismissal of members of the Force); (b) the general supervision of a State Police Force; and (c) advising the governor on the appointment of State Commissioner of Police.\u201d\n\nLeading debate on the bill, Luke said, \u201cMany years after independence, Nigeria has continually been beset with insecurity ranging from terrorism, kidnapping, armed robbery and domestic violence. Granted that there is no society without crime or manifestation of criminal behaviour, our inability to bring to the barest minimum crime is a scathing indictment on the current security architecture and structure in the country.\n\n\u201cThe federal structuring of our security does not encourage community policing or localisation of policing. Recruitment and subsequent deployment of police officers in their local area is one of the major ways of curbing crime. Such officers understand the area, terrain, language, behaviour and attitude of the people he or she is policing.\n\n\u201cNigeria, a country with over 201 million people, is grossly under policed with about 400, 000 police personnel. This number falls far short of the United Nation\u2019s recommendation of ratio 1 per 400 citizens.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution envisages Nigeria as a federal state. Granting allowance to state governments to establish police force and other security apparatuses will bring Nigeria into original constitutional contemplation of a federal state.\u201d\n\nThe Deputy Minority Leader, Toby Okechukwu, stated that creation of state police is long overdue with the current security crises across the country.",

          "title": "From iPhone shortages to price surges: The global chip scarcity is affecting Africa",
          "text": "Car manufacturers in Egypt have had to cut down on production due to a recent lack of electronic control units (ECUs), which are major components in vehicle electrical systems. In South Africa, more than 20,000 people that signed up for Supersonic\u2019s Unlimited Air Fibre service are still waiting to be connected since February, as the company continues to face difficulties getting crucial router components.\n\nThe aforementioned companies operate in two distinct industries (automobile and ICT) and \u2013 apart from the consumers they sell to \u2013 do not really have much in common. But like many others in several industries across the world, they have seen their businesses disrupted by the same problem.\n\nTechnology companies globally have recently been grappling with the shortage of one of the smallest components used in producing millions of tech products yearly \u2013 semiconductor chips.\n\nMonths into the shortage, effects from the ongoing global chip scarcity have spread far and wide, across industries and the globe. Automotive and consumer hardware companies are being hit the worst and those in Africa have not been spared.\n\nDistributors of Acer products in South Africa \u2013 Mustek, Rectron, and Homemation \u2013 told ITWeb that the severe shortage has caused a ripple effect across all industry verticals, leading to a shortage of laptops, tablets, printing and scanning equipment, and peripherals.\n\nThe automobile industry is one of the hardest hit by the semiconductor shortage with carmakers across the world forced to slash production.\n\nPrice jumps as over 100 industries suffer\n\nAn analysis by U.S. investment bank, Goldman Sachs, estimates that the semiconductor scarcity affects a staggering 169 industries in some way. This is due to the fact that chips are more widely used today. They used to be present in only personal computers and mobile phones a little over a decade ago. Now, in the wake of rapid digital advancements, semiconductors are in everything from vehicles to washing machines.\n\nManufacturers have struggled to keep up with the huge demand in recent months, a problem blamed partly on supply chain disruptions caused by national Covid-19 lockdowns, uncertainties stemming from the U.S.-China trade war, as well as a drought in Taiwan, home to the largest semiconductor maker in the world.\n\nIn fact, Taiwan is one of the four countries in Asia behind nearly three-quarters of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity. Of these countries, only two produce the most cutting-edge chips.\n\nThe Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) alone provides 92% of cutting-edge chips globally \u2013 with Samsung accounting for the rest \u2013 and 60% of chips used by automobile companies. This leaves companies with few options to get chips when the producers run out of capacity and also raises concerns about the concentration of chip manufacturing in relatively few countries.\n\nThe global semiconductor scarcity affects a staggering 169 industries in some way, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nU.S. tech giant Apple has been significantly affected as it is one of TSMC\u2019s biggest clients. In South Africa, many stores run by the company\u2019s authorised reseller, iStore, have reportedly experienced shortages in iPhone stock. Meanwhile, TechCabal was unable to reach the Nigerian unit of iStore for comments as of the time this article was published.\n\nGoing by the law of demand and supply in economics, there is bound to be an increase in the price of a product when there\u2019s a scarcity, as long as all things remain equal. So the global chip shortage has naturally led to price increases and there\u2019s not so much local players can do about it.\n\n\u201cThese are not components domestic car makers can produce,\u201d head of the Egyptian Association of Automobile Manufacturers, Khaled Saad, reportedly told local press. \u201cThe problem is already putting pressure on car prices domestically and it is expected to raise prices further.\u201d\n\nReports show many local stores in South Africa are now selling well above the retail prices suggested by manufacturers.\n\nAccording to David Kan, CEO of Mustek, the ongoing shortage is the worst in more than three decades. \u201cIn my 34 years of working within the IT industry, I have never experienced or seen such shortages. Pricing has gone through the roof!\u201d\n\nAny end in sight?\n\nThe multifaceted global chip shortage problem is showing no signs of abating.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, there were hopes that the supply chain issues would have been sorted by the summer. However, it is unlikely that will be the case, even though the summer does not end until September.\n\nIndustry analysts also can\u2019t seem to agree on when the shortage will end, with predictions ranging from the second half of 2021 to the beginning of 2022. Some experts say the effects of the crisis could last well into 2023. However, the general consensus seems to be that things will get even worse before it gets better as there is no immediate solution.\n\nSome global chipmakers \u2013 such as TSMC, Samsung, and Intel \u2013 are already investing to expand their capacity and ramp up production. The U.S. is also working towards investing billions in its semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nIn Africa, Kenya\u2019s Dedan Kimathi University of Technology partnered with American firm 4Wave Inc on the launch of the country\u2019s first semiconductor factory earlier this year.\n\nA future partnership between local car agents and brand owners to set up local facilities for manufacturing high-tech components like semiconductors is also being mooted among automobile stakeholders in Egypt.\n\nBut these moves can do little to ease off the crisis immediately as it will take months, if not several years, for the investments to mature.\n\nFor now, tech products are bound to keep fighting for limited chips, manufacturers grappling with delayed production, and consumers suffering from shortages and price increases.\n\nDid you enjoy reading this article?

          "summary": "Months into the shortage, effects from the ongoing global chip scarcity have spread far and wide, across industries and the globe.\nThe automobile industry is one of the hardest hit by the semiconductor shortage with carmakers across the world forced to slash production.\nIn fact, Taiwan is one of the four countries in Asia behind nearly three-quarters of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity.\nThe global semiconductor scarcity affects a staggering 169 industries in some way, according to Goldman Sachs.\nSo the global chip shortage has naturally led to price increases and there\u2019s not so much local players can do about it.",

          "title": "What telcos and banks look for in fintech partnerships",
          "text": "Fintech is growing in Africa thanks to strategic partnerships between startups, banks and diverse categories of global companies. According to McKinsey & Company, at least five models of partnerships are currently favoured.\n\nOne model is a vendor relationship: a bank that needs to quickly go to market with an innovation opts to ride on a fintech\u2019s technology, avoiding the hassle of building from scratch.\n\nIn a distribution model, a digital-only bank (say Kuda) partners with traditional banks to offer in-branch deposits, ATM withdrawals and card issuance. Chaka, the recently licensed stock trading app, has been able to provide investment options to users by working with brokerage partners.\n\nOther partnership models from McKinsey\u2019s research include strategic Investments (like Visa\u2019s 20% stake in Interswitch); joint ventures (where two entities create a common product together); and outright acquisitions \u2013 the popular example over the past year being Paystack\u2019s acquisition by Stripe.\n\nWhatever the partnership type, the aim is to win. For a startup, a long term win might be a successful exit or Initial Public Offering (IPO). Otherwise, the immediate goal is to accelerate growth at a rate they wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve if they worked alone.\n\nBut partnerships don\u2019t automatically work just because two parties have good intentions or similar ambitions.\n\nNot a piece of cake\n\n\u201cSuccess should not be taken for granted and both parties need to be well prepared,\u201d says Mayowa Kuyoro, partner at McKinsey and head of its West Africa financial services practice.\n\nAlignment on resources, culture and regulatory compliance, among other factors, is key.\n\nIt\u2019s a consideration that is always on Abubakar Suleiman\u2019s mind. As CEO of Sterling Bank, Suleiman receives partnership offers regularly and believes himself open to having many conversations.\n\nBut he has identified a problem: \u201cMore often than not, we are not clear about the problem we are trying to solve,\u201d Suleiman said. \u201cWe are trying to jump into partnerships because we think there is profit to be shared.\u201d\n\nPartnership conversations have worked better for Suleiman when the initial focus was on problems and the capacity to solve them. And so he wishes to encourage an approach that frames partnerships in terms of capabilities, not institutions.\n\nFor example, a startup that needs a partner for regulatory issues should go for the most capable and experienced firm on the subject. It should not matter whether this firm is a big bank or whatever else.\n\nWhat\u2019s on the table?\n\nThat said, the size of rewards at stake for both parties matters.\n\n\u201cIt is important to make sure the economics work out for everybody,\u201d says Tayo Oviosu, co-founder and CEO of Paga.\n\nHe cites the example of Paga\u2019s partnership with Interswitch in the 2010s which, though initially successful in terms of returns to both parties, tapered off for a while. It raised a need for a review after which Paga decided it was in its best interest to plug directly into every other billing services provider in Nigeria.\n\nRia, the money transfer service provider, operates in 43 African countries. According to Robert Kotei, operations director for Africa, startups and companies present beyond one country can be more appealing to multinational companies looking for partnerships.\n\nHowever, sometimes a startup may need to patiently prove itself before landing big partnerships.\n\nWhile getting Bankly off the ground in 2019, Tomilola Majekodunmi faced the dilemma of deciding what partners she needed for the startup\u2019s ambition to digitalise contributory savings networks known as ajo. To achieve this, Bankly planned to work with telcos.\n\nIt didn\u2019t work out, partly because the potential partners were already looking to directly offer services similar to what Bankly proposed. They did not see a unique advantage to entice them towards a partnership.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t get a fair or just partnership either because we were too young or too small for these big players,\u201d Majekodunmi said. So Bankly spent two years building an agent network which now numbers 15,000 agents across Nigeria.\n\nMinimum viable partnerships\n\nElsa Muzzolini, a general manager for MTN\u2019s mobile financial services, acknowledges the difficulty in partnering with relatively small startups. Three factors, she said, are often at play.\n\nParties may have different expectations for how long deals take to complete. They may diverge on the initially agreed scope, and finding the precise contact person who can activate decisions can be hard.\n\nWhere these factors come together, partnerships can work. But Muzzolini would like startups to seek avenues for collaboration that bypass the formal phases that a typical partnership entails.\n\n\u201cCan we do a lighter form of partnership? Get my API, run with it. Maybe at a later stage as your numbers grow, we can discuss co-branding and other things.\u201d\n\nFollow all TechCabal Live conversations on our YouTube channel.

          "title": "Tolu Michaels on how digital entrepreneurs create and sell intangible products online",
          "text": "In 2021, when you think of how best to serve people beyond physical borders, the internet comes to mind.\n\nBuilding a business on the internet could play out in two different ways. Your business can either deal with offering physical products for sale online or providing a service online. The former would be tangible while the latter would have no physical form whatsoever.\n\nTolu Michael chose to provide a service \u2013 a digital product \u2013 where she guides people on how to establish personal reputation using the internet. She\u2019s helping them gain visibility online. I had an interesting chat with her on what it\u2019s like creating services and selling to tens of thousands of people online from the comfort of her home in Lagos, Nigeria. But before we dive in, let\u2019s take a stroll through her career journey.\n\nA digital entrepreneur with an engineering background\n\nAfter studying mechanical engineering in Nigeria- something she did because of her love for cars \u2013 she took a detour into the world of investment banking. This happened after she interned at a Toyota after-sales franchise for a while and realised she didn\u2019t want to deal with the smell of petrol and engine oil every day.\n\nSomewhere in her career journey, marriage happened and she had to move cities but during that process, she lost her job so she had to rethink her career path. As a woman, changing jobs alongside starting a new family came with startling challenges.\n\nMichaels\u2019 initial obstacle being a newly wedded woman is not exactly a peculiar one. In a lot of family situations, prioritizing family over work is the number one barrier to a woman\u2019s career. This study by Harvard Business School says more than half of Gen X and Baby Boomer men expected that their careers would take priority over their partners. In the study, \u201c73 percent of men and 85 percent of women agreed that prioritizing family over work is the most difficult career decision women face.\n\nFor Michaels, being newly married came with lots of \u201cspecific rejections,\u201d where employers assume she might get carried away with building a family and leave her job to suffer. At this point, searching for new job opportunities proved abortive so she figured she could try out something on her own and that just happened to be digital entrepreneurship.\n\n\u201cInitially, I started to ask myself, what do I have to offer people, especially beyond borders, because I couldn\u2019t do something physical. I didn\u2019t have the capital to sell physical products so I needed something I could provide people in whatever location I am,\u201d she tells me on our Google Meet call.\n\nLeveraging knowledge commerce\n\nDigital products are basically online products that can\u2019t be held, touched, or tasted. They could be music, videos, ebooks, online courses or even this article you are reading. They are only created and delivered electronically.\n\nTo generate revenue, a digital entrepreneur builds their platform through personal branding, this is particularly pertinent to gain visibility and influence more sales\n\nPersonal branding is all about positioning, Michaels tells me. \u201cYou don\u2019t even need to have a very large audience, all you need is to position yourself as a valuable expert and leader. This will allow the right people and the right opportunities to be attracted to you.\u201d\n\nIn the initial stage of her digital career, Michaels picked up new skills including a degree on Disruptive Strategy from Harvard Business school. She had also helped a few friends build their personal brands so it was about time to enlarge her area of reach.\n\nFirst, she buffed up her social media presence, which she says is a major part of \u201cpositioning.\u201d Social media is free to use but to gain followers or reach a larger audience, one needs to put in the work. She got her \u201cfirst-ever client from outside her circle of friends\u201d from Instagram. One would think LinkedIn could have been at the forefront of this process but, she says, in selling digital products, entrepreneurs should have their profiles on all social media platforms and utilise each platform fully.\n\nFrom getting her first international client to building a personal platform that has trained over 20,000 people in over 12 countries of the world, what Michaels really does is teach modern entrepreneurs how \u201cto build purposeful and profitable personal brands, so that they can stand out of the crowd and sell impactful products.\u201d\n\nShe does this through branding, online courses, consultations, podcasting and through her book, Show Up. For her, work revolves around helping people get the clarity and confidence to show up online, communicate their values, and create a bigger impact with their work. How she sells is mostly by referrals from people she\u2019s worked with in the past.\n\nFor some digital entrepreneurs, online sales only provide supplementary income in addition to their main jobs but for people like her, it is a full-time job that is earning her a living.\n\nWhen Michaels made her first 1000 dollars just from putting her thoughts together and selling to her audience, she became an ardent digital product creator. What is even more important to her is positioning herself not as someone whose products are for an African audience alone but for an untapped global market.\n\nAs one who speaks candidly about juggling motherhood, selling digital products is not just helping her create impact and make money while at it, it is also enabling her to work mostly from the comfort of her home, close to her daughter.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Product partnership managers are obsessed with a product\u2019s life cycle",
          "text": "Product and partnership managers are a nascent breed of individuals who act as a bridge between external partners and their companies. While product managers are responsible for hand holding a product from conception to maturity, product and partnership managers go a step further by exposing the product to valuable collaborations.\n\nI am bringing Tide Ayeni to Centre Stage because he understands the fundamentals of building partnerships into existing products. In his role as product and partnership manager at Indicina, he is responsible for driving growth through setting up successful partnerships and working with them to launch consumer credit products.\n\nWhat is your favourite part of a product life cycle?\n\nFor people who don\u2019t know, the life cycle of a product is broken into four parts: introduction (birth), growth, maturity, and decline (or death). My favourite part has to be the growth of a product. I\u2019m obsessed with numbers \u2014 as should every product and partnership manager.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, the maturity part is great because you can kind of kick back and watch your product make money. But the growth stage keeps you on your toes.\n\nSay more, please\n\nOur tech ecosystem is designed to promote collaboration and partnership. Can you grow your product successfully without partnering with a bigger company, yes. Is that method sustainable? No. Why? Because you will end up putting you and your product into a box. If you want your product to go farther than its birthplace, you need to get creative with your partnerships. Some partners can help you figure out marketing strategies and campaigns; other collaborators can help you aggressively penetrate a new market.\n\nIn your years of experience working as a product partnership manager, have you ever experienced the death of a product?\n\nOh my goodness, yes! During my time at Interswitch, we had a product that was designed to work for a specific market. I mean we put everything we had into that product but over time, we realized that it wasn\u2019t a good fit for that market. When the product was in its ideation stage, it was built for prospective retail clients. But when we went back to the drawing board, we discovered that it would work better for government agencies and hospitals. Imagine that?\n\nHow did you handle the product\u2019s demise?\n\nMy team made an executive decision to bring the product to end of life and move into maintenance mode; which means we didn\u2019t make any code improvements or fix existing bugs. We also sent out an email to all the users letting them know our decision.\n\nCan you tell us why partnerships matter in product development?\n\nBecause you can\u2019t do everything yourself. If I want to build multiple features into one product, I have two options: I can either pressure my developers to figure out how to hack the infrastructure; or I can find a partner that has already done the work and just connect my product to their rails. Collaboration is a shorter route to making things happen for your product.\n\nHow can you tell when a product is on its way to becoming powerful?\n\nFirstly, you have to consider timing. A powerful product will enter the market at the right time. If the timing isn\u2019t right, your product will not scale and adoption rates will be low.\n\nSecondly, a powerful product is backed by a powerful team. I cannot stress enough that a good team plays an important role in a product\u2019s life cycle\u2013 particularly where growth and maturity are concerned.\n\nLastly, when your market accepts and adopts your product, it is well on its way to becoming powerful.\n\nHow do you develop yourself in your role? What are you reading, watching, or listening to?\n\nI do a lot of courses. I try my best to use that to fill whatever gaps I feel like I might have in my day to day. I\u2019m a big fan of product management and business analytics courses because they directly influence the work I do at Indicina. Prodpad is a great resource for aspiring product partnership managers \u2014 they have a great blog and also offer online courses.\n\nWhat kind of skills are required for your role?\n\nPatience. Product partnership managers have to be extremely patient people. You are dealing with different personalities, clients, departments, and stakeholders. You are constantly coordinating moving parts so you cannot afford to lose your head.\n\nThen you need to know how to articulate your thoughts and translate technical requirements into plain language. You need to be able to make your future partners understand the problem you are trying to solve with your product. Eloquence sells products.\n\nFinally you need an ownership mentality. When you successfully own a product you motivate people to step out of their comfort zones. And you know what\u2019s true? Real magic happens outside your comfort zone.\n\nWhat are some of the challenges product partnership managers face on the job?\n\nThe pricing is never right; that is something that you need to understand. Your prospective partners will negotiate pricing and terms and you have to be prepared to handle that conversation.\n\nYou might also run into challenges where value is concerned. You must ensure that you and your partner are aligned in your definition of value. This way you are forging a mutually beneficial relationship that could last for a long time.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s talk about leadership. How do you motivate your team?\n\nI listen to understand and I lead a place from understanding. That means understanding our goals, KPIs, mission, and strategies. We are working together to achieve a common goal so if we are all on the same page, we can really make magic happen.\n\nI also try my best to communicate effectively with my team and direct line managers. I leave room to receive feedback from my peers and team members. You can\u2019t just talk at people or dump information on them \u2013 you have to be open to hearing their opinions.\n\nTransparency is absolutely essential as well. When I have all the information I need then I am motivated to work hard and punch above my weight.\n\nWhat do you think about the future of technology? What are you excited about?\n\nI\u2019m really excited to see more African founders playing around with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning models. AI and machine learning will help African countries digitize their databases and information centres. When you have access to verified consumer information and data, you can offer crucial financial services like credit, debt financing, mortgages, etc.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this edition of Centre Stage, please consider sharing it in your Whatsapp, Telegram, and LinkedIn groups.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

The firm\u2019s focus will be on fintech, healthcare, Software as a Service (SaaS) and enterprise, women\u2019s health and developer tools.\n\nHowever, MAGIC Fund\u2019s support for these startups will go beyond money. The venture firm also aims to provide them with partners that have experience and expertise.\n\nAccording to a Medium post by the firm, it says \u201cWe provide guidance in the rigorous discovery of product-market fit, facilitate introductions, and support with expansion into new regions, strategy, marketing, fundraising, and hiring.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince MAGIC Fund\u2019s launch in 2017, it claims to have invested in 70 startups, including Nigerian API fintech, Mono; investment fintech, Bamboo; and home management company, Eden Life.\n\nPer TechCrunch, the firm\u2019s $1.5 million Fund I performed well with a 5x return over three years. Some of these founders joined MAGIC Fund as partners for this raise when their companies exited.\n\nA third of the fund was contributed by the firm\u2019s founder general partners (GPs), with the rest contributed by its limited partners (LPs).\n\nFor Fund II, new partners include Stitchroom\u2019s Thomas Chen, Medumo\u2019s Adeel Yang, Juice\u2019s Michael Lisovetsky & Troy Osinoff, who will collectively manage North American investments.\n\nIts Africa-focused investments will be overseen by Kauffman Fellow Temi Marcella Awogboro, while Helium Health\u2019s Dimeji Sofowora and Alison Cheung handle European assets. Southeast Asia investments will be led by Payfazz\u2019s Hendra Kwik and Oxy2\u2019s Elvis Zhang.\n\nAlso, MAGIC Fund has created a cohort specifically to invest in companies founded by women, led by Alison Cheung and Tito Ovia.\n\nAccording to Adegoke Olubusi, Managing Partner of the fund, \u201cThe vision for MAGIC is going back to how early-stage venture capital began, which is, founders investing in other founders and supporting them through the journey. We\u2019re going to keep scaling this up as much as we can, across different geographies and industries, and we\u2019re very happy for the headstart we already have.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the firm is accepting pitches from founders through its website. While speaking to TechCrunch, Olubusi gave two indicators as to what MAGIC Fund looks for: founders with grit to stick through tough times and willing and open to learning while using that knowledge to succeed.",

There\u2019s also a projection that it will be worth over $28.5 billion by 2022.\n\nRecently, a lot of funding has gone into eCommerce in Egypt and the MENA region. In the last six months, we have reported various funding news about Egyptian startups in the sector, including Flextock, Bosta, and others.\n\nWe are also witnessing a changing narrative in the investments that have gone into African startups over the years. The trend suggests a potentially robust future of the ecosystem in the MENA region and Africa at large.\n\nTo know more about this raise, read this article:\n\nEgyptian eCommerce startup, MaxAB, raises $40m Series A to accelerate expansion\n\nLiquid Intelligence Technologies partners with Facebook to build a fibre network in the Democratic Republic of Congo\n\nOn Monday, July 4, 2021, Pan-African digital infrastructure provider, Liquid Intelligence Technologies, announced a partnership with Facebook to build an extensive long haul and metro fibre network in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nWhy the partnership? Given the long wait for sustainable Internet infrastructure in Africa, this partnership aims to improve Internet access. Together they plan to meet the growing demand for connectivity across Central Africa by providing Internet infrastructure that cuts across the East and West African coasts and Europe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA daunting task? Nic Rudnick, Liquid Intelligence Technologies Group CEO, claims it is the most difficult fibre build ever undertaken, but their mission to speed up the rate of Internet access in Africa is a good blend with Facebook\u2019s people connectivity ethos.\n\nFirst of its kind? This is not Facebook\u2019s first partnership with an African company to boost Internet connectivity. Apart from a few other partnerships, in May 2021, they partnered with four telecom giants and Alcatel Submarine in the region to build a 37,000 km undersea Internet cable to serve 23 African countries.\n\nDespite questions about their intentions, the resultant effects of these partnerships might speed up the improvement of Internet infrastructure in Africa.\n\nThis article provides detailed information about the partnership:\n\nFacebook partners with Pan-African tech group to build metro fibre network in Democratic Republic of Congo\n\n#TwitterBan: supposed economic effects an exaggeration?\n\nExactly 32 days ago, the Nigerian government declared a ban on microblogging site, Twitter. So far, there\u2019ve been criticisms, meetings about a likely reversal, and a court restriction preventing further acts by the government. No\n\nNetblocks.org, an online tool that calculates the financial loss attached to partial or full Internet shutdown in a country, aggregates that Nigeria loses $6,014,390 (\u20a62,177,089,051) every day because of the Twitter ban.\n\nCould this be an exaggeration? A report by Statista revealed that compared to Facebook\u2019s 86.2% of the roughly 28 million social media users in Nigeria, Twitter had a user share of 61.4%, which is less than 4 million.\n\nThis might be somewhat puzzling as many reports state that Nigeria has 40 million Twitter users. In a country with roughly between 25 and 40 million smartphone users as of 2020, this case is worthy of thorough analysis.\n\nEven though research published in 2019 revealed that government-led Internet shutdowns cost the global economy $8 billion as it disrupted the flow of online-based businesses, access to information, and stifled global tourism revenue.\n\nWhether or not the economic loss from #TwitterBan is as staggering as it seems is a valid case point.\n\nBe on the lookout for Emmanuel Paul\u2019s analysis.\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nWhat else I\u2019m reading/watching\n\nPaystack becomes WooCommerce\u2019s preferred payment partner in Africa.

Wike\n\nShare Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPORT HARCOURT \u2013 The governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike says he never promised to solve all the socio-economic and infrastructural problems of the State during his tenure.\n\nHence, he said, it is preposterous for the opposition to continue to live in denial of his sterling performance as governor, just because he has not addressed all the needs of the State.\n\nGovernor Wike made this assertion during the inauguration of the ultramodern National Union of Rivers State Students, (NURSS) national secretariat built by his administration at the Rivers state University on Monday night.\n\nThe governor maintained that irrespective of the country\u2019s current economic challenges, the State government has made tremendous progress in tackling some of the infrastructural deficit it inherited.\n\nTo this end, he said it is preposterous for the opposition not to acknowledge that he never promised to fix all the problems of the State during his tenure.\n\n\u201d I never said I will finish the whole work in Rivers State. Did I say so? Even if you keep me here for 40 years, I cannot finish the work in Rivers State. What we have said is, go to any local government, you\u2019ll see our impact. I said in Omuma, we did so-so number kilometers of road. What you should bother yourself with is to go and check.\u201d\n\nHe further added: \u201cOn Saturday, we were in Opobo. The issue is, is there road to Opobo?\u201d\n\nThe governor urged the leadership of NURSS to resist being used by disgruntled politicians to cause friction between them and State government. According to him, it is unethical for them to allow politicians to instigate them against the State.\n\n\u201cSometimes, most of you leave what you\u2019re supposed to do and concern yourself with irrelevant things, and allow politicians to use you to come and block Government House.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike explained that by the time he assumed office in 2015, there was virtually no State government presence in the University. According to him, the previous administration which wasted the State\u2019s resources, completely neglected the institution.\n\nHe attributed the current ranking of the State University as one of the best in the country, to the huge investment his administration has made in the past six years to improve infrastructure, capacity building and welfare of the workers.\n\nPerforming the inauguration, Senator Bennett Birabi said since 1999, no governor of the State has worked conscientiously to improve infrastructure and enhance the wellbeing of the people, particularly during their second term, like Governor Wike.\n\nHe urged students to make judicious use for the edifice and shun social vices like cultism.\n\nEarlier, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Special Projects, George-Kelly D.Alabo, said the NURSS secretariat has offices, conference hall ,cafeteria , ICT centre and a 400 capacity auditorium.\n\nAlabo, who described the secretariat as the biggest in West Africa, said NURSS is expected to generate at least N50 million as revenue from the complex annually.\n\nThe Commissioner of Education, Professor Kaniye Ebeku, thanked the governor for erecting a befitting edifice for NURSS.\n\nVice Chancellor of the Rivers State University, Professor Nlerum Okogbule commended the governor for his unwavering commitment to improve academic environment in the University and enhance academic excellence.\n\nPro-Chancellor of the University, Justice Iche Ndu (rtd) said when the history of the State will be written, Governor Wike\u2019s name will be written in gold for his commitment to good governance.\n\nNURSS national president, Levi Z.George, said the inauguration of the secretariat marks a major milestone in the history of the union.\n\nHe explained that the gesture to build the secretariat is a further demonstration of the importance Governor Wike attaches to education.\n\n...",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPORT-HARCOURT \u2013 The governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike says only compromised academics who are willing to submit names of politically exposed lecturers as returning officers to rig elections for the ruling party, are being appointed as Vice Chancellors of federal universities.\n\nGovernor Wike, who warned Vice Chancellors and lecturers to be wary of attempts by some unscrupulous politicians to use them to manipulate elections, declared that those contemplating to rig elections in Rivers State will be treated as a coup plotters.\n\nHe stated this during the foundation laying ceremony for the construction of 9200 capacity ultramodern convocation arena of the University of Port Harcourt by the Rivers State government on Tuesday.\n\nGovernor Wike said it is worrisome that Nigeria has degenerated to the point where politicians now influence who becomes a Vice Chancellor of a federal government for the purposes of rigging elections.\n\n\u201cLet me warn, not one person will dare to rig election in Rivers State. Not one person will dare it. I have told people, allow university community to produce those who will be leaders of this country. Don\u2019t turn university community to be where you will have politicians who manipulate and change the mandate of the people. Anybody who does that, you know it is a coup and you know the punishment for coup plotters.\u201d\n\nThe governor stressed that the reason why there is so much tussle these days on who becomes Vice Chancellor of federal universities, is because of political interference by extraneous forces.\n\nHe described as heartrending a situation whereby lecturers who are supposed to revered in society, wilfully compromise their integrity, just to become Vice Chancellor, who will afterwards be used to manipulate elections.\n\n\u201cThese days , you see a lecturer, a PhD holder, a professor ready to soil his name, to allow himself to be kidnapped and taken somewhere to sign result and to declare somebody who did not win election winner.\u201d\n\nThe governor enjoined desperate politicians in the ruling party not to dent the integrity of the university system because of their inordinate ambition.\n\nGovernor Wike warned that any Vice Chancellor that allows himself to be used to rig election in Rivers State, should be prepared for the consequences of such hideous act.\n\n\u201cIf you want to play politics with us, I will rub you mud. If you want to join us (politicians), openly come and join us. But if you want to hide under the university.\u201d\n\nThe governor declared that 2023 general election will be completely different from the 2019 election which was manipulated by the ruling party. He insisted that attempts to prevent transmission to election results electronically will be resisted.\n\n\u201cINEC knows that they have to be prepared in 2023. And that is why we will resist any attempt for anybody to manipulate the amendment of the Electoral Act, to say that election results will not be transmitted electronically. That will not happen. If you want the vote of the people to count, the result must be transmitted electronically.\u201d\n\nGovernor Wike stated that as an alumni of the University of Port Harcourt, his business is not to play politics in the University, but to see how he can contribute to the development of the institution.\n\nHe promised to complete a primary school building in the university that was abandoned by the previous administration for inexplicable reason.\n\nThe Acting Vice Chancellor of University of Port Harcourt, Professor Stephen Okodudu commended Governor Wike for consistently identifying with the ideals and aspiration of the university.\n\n\u201cYou have continued to support the successive administrations of the University through donation of funds and provision of social infrastructure to give meaning to the lives of staff and students. I recall with nostalgia, that Your Excellency attracted then construction of the Faculties of Law and Social Sciences buildings while serving as the Hon. Minister of State for Education.\u201d\n\nChairman of the Governing Council of the University, Senator Andrew Uchendu applauded Governor Wike for laying the foundation for what will be the best, iconic convocation arena in West Africa.\n\nPerforming the inauguration of the new convocation arena, immediate past Vice Chancellor of the University, Professor Ndowa E. Lale said Governor Wike decision to construct the new convocation arena is a further demonstration that he has a heart to add value to the institution.\n\nHe declared that history will be kind to Governor Wike because he has deliberately worked conscientiously for public good.\n\nEarlier, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Special Projects, George Kelly D. Alabo said 9200 capacity convocation arena is going to have convertible compartments, offices, assembly hall, 750kva transformer and will be completed in 14 months.\n\nHe further added: \u201cThis structure will not only be aesthetically pleasing, it will also be structurally sound.\n\n...",

          "text": "By Taiwo Okanlawon\n\nThe only three daughters of Prophet TB Joshua, the founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations, have paid tributes to their late father, describing him as loving and caring father.\n\nSerah, Promise and Heart poured out their hearts at the All-Day Tribute Service held at the church premises on Tuesday, in his honour.\n\nTheir mother, Evelyn had earlier promised to carry on with the legacy of her husband and \u201ckeep his hopes alive\u201d.\n\nEvelyn said though his husband is not dead, it\u2019s very sad she will not see him again.\n\nThe widow in her heart-warming message also described the late man of God as a loving husband and father and one who created time for his family despite his busy spiritual schedule.\n\nShe, however, thanked God for making her the wife of such a great husband and spiritual father, and said, \u201cthank you for choosing me\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, she described her late husband as one who did not understand the word impossible.\n\n\u201cWe will keep the fire burning. We will keep your hopes alive. I shall forever be proud to be your wife,\u201d she added.\n\nDad lived a fulfilling and enigmatic life \u2013 Serah\n\nIn her own tribute, Serah, the first daughter of the late prophet said he lived a fulfilled life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to put in words how remarkable and impressive you are. I had a good portion of having you as a father who was hard-working, generous, and a host of other versions too numerous to count.\n\n\u201cI remembered the countless time you called me when I was in boarding school, asking about my favourite subject, how my exam went and for some reasons, asking me to predict what I think I got in every test.\n\n\u201cI truly appreciated that you took your time out of your busy schedule to call me.\n\n\u201cI am so proud of my father. Dad told me that the work of God is so beautiful to do.\n\n\u201c\u2019Indeed he lived a prayerful life, I recall how one day we prayed for 45 minutes and after that my knees were aching. After that he told me that the spirit is willing, but the body is weak.\n\n\u201cI will truly miss our conversation. If anyone lived a fulfilling and yet enigmatic life, it was you. I have no reservation that my dad had the biggest heart that I know of. He was a true humanitarian for his generation. What a feat you have left for all of us to live up to.\n\n\u201cI am so surprised to hear about all the condolences from people around the world about your passion, even people I have never met, they all testified about your passion for What a life you lived- such a legend and exemplary light.\u201d\n\nHis death didn\u2019t come to me as a surprise \u2013 Promise\n\nOn her part, Promise the late Joshua\u2019s second daughter described her late dad as one who lived each day as if it was his last.\n\n\u201cAs devastated as I was upon hearing about the news of my dad\u2019s passage, I cannot say I was completely unprepared for that day. Growing up as a biological daughter to a man like Prophet TB Joshua, he made me understand that he was on a mission in this world.\n\nShe added that she was also certain her father will be called back after executing the assignment he came to the world for.\n\n\u201cI will say that my Dad did an excellent job in preparing me mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and even physically.\n\n\u201cI remembered our trip to Arigidi in Akoko, Ondo State, he made sure I was present when in town to visit the ederly people. He will ask me to kneel down as we ask the elders to accept out gifts and they will pray for us, he will look at me and say \u2018this is the good life.\u2019\n\nHe lived each day like it was his last. It didn\u2019t come to me like a surprise. Thank you for living such an exemplary life,\u201d she added.\n\nIt has not been the same for me since his death- Heart\n\nAlso paying tribute to her dad, Heart Joshua said; \u201cThank you for coming out to celebrate my father\u2019s beautiful life. When that day came, June 5, my father Prophet TB Joshua departed this world to go and join his father in heaven and it has not been the same for me then.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have many words to express how much I love him, me Daddy\u2019s girl. At a tender age, he showed me that he loved me, and I will forever love him.\n\n\u201cHe was clear in heart, body, and mind, and I shall never forget that. My father was an extraordinary man.\n\n\u201cMy father always had a smile on his face regardless of any situation and will never let anything trouble him.\n\n\u201cHe was a jovial man, full of fun and laughter, he cracked uncountable jokes with me and my sister.\n\n\u201cHis death has left a scar in our hearts, but his legacy will stand in our lives. I am so grateful to have had as much time I had with him, and I will always remember that he was the most ambitious and remarkable father.\n\n\u201cMy father was the most important person in my life and I feel heartbroken that I no longer have my father, a spiritual figure.\n\n\u201cHis memory will not only carry on in my heart but in the heart of everyone lucky enough to have known Prophet TB Joshua,\u201d she added.\n\nI doubted many times if he was human \u2013 Brain Moshil\n\nHis son-in-law, Mr Brian Moshil, said that he lived an exemplary life of service to God and humanity.\n\nMoshi said that his father-in-law could do many things at the same time.\n\n\u201cYou were a great teacher, yet a good student, a lion, yet a lamb.\n\n\u201cI have doubted so many times if you were human; you never waited for tomorrow to accomplish what could be done today,\u201d Moshi said.",

          "text": "Nyesom Wike, the governor of Rivers State, has lifted the two-month curfew that had been imposed on the whole state following attacks on security officers and formations in the state by unknown gunmen.\n\nThe governor announced that the curfew will be lifted on Wednesday, July 7, 2021.\n\nWike, who made the announcement during a state broadcast on Tuesday, stressed that the state government recognizes the curfew\u2019s harmful impact on business and the state\u2019s and inhabitants\u2019 social-economic well-being.\n\nWike\u2019s Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, transmitted the broadcast to newsmen in Port Harcourt in a statement captioned, \u201cGovernor Wike removes night curfew on Rivers State.\u201d\n\nThe governor stated that the curfew has been relaxed as a result of measurable improvements in the state\u2019s and neighboring states\u2019 security situations.\n\nHe added that the government\u2019s major concern and interest in imposing the curfew was and continues to be the state\u2019s security, and that no sacrifice or price is too great for the preservation of lives and property.\n\n\u201cWe have decided to lift the existing curfew on the entire state from tomorrow 7th July 2021,\u201d the statement said.\n\nWhile praising people for their patience and cooperation throughout the curfew, Wike asked them to be vigilant and report any suspicious situations to the appropriate security services.\n\n\u201cOn our part, we will not fail to deploy every resource at our disposal to ensure the safety of lives and property while advancing the well-being of all residents.\n\n\u201cThis is the very reason we are clearing the state of shanties that have become veritable sanctuaries for criminals and criminal activities across the state. Clearly, our actions in this direction are not directed or targeted at any particular person, identity or group,\u201d he added.\n\nHe explained that the state government had in response to the security breaches and premeditated attacks and killing of security officers in some of the neighbouring states by gunmen, imposed a night-time curfew on the state\u2019s land borders with other states on April 28, 2021.\n\n\u201cFollowing the premeditated attack and killing of some security personnel in Abua and Ikwerre Local Government Areas by gunmen, we were forced to impose a statewide curfew from 10.00pm to 6.00am.\n\n\u201cOn the 11th of May 2021, the gunmen defied the existing curfew and carried out yet another murderous attack and killing of some security personnel in the state. This prompted the review of the statewide curfew from 7.00pm to 6.00am,\u201d the statement explained.\n\nThe governor commended residents of the state for their support, prayer and solidarity even as the government continues to work tirelessly to keep Rivers State safe and secure for all.\n\nOur correspondent recalled that on May 16, 2021, the curfew timeframe was readjusted to 8.30pm to 6.00am for Port Harcourt and Obio/Akpor Local Government Areas only, all of which has now been lifted across the 23 LGAs of the state.",

Our people need help, government must be swift in taking action to assist these poor communities to avert impending famine\u201d, he decried.\n\nTimothy Dantong, who represents the Riyom Constituency in the State House of Assembly, reacted to the tragic incident by urging the government to apprehend those responsible.\n\nDantong bemoaned the fact that Governor Simon Lalong\u2019s anti-land grabbing ordinance has yet to take full effect, and that enforcement of the law has remained a fantasy.\n\nHe said \u201cTwo days back, Fulani militia invaded my constituency and destroyed farmlands with crops, this has been the reason why we have had crises in the past.\n\n\u201cThe agenda of the militia is to take over lands that belong to the natives and that is our major concern and we appreciate the State Government for coming up with a bill that seeks to prevent land grabbing in the state and unless we have an enforcement agency that will enforce these laws, our efforts as Government is useless\u201d, he explained.\n\n\u201cRight now the people in the grassroots have not felt the impact of that law. We have over 60 villages that have been taken over forcefully and the perpetrators are having a filled day, something urgent needs to be done\u201d, he lamented.\n\nThe Lawmaker appealed to the State Government to come to the aid of the communities as the act is capable of throwing the villagers into severe famine.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, the cost of the destruction cannot be ascertained because the data is being collated; but I can tell you it\u2019s worth a billion\u201d, he maintained.",

He has wasted numerous chances during the tournament \u2013 with his family having to endure threats from fans \u2013 and his equaliser looked set to change the narrative before he failed from the spot.\n\nItaly\u2019s style of play has changed as the tournament has gone on, with the Azzurri reverting to their old defensive ways, and it has taken them through to the final.\n\nThey were free-scoring and impressive in the group stages \u2013 while also solid at the back \u2013 taking their run to 11 wins in a row without conceding.\n\nBut they needed extra time to beat Austria in the last 16 and then dug in to beat Belgium 2-1 last time out.\n\nMancini took over a team that failed to even qualify for the 2018 World Cup and has now led them to the next major final.\n\nSurprisingly, the four-time world champions have only ever won one European Championship \u2013 all the way back in 1968.\n\nThey lost the 2000 and 2012 finals \u2013 but will hope to go one better this time at Wembley.\n\nEmerson was a competent but unspectacular replacement for the injured Leonardo Spinazzola at left-back and hit the bar from a tight angle with their only effort of the first half.\n\nTheir breakthrough came from a counter-attack that began with goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma and ended with Chiesa\u2019s perfect finish from near the edge of the box leaving Unai Simon rooted to the spot.\n\nThey had a couple of chances to wrap the game up, but Domenico Berardi shot straight at Simon both times before Morata equalised.\n\nFrom that stage on it looked as if they were playing for penalties \u2013 and that was the way it turned out.\n\nThe Azzurri got off to the worst possible start when Manuel Locatelli\u2019s penalty was saved, but they converted the rest of their spot-kicks with Jorginho nonchalantly waiting for Spain keeper Simon to move before slotting the other",

This international operation was executed in a closely coordinated fashion following which he was handed over to our National Intelligence Agency, and then returned to Nigeria to face the Law.\n\nThe violence inspired by IPOB has led to hundreds of fatalities, particularly targeted at Government assets and Law Enforcement Agents. Additionally, there have been at last count, fifty (55) separate violent attacks, heavily concentrated in the South-East, which heaped further hardship on our honest and hardworking citizens, preventing them from earning their livelihood and going about their normal lives.\n\nThe Government had long been monitoring the activities of IPOB and had strong cause to believe that their funding sources include proceeds of suspected illicit criminal activities. By this singular action of our Security Forces, sanity, calm and peace has been returned to our communities who previously lived in constant fear of these misguided elements.\n\nIn furtherance of continued diligent work, the State Security Service on Thursday, 1st July raided the residence of a militant ethnic Secessionist, who has also been conducting acts of terror and disturbing the peace under the guise of protecting fellow \u201ckinsmen\u201d.\n\nHis seditious utterances and antics, which he is known to have publicly expressed, have overtime morphed into very hateful and vile laden speeches. It must be highlighted that the government respects fundamental rights of citizens to express their views and recognizes this as a democratic tenet. However, any attempt to build an Armoury coupled with plans either subtle or expressed to undermine our unity as a nation will not be condoned.\n\nMr. President\u2019s directives to Security Services regarding anyone seen to be carrying arms, particularly AK-47 are clear and require no further illumination. Assault weapons are not tools of peace loving people and as such, regardless of who they are and where they are from, the Security Agencies should treat them all the same.\n\nThe successes of our Security Agencies must be commended as they have demonstrated significant deftness, guile and secrecy in carrying out these missions. This level of professionalism must be sustained and brought to bear as we focus on extracting from our society those who have found a new trade in targeting students, rural dwellers and our citizens in the North-West. The nation recognizes their efforts and sacrifice.\n\nGarba Shehu\n\nSenior Special Assistant to the President\n\n(Media & Publicity)\n\nJuly 6, 2021",

          "text": "The Governor of the Central bank of Nigeria, Mr Godwin Emefiele, has asked managers of higher institutions of learning in the country to draw knowledge from curricula that cater to the modern realities of the country.\n\nMr Emefiele made the call during the 51st convocation lecture of the University of Lagos on Tuesday where he was invited as guest speaker on the topic: National Development And Knowledge Economy In The Digital Age: Leapfrogging SMEs Into the 21st Century.\n\nThe CBN boss harped on the need for an enhanced learning experience for students as well as fostered innovation amongst faculty and staff in schools across the country.\n\nIn his presentation Mr Emefiele said: \u201cenhanced collaboration between universities and players in key sectors of our economy such as agriculture, manufacturing and ICT are necessary to enable implementation of sound ideas generated from our universities. For instance, universities in most developing countries have little or no formal linkages to industry. This often arises from the implementation of training curricula that is irrelevant to the industry, thereby, resulting in the production of ill-equipped graduates.\u201d\n\nAs one of the steps to addressing that challenge, Emefiele advocated collaboration between institutions of higher learning and industry key players in key sectors of the economy.\n\nMr Emefiele maintained that \u201cthe current economic situation in Nigeria requires an accelerated adoption of knowledge to drive our developmental goals. The fast pace of growth and innovation in the digital space along with the large and growing population of vibrant youths places Nigeria on a vantage position to harness these potentials for accelerated development.\u201d\n\nHe beamed his light on advanced economies whom he affirmed had adopted technology-driven development models rather than the previously adopted traditional factors of production including labour and capital.\n\nThe CBN governor identified SMEs as the backbone of national and economic development which he said is due to their contributions to GDP through employment generation and poverty eradication.\n\nHe gave identified SMEs as accounting for close to 90 per cent of total enterprises in most countries. In a report which he said is from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, 98 per cent of Chinese firms are SMEs, contributing around 68 per cent to exports and a whopping 60 per cent to Chinese\u2019s GDP while employing 75per cent of the Chinese workforce. The experiences of Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Hong Kong are like China with about 90 per cent of their industries classified as SMEs.\n\nIn spite of the numerous benefits of the SMEs to economic development and job creation, limited access to finance, inadequate infrastructure and poor digital penetration were some of the challenges Mr Emefiele identified to be confronting it.\n\nTo tackle those challenges, the CBN boss revealed some of the interventions of the apex bank to include the provision of support to selected higher institutions in the country to enhance training and quality as well as development of finance interventions to support SMEs.\n\nOther programmes of the bank include the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme (SMECGS), Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Programme (YEDP); Agribusiness/Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS). Others are the Entrepreneurship Development Centres (EDCs), National Collateral Registry(NCR), Creative Industry Financing Initiative (CIFI), Targeted Credit Facility (TCF) and the Nigeria Youth Investment Fund (NYIF).\n\nSmall and Medium Enterprises Development Fund is another scheme through which Mr Emefiele said the CBN is channelling low-interest wholesale funds to the MSME segment.\n\nSo far, over N83.9 billion are reported to have been disbursed to 216,704 beneficiaries with a nine 9 per cent interest charge.\n\nFormer Vice presidential candidate, Pastor Tunde Bakare was the Chairman of the convocation lecture.\n\nHe advised graduating students to take up the attributes of respect for value, discipline, dedication, calculated risk, integrity and intelligence; attributes he said he learnt from his mother and have helped him through life.",

What that means is that our standard here has to be higher than the national standard.\n\n\u201cWith post-COVID-19, you can\u2019t travel, you have to sit and source for cure here. So the standard you must adopt locally has to be the same standard that you are going to get abroad. Nobody can do it for us; we have to do it ourselves.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe continued: \u201cFor us, we must aspire to get global standards. So, I agree with you; if we decide to run a college system, we must withdraw the bill in the House of Assembly.\n\n\u201cWe are going to get that amendment in now; it gives us the flexibility to do more with the institution.\n\n\u201cIn the new nursing school, I am not going to accept any staff who joined to ruin the old system. Those who were in the system and saw it decay will not come into the new system.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will get new staff to run the new system. We will, as much as possible, put adequate facilities in place. We are going to train graduates who will gain global recognition,\u201d he reassured.\n\nEarlier, Dr. Faruk Abubakar commended Obaseki for his giant strides in the health sector, which has positively impacted the lives of citizens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbubakar, however, suggested that the governor upgrade the state\u2019s School of Nursing and Midwifery to Edo State College of Nursing Sciences, as part of the federal government\u2019s educational reforms.",

The losing bidder, Amazon Web Services, went to court arguing that the Pentagon\u2019s process was flawed and unfair, including that it was improperly influenced by then-President Donald Trump\u2019s dislike of Amazon and its chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos. Bezos owns The Washington Post, a news outlet often criticized by Trump.\n\nThis year the Pentagon had been hinting that it might scrap the contract, saying in May that it felt compelled to reconsider its options after a federal judge in April rejected a Pentagon move to have key parts of Amazon\u2019s lawsuit dismissed.",

And for these sea offenses, we will be uncompromising,\u201d prosecutor Kodjo Gnambi Garba told reporters.\n\nPirate attacks in the Gulf are mainly carried out by gangs from southeastern Nigeria who speed out in boats to raid commercial vessels offshore to kidnap their crew for ransom.\n\nThe Gulf of Guinea, which stretches along 5,700 kilometres of coastline, accounted for 130 of the 135 kidnappings of seafarers recorded worldwide last year, according to a recent report by the International Maritime Bureau.\n\nA group of shippers and trade companies in the international maritime sector in May signed a declaration calling for the creation of a coalition to put an end to piracy in the Gulf of Guinea.",
