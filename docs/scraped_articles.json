          "text": ".\n\nAs Nigeria joins the rest of the world to mark World Health Day, issues bothering the health state of the nation and its infrastructures come to the front burner.\n\nFounder and Chief Executive Officer of Mobaby Care, Maryam Adebola-Salami through her brand created with all naturally-sourced ingredients is helping many babies lead healthy lives.\n\nA multi-potentialite with 15 years of experience building and running successful businesses across sectors, Adebola-Salami is also constantly enabling other women to achieve financial independence, which she considers key to women empowerment and eradication of domestic violence. In this interview, she shares her passion for the Mobaby Care brand and how it is addressing healthy living in our economy.\n\nIt\u2019s World Health Day. Do you think Nigeria has been able to address healthy living and health infrastructure upgrades generally compared to other developed countries?\n\nI have never left the foreshore of Nigeria for medical or health reasons but I know what Good health care means and what it costs to acquire it within the country. Not many Nigerians can afford basic health care, Health insurance is not accessible to all and when available, rarely addresses concerns that are most life-threatening.\n\nEspecially delivery and labour. You find that more than 40 per cent of deliveries are still done at home and in unauthorised birthing centres because many moms like myself cannot afford health care or do not trust the competencies of the primary health centres. In comparison to other developed and even developing countries, Nigeria has alot to do.\n\nThe health care system and that\u2019s why my Brand At Mobaby Care is doing its best possible to collaborate with ministries and parastatals to bring good health to urban and localised women in support of the Sustainable Development Goals, good health and wellbeing for all.\n\nWith World Health Day themed \u2018Our Planet, Our Health,\u2019 how does the planet boost healthy living in Nigeria and globally?\n\nHuman life is well-adapted to our planet. A healthy environment is essential to optimal health and well-being. Conversely, disease and early death are often due to environmental agents called pathogens, both biological and physicochemical. Climate change, heatwaves, floods, land degradation, and the loss of biodiversity also threaten human health in a variety of ways, both direct and indirect.\n\nIn the face of the current pandemic, how do we tackle pollution of the planet and the increasing incidence of diseases?\n\nFirst, we need to teach basic hygiene, reposition urbanisation without neglecting the rural area, educate builders to provide drainage, demand good roads and Electricity that help the Small, medium and large scale recyclers and upcyclers to transform and transport waste for better use. This will in turn reduce diseases, and their spread and reduce the influx of children and adults in the hospital that is not equipped to cater for the deficit of our hygiene. Changes in agricultural practices and clearing land for farming are often associated with outbreaks of debilitating disease.\n\nGlobally, an estimated one million premature deaths per year are attributed to known avoidable environmental risks. What is your advice to reduce this alarming rate?\n\nFour million children and babies die of diarrhoea diseases from contamination of their food or water. Hundreds of times this number have intestinal parasites and debilitating diarrhoea. It is estimated that over a million die of malaria every year, worldwide, among over 260 million cases. Most of these are children less than five years old. 100,000 African children die from cancer due to exposure to toxins from their food, drink, cosmetics and open-air emissions.\n\nThe lack of open spaces for recreation and exposure to natural elements, such as large parks with trees, bushes, and walking paths, as well as playgrounds and bike trails, is an important element in promoting ill-health and reducing the quality of life. It is possible to take steps that bring down infant and child mortality while also improving healthcare for mothers, and making more education and employment opportunities available to them.\n\nAll measures that raise the standard of living and reduce the mortality rates, among women and children also encourage global human and environmental health. Introduction of healthy meals to children. Incorporating all the classes of food. Their right proportion. Education on child nutrition and embracing the African skin and hair without altering it with toxic chemicals will make a great impact.\n\nHow can government practices help reduce air pollution, contaminated water and inadequate sanitation?\n\nEnvironmental pollution has many facets, and the resultant health risks include diseases in almost all organ systems. Reducing air pollution exposure is largely a technical issue. Technologies to reduce pollution at its source are plentiful, as are technologies that reduce pollution by filtering it away from the emission source (end-of-pipe solutions; Examples of technologies to reduce air pollution include the use of lead-free gasoline, which allows the use of catalytic converters on vehicles\u2019 exhaust systems. Ridding our roads of vehicles with bad exhaust pipes and Co. Sanctioning manufacturers to embrace sustainable production and consumption.\n\nEncourage and provide free and prompt Waste Pickups to enable an easy flowing drainage system. Mandate builders to create and ensure free flow of drainage from blocks to canals. Road construction shouldn\u2019t be commissioned unless proper drainage systems have been put in place.\n\nWhat is your company doing to help encourage healthy living in Nigeria?\n\nAt Mobaby Care our driving force is the embodiment of Absolute Nurture and care for babies, children, people and the environment at large. We are an all-natural solutions company that uses plants, plant extract and other botanical oils to manufacture safe and effective body and hair care solutions for babies and children under 10 years. Our products undergo sustainable production, we encourage recycling and upcycling. We use only Naturally grown and organically bedded products to formulate our solution. We are child loving and earth-conscious\n\nHow is your company commemorating World Health Day?\n\nWe are visiting local healthcare centres in our community to educate and interact with new and existing mothers on the importance of choosing Natural solutions for the children to further reduce the risk of cancer and other environmental borne diseases. Keep their environment clean to rid of mosquitoes thereby reducing the rate of Malaria and mortality rate brought about by it. We would also be using our social media platforms to advocate the importance of this year\u2019s theme, \u2018our planet, our health\u2019.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "In a move aimed at ensuring a quick response, the Bauchi State House of Assembly on Wednesday at plenary resolved to remove the state Fire Service Department from the Ministry of Works and Transport and transfer it to the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), which is under the office of the state governor.\n\nThe resolution followed a motion to that effect brought under matters of urgent public importance by the member representing Azare/Madangala State Constituency, Tijjani Muhammad Aliyu, on the incessant fire incidents across the state, leading to deaths and destruction of properties as a result of dearth of firefighting equipment.\n\nLeading debate on the motion, Aliyu, who is the Assembly\u2019s Majority Leader, informed that many fire incidents occurred across the state in recent times.\n\nHe said one of the cardinal responsibilities of government is to protect the lives and property of the citizens, submitting, however, that management of fire service in the state is becoming very unfortunate.\n\nAliyu said because of the availability of fire fighting machines at The Federal Polytechnic and Abubakar Tatari Ali Polytechnic (ATAP), both in Bauchi, fire services were better in the state capital than in other parts.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cFire safety is in a sorrowful situation in Bauchi State. The honourable House has deliberated many times about this matter but nothing is done to assuage that situation.\n\n\u201cI get a lot of criticisms from my constituents because there is no single functional fire service machine in the constituency and there are many fire incidents happening in the town.\n\n\u201cRecently, there was a fire incident in Matsango Azare and they are sharing the same wall with the fire service office but they have nothing to do because they don\u2019t have the machines to fight the fire. They have only one tanker but they don\u2019t have the machine to quench the fire.\n\n\u201cEven last week, there was a fire outbreak at the central motor park in Azare and nothing is done. Same story in Bauchi metropolis, many fire incidents.\n\n\u201cWe have made efforts to get the government to do something about the situation but nothing is done.\u201d\n\nThe majority leader then urged the House to ask the government to do something urgently about the situation since it is their responsibility to do so.\n\nWhile saying that many development projects are ongoing in the state, Aliyu submitted that nothing was being done as far as fire fighting was concerned.\n\nHe declared that the fire fighting equipment needed to fight fire outbreaks would be up to 10 percent of the funds being expended on the projects being executed by the state government.\n\nHe then advised that more fire fighting machines and vehicles be provided in the state capital and each of the three senatorial zones in the state should be provided with fire fighting trucks and machines.\n\nResponding to the motion, the Speaker, Abubakar Suleiman, commended the motion, which he said was very important because fire incidents were becoming rampant in the state.\n\n\u201cAs I was coming to the office today, I saw a vehicle burnt to ashes around Ramadan Press. I believe if we have a functional fire service system, the damage would not reach that level,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, the Deputy Speaker, Danlami Ahmed Kawule who is representing Zungur/Galambi Constituency in the House agreed that the matter needed urgent attention.\n\nHe added that if the motion passed by the Assembly to make fire service part of the State Management Agency (SEMA) instead of the Ministry of Works and Transport, fire incidents would be reduced.\n\nFollowing contributions by members, the House unanimously approved the motion.\n\nWith the approval, the Speaker said that given the urgency and importance of the motion, he would personally sign the House resolution and take same to the state governor for prompt necessary action.",

          "text": "FOR a pupil of Community Primary School II, Egan, Alimosho, Olufemi Adeniyi, last week would remain indelible in his mind as the state government inaugurated the school\u2019s poultry pen under the Lagos State Agriculture Education Programme (LASAEP). Four other poultry pens were also inaugurated under the programme in four other public primary schools.\n\nLittle Adeniyi is fond of buying hatchlings towards Christmas after breaking his piggy bank. During the Christmas, his mother always assists him to sell the full-grown chickens, making a little profit for the boy in the process. Now, with the inauguration of the school\u2019s poultry pen, the boy said he would have the opportunity to learn more about his hobby in a school setting.\n\nThe inauguration, apart from the Community Primary School II Egan, also took place simultaneously at four primary schools \u2014 Obele Primary School, Itire; Roman Catholic Primary School, Ipakodo; and Methodist Primary School, Gberigbe.\n\nThe poultry pens are aimed at inculcating farming into young ones.\n\nLASAEP is a programme approved by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to complement the efforts of UBEC in revamping agricultural education. Six schools benefitted from the construction of the Pens with the supply of birds as encapsulated under the mantra \u201ccatch them young\u201d. The sixth poultry pen at Christ Central Primary School, Mushin LGEA is still under construction.\n\nIn his remarks at Obele Primary School, Itire, Surulere, the Executive Chairman LASUBEB, Wahab Alawiye-King, explained that the UBEC Agricultural Education Training Programme (AETP) initiative to 51 schools has been vibrant and attractive to learners in 11 Local Government Education Authorities, with different enterprises such as crop farming, fishery, animal husbandry and poultry.\n\nHe asserted that the involvement of pupils in farming would not only contribute to economic development, but resuscitate agriculture in the learning environment and also promote agricprenuership in the state.\n\n\u201cI encourage the learners to take full advantage of this programme and build lifelong skills, that will be useful to them in the nearest future. I also urge the school manager and teachers to see to it that the pen is well utilised and supervised,\u201d Alawiye-King said.\n\nAlso, the poultry pen consultant, Mr. Abidemi Iwajomo, testified that the positive interest showed by the pupils has projected a greener pasture in farming. He urged the pupils not to rest on their oars in acquiring farming skills, stressing that it is a profession that is contributing majorly to the development of the nation.",

          "title": "Outcry in Southeast schools over \u2018sit-at-home\u2019",
          "text": "Lecturers, teachers and other stakeholders have decried the negative effects of Mondays\u2019 sit-at-home order by Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) enforcers. They are seeking a way forward. Nwanosike Onu, Awka, Damian Duruiheoma, Enugu, Ogochukwu Anioke, Abakaliki, Chris Njoku, Owerri, Emma Elekwa, Onitsha and Sunny Nwankwo, Aba, report.\n\nThe Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) first introduced the sit-at-home order in the Southeast to add pressure to their quest for the actualisation of an independent nation of Biafra and to show that most people in the Southeast support their quest for freedom. It soon transformed into a tool for achieving other goals, including raising of awareness for other Biafran-related issues and, of recent, it has become a tool to draw attention to the plight of the leader of IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\nThe order has become so frequent that it has triggered a backlash and a diminishing return. Resistance to the order has led to fierce enforcement with the use of arms.\n\nThe IPOB also, during the week, warned Anambra State Governor Chukwuma Soludo, the Obi of Onitsha, Alfred Achebe, and leaders not to dare it over the order.\n\nThe group declared that it was waiting for the planned Truth and Reconciliation Commission to be set up this week, to know its next line of action.\n\nThe pro-Biafra group further warned that it was not part of the proposed prayer session scheduled for Monday in the state, adding that anybody who planned to be at the venue was on his or her own.\n\nThis was contained in a \u2018message\u2019 from some members of the group, which was circulated in Awka.\n\nOn Saturday, the Southeast Traditional Ruler\u2019s Council, led by the Obi of Onitsha, in conjunction with Anambra State Government, held a stakeholders meeting in Awka to deliberate on how to put an end to the Monday sit-at-home in Anambra and the region.\n\nIt was held at the Prof. Dora Akunyili Women\u2019s Development Centre, where Soludo, Obi Achebe and other high-profile ndi Anambra were present, including security chiefs in the state.\n\nIn their communique, which was signed by the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Solo Chukwulobelu, stakeholders said they had declared Monday, April 4, as a Day of Prayer for Peace for ala Igbo.\n\nBut, the IPOB, in a reaction, said \u201cwe, the Biafrans are not against your prayers, but if you want to do it, stay in your house. Anybody we see outside should know he or she is calling for another thing.\n\n\u201cWe are serious in what we are doing and we are not joking. This is the last warning we are going to issue on this. Don\u2019t incur our wrath.\u201dBut, this latest development has ignited controversy over those behind the warning.\n\nStakeholders in higher institutions, just like operators in other sectors of the Southeast\u2019s economy, have raised the alarm on the devastating negative effect of the sit-at-home on tertiary institutions in the zone, while offering remedies.\n\nSome of the stakeholders said though public universities were on strike called by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) and the Non-Academic Staff Union (NASU), the order was distorting the lives of students in various institutions in the region.\n\nSoludo said not only had the exercise crippled activities in the region, it had devoured the zone\u2019s economy.\n\nThe Nnamdi Azikiwe University (UniZik), Awka, Anambra State, is seriously affected, but it keeps marching on.\n\nIts Acting Public Relations Officer, Mrs. Chika Ene, told The Nation that students and lecturers were willing, but it was difficult to access the institution because drivers to take them to the campus were not available as a result of the sit-at-home.\n\nBesides, the Vice Chancellor, Prof. Charles Esimone, she said, did not want to risk the lives of students or lecturers\u2019.\n\nBoth Igbariam and Uli campuses of the Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University, Anambra State, always witnessed skeletal academic activities on Mondays.\n\nA senior lecturer, who preferred anonymity, said major activities were deliberately not fixed for Mondays due to the near-absence of members of staff and students.\n\n\u201cInitially, we tried to force students to attend lectures and other activities on Mondays. But when we discovered that students scarcely came to school, we had to leave out Mondays,\u201d the lecturer said.\n\nFor Prof. Obasi Igwe, apart from the negative impact on the economy of the region, education sector is on the line, as the exercise now leaves institutions empty.\n\nIgwe said: \u201cWhen this sit-at-home started last year, I warned that it would be used against the Igbo. Today, that is exactly what is happening. It is leaving tertiary institutions empty. It has no positive effect at all because it is distorting the lives of youths in schools.\n\n\u201cThis exercise has increased the propensity for crime among children in the Southeast while parents are facing hard times in terms of their businesses. Recall that some of the students are getting arrested as members of ESN when they know nothing about that.\n\n\u201cThe sit-at-home is also helping the migration of students from here to other regions of the country. I\u2019m glad that it is gradually stopping. I believe it will stop soon. The first sit-at-home was the main one used to register solidarity for Kanu. But the subsequent ones should not have been declared. That is what is causing the problems now.\u201d\n\nA lecturer in one of the tertiary institutions in Enugu State, Dr. Ifediora Uzoma, lamented that the sit-at-home had denied institutions in the Southeast opportunities.\n\n\u201cSit-at-home has negatively impacted academics in tertiary institutions in the Southeast in many ways. Except private universities in the Southeast, which have their academic activities unhindered, others which are government-owned have succumbed to the threats of sit-at-home on Mondays and other days IPOB announces as sit-at-home.\n\n\u201cApart from the University of Nigeria, which has some of its staff and students living inside the institution, all other tertiary institutions in the Southeast have their staff and students living off campus. This is why you can\u2019t find anyone in any school on Mondays or any day IPOB may determine as sit-at-home day. This means that no teaching or learning takes place on these days.\n\n\u201cAnother evil this sit-at-home has brought upon us is that no conference or seminar holds anymore in the Southeast because of the fear of the attacks that might result from sit-at-home.\n\n\u201cSo, people now use the sit-at-home thing to deny us certain opportunities that have to do with hosting certain programmes. I want to tell you that if the academic system is still as sacrosanct as it used to be in the past, students from the Southeast would not be able to compete with others from other regions because, so far, we have lost four straight months to sit-at-home.\n\n\u201cIf you calculate how many Mondays our students have been out of school since August last year, you will begin to appreciate how fast the education system in the Southeast has been descending into the abyss,\u201d Uzoma said.\n\nHe urged \u201cthe Federal Government to help us by negotiating with the agitators and release Nnamdi Kanu\u201d.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine what we would have lost in the next one year if Kanu continues to be held in detention,\u201d he said.\n\nA lecturer at the University of Nigeria Enugu Campus, Dike Amara, also said apart from instilling fears among staff and students, the sit-at-home has affected the quality of education in institutions.\n\n\u201cIn some institutions, lecturers will brave the odds and come to school, but won\u2019t find any student to teach. In that instance, it is the students that lose because most of them don\u2019t get to cover what they have for the semester as a result of some of these things,\u201d Amara said.\n\nOn the way forward, Dike said: \u201cThere must be compromise and dialogue for this whole thing to end. I still insist that the government should look into the agitations and see what the complaints are if not you will continue to kill the people you are supposed to be protecting.\n\n\u201cEverything is not about exercise of power. You should listen to the people you are ruling and know what their complaints are.\u201d\n\nThe Nation gathered in Ebonyi State that the sit-at-home has no effect on education activities in higher institutions in the state.\n\nA student of Alex Ekwueme Federal University, Ndufu-Alike, Ikwo (AE-FUNAI), Chisom Obi, said academic activities were always taking place in higher institutions on Monday before the strike embarked upon by ASUU.\n\nA student of Ebonyi State University (EBSU), Ngozika Eze, said the only negative effect the sit-\u00e1t-home had was that lecturers or students couldn\u2019t come into the state on Mondays.\n\n\u201cIf you travel and can\u2019t return on Sunday you are likely to miss your Monday lecture or whatever programme you may have on Monday.\n\n\u201cThis is because you may not get any public transport to bring you to Ebonyi on Mondays as the sit-at-home is active in other states on Mondays. Apart from that, we always have our usual lectures and other activities on Mondays,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Imo State, the Public Relations Officer, Imo State University (IMSU), Ralph Obi-Njoku, said some students living outside the campus adopted the strategy of leaving their houses early to beat the IPOB order.\n\nHe said though majority of their students lived within and around the school, those who come from far areas had resorted to leaving their houses around 6am before hoodlums start enforcing the order.\n\n\u201cWe have our students living within and around the campus. So Mondays don\u2019t pose much problem to our students. But those who live far away like Emekuku, Irete, Orji, Akabo, Avu and Obinze leave their houses very early to beat the enforcers of the sit-at-home,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a remedy, he suggested that the Federal Government should as a matter of urgency release the leader of IPOB to bring the situation under control.\n\n\u201cWe are losing billions of naira in commerce to the situation,\u201d he said.\n\nHigher institutions of learning in Abia State, including state, federal and private polytechnics, colleges of education and universities have continued to hold their academic activities despite the order.\n\nThe Nation gathered that managements of various higher institutions in the state, apparently because of the violent turn its enforcement was taking, adhered to the sit-at-home earlier. The schools, however, gradually began normal academic activities as the enforcement relapsed.\n\nA visit to some of the schools by The Nation showed that students of the Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike (MOUAU) had gone home because of ASUU strike.\n\nAccording to the students and lecturers, the order at the earliest stage was observed because of the dangerous turns the enforcement of the sit-at-home was taking.\n\nFor Sunday Okoro, the students, after the effect of the #ENDSARS protest and previous ASUU strikes, were ready to sacrifice anything to ensure that there was no further extension of their stay in school.\n\nA staff of the Abia State Polytechnic, Aba, who craved anonymity, told The Nation that they had been having their normal lectures over time, adding that they were about starting their second semester examination.\n\nAt Abia State University, The Nation gathered that lectures had been going on till last week when the institution got a threat letter from people suspected to be members of IPOB\n\nThe source said the IPOB members threatened to come hard on schools, including ABSU, should they hold academic activities on Mondays and any other day Nnamdi Kanu would be in court.\n\nIn Anambra State, primary and secondary schools have been under lock and key since August last year, including private ones. At a time, the schools resorted to going to school on Saturdays.\n\nA teacher in one of the public secondary schools in Awka said their main concern was the lives of the children.\n\nAccording to the source, \u201cthose people are heartless. If we failed to close schools, they would come here one day and set everywhere ablaze. The situation has made the students to lose track of many things and it made many of them, with the help of Anambra State Government, to replace Monday with Saturday for the children to cope.\u201d\n\nThe same was applicable in Imo, Abia and Enugu states, where Monday sit-at-home has been severe. But in Ebonyi, primary and secondary schools were always in session, but with caution, according to one of the teachers, who spoke with The Nation.\n\nThe source, who pleaded anonymity, said the situation made it difficult for them to concentrate in teaching the wards, as they were always afraid of what would happe the next minute.\n\nIn Abia State, stakeholders noted that the activities of the hoodlums have negatively affected teaching and learning.\n\nA private school owner in Aba told The Nation that they have not only extended their lecture hours, but have also included Saturday lectures into their teaching programme since they no longer go to school on Mondays.\n\nAlso, Imo State has been the hotbed of the activities of the hoodlums.\n\nPupils of Comprehensive Secondary School Nkume Njaba in Njaba Local Government Area of Imo State were chased out of the examination hall by suspected IPOB operatives during one of the sit-at-home.\n\nThe students and staff were pursued by enforcers of the order while they were about to write the West African Examination Council (WAEC) English Language Examination.\n\nThe situation has been bad in the Southeast for a long time and the students need help.",

          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nApex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, yesterday, described the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as a betrayer saying it committed political suicide by throwing its 2023 presidential ticket open to all aspirants, irrespective of geopolitical zone.\n\nA 37-member zoning committee of the PDP, chaired by Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom in its report to the National Working Committee of the party failed to zone the slot.\n\nBut President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, George Obiozor wondered why the PDP decided to jettison zoning when it was the turn of the South, and particularly the South East.\n\nHe described the decision as \u201cunconscionable political blunder and betrayal\u201d of the Igbo given the price they have paid supporting the party over the years.\n\nObiozor stated this in a statement signed by the group\u2019s National Publicity Secretary, Chiedozie Alex Ogbonnia condemning \u201cin its entirety the political suicide that has been committed by the PDP by its position on zoning.\u201d\n\nFor purpose of clarity, he stated that rotation and zoning principle was engrained into the PDP\u2019s Constitution in 2009.\n\nAccording to him, article 7 (2) (c) of the PDP Constitution states: \u2018In pursuance of the principle of equity, justice and fairness, the party shall adhere to the policy of rotation and zoning of party and public elective offices, and it shall be enforced by the appropriate executive committee at all levels.\u2019\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nHe said that such unscrupulous violation of the zoning principle that has been well entrenched in the PDP constitution simply changed the rules of the game in order to deprive Ndigbo the opportunity to produce a president for Nigeria.\n\nObiozor said history was never kind to betrayers and the treacherous, stressing that the machinations and conspiracies to deny the Igbo their due place in Nigeria was an ingratitude that daily cried to God.\n\nHe urged all the Igbo presidential aspirants to remain focused and undaunted because of the PDP shenanigans, pointing out that history will always vindicate the just.\n\n\u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide reiterates the position of the Southern and Middle Belt Leadership Forum led by Chief E K Clark that any party that does not zone it presidential ticket to the south should not expect the support of the Middle Belt and the entire South. It is therefore curious that the PDP should commit political hara-kiri at a time it is struggling for a fresh air. It is unfortunate that the PDP glomourises inordinate ambitions; any political ambition that undermines nation building should be checkmated.\n\n\u201cLet it be known that it runs contrary to the indomitable Igbo spirit to swallow any form of indignity, disdain or condescension from anybody or group. It is therefore highly inconceivable that the Igbo will validate a party or group that runs roughshod over its sensibilities.\u201d\n\n\u2026We\u2019ll not support northern candidate \u2013Afenifere, MBF\n\n\u2022PDP\u2019s action amounts to justice, equity, fairness \u2013AYCF\n\nBy Sunday Ani and Chukwudi Nweje\n\nPan Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere and Middle Belt Forum (MBF) have reiterated their earlier position that they would not support any presidential candidate from the north in 2023, insisting that after President Muhammadu Buhai\u2019s eight years in power as a northerner, power should naturally shift to the south.\n\nReacting to Ohaneze Ndigbo\u2019s assertion that the PDP has committed political suicide by throwing its presidential ticket open to all zones, , Afenifere said it would not be drawn into the partisan affairs of what the party did or did not do.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nBut, the National Publicity Secretary of the group, Jare Ajayi, however, reiterated the position adopted by the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF), under the leadership of Chief Edwin Clerk and the Southern Governors Forum led by Ondo State governor, Rotimi Akeredolu that power should shift to the south in 2023.\n\nPresident of the MBF, Dr. Pogu Bitrus, agreed with Ohanze\u2019s position that what the PDP had done amounted to a political suicide.\n\n\u201cWe said we would campaign against any political party that chose a northern candidate and if through this open process, a northern candidate emerges, it would amount to a political suicide because the Pan Niger Delta Elders Forum (PANDEF), Ohaneze, Afenifere and Middle Belt Forum will all campaign against the candidate, and that, by implication, means that PDP is gone. So, throwing the contest open actually amounts to a political suicide unless if they succeed in electing a southern candidate during the primary,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, President of the Arewa Youths Consultative Forum (AYCF), Alhaji Yerima Shettima disagreed with Ohaneze\u2019s assertion of PDP committing political suicide saying there was nothing like political suicide in what the PDP has done.\n\nHe said on the contrary, the party\u2019s action amounts to justice, equity and fairness.\n\n\u201cThe party knew that it was morally wrong to zone the presidency to the south; it also has no moral right to zone it to the north. The last president came from the south and in the 16 years of PDP in power, the north has only three years. And if you combine Buhari\u2019s administration as a northerner, though from the APC, together with that of late Umar Musa Yar\u2019Adua of the PDP, and you zone the presidency to the south, some of us will still feel that the right thing was not done and justice was done to the north. The south cannot have 14 and half years in power while the north has 10 and half years and they say justice has been done to the north; there is nothing justice about that.\u201d\n\nHe questioned the imperatives of zoning saying, \u201cIn what way has the zoning favoured anybody since we started it Nigeria? Look at what we are going through in Nigeria today. I has never favoured anybody and that is why we are saying that enough is enough. Let us begin to look at competence, no matter where the person comes from, rather than zoning.\u201d\n\n\u2026Final decision rests with NEC \u2013Ortom\n\nBy Sunday Ani\n\nContrary to what has been widely reported in the media that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has jettisoned its zoning arrangement and thrown open the contest for its presidential ticket for the 2023 poll to all geopolitical zones, Chairman of the party\u2019s 37-man zoning committee and Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has debunked the report.\n\nOrtom said the committee only submitted its recommendations to the party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC), which has the final decision on whether the presidential ticket should be zoned to the south or north or thrown open to aspirants from all geopolitical zones of the country.\n\nHe stated this on a Channels Television programme, yesterday.\n\n\u201cI want to repeat that the committee\u2019s work at our own level has been concluded; it is now left for the NEC to decide on what they think is the best for the party and Nigerians. We have just made a recommendation to the NEC, but it will now take a final decision. I think that NEC will soon invite us to a meeting because in any case most members of the committee are also members of NEC. So, at NEC, there will be robust discussions on what will help Nigerians and what will help the party to win in 2023,\u201d Ortom said.\n\nOn whether the party had not taken the wrong step by contemplating whether to jettison zoning or abide by it as has been the tradition of the party, Ortom said: \u201cWe have not shot ourselves in the foot and we will not do that. We listen to the people; we are grassroots-oriented and we want to make sure that whatever we do reflects the interests of our people in the PDP and the interests of Nigerians.\u201d\n\nAlthough he agreed that there could be some dissenting voices if zoning is finally jettisoned based on where such persons come from and their collective interests within their constituency, Ortom said at the end of the day, they would still come together and look at the larger picture of winning the 2023 presidential election.\n\n\u201cIt is not just about having a candidate, but it is about going ahead to campaign and winning the election so that we can rescue Nigeria and rebuild it. This is our paramount interest for now, but as I said, this is not the final decision. Whatever we have decided, which in our wisdom we have chosen not to make public, we are submitting it to NEC and NEC will deliberate on it, consult and take a final decision. Every average PDP member is concerned about winning the election. We will do whatever we can to give us favour before the people and make things work for us to win the election\u2026There was money in 2015 but did PDP win? Today, we are focusing on ensuring that we get the hearts of the people and in doing so, we must ensure justice, fairness and equity and truthfulness in all that we do. We have emphasised that we will get it right this time by doing the right thing.\u201d",

It is a war of attrition, but our military is living to the billing, working day and night to ensure that the terrorists are neutralised. We will continue to give information on the progress we are making in our fight against terrorism, but we can assure you we are on top of this matter.\n\n\u201cBut, unfortunately, it is the story of second guessing that is going on, and we will continue to give relevant information on the progress we\u2019re making in our fight against terrorism. But we can assure you we\u2019re on top of this matter and in any country in the world, while we are fighting terrorists, the oxygen they need is what is being provided daily, which is, they want to occupy the front page of every newspaper, they want to carry out spectacular attacks even when they are down\u2026 But clearly, the last three, four, five days, the military recorded massive victories against terrorists and bandits, either in the North East or in Kaduna, Niger axis.\u201d\n\nAsked if the Federal Government was listening to Kaduna governor\u2019s comment that the terrorists can be tracked as they listen to their conversations, he said: \u201cI know that on Monday, there was a very successful area interjection, where scores of hundreds of bandits/terrorists were eliminated.\n\n\u201cEven when we\u2019re able to identify where the bandits are, sometimes out of fear of collateral damage to the innocent civilians, you choose the time you want to strike. But I just want to assure you that the administration is not unmindful of your anxieties and your concerns. But probably because we are in charge, we can assure you there\u2019s really, really no cause to feel that the government is overwhelmed, not at all.\n\n\u201cWe are not overwhelmed and the last few days, I think has confirmed that. But unfortunately, when we inflict these victories on the bandits, for many reasons, we do not come out and say we have killed so many. Because, it\u2019s continuous.

          "title": "Zenith Shareholders Reap Bumper Harvest as Bank Pays N97.3bn Dividend",
          "text": "Kayode Tokede\n\n\n\n\n\nShareholders of Zenith Bank Plc have unanimously approved the bank\u2019s proposed final dividend, expressing delight at the final dividend payment of N2.80 per share which brings the total payout for the 2021 financial year to N3.10 per share with a total value of N97.33 billion.\n\nThe shareholders gave the approval at the bank\u2019s 31st Annual General Meeting (AGM) held yesterday at Civic Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos.\n\nIn his statement, the Founder and Chairman of Zenith Bank Plc, Mr Jim Ovia, thanked the shareholders for their unflinching loyalty, which has enabled the bank to rise to the pinnacle of the nation\u2019s financial services industry, and assured them of the bank\u2019s commitment to consistently deliver superior value to them.\n\nSpeaking on the financial institution\u2019s performance, the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive, Mr. Ebenezer Onyeagwu, said: \u201cif you look at the bank\u2019s history over the years, Zenith Bank has always grown, and even within the pandemic, we have maintained a reasonable positive growth trajectory. Growth is coming from the fact that we are deploying our digital capability to grow more businesses, simplify our service processes, make our processes more efficient, and deal with customers\u2019 complaints.\n\n\u201cApart from developing new products, we are discovering new business verticals, especially within the retail segment, which have significant revenue.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cMeeting the expectation of shareholders means we have to work harder. The team is dodged, hardworking, resilient, and above all, we have a very supportive board that comes with superior guidance.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the dividend payout, the Chairman Emeritus of the Independent Shareholders Association of Nigeria (ISAN), Mr. Sunny Nwosu, expressed the delight of shareholders over the consistent payment of dividends by Zenith Bank, noting that the bank\u2019s shares remain the toast of investors because the bank has never failed to pay dividends to shareholders.\n\nAlso speaking on behalf of other shareholders, the President of the Association of the Rights of Nigerian Shareholders (AARNS), Dr. Faruk Umar, said: \u201cThe bank is doing very well. All the ratios and indices have gone up. And more importantly, while we were in the meeting, I got my alert of the credit of my dividend. This is very commendable.\n\n\u201cThe leadership of the bank has been very effective; we thank Jim Ovia for the leadership he has been giving, he has increased the dividend in spite of the economic hardship in the country, and I believe the GMD is doing very well. I commend the management and staff of the bank, including the board, and I am very confident that this year would also be very good for the bank.\u201d\n\nUmar also commended the Group Managing Director over the numerous awards the bank received in 2021, especially the sustainability awards.\n\nIn spite of a challenging macroeconomic environment aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Zenith Bank Group achieved year-on-year (YoY) growth in gross earnings of 10 per cent from the N696.5 billion reported in the previous year to N765.6 billion. This was on the back of a 23 per cent YoY growth in non-interest income from N251.7 billion to N309 billion and a two per cent YoY growth in interest income from N420.8 billion to N427.6 billion.\n\nIts profit before tax also grew by 10 per cent, from N255.9 billion to N280.4 billion in the current year. The increase was due to growth in the top-line and very strong management of the treasury portfolio that increased efficiency, resulting in a drop in interest expense by 12 per cent from N121.1 billion in 2020, to N106.8 billion in the current year.\n\nThis further led to a seven per cent increase in net interest income of N320.8 billion in 2021, from N299.7 billion in 2020.\n\nThe bank\u2019s customer deposits also increased by 21 per cent, growing from N5.34 trillion in the previous year to N6.47 trillion in the current year.\n\nThe growth in customer deposits came from both corporate and retail customers. Retail deposits grew by N146 billion from N1.72 trillion in 2020 to N1.87 trillion in 2021.\n\nThe Group\u2019s continuous drive for retail deposits combined with the strategic rebalancing of its funding base helped to reduce the cost of funding from 2.1 per cent to 1.5 per cent in the current year. Although operating expenses grew by 13 per cent YoY, growth remains below the inflation rate, and the Group improved its Earnings per Share (EPS) which grew by six per cent from N7.34 to N7.78.\n\nTotal assets increased by 11 per cent, growing from N8.48 trillion in 2020 to N9.45 trillion in 2021, mainly driven by growth in customer deposits. With the steady recovery in economic activities, the Group prudently grew its gross loans by 20 per cent, from N2.9 trillion in 2020 to N3.5 trillion in 2021, with moderated non-performing loans (NPLs) ratio from 4.29 per cent to 4.19 per cent YoY. The Group recorded impressive liquidity and capital adequacy ratios of 71.6 per cent and 21 per cent, which remained above regulatory thresholds of 30 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively.\n\nIn recognition of its track record of excellent performance, Zenith Bank was voted as Best Commercial Bank in Nigeria in the World Finance Banking Awards 2021, Best Bank in Nigeria in the Global Finance World\u2019s Best Banks Awards 2020 and 2021, Bank of the Year (Nigeria) in The Banker\u2019s Bank of the Year Awards 2020, and Best in Corporate Governance \u2018Financial Services\u2019 Africa 2020 and 2021 by the Ethical Boardroom. Also, the bank emerged as the Most Valuable Banking Brand in Nigeria in the Banker Magazine Top 500 Banking Brands 2020 and 2021, Number One Bank in Nigeria by Tier-1 Capital in the \u201c2021 Top 1000 World Banks\u201d Ranking by The Banker Magazine and the Retail Bank of the year at the BusinessDay Banks and Other Financial Institutions (BOFI) Awards 2020 and 2021.\n\nSimilarly, Zenith Bank was honoured as Bank of the Decade (People\u2019s Choice) at the ThisDay Awards 2020 and emerged winner in four categories at the Sustainability, Enterprise, and Responsibility (SERAS) Awards 2021, carting home the awards for \u201cBest Company in Reporting and Transparency\u201d, \u201cBest Company in Infrastructure Development\u201d, \u201cBest Company in Gender Equality and Women Empowerment\u201d, and the coveted \u201cMost Responsible Organisation in Africa.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Decision makes Oyo, Delta, Rivers, Cross River, Abia, Enugu, Akwa Ibom vulnerable in govship contest, Benue also susceptible\n\n\u2022Party unlikely to make appreciable impact in key northern states to compensate for loss in south\n\n\u2022Ortom: We\u2019re yet to throw our ticket open\n\n\u2022Ohanaeze, PANDEF condemn decision by opposition party, say it\u2019s suicidal, a betrayal\n\n\u2022Fayose: PDP must tread carefully over zoning\n\nBy Deji Elumoye, Chuks Okocha, Udora Orizu, Emameh Gabriel in Abuja, Emma Okonji, Nosa Alekhuogie in Lagos and Gideon Arinze in Enugu\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the decision by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to throw its 2023 presidential ticket open, has not been sealed yet by its National Executive Committee (NEC), there are clear indications the party might compromise its otherwise bright chances in next year\u2019s general election if it travelled that route.\n\nSome of the unintended consequences of such a critical, but sensitive decision, is that the PDP might render some of its key states vulnerable and further unable to make significant impact in a few other equally crucial states, in addition to frittering away the presidency.\n\nTherefore, while the decision could make the PDP lose such states like Oyo, Delta, Rivers, Abia, Enugu, Akwa Ibom, Benue and Cross River (though currently controlled by the APC, however, a strong PDP state) in the governorship election.\n\nEven more interesting is that the action does not guarantee the PDP would make any major impact in key northern states to compensate for the expected loss in the south.\n\nFor example, the PDP has never won Yobe and Borno States, and it is unlikely to perform any magic in 2023, to change the voting pattern. So, the party would face an uphill task winning these states even with a northern presidential candidate and the APC fielding a southern candidate.\n\nThis, nonetheless, Chairman of the PDP Zoning Committee and Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, yesterday, denied the claim, stating that the PDP National Executive Committee (NEC) would take a final decision on whether or not to throw the presidential ticket open.\n\nAlso, reactions to throwing the contest open to all came swiftly from several groups in the South, who have been clamouring for the presidential ticket to be zoned to the South.\n\nForemost Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, condemned the decision by the PDP to throw its presidential ticket open, saying it was a suicidal move.\n\nA Pan-Niger Delta Forum, (PANDEF), has also expressed its disappointment at the PDP decision, saying it was an awful decision that would have consequences.\n\nA preponderance of submissions by analysts contended that if the party eventually produced a northern presidential candidate, it stood the chance of losing those southern states to the All Progressives Congress (APC), especially, that it had already begun to make inroads into the southern states.\n\nUnfortunately, the possibility that PDP might pick its presidential candidate for the 2023 general election from the North is high, because the north, which has more delegates would ensure that a northerner emerged at its presidential primaries.\n\nYet, with a northern presidential candidate, the PDP might lose some of its controlled states in the South-south, Southeast and at the same time, unable to make serious impacts in some APC-controlled northern states, both at the governorship and presidential polls.\n\nA survey report sighted by THISDAY, which advised against throwing the ticket open, alluded to the agitation and position of the southern governors that the next president should come from their region.\n\nThe party would be going against the mood of its support zone, if it fields a northerner. According to analysts, \u201cthere is no way the party will escape the wrath of the of the South\u201d, if it goes ahead to pick a northerner as its candidate.\n\nAccording to the survey, the PDP states had already complained of the implications of being in opposition by 2023, and cited the frequent defections of some of their governors and members of the National Assembly to the APC, as a development that could not be glossed over.\n\nThe survey, therefore, warned that the PDP might lose governorship elections in Delta, Akwa Ibom, Enugu, Cross Rivers, Rivers and Oyo states, because it might lose grip of the attendant protests for a southern presidential candidate.\n\nWhile the survey report stated that the party might win in Adamawa state, it noted unequivocally that it would be unable to make any positive input in Borno and Yobe States, as it has never won elections in the two north east states\n\nImportantly, with the resignation of Rabiu Kwankwanso from the PDP and his membership of a relatively unknown New Nigeria People\u2019s Party (NNPP), the PDP might not make any positive impact in Kano State.\n\nThe survey further analysed that, should the APC also pick a southern presidential candidate, it would take advantage of the whirlwind protests against the PDP, which is determined to go north.\n\nThe report reiterated that only Adamawa State might be retained by the PDP in the north as 2023 would be a smooth-sail victory for the APC.\n\nWhereas the southern states of Delta, Enugu, Akwa Ibom, Rivers and Benue in the north central might be taken over by the APC, because of the solidarity of the ruling party picking a southern presidential candidate, in tune with the mood of the nation.\n\nA copy of the recommendation of the zoning committee obtained by THISDAY stated thus: \u201cZoning, as in our party constitution, is affirmed. Inspite of (1) above, ticket is thrown open, this time around due to exigency of time. Our party is encouraged to always make the issue of zoning very clear, at least, six months before sales of forms.\n\n\u201cOur party should commend the efforts of some our contestants on the issue of consensus candidacy; the efforts should be seen to a peaceful and logical conclusion.\u201d\n\nBut no date has been fixed for the National Executive Committee (NEC) the party, where it is expected to ratify the recommendation.\n\nTo that extent, the survey report sighted by THISDAY, stated that there would be a mark up in the 2015 and 2019 election figures for the APC in the South, due to the fact that the party would field a presidential candidate from South, giving value to the aspirations of the people of the South.\n\nVerified INEC Figures of 2019 Election\n\nA verified INEC figures of the 2019 election, put registered voters as follows: North West:20 million; South West: 15.8 million; North Central: 13.1 million; South-south: 12.6 million; North East: 11.3 million and South East: 9.5 million, put the total for northern Nigeria at 44.3 million and Southern Nigeria at 38 million.\n\nAlso, it stated that, 35 in every 100 Nigerian that registered to vote in 2019 presidential election, voted. Thus, in Northern Nigeria, the figure was 41, while the Southern Nigeria posted 27.\n\nThe figures for the turnout also broke down the election categories as follow: Presidential Election: North West, 44%; North East, 43%; North Central, 37%; South-south, 28%; South West, 28%, and South East, 25%. Over all, the Northern Nigeria had 41% while the Southern Nigeria had 27%.\n\nHighest Voting States\n\nA breakdown of the 2019 highest voting states listed the top 10. Kano: NW, 1.96; Kaduna: NW, 1.71m; Katsina: NW, 1.62m; Lagos: SW, 1.16m; Jigawa: NW, 1.15m; Plateau: NC,1.06m; Bauchi: NE, 1.06m; Borno, NE, 955K; Sokoto: NW, 926K and Niger: NC, 897K.\n\nYet, the 2019 least voting states, according to the survey, gave the breakdown. On the presidential election, Bayelsa: SS, 336K; Abia: SE, 344K; Ebonyi: SE, 379K; Ekiti: SW,394K; Cross River: SS, 446K; Enugu: SE, 451K; FCT: NC, 451K; Kwara: NC, 486K; Imo: SE, 543K; and Kogi: NC, 553K.\n\nFactors That Informed the THISDAY Projections\n\nClearly, these are not some armchair analyses but informed by existential factors, which point in plausible directions for the different categories of elections. However, in the presidential run, there are three critical factors that currently lent credence to the THISDAY projections.\n\nThe first factor is that the APC is still strong in the north despite insecurity and banditry. This is essentially, because they still have the support of three key religious groups in the north.\n\nThe groups include the one led by Sheikh Dahiru Usman Bauchi. There\u2019s another led by Muhammad Sanusi II, former emir of Kano, the Tijaniyya Islamic sect, and of course, there is the Izala Muslim sect, formally Jama\u2019at Izalatul. They have continued to mobilise support for the APC and so, it is still very strong in the north.\n\nThe second factor is that, even if the PDP fielded a northern candidate, it still couldn\u2019t defeat the APC in the north and at the same time, it would lose in the south, because APC would still retain its northern hold, while the PDP would lose the south.\n\nHowever, the third factor is the mood of the country. In 1999, the mood of the country was for a South-west candidate, because of the June 12 crisis, which also explained why the two presidential candidates at the time \u2013 Olusegun Obasanjo and Oluyemisi Falae \u2013 were from the zone.\n\nIn 2011, the mood was for Niger Delta, albeit by providence, and former President Goodluck Jonathan, won. And now, the mood is for a southern candidate, however, from the Southeast zone.\n\nAbove all, the second term APC governors are also determined to ensure successors of choice, a development that would make the election stiff and clearly in their favour with the incumbency factor largely in force.\n\nOrtom: Ticket Not Open Yet, NEC Will Take Final Decision\n\nChairman of the PDP Zoning Committee and Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, has denied claim that the party had thrown its ticket open, saying a final decision on the matter would be taken by the PDP National Executive Committee (NEC).\n\nOrtom said members of the committee met, and unanimously adopted a position, but concluded not to make the decision public until NEC makes a final pronouncement on it.\n\nOrtom, who spoke on the ARISE NEWS Channel, stressed that what was decided at the meeting would be subject to NEC\u2019s approval, adding that NEC could either decide in agreement with what they did, or decide to subtract or add to it.\n\n\u201cAll that we did was a recommendation and that was why we felt that it was premature for us to let the cat out of the bag. PDP has not brought out a report, and that will be done by NEC, so don\u2019t crucify us.\n\n\u201cThey will soon invite us to a meeting, a decision will be taken and then, we can move on from there. NEC has the final authority to decide the zoning. So, when that decision is made, then, the party will give a directive,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor, however, said the committee\u2019s work at their own level had been concluded and the report submitted to NEC to decide on what they thought was best for the party at the material time.\n\n\u201cWe are just 37 members selected from each state and the Federal Capital Territory. But I want to tell you, that PDP is very mindful. We listen to the people, because we are a grassroots party; we are people-oriented and will make sure that whatever we do reflects the interests of our people in the PDP and for Nigerians.\n\n\u201cTwo heads are better than one and we have been able to send a recommendation to NEC. They will make a final decision and I think we will soon be invited for a meeting, because in any case, most of the members of the committee happen to be members of NEC. So, there will be a robust discussion on what will help Nigeria and our party to win in 2023,\u201d Ortom further said.\n\nInterestingly, he made his position known to all on the zoning, when he said the presidency should be zoned to the south, adding that zoning was part of PDP\u2019s constitution and they were able to resolve what they thought was best for the party, adding that, this was his personal position right from the beginning.\n\nHis words: \u201cI am not talking as a zoning committee member or the chairman of zoning committee; I am talking as Samuel Ortom. Most importantly, what can we do to get back to where we stopped in 2015, because Nigerians were aware of how PDP was able to manage the economy, the security, the social life, and everything?\n\n\u201cAs of today, we have already gone from top to bottom and we\u2019re not just talking at the bottom, we are going beneath the bottom, if no drastic action is taken with someone with the capacity to deliver. It means all of us are going to be buried soon.\n\n\u201cFor some of us, we have made sacrifices. The unity of Nigeria cannot be compromised and I\u2019m ready to sacrifice anything to ensure justice, equity, and fairness, for our people,\u201d Ortom said.\n\nReacting to accusations that some aspirants were trying to use money to get the ticket, he said people are entitled to their opinions but encouraged Nigerians to always seek the truth, even as he urged everybody to team up in the fight for justice, equity and fairness in everything, knowing that this is a democratic rule.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are really looking at the larger picture of winning the election. It is not just about having a candidate, but it is about going ahead campaigning and winning the election so that we can rescue Nigeria and build it, which is our paramount interest as at now.\u201d\n\nThe committee chairman explained that PDP\u2019s NEC had always been represented by all members of the party in the entire country from the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), adding that other people from outside, who were not members of NEC could still make input.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity to get it right. PDP got it wrong in 2015 and they paid dearly for it. I am sure our people have learnt from the mistakes that were done in the past and that is why you can see we are not talking about imposition of candidates. We are talking about doing due process in ensuring that democracy gets to the grassroots and the people themselves, have a say, who becomes their representative.\n\n\u201cSo, the issue of money is not the focus. In 2015, there was money everywhere, but did PDP win? Today, we are focusing on assuring that we get the hearts of the people and I believe that in doing this, we must ensure justice, fairness, equity and truthfulness, in all that we do,\u201d Ortom said.\n\nThe Benue governor also accused the present administration of rigging in past elections, stating that from the information that they had been able to gather, the opposition has plans to still rig in futute elections, but said PDP would not allow such to happen again.\n\nHe reiterated that the reason he was banned from seeing President Muhammadu Buhari was because he was advising him to do the right thing.\n\n\u201cThe government does not have the interest of the people. They only have their own personal interest. If the federal government does not act fast, Nigeria will be buried and that is where we are headed,\u201d Ortom added.\n\nOhanaeze: Throwing Presidential Ticket Open is Political Betrayal\n\nA foremost Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has condemned the decision by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), to throw its presidential ticket open to aspirants from all parts of the country and described it as political betrayal.\n\nAccording to a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Chiedozie Alex Ogbonnia, the group, which urged all the Igbo presidential aspirants to remain focused and undounted, wondered why the party decided to jettison zoning now that it was the turn of the South, particularly, the South East.\n\n\u201cFor purpose of clarity, rotation and zoning principle was engrained into the PDP party\u2019s Constitution in 2009. Article 7 (2) (c) of the PDP Constitution states: \u2018In pursuance of the principle of equity, justice and fairness, the party shall adhere to the policy of rotation and zoning of party and public elective offices, and it shall be enforced by the appropriate executive committee at all levels,\u201d Ohanaeze explained.\n\nThe group noted that such \u201cunscrupulous violation of the zoning principle that has been well entrenched in the PDP constitution simply changes the rules of the game in order to deprive Ndigbo the opportunity to produce a president for Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIt claimed it was a political blunder and betrayal, given what Ndigbo had suffered in the country and most recently, for supporting the PDP.\n\n\u201cHistory has never been kind to betrayers and the treacherous,\u201d Ohanaeze said, stressing that, \u201cThe machinations and conspiracies to deny Ndigbo their due place in Nigeria is an ingratitude that daily cries to God.\u201d\n\nOhanaeze reiterated the position of the Southern and Middle Belt Leadership Forum led by Chief E K Clark, that any party that does not zone its presidential ticket to the South should not expect the support of the Middle Belt and the entire South.\n\nThe organisation maintained that one of the roles of a political party in a democracy was nation building and that for the PDP to shirk its responsibilities, was an unfortunate path to Golgotha.\n\nThe statement read in part: \u201cLet it be known that it runs contrary to the indomitable Igbo spirit to swallow any form of indignity, disdain or condescension from anybody or group. It is, therefore, highly inconceivable that the Igbo will validate a party or group that runs roughshod over its sensibilities,\u201d Ohanaeze said.\n\nPANDEF: PDP\u2019s Decision is Awful, Will Have Consequences\n\nA Pan-Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), yesterday, expressed its disappointment in the decision of the PDP to throw its 2023 presidential ticket open, warning that such an awful decision would have consequences.\n\nThe Forum, in a release by its National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Ken Robinson, stated that it was not utterly surprised at the development, as the outcome was predictable, because there were evident pointers that this would be the conclusion.\n\nPANDEF insisted that for fairness, equity, justice and in the nation\u2019s interest, the next President of Nigeria, to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023, should come from the South.\n\nIt reiterated the call by the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders\u2019 Forum (SMBLF) on the people and all lovers of peace and equity in Nigeria to reject any political party that failed to zone its presidential ticket to the South.\n\nThe statement stated, although in parts, \u201cGovernor Ortom\u2019s Committee had a script and they have played it out, with due deference to some patriots that were in the Committee. The level of desperation and political debauchery being demonstrated by some political stakeholders is deplorable and quite disappointing.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, we are in a society, where it seems anything goes. We will await the conduct of the presidential primaries by the parties to assess the choices that would be presented to us. Anything otherwise would be detrimental to national peace and cohesion. The basis of any viable democracy, especially, in a diverse and complex country such as Nigeria, is fairness and even sharing of power.\u201d\n\nFrom PDP\u2019s Zoning Committee, Some Inside Gist\n\nBefore the PDP zooming committee meeting commenced yesterday, it was observed that Professors ABC Nwosu and Jerry Gana, had in collaboration with like minds, drafted what they purported to represent the views of the committee at the previous meeting.\n\nThis was revealed to the meeting by the Deputy Chairman of the Committee and Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Hon Ndudi Elumelu.\n\nHowever, to the rude shock of some members, Elumelu got up and wanted to present what he claimed was the draft resolution of the committee for adoption.\n\nHe was angrily shouted down by some committee members from the South. Someone would later query why Nwosu and Gana hijacked the duty and responsibility of the committee\u2019s secretariat to summarise their contributions and went ahead to draft resolutions for them.\n\nAt this juncture, Governor Samuel Ortom took the microphone from him and started pleading with the house for calm and understanding.\n\nEnugu State Governor, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, was obliged to make contributions and he spoke along the line of the decisions of his colleague, Ortom, on the challenges facing the PDP as opposition party as well as the expectations and opportunities for the party to seize.\n\nThereafter, the Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku, who was visibly angry, made reference to the submission of Bode George on the need for equity, fairness and justice to be reflected in all that the PDP would come out with.\n\nBut it was Senator Jonah Jang, a former Governor of Plateau State, who took strong exceptions to the attitude of his colleagues and queried the justification and morality in what they were saying.\n\nHe bluntly told everyone that what they are about to do by denying the South East Zone their God-given opportunity at this time of national distress to step in and rescue Nigeria was an act of hatred, cruel and unjust.\n\nIbrahim Shema, former Governor of Katsina State, was unapologetic in his submission and quoted various sections of the PDP Constitution to support his position and insistence on Rotation and Zoning.\n\nAs a former Deputy Chairman of the PDP, he counselled the committee to adopt the strategies of the past in cases like this, rotate and zone as per the PDP Constitution. He claimed that would not preclude those opposed to it from contesting, because it was their constitutional right, and by so doing, the party would have upheld its constitution.\n\nIn the midst of grumbling, Nze Ozichukwu Chukwu, whose brilliant and explosive memorandum, had been earlier circulated took the microphone and made a very moving speech that provoked an outcry at the meeting.\n\nHe challenged their minds with incidences, facts and figures while buttressing and reinforcing the submission of Governor Shema. He equally reminded all of the need for justness and sincerity. He spoke of the need to reinterpret the paper of Professors ABC Nwosu and Jerry Gana into ordinary language for them to become effective instruments for action.\n\nHow efficient will they be? To whose benefits? He queried. He went further to caution the PDP not to take the \u201csensitivities and sensibilities of the masses\u201d for granted and insisted that rotation and zoning were the pillars on which the PDP was anchored and what would happen in the event that the PDP jettisoned it and APC dusted it and embraced it.\n\nAt this point, Ortom asked him, \u201cPlease, what do you want us to do?\u201d He responded and said, \u201cYour Excellency, please, let us do right things right and zone the presidency to the South.\u201d\n\nAt this juncture there was an uproar. Alhaji Sule Lamido spoke but the eruption that attended Nze Ozichukwu\u2019s bombshell drowned his voice. To those who became quite uncomfortable and apprehensive, he cited the \u201cneed to diligently and sincerely cultivate the civilisation of dialogue.\n\n\u201cWe overheard him telling the chairman that as a democrat, he will sign the draft resolution not as a consensus document, but as reflecting majority opinion though no voting by raising of hands took place but he heard the voice votes.\n\n\u201cAfter the meeting, we wanted to seek audience with Nze Ozichukwu for more light but he disappeared. By the time we went out looking for him, we were told that he had driven out with his driver,\u201d a source who was at the meeting.\n\nFayose: PDP Must Tread Carefully over Zoning\n\nA former governor of Ekiti State and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential hopeful, Ayodele Fayose, has advised the opposition party to tread with caution and respect the existing zoning arrangement between the South and the North.\n\nHe also maintained that he was not going to step down for aspirants from any zone, because the sentiment that only the north could win election for the party must be jettisoned.\n\nThe former governor, who was a host on a Channels TV programme, Politics Today, a few hours after purchasing his presidential nomination form, said he was ready for the onslaught.\n\nFayose said he intentionally bought his nomination form to challenge the status quo and fight some powerful forces in the party, who wanted to silence or shortchange the south in the scheme of things.\n\n\u201cNigeria as a country has a diversity. And for that reason, we (PDP) must tread carefully. We must be very careful. The peculiarities, including the minority, the south, the north the middle belt and sentiment of religion for us to coexist brought into the fore to create within our constitution that there should be time to the north and there should be a time to the south.\n\n\u201cIf you remember what happened in 1999, what brought President Obasanjo to power was the reason of grievances in the south, because they don\u2019t have good time during the military.\n\n\u201cThe agitation was so much and the killing of Abiola and all that, was what brought President Obasanjo. I remember in 1999, power was purposely zoned to the Southwest that gave Olu Falae and Obasanjo the opportunity. There was no other way.\n\nExplaining why qualified aspirants from the South were not allowed to contest at the party\u2019s last convention in Port Harcourt, he said they \u201cdidn\u2019t contest because they were told it was purely a Northern affair\u2019. I was told it was going to be a Northern affairs. And that was why you ad the Sarakis of this world, the Atiku, the Tambuwal and all of them. There was no southerner,\u201d he recounted.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIf we don\u2019t begin to put things in perspective and rightfully, our children will ask questions. The unfortunate demise of former President Yar\u2019Adua is not enough an excuse for anybody to take away the letters of our constitution.\n\n\u201cDo we say if you contest an election and you lost, they (the north) must continue to produce you so that you win before zoning will count? No! The last election has given opportunity to the north. If they had won that election, they would be there today. I don\u2019t believe in not zoning this presidential ticket.\u201d\n\nHe said the zoning committee of the party, which he was a member made an error for failing to specially state where it would pick its next presidential flag bearer from.\n\n\u201cI believe it was an error. It was wrong. It was the more reason why I took my form today. I won\u2019t be blamed for that. They would come back and say to us one day.\n\n\u201cLook at it from this angle. Who tells you that it\u2019s the north that will give us the vote? Some people say it and I hear it: \u2018let the person that can win.\u2019 Who can win? Who tell you that I cannot win?\n\n\u201cEverybody on election day would hold his ward and his local government. We will all work together, even after primaries. We have to come together and work for whoever wins an election. Stop telling me it\u2019s this person that can win. We are all great politicians in our states. We all donate our votes.\u201d\n\nContinuing, Fayose said, \u201cLet me give you an example. Let me come from our respectable leader, His Excellency Atiku Abubakar. He won in Adamawa by less than 20,000 votes. Less than, with due respect to him, for reasons of analysis. Go to Sokoto, what is the voting difference?\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s us go to Bukola Saraki in Kwara, we actually lost there. Let\u2019s us sit back and look at figures. When somebody is saying this is the person that can win. Who is the person that can win? Let\u2019s talk about the characters. If we don\u2019t agree, we go to the field. We are not like the APC, where somebody will be begging you in the field.\n\n\u201cI am not stepping down. I am a young man, only 62. I won\u2019t step down. The energy is there. The party cannot determine consensus. Let me tell you the truth, it\u2019s within my right to contest an election. Even if they choose Governor Wike, I will still contest.\n\n\u201cLet all of us go to the field. It\u2019s this issue of consensus, that you try to turn red to green and trying to silence some people. This one, I purposely went there to get this form and I will start to go to states to let them know I am prepared for the onslaught.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says menace preventing new investment in fossil fuels\n\nEmmanuel Addeh\n\n\n\n\n\nAs oil-producing companies in the country and even Nigeria continue to lose out on the rising international price of the crude, Wood McKenzie, a global mining and consultancy research group, has said that the oil theft challenge in the country has gone beyond a crisis point.\n\nThe firm in its latest report titled: \u201cNigeria Suffers Record Levels of Oil Theft,\u201d while noting that the problem was scaring investors from the sector, noted that for instance, Shell reported about 107 sabotage incidents in 2021 alone.\n\nStating that the Bonny pipeline remains the hardest-hit by theft and vandalism, the research organisation stressed that Heirs Oil and Gas, owned by Tony Elumelu, for example, averaged losses of 66 per cent from Oil Mining Licence (OML) 17 in 2021, before peaking at 97 per cent in December.\n\nFurther describing Imo River and Rumukpe as hotspots for the menace, the document showed that the Nembe Creek Trunkline, operated by Aiteo experienced a downtime of 40 per cent during the period.\n\nWoodmac added that although improved security and monitoring reduced losses at Forcados, lack of pump capacity at Ughelli had a major impact on oil production in the Western Delta.\n\nAccording to the document, ND Western reported 300 theft points on a 12 kilometre section of pipeline during the period around OML 34, while shell declared force majeure at Forcados in August and December last year.\n\nIt disclosed that Eni\u2019s Brass oil pipelines in the northern areas are now worst affected, while local security officials contend with an unprecedented number of incidents.\n\nAlthough Chevron\u2019s Excravos network is mostly offshore and not so vulnerable, it noted that the southern swamp community dispute shut in 8.8kpd in December 2021 while 50 per cent of liquids production now comes from offshore, which offers some form of protection.\n\n\u201cOil thefts have gone beyond crisis point and are deterring investment in the onshore. Crude theft and sabotage have long been problems in Nigeria, but 2021 saw record levels of theft.\n\n\u201cThefts combined with export terminal and pipeline shut-downs are limiting Nigeria\u2019s ability to ramp-up production and take advantage of high prices. Onshore operators are spending to secure current production rather than grow it. This represents a huge opportunity cost.\n\n\u201cThe Bonny and Brass pipelines in the eastern delta are worst affected, Forcados much less. Barging can be cost-effective but only at small scale longer term solutions needed,\u201d it said.\n\nExplaining that, \u201cNigeria has been here before in 2016,\u201d Woodmac said alternative pipelines are coming far too slow to materialise. It added that investors and the state were paying the price.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s production is likely to improve in 2022, but underperformance against OPEC+ quota remains a major risk. NNPC reports that crude thefts in 2021 reached 200,000 barrels per day a quarter of onshore production.\n\n\u201cProlonged shut-downs at Forcados and Qua Iboe export terminals also hampered output. There has been little improvement in 2022, with Brass and Bonny terminals shut-in in March,\u201d it noted.\n\nThe report reiterated the recently released data by the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) that stolen volumes cost Nigeria up to $3.27 billion oil shut ins and impact associated gas production and sales to the domestic market.\n\n\u201cSome onshore investments are on hold while operators try to secure production via alternative export routes. The scale and sophistication of crude thefts suggests an organised operation on an industrial scale,\u201d it pointed out.\n\nIt noted that attempts at finding alternatives had come at a higher cost, as barging costs for instance, are typically between $15 to $20 per barrel.\n\n\u201cBarging becomes cost effective when losses exceed 20 per cent, provided that oil prices are high enough to cover the additional cost Logistics can limit barging volumes to a maximum of 20,000 bpd.\n\n\u201cProducers need access to a navigable river and barging Jetty, and an agreement with an offshore vessel to export the crude. Larger producers see barging only as a short-term solution and typically return to the major trunk lines once performance improves,\u201d it said.\n\nThe firm stated that there had been a failure to construct alternative pipelines since 2016 as many producers barge crude offshore from Warri as it offers more secure exports, but at prohibitive costs.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Ohaneze: PDP Has Committed Political Suicide by Discarding Zoning",
          "text": "* Says it\u2019s highly inconceivable that Igbo \u2018ll validate a party that runs roughshod over its sensibilities\n\nPresident General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo World Wide, Prof George Obiozor, has said the Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party (PDP) has committed political suicide by jettisoning zoning.\n\nObiozor was reacting to the decision of the Governor Ortom-led PDP committee on zoning of its presidential ticket to throw the party\u2019s ticket open.\n\nThe Ortom committee was reported to have thrown the presidential ticket of the party open to all aspirants from all parts of the country, in violation of the party\u2019s tradition of rotating power between North and South.\n\nSpecifically, Article 7 (2) (c) of the PDP Constitution states: \u2018In pursuance of the principle of equity, justice and fairness, the party shall adhere to the policy of rotation and zoning of party and public elective offices, and it shall be enforced by the appropriate executive committee at all levels.\u201d\n\nReacting to the development, Obiozor wondered why the PDP decided to jettison zoning when it was the turn of the South and particularly the South East to produce the President.\n\nDeploring what he called the unconscionable shifting of the goal post at the middle of the game, Obiozor said such unscrupulous violation of the zoning principle that had been well entrenched in the PDP constitution simply changes the rules of the game in order to deprive Ndigbo the opportunity to produce a president for Nigeria.\n\nObiozor described the party\u2019s action as \u201ca political blunder and betrayal given what Ndigbo have suffered in our own country and most recently for supporting the PDP.\u201d\n\nNoting that history has never been kind to betrayers and the treacherous, the Ohaneze leader said the machinations and conspiracies to deny Ndigbo their due place in Nigeria was an ingratitude that cries to God daily.\n\nObiozor said: \u201cOhanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide reiterates the position of the Southern and Middle Belt Leadership Forum led by Chief E K Clark that any party that does not zone it presidential ticket to the South should not expect the support of the Middle Belt and the entire South. It is therefore curious that the PDP should commit political hara-kiri at a time it is struggling for a fresh air.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the PDP glomourises inordinate ambitions; any political ambition that undermines nation building should be checkmated. One of the roles of a political party in a democracy is nation building and for the PDP to shirk its responsibilities is an unfortunate path to Golgotha.\n\nLet it be known that it runs contrary to the indomitable Igbo spirit to swallow any form of indignity, disdain or condescension from anybody or group. It is therefore highly inconceivable that the Igbo will validate a party or group that runs roughshod over its sensibilities.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, there is hardly any society that can develop amidst crises. Development is a product, an effect that arises from peace, unity and national coherence. On the other hand, the basics of peace, unity and sustainable national development is justice, equity and human dignity.

Obilor Esq., a lawyer from our chambers (Tope Temokun Chambers) visited the office of the DSS in Akure, with the family members of Mr. Olupona to find out the reason for his arrest, but they were denied not only access to him but also the opportunity of knowing the reason for the arrest and detention of Mr. Olupona.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn the 28th of March 2022, the detainee\u2019s mother and B.C. Obilor Esq. from our chambers again visited the DSS office in Akure, to formally apply for bail for Mr. Olupona, but the officer in charge who refused to disclose his name, refused this constitutional request for the detainee to be released on bail, while still refusing to disclose the reason for the arrest and detention of Mr. Olupona.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe officer in charge of the case in the DSS office demanded that we write a letter to the director, requesting the director\u2019s consent and approval, before we could have access to see the detainee and in a swift response, by a letter signed and presented dated 28th of March 2022, we made the appropriate formal request as directed, but till date, we did not get consent nor the approval of the director for the counsel and the detainee\u2019s mother to see him.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have been left with no choice but to approach the court to challenge this serial lawlessness of the secret police, who have perennially indulged in wearing this military toga of disrespect to the rights of Nigerians from state to state as if they are above the constitution of the land.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are not unmindful of the fact that the DSS is answerable and responsible to the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria only. But they should know that the president is an employee and servant of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Federal Republic of Nigeria is a company owned constitutionally by the people, the Nigerian people, whose rights and human dignity the DSS has been disrespecting and trampling underfoot.

          "text": "BY OMOLOLA AFOLABI\n\nCalm as a millpond, Mufeedah Aliyu cooed infectiously. She waved her fingers and snuggled close to her grandmother, who cuddled her, then whipped out a bottle filled with congealed pap with which she fed her.\n\nIt had been months since Mufeedah\u2019s mother, Halimat, died as a result of a snakebite in the Sepeteri area of Oyo state. Following her death on August 27, 2021, the responsibility of caring for her infant child fell on her mother-in-law, 75-year-old Abidatu Abdulazeez.\n\n\u201cWe have been feeding her on a bottle since she was six months old,\u201d Abidatu said as she adjusted the baby\u2019s bib.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSepeteri, the largest town in Saki east LGA, is surrounded by Igboho, Saki, Ago Are and Iseyin \u2014 all in the Oke-Ogun region of Oyo. Over 70 percent of the residents of the community are farmers.\n\nThe brown mamba, which is commonly found in the community, is known locally as \u2018paramole\u2019. Other snakes found in the area include the West African carpet viper, the puff adder and the spitting cobra.\n\nAbdulazeez Aliyu, Halimat\u2019s husband, described his late wife as a hardworking woman, adding that she was a teacher in the only private primary school in the community \u2014 Muslim Primary School, Sepeteri.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe went to the farm early on a Saturday. As we parked the vehicle, she came down first and was bitten by a snake on her right heel. We rushed her to the UCH facility immediately, and we were told that they were expecting someone. That person never came,\u201d Aliyu recounted, as he narrated the events leading to her death.\n\n\u201cWhile looking for the fastest alternative, we were advised to take her to Saki. We, however, took her to a private hospital because of the distance.\n\n\u201cShe was admitted and given treatment, but three days later, she died. She was vomiting blood and we later understood that the venom had gone through her body.\u201d\n\nAside from a University College Hospital (UCH) annex in Sepeteri, there is the Muslim Hospital in Saki, about 30 kilometres away, which is the nearest facility where residents can get treatment for snakebites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTWO MORE TODDLERS TO RAISE\n\nMufeedah\u2019s siblings, six-year-old Ridwan and four-year-old Mashidat, are in the care of Halimat\u2019s mother, 69-year-old Saratu Raheem. When TheCable visited, Saratu was found at a hearth trying to make breakfast.\n\nSaratu, a widow, appeared distraught as she spoke about the death of her only daughter.\n\n\u201cI am consoled by God and the children, although it\u2019s hard to accept such a fate. On that fateful morning, she told me she wouldn\u2019t stay long at the farm. I was later told she had been bitten by a snake and rushed to a private hospital,\u201d Saratu said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cShe was given some antivenom. We were willing to spend any amount of money to save her life. She was recovering steadily until she complained of drowsiness. After three days, she vomited twice and died.\u201d\n\n\u2018I WOULD HAVE DIED\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Halima succumbed to the snakebite, some other residents were lucky enough to survive and recount their experiences.\n\nMujidat Mudashiru, a millet and maize farmer, said she would have died if not for the prompt intervention of her husband who took her to the Muslim Hospital in Saki.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was taken to the UCH centre but we were told there were no drugs. So, I was immediately rushed to Saki. On the way to Saki which took about an hour, I felt like the venom was travelling through my body, while my leg where I had been bitten started to feel numb,\u201d the 43-year-old, who currently walks with a slight limp, said.\n\nA 71-year-old resident identified as Baba Kekere was also said to have died of snakebite. His brother, who asked not to be named, said after Baba was rushed to a hospital, there were challenges with raising funds for treatment.\n\n\u201cIf we could afford the treatment, perhaps he would have survived,\u201d the brother added.\n\nFor Okewole Muritala, aged 60, another maize and millet farmer, the unavailability of workers at the UCH facility worsened the situation.\n\n\u201cI stepped on a snake while I was farming and I got bitten. Then, I was taken to UCH here but the facility was not open. I was taken to Saki afterwards where I was treated,\u201d he said.\n\nSNAKEBITE TREATMENT CENTRE DESERTED\n\nThe comprehensive health centre in Sepeteri is under the administration of the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan.\n\nYears after former Senate President David Mark inaugurated the facility in 2014, it has grappled with epileptic power supply that hampers the effective operation of the blood bank and X-ray unit, while the staff quarters are also inhabitable.\n\nThe facility also consists of a snakebite treatment centre, which is now deserted and surrounded by bushes. When TheCable visited the facility, it was locked. A public health official who asked not to be named later allowed access into the facility. Inside, there were vacant beds for patients. The beds looked new, some still wrapped in polythene.\n\n\u201cThe problem we have is the lack of light as antivenom can\u2019t be stored for so long. The encouragement is not there for the community to patronise us. The antivenom is mostly brought in from UCH, Ibadan,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe official said for the facility to be functional, \u201cwe have to get power in the centre\u201d.\n\nAzeez Dansalam, community secretary of Sepeteri, told The Cable that efforts to get the facility running have been futile.\n\n\u201cWe have contributed over N20 million for the installation of solar-powered plants in the hospital,\u201d Dansalam, a former schoolmaster, said.\n\n\u201cMost times, when we rush our people to the hospital to get treated, they refer us to a private hospital. This is despite all our contributions. In the end, many consult herbalists for treatment.\u201d\n\n\u2018NIGERIA IMPORTS ANTIVENOM FROM UK, COSTA RICA\u2019\n\nAccording to Osagie Ehanire, minister of health, Nigeria ranks among the worst-affected nations in terms of snakebites, with an average of 20,000 cases recorded every year, including about 2,000 deaths.\n\nSpeaking on how Nigeria can improve snakebite treatment, Akindele Adeyi, a researcher in animal physiology and lecturer at the University of Ibadan, said although antivenom can be produced locally, there is a need to address the exportation of snakes since venom is the most important ingredient for producing antivenom.\n\n\u201cMost antivenoms are usually brought into Nigeria by the ministry of health. So, there are always issues of importation and a perennial problem of shortage of antivenom,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf antivenom is to be produced, then the snakes are to be milked \u2014 the process of extracting venom from snakes. This informs the exportation of the extracted venom to other countries where it can be processed. You would need to export Nigerian snakes to Costa Rica and the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cYou could also get antivenom in some big pharmacies in Nigeria but they are mostly produced using Indian snakes, which renders them ineffective for local use.\u201d\n\nPLANT TREATMENT ALTERNATIVE\n\nAdeyi also said research has been intensified on the use of plants to treat snakebites.\n\n\u201cOne of those plants is the one we have tested on six species of snakes in Nigeria and we found out that it works. We isolate enzymes from the venom and use components of the plant to inhibit those enzymes. We have injected the venom into rats, used the plant to treat them, and saw that they survived,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe antivenom is an immunoglobulin, and most antivenoms are usually in liquid form. To improve the lifespan of the antivenom and ensure it is not dependent on temperature to be viable, it has to be made into solid form.\u201d\n\nAdeyi, whose expertise is in venomics (the study of snakebites), has been invited \u2014 alongside a team of researchers \u2014 to develop a national policy for Nigeria on snakebite treatment and management.\n\n\u201cThe report has been submitted to the health ministry and subsequently to the national health council and the federal executive council. We don\u2019t know the level they are now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGovernment needs a lot of willpower to achieve that and the onus rests on the ministry to take charge of that.\u201d\n\nA vial of antivenom costs about N40,000, and a victim would need up to three, depending on the severity of the bite. Adeyi, however, said he hopes that when the proposal is approved, the cost would be subsidised so that poor people can afford it.\n\n\u2018IFA DOESN\u2019T ACCEPT MONEY FOR SNAKEBITE TREATMENT\u2019\n\nOkedoyin Alao is the Oluwo (diviner) of Sepeteri. He also serves as the deputy chief traditional healer of the community and has treated snakebite victims using herbs.\n\n\u201cSometimes, we ask for kola nuts only when the treated person returns cured. That is the way it was handed to us. Healing people is not a money-making enterprise. We seek to save lives first. If the person desires, he or she can show gratitude afterwards,\u201d Alao said.\n\nN24M ALLOCATED FOR SEPETERI SNAKEBITE CENTRE\n\nWhile the centre sits idle, according to the 2021 budget, a total of N24,295,265 was allocated for the \u201cconstruction and equipping of snakebite treatment centre in Sepeteri, Oyo state\u201d. This is an interesting development considering that the centre was constructed in 2014.\n\nHowever, efforts to determine if the funds for the centre were disbursed were unsuccessful as the open treasury portal (OTP) has been inaccessible for days.\n\nConfirming the issues with the portal on Wednesday, the federal government said the problem with the site would soon be resolved.\n\nMeanwhile, when contacted, Toye Akinrinola, UCH spokesman, claimed that the centre was \u201cnow fully functional\u201d.\n\nBut Azeez Dansalam, secretary of the community, countered the claim and said \u201cthere is no new development on the facility\u201d as of Wednesday afternoon.",

How many of these nations of the world are your friends?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMore than 90 percent of our income from the leftover of the oil that was stolen, we are using it to pay the interest of the money we have already borrowed and then, it is news. I am sure you listened to the news. We are borrowing more.\u201d\n\nRecently, figures have been churned out on the level of oil theft in the country.\n\nLast month, Tony Elumelu, chairman of the United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc, had claimed 95 per cent of oil production is lost to oil thieves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBusinesses are suffering. How can we be losing over 95% of oil production to thieves,\u201d he queried.\n\nIn another submission, Austin Avuru, former chief executive officer of Seplat Energy Plc, had also said 80 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s oil output in certain oilfields is lost to oil theft.\n\nCLAIM ONE: 80 PER CENT LOST TO OIL THEFT\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC), Nigeria loses more than 115,000 barrels per day (bpd) to oil theft and vandalism between January 2021 and February 2022, which amounts to $3.27 billion worth of crude oil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy implication, the country lost about 7.6 per cent of the current 1.5 million barrels of crude produced per day on average.\n\nFurthermore, if 80 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s crude oil is stolen as claimed by the cleric, that means we produce about 300,000 bpd, whereas regulators put the daily output at 1.5 million.\n\nThe NUPRC recently expressed worry over the \u201ccrude loss figures recently being quoted in the media by some operators, given actions taken so far on the issue.\u201d\n\nThe NUPRC had said it established a panel to audit the activities of operators in the upstream sector to ascertain the actual volume of oil lost to theft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTo ascertain the veracity of these claims, the Commission has activated all the necessary mechanisms to get to the root of the matter and establish the actual volume of crude stolen as against the volumes claimed,\u201d the commission had said.\n\nVERDICT\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe claim that the government has backed the assertion that 80 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s oil production is lost to oil theft is FALSE.\n\nBased on the regulator\u2019s record, only 7.6 percent of crude oil is lost to theft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCLAIM TWO: MORE THAN 90 PER CENT OF NIGERIA\u2019S REVENUE USED TO REPAY DEBT\n\nAccording to Adeboye, more than 90 per cent of Nigeria\u2019s oil revenue is being used to service the country\u2019s debt.\n\nIn 2020, out of the federal government\u2019s total revenue of N3.42 trillion, N3.34 trillion was used for debt servicing.\n\nBy implication, for every N100 earned as revenue, N97 was spent on debt servicing during the period under review.\n\nAccording to Zainab Ahmed, minister of finance, budget and national planning, the federal government spent N4.2 trillion on debt servicing between January and November 2021. The figure amounts to 76.2 per cent of the N5.51 trillion generated for the period.\n\nAlso, records from the budget office show that the total revenue inflow of the federal government stood at N3.49 trillion in the first three quarters of 2021, while N3.42 trillion was used to service debts. This means that debt service to revenue represented 97.9 per cent for the period under review.\n\nVERDICT\n\nThe claim that over 90 per cent of the federal government\u2019s revenue is used to repay debt is TRUE.",

          "title": "How much did African startups raise in 2021?",
          "text": "In 2021, African startups raised over $4 billion across 355 funding deals. Across Africa, this number is almost 3x times what was raised in 2020 and 2019, where the ecosystem recorded $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion respectively.\n\nWhile 2021\u2019s total tech funding in Africa is certainly the most impressive factor for the ecosystem, it\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Across Africa\u2019s 4 regions, many new firsts were achieved in 2021. It was the year $100 million single-round raises were normalised with 10 startups\u2014including unicorns Wave, OPay, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash\u2014raising $100 million and breaking the records. That\u2019s a significant increase from 2020, where no African startup raised $100 million in a single round, and a 400% total increase from the only 2 startups that raised such amounts pre-2021.\n\n2021 was also the year the number of unicorns increased, by 166%, from 3 unicorns to 8. Andela, Chipper Cash, Wave, OPay and Flutterwave joined Jumia, Fawry, and Interswitch on the global stage.\n\nThere are a few other markers of the maturity of Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem, including a derriere of veteran founders investing in early- and growth-stage startups on the continent. Flutterwave\u2019s Gbenga Agboola, for example, invested in Brass and PayDay, while dynamic duo, Eloho Omame and Odun Eweniyi banded together to form FirstCheck Africa, a venture that invests in \u201cridiculously early\u201d startups by female founders.\n\nAll of these key developments are explored in TechCabal\u2019s 2021 End-of-Year Report.\n\nFor the first time, TechCabal has released data that documents the state of Africa\u2019s ecosystem in the given year. The free-to-download report tracks the milestones Africa\u2019s tech industry recorded in 2021. In our report, we cover the following themes and topics:\n\nHow much did African startups raise in 2021, and how much did each of the regions raise?\n\nWhich tech sectors, including fintech, edtech, and agritech got the most funding in each of the regions, and how do these numbers compare to previous years?\n\n2021 also saw some of the biggest and most important mergers and acquisitions (M&As) across the continent, including Flutterwave\u2019s acquisition of Disha and MFS Africa\u2019s acquisition of Capricorn. These M&As are covered in the report.\n\nWith an influx of funds into the ecosystem, more VC firms and angel investors popped up last year. Who are they?\n\nWhat can we expect from early-stage startups given that over $250 million venture funds were launched by a host of Silicon Valley companies including Google?\n\nDownload the free report here and find out.\n\nNote: TechCabal Insights launched DealFlow, a funding tracker dashboard that tracks total VC funding for Africa startups in real-time. With the dashboard, the ecosystem does not have to wait for reports at the end of the year to get an accurate sense of what startup funding in Africa is like.\n\nA Sample of TechCabal\u2019s Funding Tracker Dashboard\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago. The 3 banks, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA) were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nStandard Bank Group Ltd was fined \u20a6200 million (~$481,000) for 2 accounts alleged to have been used for crypto transactions. Access Bank was fined \u20a6500 million (~$1.2 million) for failure to close customers\u2019 crypto accounts, according to a filing with the Nigerian Exchange Ltd; and United Bank for Africa (UBA) was fined \u20a6100 million (~$240,000) for digital currency transactions by a customer.\n\nNigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto restriction\n\nIn February 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria ordered all commercial banks and financial institutions to close all customer accounts that operate in or trade cryptocurrency. The apex bank referred to a 2017 circular that ordered commercial banks \u201cnot to use, hold, trade and/or transact in cryptocurrencies \u201c.\n\nLike most countries like China that have restricted crypto trading, CBN cited financial safety as the reason for the ban. In its circular clarifying its position, Osita Nwanisobi AG Director, Corporate Communications of CBN stated that most crypto users value anonymity, obscurement and concealment. \u201cIt is on the basis of this opacity that cryptocurrencies have become well-suited for conducting many illegal activities including money laundering, terrorism financing, purchase of small arms and light weapons, and tax evasion,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the CBN didn\u2019t ban cryptocurrencies in Nigeria as it\u2019d have to outlaw crypto exchanges and shut down the internet to achieve that. It did, however, cut the link between crypto exchanges and their users. So Nigerians can still buy and trade crypto, just not through any Nigerian bank or fintech.\n\nIn response to the restriction Nigerian crypto exchange platforms have responded with new ways to circumvent the restriction including introducing peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges for their cryptocurrency transactions, as well as trading stablecoins.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

          "text": "The shareholders of Zenith Bank Plc, Nigeria\u2019s leading lender, have approved a proposed final dividend of N97.33 billion for the financial year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nThe bank\u2019s shareholders gave their approval at the 31st annual general meeting (AGM) of the bank held on Wednesday in Lagos.\n\nThey expressed delight at the bumper final dividend payout of N2.80 per share which brings the total dividend for the 2021 financial year to N3.10 per share with a total value of N97.33 billion.\n\nThe chairman of Zenith Bank, Mr Jim Ovia, thanked the shareholders for their unflinching loyalty, which has enabled the bank to rise to the pinnacle of the nation\u2019s financial services industry, and assured them of the bank\u2019s commitment to consistently deliver superior value to them.\n\nSpeaking on the bank\u2019s performance, the group managing director/chief executive, Mr Ebenezer Onyeagwu, said, \u201cIf you look at the bank\u2019s history over the years, Zenith Bank has always grown, and even within the pandemic, we have maintained a reasonable positive growth trajectory.\n\n\u201cGrowth is coming from the fact that we are deploying our digital capability to grow more businesses, simplify our service processes, make our processes more efficient, and deal with customers\u2019 complaints.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cApart from developing new products, we are discovering new business verticals, especially within the retail segment, which have significant revenue.\u201d\n\nHe also said that, \u201cMeeting the expectation of shareholders means we have to work harder. The team is dodged, hardworking, resilient, and above all, we have a very supportive board that comes with superior guidance.\u201d\n\nOn the dividend payout, the founder of the Independent Shareholders Association of Nigeria (ISAN), Sir Sunny Nwosu, expressed the delight of shareholders over the consistent payment of dividends by Zenith Bank, noting that the bank\u2019s shares remain the toast of investors because the bank has never failed to pay dividends to shareholders.\n\nAlso, the president of the Association of the Rights of Nigerian Shareholders (AARNS), Dr Faruk Umar, said, \u201cThe bank is doing very well. All the ratios and indices have gone up. And more importantly, while we were in the meeting, I got my alert of the credit of my dividend. This is very commendable.\u201d\n\nIn spite of a challenging macroeconomic environment aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Zenith Bank Group achieved year-on-year (YoY) growth in gross earnings of 10 per cent from N696.5 billion reported in the previous year to N765.6 billion. This was on the back of a 23 per cent YoY growth in non-interest income from N251.7 billion to N309 billion and a two per cent YoY growth in interest income from N420.8 billion to N427.6 billion.\n\nProfit before tax also grew by 10 per cent, from N255.9 billion to N280.4 billion in the current year. The increase was due to growth in the top-line and very strong management of the treasury portfolio that increased efficiency, resulting in a drop in interest expense by 12 per cent from N121.1 billion in 2020 to N106.8 billion in the current year. This further led to a seven per cent increase in net interest income of N320.8 billion in 2021 from N299.7 billion in 2020.\n\nCustomer deposits increased by 21 per cent, growing from N5.34 trillion in the previous year to N6.47 trillion in the current year. The growth in customer deposits came from both corporate and retail customers. Retail deposits grew by N146 billion from N1.72 trillion in 2020 to N1.87 trillion in 2021.\n\nThe group\u2019s continuous drive for retail deposits combined with the strategic rebalancing of its funding base helped to reduce the cost of funding from 2.1 per cent to 1.5 per cent in the current year. Although operating expenses grew by 13 per cent YoY, growth remains below the inflation rate, and the Group improved its Earnings per Share (EPS) which grew by six per cent from N7.34 to N7.78.\n\nTotal assets increased by 11 per cent, growing from N8.48 trillion in 2020 to N9.45 trillion in 2021, mainly driven by growth in customer deposits.

          "text": "\u201cGood afternoon, how are you doing? I\u2019m so sorry for keeping you waiting; I was busy with other pressing issues in my office,\u201d Ms Lamptey tells me with a large smile.\n\nWell, I smiled back and quickly introduced myself and team members. That was the time they newly moved back to the UN House from WAEC building, I recall.\n\nAt the meeting, we talked about women\u2019s involvement in peace processes, gender equality and other things surrounding the women\u2019s cause. She proudly emphasised the works they were doing for women and girls, especially in the Northeast, illustrating with a map on the wall of her office.\n\nTime later revealed Ms Lamptey as a trail blazer, a lady that is loved across board, emotionally intelligent and with passion for her work. Highly cerebral, smart, unassuming, results-oriented, easy-going, a true and thorough professional who knows the UN system well.\n\nI recall an uproar and harsh criticisms from some quarters concerning a decision made by her office last year; how she gracefully handled the issue without any kind of drama is highly commendable. I envy her comportment which can only be as a result of years of experience, personal training and personae \u2013 the calmness that could be likened to a duck working under the water yet looking so relaxed on the surface.\n\nOne of the remarkable things is her effort and ability to support small and active NGOs. She gives a listening ear and intentionally makes herself available to advise whenever she has the chance. Unlike what we have experienced in the past, she has given a lot of small NGOs that confidence and reassurance while working closely with more established and big NGOs. She helps smaller NGOs to thrive and supports with as little as IEM materials. You can only leave her with a smile; even a \u2018No\u2019 will be said in the most reassuring way.\n\nLamptey is politically correct and committed to the Nigerian women\u2019s cause.\n\nThere is a high level of unity amongst the womenfolk working in the frontline of the gender cause in Nigeria, thanks to her efforts and willingness to make it a possibility. Not leaving anyone behind, her networking game is top-notch, influencing policies and bills nationally. She played a big role in the passage of the Violence Against Persons Prohibition (VAPP) Bill that was signed into law by many governors in Nigeria.\n\nMs Lamptey was at the forefront of advocacy against Gender-based Violence; she was very active during the lockdown when GBV was rife. Young women in politics get more recognition, acceptance and support through the great works from her office. She\u2019s an ardent team player who believes so much in the younger generation.\n\nShe is an all-inclusive woman, who carries along women with disabilities. More women from the PWDs community have benefitted greatly on her watch, as she ensures they are empowered.\n\nThe UN Women Match-Women Shadowing Scheme exclusively set up to mentor young women leaders was very successful and I have seen beneficiaries of that initiative doing well for themselves.\n\nComfort Lamptey is the one you can proudly call \u2018Mama for the girls.\u2019\n\nThank you for loving Nigerians and your commitment to Nigerian women and girls.\n\nThank you for the genuine sisterhood and professionalism. Thank you for embracing sports advocacy for development. Thank you for agreeing to serve as assistant referee in commemoration of women\u2019s day in 2019; you look cute in those referee kits, sis!\n\nThanks for loving women with disabilities genuinely.\n\nThank you for supporting and believing in me and FAME Foundation; thank you for giving us a chance.\n\nIt\u2019s only time that will tell if she is replaceable or not. Ms Comfort, our charming and delectable sister from Ghana, you shall be greatly missed.\n\nYour impactful legacy will continue to yield good results because they are sustainable, rest assured.\n\nNigerian women and girls will miss you. I will miss your infectious smile!\n\nFare thee well and thrive, Comfort Lamptey. Best wishes in your future endeavours.",

This will enable you to determine if a conversation is safe or unsafe.\n\nTier 1: Small Talk\n\nMovies, sports, the weather, food, pop culture and music are all usually safe topics anywhere and with anybody. Learn about these topics so that at any given time you can hold a good conversation on any of them.\n\nTier 2: Controversial Topics\n\nReligion, sex and politics are all very controversial topics. People tend to have strong and very different opinions about these topics, so they are to be approached very carefully, if at all.\n\nNever assume someone holds the same views as you do on any of these particular topics, even if you share other things in common.\n\nTier3: Personal Information\n\nFinancial matters, personal health, and family are very personal matters that people only share with people close to them, and the person these matters are shared with must show discretion and tact by treating these matters as such.\n\nWith these topics, it is best not to ask probing questions about others or offer too much information about your own circumstances.\n\nRemember, these topics are best reserved for private discussion with those you trust to respect your personal information.\n\nConversation Killers\n\n\u00b7 Why aren\u2019t you getting married or having kids?\n\n\u00b7 You look pale, are you ill?\n\n\u00b7 You have bags under your eyes, are you not able to sleep?\n\n\u00b7 When are you getting married?\n\n\u00b7 When are you due?\n\n\u00b7 You look great, have you lost weight?\n\n\u00b7 How much is your salary?",

Studies have also shown that girls are less likely to return to school after a period of absence, especially girls in conflict affected regions.\n\n\u201cEven though the wave of the pandemic has reduced, and government have relaxed the restrictions, an assessment conducted by Jose Foundation\n\nUK programme team in the Northeast shows poor or non-adherence to basic COVID-19 prevention measures especially within public schools.\n\n\u201cIt is on this premise that the Foundation has not relented in its efforts to ensure that children, especially girls in Northeast Nigeria are supported with the necessary COVID-19 awareness and prevention and basic Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) sensitization to ensure that they stay safe and protected within their learning environment.\u201d\n\nThe foundation further stated that the sensitisation campaign seeks to address the poor prevention practices observed across some Government\n\nschools in conflict affected North-eastern States of Borno and Yobe as regards to COVID-19 prevention and general Water, Sanitation and Hygiene practices.\n\nRecall that the organisation had earlier conducted the COVID-19 sensitisation in Government Girls Secondary School, Damaturu, Yobe\n\nState.\n\nThe students were sensitised on the symptoms of COVID-19 and the prevention measures to observe within and outside their learning\n\nenvironment. The facilitator also trained the school girls on handwashing and safe use of latrines in their schools to prevent transmission of infections.\n\nJose Foundation UK team led by Ms Joy Otuonye donated facemasks, washing soaps, disinfectants and other PPEs to the school girls as\n\nwell as to the school management.\n\nThe foundation hoped that through this sensitisation and distribution of these items to students and the school, the students and their\n\nteachers will be able to improve on their personal protection and hygiene.\n\nIn appreciation of the support to the school, headmistress, Muhammadu Buhari Academy, Maiduguri, Hajia Amina Mustapha Haruna, appreciated\n\nthe leadership of Jose Foundation UK for selecting the school for the campaign.\n\nShe noted that the sensitisation was lifesaving and critical for the safety of the children and also noted that the items will also be used\n\nto strengthen the WASH practices in the school.\n\nJose Foundation UK said it will continue to prioritise the campaign as well as support school systems especially in conflict affected\n\nNortheast with WASH facilities to further improve access to safe and hygienic facilities.",

She did all the scans and tests required of her and everything was perfect,\u201d Mr Mchaty, an IT consultant, wrote.\n\n\u201cOn Sunday noon, 28th March she chatted me that water had dropped off her leg so she called the hospital to inform them.\n\n\u201cThey asked her to come over to the hospital. On getting there, they induce her to speed up labour.\n\nThe IT consultant said that after 10 hours of labour, his sister called him that his wife was weak and the doctor wanted to carry out a caesarean section on her.\n\nHe said he consented and around 2 a.m. they called him that she needed a blood transfusion.\n\n\u201cMind you, I was in Enugu while all this was happening.\u201d\n\nMr Mchaty said the hospital had no blood bank or ambulance in case of emergencies.\n\n\u201cSo I started looking for an Uber to take my sister to General Hospital, Isolo, to go get blood at midnight,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI succeeded in getting about five pints of blood. Around 3 a.m., they called me saying that they wanted to cut off her womb and that she was bleeding. I was shocked because this is her first child and she is 28 yrs old.\u201d\n\nMr Mchaty said that he again received a call from the hospital that they needed more blood. So, around 3:30 a.m., his sister again went on a blood search.\n\nHe said that by morning he called the hospital to speak with his wife but he was asked to wait for 20 minutes for her to be dressed and taken to the ward.\n\nUnrelenting, he said he called his sister, who told him that the consultant who carried out the operation was called back to open her again because of complications.\n\nHe said his 28-year-old wife died, but the baby survived.\n\n\u201cI rushed down to Enugu Airport and boarded a flight down to Lagos, (on) getting to the hospital, I found my wife\u2019s lifeless body in one old-looking operation room,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI was so heartbroken, they gave me an exorbitant bill to pay before I could carry her dead body, over 500k.\n\n\u201cRight now, I took my son to another hospital. He is in the ICU now. We are doing different kinds of scans, tests, Xray and co. He is using oxygen at the moment.\n\n\u201cThe bills are excess, I am just hoping he can survive.\n\n\u201cI need justice for my wife @followlasg @PoliceNG_lagos @FMHDSD.\u201d",

          "text": "Eleven months after, the federal government Wednesday lifted the nationwide midnight curfew earlier imposed to contain the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSimilarly, restrictions on parties, concerts, other large gatherings and related activities were also lifted.\n\nPresidential Steering Committee (PSC) on COVID-19 announced this in a statement in Abuja.\n\nThe message was titled \u201cImplementation Guidelines for Easing COVID-19 Restrictions.\u201d\n\nThe nationwide ban on social gathering and imposition of curfew were announced May 10, 2022.\n\nUnder the arrangement, a nationwide curfew was, among other measures, imposed from 12.00am- 4.00am to arrest further spread of the virus.\n\nDecisions revised\n\nAnnouncing the lifting of the ban, the PSC said the social restriction recommendations were revised in line with the three established thematic areas of movement, industry and labour, as well as community activities.\n\nThe PSC also said the decision followed the reduced risk of importation of new variants, availability of vaccines and the increasing number of people vaccinated in Nigeria and globally.\n\nA Tuesday update provided by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), showed 3,142 persons had so far been killed by the virus, while 255, 516 infections were recorded.\n\nThe new order\n\nIn the new guidelines, the government urged everyone to comply with existing safety protocols such as the use of face masks, regular hand washing and social distancing to limit spread of the virus.\n\nThe PSC said: \u201cPatients with underlying ailments are advised to uphold the use of universal precaution which includes the use of face masks, avoid crowds, and frequent use of hand sanitizers.\u201d\n\nThe government also said the safety protocols provided a baseline from which state governments could further build to strengthen their responses based on their local circumstances.\n\nIn the new guidelines, the states were advised to \u201ccontinue to consider them as the minimum guidelines required to ensure an acceptable level of epidemic control nationwide.\u201d\n\nThe fresh guidelines also allowed unlimited air travels \u2013 both domestic and international flights.\n\nThe government urged both international and domestic travellers to abide by all existing protocols, including the use of face masks while onboard and taking personal precaution measures; and all arriving international passengers must register on the Nigeria International Travel Portal.\n\nIt said: \u201cNo limitations on inter or intra-state travel; all vendors and service providers must abide by stated stipulations from the Federal Ministry of Transportation; all passengers and commuters must wear face masks once on board, as well as continue to observe personal precautionary measures.\u201d\n\nRising infectious diseases\n\nMeanwhile, following the emergence and rapid spread of coronavirus, yellow fever, Ebola, and Lassa fever among other infectious diseases, medical experts have advocated improved adult vaccination campaigns in Nigeria.\n\nThis is as they scored childhood vaccination efforts fair, calling on relevant authorities to invest more in vaccinations as tested means of mitigating what they described as the dangerous impacts of infectious diseases globally.\n\nThese experts, including a professor and consultant physician at the Lagos State University College of Medicine (LASUCOM) Ikeja, Olufunke Adeyeye, and the chief consultant and head of geriatrics unit at the National Hospital, Abuja, Ogugua Osi-Ogbu, among others, gave the advice at an adult vaccination media roundtable which was recently organised by an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation and vaccine makers, Pfizer Incorporation.\n\nThey said substantial improvements in adult vaccination are needed to reduce the health consequences of vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\nImportance of vaccines\n\nRelevant statistics have shown that childhood vaccines save an estimated between two and three million lives worldwide every year. However, some 20 million children are estimated to miss out on life-saving vaccines annually, and that these children are mostly found in Africa.\n\nTherefore, child inoculation is perceived to be a top priority as vaccines are found to be the most cost-effective approach for reducing childhood disease burden.\n\nBut while adults have less chance of getting infection, the emergence and rapid spread of such infectious diseases such as Lassa fever, COVID-19, among others, have shown that the adult population now has increased risks of getting communicable diseases owing to urbanisation, globalisation, and increasing international travel.\n\nThe experts, who emphasised the importance of adult vaccination as well as the challenges and gaps identified in it, noted that adults have a decreased immunological response when they are exposed to infections.\n\nExperts speak\n\nSpeaking at the virtual media roundtable, Mrs Adeyeye said: \u201cA systematic review of infections in individuals older than 65 years found that coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were all associated with a significantly higher risk of acquiring pneumococcal infections.\u201d\n\nShe added that immunisation in Nigeria, so far, has been primarily directed towards infants and children, but that \u201cvaccination is as important for adults as it is for children\u201d.\n\nOn her part, Mrs Osi-Ogbu, said: \u201cPneumococcal disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults. Many high-income countries recommend pneumococcal vaccination in older adults but, even where policies are in place, coverage is often low. Very few low and/or mid-income countries currently provide pneumococcal vaccination to older adults as a part of a routine programme.\u201d\n\nThe experts described vaccine preventable diseases as infectious diseases caused by viruses or bacteria that can be prevented with vaccines.\n\n\u201cVaccines are not just for kids; adults need vaccines too. Even if fully vaccinated as a child, adults may be at risk for other diseases due to age, job, lifestyle, travel, or a health condition.\n\n\u201cVaccines don\u2019t just protect you; they protect those around you, too. Vaccines protect individuals against specific diseases, but they also help those who have not had the vaccine by creating \u201cherd immunity\u201d. This protects people vulnerable to the disease, such as babies too young to be vaccinated, people undergoing chemotherapy, the elderly, and people who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons,\u201d added the chief consultant.\n\nImmunisation access key \u2013 Pfizer Director\n\nIn a related development, the medical director for sub-Saharan Africa of Pfizer Incorporation, Kodjo Soroh, has said the company has a long history in vaccine research and development.\n\nHe said through the development of innovative delivery systems and technologies, Pfizer had created scalable solutions that address prevention of deadly bacterial infections.\n\n\u201cThe key to maintaining and building on these advances is constant vigilance and continued access to immunisations is essential to preserving the progress we\u2019ve made against vaccine-preventable conditions and strengthening our ability to address emerging health threats,\u201d Soroh said.\n\nHe added that the company applies science and her global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.\n\n\u201cWe strive to set the standard for quality, safety, and value in the discovery, development, and manufacture of health care products, including innovative medicines and vaccines. Every day, Pfizer colleagues work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments, and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time,\u201d he added.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday said he will await the final outcome of the constitutional review process before presenting the report of the review of the vertical revenue allocation formula to the National Assembly as a Bill for enactment.\n\nThe President made the comment in Abuja while receiving the report by the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC), led by Engr. Elias Mbam\n\n\u2018\u2018Ordinarily, I would have gone ahead to table this report before the National Assembly as a Bill for enactment,\u201d the President said, as quoted in a statement signed by spokesperson Femi Adesina.\n\n\u2018\u2018However, since the review of the vertical revenue allocation formula is a function of the roles and responsibilities of the different tiers of government, I will await the final outcome of the constitutional review process, especially as some of the proposed amendments would have a bearing on the recommendations contained herein.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Buhari Redeploys Mohammed Abdullahi As Minister Of Environment\n\nPresident Buhari listed some of the recommendations in the report as follows: \u2018\u2018Establishing local government as a tier of government and the associated abrogation of the state/local government account; moving airports; fingerprints, identification and criminal records from the exclusive legislative list to the concurrent legislative list, empowering the RMAFC to enforce compliance with remittance of accruals into and disbursement of revenue from the Federation Account as well as streamlining the procedure for reviewing the revenue allocation formula.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe President assured members of the Commission that the Federal Government would immediately subject the report to its internal review and approval processes, while awaiting finalization of the efforts by the National Assembly.\n\nAccording to the President this strategy, rather than issuing an Executive Modification order, as was done in 1992, is more in line with entrenching our democratic tenets.\n\nHe commended the RMAFC for a job painstakingly done, pledging his unwavering commitment and support to them in carrying out their constitutional mandates.\n\nThe President also thanked Nigerians, especially the State and Local Governments, for making their inputs through the broad stake-holder engagement processes that produced the report.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am aware that the present revenue allocation formula has not been reviewed since the last exercise carried out in 1992,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018Considering the changing dynamics of our political-economy, such as Privatisation, Deregulation, funding arrangement of Primary Education, Primary Health Care and the growing clamour for decentralisation among others; it is necessary that we take another look at our Revenue Sharing Formula, especially the vertical aspects that relate to the tiers of government.\n\n\u2018\u2018This becomes more compelling as we need to reduce our infrastructural deficit, make more resources available for tackling insecurity, confront climate change and its associated global warming and make life more meaningful for our rapid growing population.\u2019\u2019\n\nPresident Buhari said as an advocate for grassroots development, he has always remained committed to ensuring that all tiers of Government are treated fairly, equally and justly in the sharing of national resources.\n\n\u2018\u2018I want to let you all know that I have keenly followed most of the discussions held in the geo-political consultative process and one thing that struck me clearly was the agreement that a review of our vertical revenue formula cannot and should not be an emotional or sentimental discussion and it cannot be done arbitrarily.\n\n\u2018\u2018All over the world, revenue and resource allocation have always been a function of the level of responsibilities attached to the different components or tiers of government.\n\n\u2018\u2018I am, therefore, happy to note that the discussions were held along these lines and rested squarely on roles and responsibilities as spelt out in the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\n\n\u2018\u2018However, I also note that in reaching the final decisions at most of these engagements, not much emphasis was placed on the fact that the Second Schedule of the Nigerian constitution contains Sixty Eight (68) items on the Exclusive Legislative List and the remaining Thirty (30) items on the Concurrent List requiring both the Federal and State Government to address\u2019\u2019.\n\nPresident Buhari, therefore, declared that for the nation to have a lasting review of the present revenue allocation formula, there must first be an agreement on the responsibilities to be carried out by all the tiers of Government.\n\nIn particular, he noted that the proposal seeks a 3.33% reduction in the current Federal Government allocation and on the other hand an increase of 3.07% and .44% for the States and Local Governments on the other hand.\n\nHe added that with regards to the Special Funds, the report by the RMAFC proposed an increase of .2% for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and a decrease of .38% for Development of Natural Resources.\n\nThe President recounted that the Federal Government also made its input into the process of reviewing the vertical revenue allocation formula based on existing constitutional provisions for roles and responsibilities for the different tiers of government.\n\n\u2018\u2018We must note the increasing visibility in Sub-national level responsibilities due to weaknesses at that level, for example: Primary Health Care; Basic Primary Education; Levels of insecurity, and; Increased remittances to State and Local Governments through the Value Added Tax sharing formula, where the Federal Government has only 15% and the States and Local Government share 50% and 35% respectively,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nIn his remarks, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, said the RMAFC followed due process in undertaking the exercise, and sought the opinion of the Federal Government before finalizing the report.\n\nGiving a synopsis of the report, Mustapha said that it was in four volumes, including a summary in the main report.\n\n\u2018\u2018Volume 1 contains the various memoranda submitted by the Federal and State Governments as well as the FCT. Volume 2 details the presentation from the academia, civil society, professional bodies, traditional rulers, individuals, as well as women and youth council.\n\n\u2018\u2018To complete the inclusiveness of the stakeholder participatory processes adopted, Volume 3 is a research that captures the body of knowledge that supported the review while Volume 4 is a further distillation of submissions by the State and Local Governments as well as NGOs and Area Councils of the FCT,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nAlso speaking, Mbam said the leading philosophy behind the proposed review was guided \u2018\u2018by the need for distributive justice, equity and fairness as enshrined in relevant Sections of the 1999 Constitution (as amended).\u2019\u2019\n\nHe added that the principles took into cognizance the indivisibility of the country, public opinion and weighted Constitutional responsibilities and functions of the three levels of Government.\n\nHe announced that the proposed vertical revenue allocation formula advised 45.17 per cent for the Federal Government, 29.79 per cent for State Governments and 21.04 per cent for the Local Governments.\n\nUnder Special Funds, he said, the Report by the Commission recommended 1.0 per cent for Ecology, 0.5 per cent for Stabilisation, 1.3 per cent for Development of Natural Resources and 1.2 per cent for the FCT.\n\nIn arriving at the new vertical revenue allocation formula, Mbam told the President the commission had wide consultation with major stakeholders, public hearing in all the geo-political zones, administered questionnaires and studied some other Federations with similar fiscal arrangements like Nigeria to draw useful lessons from their experiences.\n\nAccording to the RMAFC chairman, the Commission also visited all the 36 States and the FCT, the 774 Local Government Areas to sensitize and obtain inputs from stakeholders.\n\nHe added that literature reviews were conducted on revenue allocation formula in Nigeria dating back to pre-independence period while the Commission received memoranda from the public sectors, individuals and private institutions across the country.\n\nExplaining the major reasons for the exercise, Mbam noted that since the last review was conducted in 1992, 29 years ago, the political structure of the country has changed with the creation of six additional States in 1996, which brought the number of States to 36.\n\nCorrespondingly, he said, the number of local governments councils also increased from 589 to 774.\n\n\u2018\u2018There have been considerable changes arising from the policy reforms that altered the relative share of responsibilities of the various tiers of Government such as deregulation, privatization and the lingering controversies over funding of primary education, primary healthcare,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe RMAFC chairman noted that while Section 32(b), Part 1 of Third Schedule of the 1999 Constitution 9 (as amended) empowers the Commission to review from time to time the revenue allocation formulae; the inadequate and decaying infrastructure, as well as heightened widespread internal security challenges across the country also necessitated the exercise, among others.",

It subsequently announced that it was withdrawing from its involvement in all Russian hydrocarbons.\n\nThe company said it would no longer purchase Russian crude oil and would shut its service stations, aviation fuels and lubricants operations in Russia. The company had already vowed to exit its joint ventures with Russian gas giant Gazprom and its related entities.\n\nIn Thursday\u2019s update, Shell also said its cashflow is expected to be hit by \u201cvery significant working capital outflows as price increases impacting inventory have led to a cash outflow of around $7 billion.\u201d\n\nDivestment \u2018outweighs reputational damage\u2019\n\nShell\u2019s share price fell 1.8% in early trade, along with that of fellow oil giant BP.\n\n\u201cDespite the eye watering costs, the share price should continue to stay reasonably resilient given the divestment far outweighs the reputational damage which could be caused had it not pulled out,\u201d said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at British digital stockbroker AJ Bell, said the modest fall for Shell \u201creflects the fact that the company is also pointing to a big benefit from surging energy prices.\u201d\n\nHe added that BP\u2019s fall came \u201clikely on a read-across as investors looked at what it might imply for its much larger Russian footprint.\u201d\n\nShortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, BP announced that it would offload its 19.75% stake in Russian state-controlled oil company Rosneft, after 30 years of operations in the country.\n\nWestern oil companies have faced pressure from shareholders and governments to sever ties with Russia, but TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne told CNBC in late March that the French company would not write off its assets in Russia as it would effectively mean giving them to Putin \u201cfor free.\u201d",

          "text": "A Turkish court ruled Thursday to suspend the trial in absentia of 26 Saudis accused in the gruesome killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and for the case to be transferred to Saudi Arabia.\n\nKaghoggi, a United States resident who wrote critically about Saudi Crown Prince Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed on Oct. 2, 2018, at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. He had gone into the consulate for an appointment to collect documents required for him to marry his Turkish fiancee, Hatice Cengiz. He never emerged from the building.\n\nTurkish officials alleged that Khashoggi was killed and then dismembered with a bone saw inside the consulate by a team of Saudi agents sent to Istanbul. The group included a forensic doctor, intelligence and security officers and individuals who worked for the crown prince\u2019s office. His remains have not been found.\n\nThe Istanbul court\u2019s decision comes despite warnings from human rights groups that turning the case over to the kingdom would lead to a cover up of the killing, which has cast suspicion on the crown prince.\n\nIt also comes as Turkey, which is in the throes of a deep economic downturn, has been trying to repair its troubled relationship with Saudi Arabia and an array of other countries in its region. Some media reports have claimed that Riyadh has made improved relations conditional on Turkey dropping the case , which had inflamed tensions between two countries.\n\nThe move would pave the way to a resolution of disputes between the two regional heavyweights since the 2011 Arab Spring, including Turkey\u2019s support for Islamist movements like the Muslim Brotherhood, which Riyadh considers a terrorist group. Turkey also sided with Qatar in a diplomatic dispute that saw Doha boycotted by Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nLast week, the prosecutor in the case recommended that it be transferred to the kingdom, arguing that the trial in Turkey would remain inconclusive. Turkey\u2019s justice minister supported the recommendation, adding that the trial in Turkey would resume if the Turkish court is not satisfied with the outcome of proceedings in the kingdom. It was not clear , however, if Saudi Arabia, which has already put some of the defendants on trial behind closed doors, would open a new trial.\n\nThe court ruled to halt the trial in line with the Justice Ministry\u2019s \u201cpositive opinion,\u201d the private DHA news agency reported.\n\nHuman rights advocates had urged Turkey not to transfer the case to Saudi Arabia, arguing that justice for Khashoggi would not be delivered by Saudi courts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a scandalous decision,\u201d said Emma Sinclair-Webb, the Turkey director for the New York-based Human Rights Watch, asserting that the court had \u201crubber stamped\u201d a political decision that would allow the government to repair its ties with Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cIn the interest of realpolitik, Turkey is ready to sacrifice justice for an egregious crime on its own soil,\u201d she told The Associated Press. \u201c(The decision) opens the way for other countries to commit assassinations on Turkish territory and get away with it.\u201d\n\nCengiz, Khashoggi\u2019s fiancee, said she would continue to seek justice.\n\n\u201cWe will continue this (judicial) process with all the power given to me, as a Turkish citizen,\u201d she told reporters outside the courthouse.\n\n\u201cThe two countries may be making an agreement, the two countries may be opening a new chapter \u2026 but the crime is still the same crime,\u201d she said. \u201cThe people who committed the crime haven\u2019t changed. Governments and states must have a principled stance.\u201d\n\nAt the time of the crime, Turkey apparently had the Saudi Consulate bugged and shared audio of the killing with the CIA, among others.\n\nThe slaying sparked international outrage and condemnation. Western intelligence agencies, as well as the U.S. Congress, have said that an operation of such magnitude could not have happened without knowledge of the prince.\n\nTurkey, which had vowed to shed light on the brutal killing, began prosecuting the defendants in absentia in 2020 after Saudi Arabia rejected requests for their extradition. The defendants included two former aides of the prince.\n\nSome of the men were put on trial in Riyadh behind closed doors. A Saudi court issued a final verdict in 2020 that sentenced five mid-level officials and operatives to 20-year jail terms. The court had originally ordered the death penalty, but reduced the punishment after Khashoggi\u2019s son Salah, who lives in Saudi Arabia, announced that he forgave the defendants. Three others were sentenced to lesser jail terms.",

          "text": "Ukraine told residents of its industrial heartland to leave while they still can and urged Western nations to send \u201cweapons, weapons, weapons\u201d Thursday after Russian forces withdrew from the shattered outskirts of Kyiv to regroup for an offensive in the country\u2019s east.\n\nRussia\u2019s six-week-old invasion failed to take Ukraine\u2019s capital quickly and achieve what Western countries say was President Vladimir Putin\u2019s initial aim to oust the Ukrainian government. Russia\u2019s focus is now on the Donbas, a mostly Russian-speaking region in eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn Brussels, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged NATO to provide more weapons for his war-torn country to help prevent further atrocities like those reported in Kyiv\u2019s northern suburbs. Ukrainian authorities are working to identify hundreds of bodies they say were found in Bucha and other towns after Russian troops withdrew and to document what they say were war crimes.\n\n\u201cMy agenda is very simple\u2026 it\u2019s weapons, weapons and weapons,\u201d Kuleba said as he arrived at NATO headquarters for talks with the military organization\u2019s foreign ministers about Ukraine\u2019s fight to defend itself.\n\n\u201cThe more weapons we get and the sooner they arrive in Ukraine, the more human lives will be saved,\u201d he said.\n\nSome NATO nations worry they may be Russia\u2019s next target, but the alliance is striving to avoid actions that might pull any of its 30 members directly into the war. Still, he NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg urged member nations to send Ukraine more weapons, and not just defensive arms.\n\n\u201cUkraine is fighting a defensive war, so this distinction between offensive and defensive weapons doesn\u2019t actually have any real meaning,\u201d he said.\n\nWestern countries have provided Ukraine with portable anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons, but they have been reluctant to supply aircraft or tanks plus any equipment that Ukrainian troops would have to be trained to use.\n\nAsked what more his country was seeking, Kuleba listed planes, land-based missiles, armored vehicles and air defense systems.\n\nA U.S. defense official speaking on condition of anonymity said Russia had pulled all of its estimated 24,000 or more troops from the Kyiv and Chernihiv areas in the north, sending them into Belarus or Russia to resupply, reorganize and likely prepare to return to fight in the east.\n\nGrowing numbers of Putin\u2019s troops, along with mercenaries, have been reported moving into the Donbas, where Russia-backed separatists have fought Ukrainian forces for eight years and control two areas.\n\nAhead of its Feb. 24 invasion, Moscow recognized the Luhansk and Donetsk areas as independent states. Military analysts have said Putin also could be seeking to expand into government-controlled parts of the Donbas.\n\nDonetsk Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said at least five civilians were killed and another eight were wounded by Russian shelling on Wednesday. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk urged civilians to evacuate to safer regions before it was too late.\n\n\u201cLater, people will come under fire, and we won\u2019t be able to do anything to help them,\u201d Vereshchuk said.\n\nAnother Western official, also speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence estimates, said it may take Russia\u2019s battle-damaged forces as much as a month to regroup for a major push on eastern Ukraine.\n\nOleksandr Shputun, spokesman for the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, reported Thursday that near Donbas, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, Kharkiv, remained blockaded. He said Russian forces also were carrying out \u201cbrutal measures\u201d in the southern Kherson region, which they hold.\n\nIn his nightly address to the nation late Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Ukraine, too, was preparing for battle.\n\n\u201cWe will fight and we will not retreat,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will seek all possible options to defend ourselves until Russia begins to seriously seek peace. This is our land. This is our future. And we won\u2019t give them up.\u201d\n\nIn areas north of the capital, Ukrainian officials gathered evidence of Russian atrocities amid signs Moscow\u2019s troops killed people indiscriminately before retreating.\n\nUkrainian authorities said the bodies of least 410 civilians were found in towns around Kyiv, victims of what Zelenskyy has portrayed as a Russian campaign of murder, rape, dismemberment and torture. Some victims had apparently been shot at close range. Some were found with their hands bound.\n\nWestern officials warned that similar atrocities were likely to have taken place in other areas occupied by Russian troops. Zelenskyy accused Russian forces of trying to cover up war crimes in areas still under their control, \u201cafraid that the global anger over what was seen in Bucha would be repeated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have information that the Russian troops have changed tactics and are trying to remove the dead people, the dead Ukrainians, from the streets and cellars of territory they occupied,\u201d he said in a nighttime video address. \u201cThis is only an attempt to hide the evidence and nothing more.\u201d\n\nSwitching from speaking Ukrainian to Russian, Zelenskyy urged ordinary Russians \u201cto somehow confront the Russian repressive machine\u201d instead of being \u201cequated with the Nazis for the rest of your life.\u201d\n\nHe called on Russians to demand an end to the war, \u201cif you have even a little shame about what the Russian military is doing in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nIn reaction to the alleged atrocities outside Kyiv, the U.S. announced sanctions against Putin\u2019s two adult daughters and said it is toughening penalties against Russian banks. Britain banned investment in Russia and pledged to end its dependence on Russian coal and oil by the end of the year.\n\nThe U.S. Senate planned to take up legislation Thursday to end normal trade relations with Russia, paving the way for higher tariffs on some imports, and to codify President Joe Biden\u2019s executive action banning imports of Russian oil.\n\nThe European Union is also expected to take additional punitive measures, including an embargo on coal.\n\nThe Kremlin has insisted its troops have committed no war crimes and alleged the images out of Bucha were staged by the Ukrainians.\n\nBodies were still being collected in the city. On Wednesday, The Associated Press saw two in a house in a silent neighborhood. From time to time, the muffled boom of workers clearing the town of mines and other unexploded ordnance interrupted the silence.\n\nWorkers at a cemetery began to load more than 60 bodies into a grocery shipping truck for transport to a facility for further investigation.\n\nPolice said they found at least 20 bodies in the Makariv area west of Kyiv. In the village of Andriivka, residents said the Russians arrived in early March, taking locals\u2019 phones and detaining and then releasing some people. Others met unknown fates. Some described sheltering for weeks in cellars normally used for storing vegetables.\n\n\u201cFirst we were scared, now we are hysterical,\u201d said Valentyna Klymenko, 64. She said she, her husband and two neighbors weathered the siege by sleeping on stacks of potatoes covered with a mattress and blankets. \u201cWe didn\u2019t cry at first. Now we are crying.\u201d\n\nIn the southern port city of Mariupol, Mayor Vadym Boichenko said that of the more than 5,000 civilians killed during weeks of Russian bombardment and street fighting, 210 were children. Russian forces bombed hospitals, including one where 50 people burned to death, he said.\n\nBoichenko said more than 90% of the city\u2019s infrastructure was destroyed. The attacks on the strategic city on the Sea of Azov have cut off food, water, fuel and medicine and pulverized homes and businesses.\n\nBritish defense officials said 160,000 people remained trapped in the city, which had a prewar population of 430,000. A humanitarian relief convoy accompanied by the Red Cross has tried to get into the city for days, without success.\n\nCapturing Mariupol would allow Russia to secure a continuous land corridor to the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nAP",
