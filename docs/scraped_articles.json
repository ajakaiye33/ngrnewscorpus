          "title": "No amount of threat will stop Igbo from demanding rights \u2014Abaribe",
          "text": "The Senate minority leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, has warned that no amount of threat against Ndigbo will stop them from demanding equitable treatment in Nigeria.\n\nHe also warned the two major political parties in the country not to use the current insecurity in the South-East to deny the region the 2023 presidential ticket, adding that no region in the country was immune to the problem.\n\nAbaribe, who spoke in Enugu on Monday at the inauguration of the Igbonine Organisation, a group advocating a president from the South-East, lamented that the Igbo had been pushed to the fringes in the country.\n\nAccording to him, every Igbo person believes that they are part of Nigeria and \u201cthat\u2019s why we also want to aspire to be president of Nigeria.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, let no one say to us, \u2018because of the insecurity in the South-East, the Igbo cannot be president of Nigeria in 2023\u2019. Don\u2019t use different standards for different people in the same country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWas there no trouble in the North-West when Buhari was elected president? In fact, Buhari was nominated by Boko Haram during President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s presidency as their negotiator.\n\n\u201cNo amount of threat should stop Ndigbo from consistently demanding equitable treatment in Nigeria and that which is our due. We are Nigerians and we should be given everything that is due to us, including the presidency,\u201d he added.\n\nThe senator insisted that only restructuring could resolve the many challenges facing the country.\n\n\u201cIf the dominant position in Nigeria today is restructuring, then the minimal demand of Ndigbo in Nigeria cannot be anything less than that of restructuring.\n\n\u201cWe cannot be in a country where my own child will be required to score 120 per cent to enter a unity school, while another child from elsewhere will be required to score just two points to gain admission in the same school,\u201d he said.\n\nAbaribe maintained that the Igbo wanted a united country, where they would be emancipated from unfair treatment.\n\nThe guest speaker on the occasion and 2019 presidential candidate, Kingsley Moghalu, in a keynote address, titled, \u2018What do we want?\u2019, said in spite of the marginalisation of the Igbo, the tribe must continue to resist \u201cany hegemonic worldviews in Nigerian politics\u201d and assert its political relevance through persuasion combined with firmness and partnerships with other ethnic groups.\n\nThe former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria added that the Igbo must insist on power rotation to Southern Nigeria in 2023, and with a unique argument for a president of South-East extraction.",

          "text": "By Prince Okafor\n\nThe absence of a regular power supply from the national grid is increasing costs for some manufacturers of plastic products.\n\nShyam Barakale, the general manager of Pentagon Plastic Industries Ltd (PPIL) said one of the biggest challenges facing plastic manufacturing outfits is the cost of providing their own power.\n\n\u201cIf regular and consistent electrical power can be sourced from the grid, we can easily concentrate on our core activity which is plastic manufacturing rather than investing in building and maintaining power plants,\u201d said Barakale.\n\nThis lack of regular power compelled the company to invest in its own power source relying on Clarke Energy, a multinational specialist in distributed power generation solutions, to set up its own power.\n\nClarke Energy, provided a 1.8MW gas power plant for PPIL which the company purchased and regularly maintains.\n\n\u201cWith Clarke Energy, we have a partnership that goes back to 2014. The company carried out a technical study and recommended the deployment of a gas power plant. It has been serving us well since 2015.\n\n\u201cThe gas generating set comes at a very high cost but it has also given us significant cost savings and increased our production efficiency,\u201d said Barakale.\n\nMore specifically, the leadership of both companies enjoys an excellent relationship, which has helped to facilitate a seamless scheduled 30,000hours overhaul maintenance on their 1.8MW single module Jenbacher gas engine last year since its commissioning.\u201d Yiannis Tsantilas, the MD of Clarke Energy, said\n\nPentagon Plastic Industries Ltd (PPIL), which was established in 2002, part of the B. L Chainrai Group, is a leading manufacturer of high quality, cost-effective plastic housewares, garden furniture, and rigid packaging solutions in Nigeria.\n\nPPIL operates two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities producing over 200 different types of plastic products and generating over $28million in revenue.\n\nApart from power plastic manufacturers also contend with the lack of feedstock for producing high-quality plastic products.\n\nAccording to Barakale, plastic feedstock, a byproduct of the petroleum industry refining process is a very capital-intensive venture and due to Nigeria\u2019s low refining capacity, it has to source raw materials from outside the country.\n\n\u201cWe have to invest a lot in raw material sourcing and this involves sourcing for foreign exchange which makes us vulnerable to volatile exchange rates. This adds to production costs and often results in delays,\u201d said Barakale.\n\nLooking at the volumes of raw materials imported into the country, you would see that if Nigeria has a bigger refining capacity, a lot of the foreign exchange paid to import them would be saved, Barakale said.\n\nBarakale said that PPIL in its 19 years of operation has contributed to the growth of the economy including employing about 500 Nigerians and its export of quality plastics contributes to foreign exchange earnings for the country.\n\nPPIL has established a strong network of distributors located strategically throughout the country. These are complemented by its distribution arms in Kano and Delta states.\n\nAccording to Barakale, the Nigerian market presents many opportunities for plastic manufacturers with its large population and strategic location to serve other markets in Africa.\n\nPPIL says it ships its products through its distributors to several African countries including Benin, Chad, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, even as far as Sudan and this export market represents 20 percent of the company\u2019s distribution network.",

          "text": "By Henry Ojelu\n\nA 93-year-old grandmother, Mrs. Cordelia Obeya whose grandson, Nnamdi Ekwuyasi was shot and killed by the police in Lagos 19 years ago has said the way to reduce extra-judicial killings in the police force is by recruiting only graduates, reorientation, and improved welfare.\n\nSpeaking with Vanguard in memory of the late Nnamdi Ekwuyasi who was killed on June 22, 2002, by a trigger-happy policeman attached to the then Operation Fire-for-Fire team in the Falomo, Ikoyi area of Lagos, Mrs. Obeya said it is sad that the killing of innocent brilliant young men and women remains a dominant feature of the Nigeria police.\n\nMrs. Obeya, a retired educationist noted that although the pain of her grandson\u2019s death remains fresh, she has since forgiven the policeman behind the act but wishes that such killings would stop. She also empathized with many families going through the same painful loss.\n\nShe said: \u201c 19 years ago precisely on June 22, 2021, my grandson, Nnamdi who was preparing to travel abroad for his university education was shot and killed by a policeman for no just reason. The pain was and is still unbearable but my children and I have moved on. We have forgiven the policeman behind his death but, sadly, such an ugly incident continues to happen even today.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, nothing is being done to address the matter. This should not be so because many mothers who have suffered such fates are crying in silence. There should be reform to stop this kind of needless killings.\n\n\u201cThe types of people we have in the police are not well trained. The majority of them are not graduates. There should be a minimum educational standard of university education for every person joining the police force. I believe that when they are well trained, they are most likely to relate well to the public and this issue of extrajudicial killings will reduce.\n\n\u201cAside from their educational qualification, they should also be a total reorientation for police officers. Their mindset and attitude towards the people they are meant to protect must change. Police should truly be friends of the people but the reverse is the case.\n\n\u201cMore importantly also, the welfare of police officers must be improved. I believe that due to their poor remuneration, an average police officer is antagonistic towards the rich and well-to-do. This should not be so. I am not excusing their bad behavior, but their attitude can get better if they are well paid.\u201d",

          "title": "Ubani kicks against FG anti-democratic policies, FHC practice direction, NDLEA drug test",
          "text": "By Henry Ojelu\n\nThe chairman of Nigerian Bar Association Section on Public Interest and Development Law, NBA-SPIDEL, Dr Monday Ubani has kicked against what he described as the anti-democratic policies of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s led administration, the recent practice direction issued by the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court and the plan by Nigerian Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, to make drug test compulsory for intending couples.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Dr. Ubani stated that while Buhari\u2019s growing undemocratic policies including the recent ban on Twitter is been addressed through a lawsuit personally filed by him last week, the FHC practice direction which grants the Federal Inland Revenue Service, FIRS, the power and right to freeze the Bank account/s and forfeit the property of a prospective Taxpayer and the plan by NDLEA to make a drug test for intending couples, raises a serious cause of concern.\n\nHe pointed out that Presiden Buhari and Buba Marwa even though retired military personnel need a reminder that what we are presently operating in Nigeria is civilian democracy and not a military dictatorship where countless decrees and edicts are churned out without any logic.\n\nUbani also stated that the whims and caprices of officeholders have no place in a democracy, rather people are governed by laws, rules, and regulations adequately prescribed and in clear adherence to the protected rights of the citizens as prescribed by the constitution which is the grundnorm.\n\nPart of the statement reads: \u201c I am of the candid opinion that Nigerians are feeling suffocated and imperiled with several restrictive measures being churned out limiting their civic space by the current administration. I feel alarmed and forced to voice out my view on this before we are completely drowned by these retrogressive and anti-democratic policies and pronouncements of the present officials of the government in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe recent ban on Twitter, the threat to prosecute Nigerians and broadcasting media outfits who flout their lawless order not to use Twitter, and the announcement of the Minister of Information to license all social media platforms have received and are receiving proper and effective reactions through strident criticisms and invitation to judicial interventions by the aggrieved citizens. However, two other pronouncements happened last week that should be of great concern to human rights activists and the general members of the public.\n\n\u201cOne of them was The Federal High Court (Federal Inland Revenue Service) Practice Directions, 2021 issued by the Chief Judge of Federal High Court, Hon Justice John Tsoho in favor of a prospective litigant, this time Federal Inland Revenue Service and the pronouncement of the Chairman of National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency, Retired Brig-Gen Buba Marwa suggesting drug test for prospective couples before marriage and even before any employment.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari and Buba Marwa even though retired military personnel need our reminder that what we are presently operating in Nigeria is civilian democracy and not a military dictatorship where countless decrees and edicts are churned out without any logic.\n\nWhims and caprices of officeholders have no place in a democracy, rather people are governed by laws, rules, and regulations adequately prescribed and in clear adherence to the protected rights of the citizens as prescribed by the constitution which is the grundnorm.\n\n\u201cThe Bar was indeed asleep when Assets Management Corporation of Nigeria(AMCON) laws were amended with the prescriptive rules that place a litigant above the adversary in any AMCON matter that deserves the attention of the judiciary. The catastrophe in all this is that the judiciary that a prospective litigant will run to for a remedy, was clandestinely used to enact rules that place AMCON on a higher pedestal against an adverse litigant in any matter that involves both parties.\n\n\u201cIt is sacrilegious as we have seen the collateral damage the said rules and enactment have done on litigants in any case involving AMCON. The side effect of the AMCON Rules is yet to abate before another more dangerous and more destructive Practice Direction was brought out by the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court giving FIRS the upper hand in any case involving her and any prospective litigant over tax issues.\n\n\u201cThe summary of the Practice Direction is that it gives FIRS(The Executive Arm of Government) the power and right to freeze the Bank account/s and forfeit the property of a prospective Tax Payer any time FIRS assesses a taxpayer whatever sum it deems fit.\n\n\u201cHaving frozen the account/s and temporarily forfeited the property/ies of the taxpayer, if the taxpayer desires to challenge the assessment and the process adopted by FIRS, he will have to deposit half of the sum assessed in an interest yielding account before an audience will be granted by the court.\n\nThe illegality and draconian nature of this Practice Direction should get any sane man in Nigeria thinking about the motive and rationale behind it. The Practice Direction is questionable under the following parameters;\n\n\u201c It is an affront on the right of fair hearing to a citizen for a law to take away constitutionally guaranteed rights without any justification. S36(1) of 1999 Constitution as Amended guarantees every citizen in Nigeria the Right to Fair Hearing which has been taken away by this draconian Practice Direction that mandates anyone who is challenging the tax assessment to first pay half of the assessed sum before he or she can be heard by the court.\n\n\u201cIt is a clear denial of Access to Justice for a litigant to be told to comply with what he or she is challenging in court before gaining access to the same judiciary that will determine his rights and liabilities. This is evil and must not be allowed to stand in any democratic country. Practice Direction by ranking as laws is on the lowest ladder and cannot be used in whatever manner to wrestle the rights of the citizens that are guaranteed by the constitution.\n\n\u201cThe arbitrary and abuse in the exercise of power by office public holders should have put the Chief Judge in check before issuing such a Practice Direction that makes a litigant like FIRS to have upper hand in any controversy between them and another litigant who has the right to challenge the exercise of their power in assessment.\n\n\u201cWe are here and we know how abusive and arbitrary office public holders can be, especially against opponents and when pursuing their personal interests. Tax assessor can just arbitrarily assess a taxpayer, say one billion naira. This has happened severally here. Going by that Practice Direction, the prospective tax payer will have to cough out 500 million naira and pay it into an interest-yielding account before such a body or person will have an audience in court. If the body or person does not have much money, he loses his property forfeited and all the money in his frozen accounts to satisfy the bogus assessment. Where is this kind of thing allowed in any sane society?\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that this Practice Direction must not be allowed to stand. If the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court refuses, and, or fails to see the danger and illegality of issuing this Practice Direction, the court of the land should determine this issue simpliciter. We are prepared for the war ahead.\n\n\u201cOn Buba Maruwa\u201ds suggestion on the drug test before marriage and employment, I am sure that no legislator whether at the State level or Federal will take him serious on that. We all desire a drug-free society and will vote for whatever legal measures that should be used to reduce if not eradicate it completely but we will not support any policy or measures that infringe on the rights of law-abiding citizens. We commend and appreciate the efforts of the current leadership of NDLEA in tackling drug problems in Nigeria, but the leadership of Buba Marwa must learn to operate within the law of the land as we are not under the military rule anymore. We are yet to recover from their excesses while they were in power as military rulers.\n\n\u201cNigerians have made a choice for democracy and we insist that they must enjoy all the ingredients of it especially on the aspect that pertains to fundamental rights as guaranteed by the constitution. Every attempt to restrict the civic space either now or in the future will be decisively resisted by the Nigerian Bar Association members that are alert.\u201d",
          "summary": "The illegality and draconian nature of this Practice Direction should get any sane man in Nigeria thinking about the motive and rationale behind it.\nThe Practice Direction is questionable under the following parameters;\u201c It is an affront on the right of fair hearing to a citizen for a law to take away constitutionally guaranteed rights without any justification.\nPractice Direction by ranking as laws is on the lowest ladder and cannot be used in whatever manner to wrestle the rights of the citizens that are guaranteed by the constitution.\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is that this Practice Direction must not be allowed to stand.\nIf the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court refuses, and, or fails to see the danger and illegality of issuing this Practice Direction, the court of the land should determine this issue simpliciter.",

          "text": "My name is RTD Major/Gen.A.O.Aladenola. The journey of my diabetes started on a terrific Tuesday morning. I received an emergency call from my superior officer to attend a security briefing in Abuja the next morning which is Tuesday. I woke up early to catch up with the early morning flight; that 45 minutes journey was the beginning of my predicament.\n\nI visited the rest room 5 times which became very embarrassing. Ultimately I knew something was wrong and as I put a call through to my doctor, I was advised to immediately go to hospital.\n\nImmediately I managed to finish my meeting which was another embarrassing moment, I checked into our base hospital where a comprehensive checkup was conducted on me and it was discovered that I had diabetes and my sugar level was 385mg. I was admitted and placed on insulin. That was how the journey started and it has been a terrific one \u2013 injecting myself everyday with dosage of insulin.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe situation got worsened when I had a wound on my leg which later became sore. At a point, my leg was considered to be amputated but I refused blatantly and I travelled to India, Saudi Arabia and UK, but all to no avail. The predicament led to my early retirement from the Military.\n\nMY ENCOUNTER WITH NKHAMBI\n\nMy Childhood friend Charles was in the know of my ordeal with diabetes. He called me one fateful day and informed me about what he saw on the page of a Newspaper concerning diabetes and sent a number to call but I didn\u2019t bother till about a week later when my nurse came to the house for the routine treatment of my leg.\n\nReluctantly I put a call through and explained my predicament to the fellow who assured me that I will be well and the sore will heal up.\n\nI was told that I will use the medication for 6 months for total cure, but within 2 months the sore will heal up. He sounded very convincing. So I ordered for 2 months\u2019 treatment. The first thing I noticed when I commenced the medication was that it helped to free my bowel and anytime I visited to toilet, what comes out of me was unexplainable.\n\nAfter 3 weeks on the medication, the sore was drying up and my nurse was also shocked \u2013 all other symptoms like my blurry vision and tingling sensations on my feet were subsiding. But what shocked me to the marrow was that within 7 weeks of administering NKHAMBI the SORE totally healed up and my sugar came down to 115 \u2013 120mg.\n\nI ordered for the complete dosage as advised, and after 4 months I started eating what I desired without restriction and all symptoms of diabetes had vanished; no more fluctuation of blood sugar.\n\nNow I am well and healthy after 18 years of battling diabetes which almost claim my leg. Thanks to NKHAMBI and I recommend it for anybody having any type of DIABETES.\n\nABOUT NKHAMBI\n\nNKHAMBI is a composition of carefully selected herbs across three (3) continents and is formulated into capsules under highly hygienic condition. This medication helps to rejuvenate the cells in the Pancreas that produces insulin in the body. Human bodies uses insulin to take the sugar from carbohydrates we eat and convert to energy that the body requires.\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENTS\n\n\u2022TRIGONELLA FEONUM-GRAECUM\n\n\u2022GYMNEMA SYLVESTRE\n\n\u2022PANAX SPP\n\n\u2022CINNAMOMUM CASSIA VERUM\n\nDIABETES INDICATION\n\n\n\n\u2022Frequent Urination\n\n\u2022Blurry Vision\n\n\u2022Weight loss\n\n\u2022Numb and Tingly of Feet or Hands\n\n\u2022Thirstiness and Hunger\n\nThou there are cases when a chronic increases in blood sugar for a while may not have such typical for diabetes manifestation but early detection and treatment is always advised.\n\n\u2022FOR ORDER PLACEMENT OF THIS DRUG: Call 09053333458 OR 07037318531\n\nWhatsApp: +2347037318531\n\nMake payment to account details\n\n1020932254\n\nA&B HERBAL ENTERPRISES.\n\nUBA",

          "title": "Buhari, Afenifere, Ohanaeze, MBF clash over appointments",
          "text": "By Sunday Ani, Chukwudi Nweje and Romanus Okoye\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has defended his appointments and policies, saying they are fair and inclusive.\n\nHe was apparently reacting to the gale of criticisms against his alleged lopsided appointment which critics say favour one part of the country.\n\nBuhari said there was no part of the country that has not been impacted positively in the areas of infrastructure, agriculture and economic support initiative based on peculiarities of the regions.\n\nHe spoke at the All Progressives Congress (APC) Youth Conference with the theme: \u201cThe future is a decision.\u201d\n\nThe conference, first of its kind in the history of the APC was attended by youths representatives from across the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).\n\nHe maintained that the party would keep implementing and executing policies that were not only beneficial but fair to all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cSo far, all the policies initiatives, projects and even appointments by this administration has been guided by equity and inclusiveness. There is actually no part of the country that has not been impacted positively in the areas of infrastructure, agriculture and economic support initiative based on peculiarities of the regions.\u201d\n\nHe explained that what an area lacked in one aspect was compensated for in another.\n\nHowever, the pan-Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, Ohaneze Ndigbo, the Middle Belt Forum, former governor of Anambra State, Chukwuemeka Ezeife and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Chijioke Okoli faulted the President Buhari\u2019s claim.\n\nNational Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, Jare Ajayi, said the administration has been most unfair in terms of appointments and policies.\n\n\u201cThere has never been an administration in this country that is as unfair and alienates certain parts of the country as that of President Buhari. For Buhari to claim he is fair shows he is unaware of the feelings of the Nigerian public. It seems certain English words connote a different meaning to president Buhari,\u201d he said.\n\nOhanaeze\u2019s scribe, Alex Chidozie Ogbonna, agued that the lopsidedness is not just in favour of the north but the Fulani extraction, which he said gives great concern to even the northerners.\n\nHe said after his election in 2015, he did not hide his disdain for the South East when he said those who gave him 97 percent would not be treated the same way as those who gave him five per cent.\n\n\u201cAnd true to his pronouncement, his administration has been skewed against the South East that didn\u2019t give him much electoral support in 2015. But even when the zone supported him in 2019, the trend did not change. So, he can\u2019t say his appointments and policies have been fair and inclusive. I disagree with him on that.\u201d\n\nPresident of the Middle Belt Forum, Dr. Pogu Bitrus, said if the president was right in his claims, people would not complain about his administration.He noted that the president has been so nepotistic in all his political appointments so much that every important organisation in Nigeria is headed by a northern Muslim.\n\n\u201cThe president is not just nepotistic in his appointments and policies, he also has an agenda which favours what he wants to protect. I don\u2019t want to say he lied, but the data is there for everybody to see. Nearly all appointments, even in some states where the Fulani population is insignificant like in Nasawara and Taraba, are taken by the Fulani. There is nepotism in Buhari\u2019s government, which has never been experienced in Nigeria before now. So, let him change. Nigerians don\u2019t hate him; it is his policies that Nigerians don\u2019t like. It is his policies that are creating all the problems we are having today. It is his policies that are making people say they are no longer interested in this country.\u201d\n\nOkoli (SAN) equally disagreed with the president, saying if the president said his appointments and policies are fair and inclusive, then he is not just habituating in an alternate universe but has also taken his audience to the theatre of the absurd.\n\n\u201cAnd in such theatre, you are torn between laughing and crying. The disingenuousness is beyond belief. He had earlier acknowledged the lopsided nature of his appointments but justified them on the basis of merit. It is a village idiot that would believe him in his embarrassing appointment of some of the least qualified from a section of the country, which are, in the first place, disadvantaged educationally, in the presence of qualified manpower.\u201d\n\nFor Dr Ezeife, President Buhari\u2019s appointments are motivated by blood relationship while his policies are driven by love and hatred.\n\n\u201cHe hates the South East and to a lesser extent the South-South. He loves Niger Republic even though it is not part of Nigeria. He loves Muslims and hates Christians. It is not possible for him to say his appointments and policies are fair and equitable. I can\u2019t believe he can say such a thing but if indeed he said so, then something is wrong, too wrong for correction,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022Criminal elements\u2019ll be brought to book\n\n\u2013President\n\nNotwithstanding the criticisms, Buhari has reassured that no effort would be spared in tackling insecurity in the country and bringing its perpetrators to justice.\n\n\u201cAs you are all aware, we are currently dealing with some internal security challenges and I will like to reassure you that as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, no effort will be spared in tackling them.\n\n\u201cAs I have repeatedly said in recent weeks, every criminal element that has taken up arms against the peace of the country and its citizens will be brought to book accordingly.\n\n\u201cI am happy to see that we are beginning to see the results and we keep improving until the country is rid of such divisive elements,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nBuhari implored Nigerians not to be discouraged or relent in the joint task of nation building.\n\nHe stressed that we have no other country but Nigeria, adding that it was the responsibility of everyone to work toward the development and advancement of the country.\n\nHe advised that unpleasant experiences and controversies of the past should be put behind, as we forge a better future for the country.\n\nThis, he added, could be achieved through patience, perseverance, love and empathy for one another irrespective of tribe, language and religion.\n\nBuhari also gave assurance that the APC would remain bound by the tenets of its manifesto and constitution.\n\nHe noted that while the party`s constitution and manifesto might not be perfect, they were put together to ensure that elected and appointed members of the party conducted themselves in the most responsible manner possible.\n\nMeanwhile, the First Lady, Mrs Aisha Buhari, has said her faith in younger generation of Nigerian women and youths remained unshakable.\n\nRepresented by her Senior Special Assistant on Women Affairs and Administration, Dr Rukayyatu Gurin, the first lady expressed her unalloyed support and commitment to the party.",

          "text": "From Adetutu Folasade-Koyi and Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it is targeting a minimum of 20 million additional registrants in the forthcoming nationwide Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise to increase the total number of voters to 100 million ahead of the 2023 general elections.\n\nINEC also pleaded with media organisations to ensure the success of the CVR through massive publicity, emphasising that the exercise scheduled to last a period of at least one year, will depend on citizens\u2019 awareness through voter education.\n\nCommission\u2019s Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, made the appeal in his remarks during the second quarterly meeting with media organisations in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nHe argued that with the launch of online Voter Registration portal and deployment of over 2,000 mobile physical registration equipment, the target of the commission to enrol about 100 million voters ahead of the 2023 general election is a mission possible.\n\n\u201cThe expansion of voters\u2019 access to polling units prepares the ground for the discharge of another important responsibility of the Commission. The registration of eligible Nigerians as voters is one of the immediate tasks before the Commission.\n\n\u201cConsequently, in the next one week i.e. Monday June 28, 2021, the Commission will resume the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) nationwide. In doing so, the Commission is introducing a portal to enable eligible Nigerians to commence registration as voters online before completing the exercise physically at designated centres nationwide. This is first time a major exercise of this nature is handled partially online consistent with the Commission\u2019s commitment to continue to deepen the use of technology in the electoral process in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cJust like the expansion of voter access to Polling Units, the Commission appeals to the media for support so that this novel idea will also be successful. The CVR will be a major issue for discussion at this meeting.\n\n\u201cThe Commission will demonstrate the procedure for the proposed online registration and also present the new INEC Voter Enrollment Device (IVED) to you shortly.\n\n\u201cThe Commission will also brief you about the preparations for the forthcoming Anambra State governorship election scheduled for November 6 and the Area Council elections in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) holding on February 12, 2022.\n\n\u201cAs you are already aware, the Commission has released the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the two major off-season governorship elections in Ekiti and Osun States holding on June 18, 2022 and July 16 2022 respectively.\n\n\u201cWe have since uploaded the details on our website and social media platforms. However, hard copies of the same documents are contained in your folders for this meeting.\n\n\u201cWe intend to undertake the CVR exercise over a period of at least one year. The success of the exercise depends to a considerable extent on citizens\u2019 awareness through voter education.\n\n\u201cThere will be new registrants, requests for intra-state and inter-state transfers as well as the replacement of voters\u2019 cards as provided by law.Furthermore, with the relocation of voting points to underserved areas as autonomous polling units, there is need for massive publicity so that citizens are familiar with their voting locations well ahead of all forthcoming elections. We appeal for your partnership to achieve this,\u201d he requested.\n\nPresident of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Chris Isiguzo, had appealed to the Commission to use the various off season elections to cement the electoral progresses it has recorded.",

          "text": "\u2022Vows to prosecute criminals terrorising Nigeria\n\nAdedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday tackled critics that accused him of nepotism and lopsidedness in appointments and execution of projects, insisting that all decisions about policies, projects, and appointments by his administration have been guided by equity and inclusiveness.\n\nThe president also vowed to prosecute those he described as criminals terrorising the country.\n\nBuhari spoke through the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr. Boss Mustapha, in Abuja, at the maiden edition of the Progressives Youth Conference with the theme, \u201cThe Future is a Decision,\u201d against the backdrop of criticisms that his administration has strived to foist Northern hegemony on the nation through favouring the zone in key political appointments, particularly in the security agencies, and allotment of projects.\n\nThe conference was organised by the All Progressives Congress (APC) youth wing.\n\nThe president stated that there is no part of the country that has not been impacted positively in the areas of infrastructure, agriculture, and economic support initiative based on peculiarities of the regions.\n\nHe said: \u201cSo far, all the policies, initiatives, projects, and even appointments by this administration have been guided by equity and inclusiveness. There is actually no part of the country that has not been impacted positively in the areas of infrastructure, agriculture, and economic support initiative based on peculiarities of the regions. What an area lacks in one aspect is compensated for in another.\n\n\u201cAs you are all aware, we are currently dealing with some internal security challenges and I will like to reassure you that as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, no effort will be spared in tackling them.\n\n\u201cAs I have repeatedly said in recent weeks, every criminal element that has taken up arms against the peace of the country and its citizens will be brought to book accordingly.\n\n\u201cI am happy to see that we are beginning to see the results and we keep improving until the country is rid of such divisive elements.\u201d\n\nHe expressed the pleasure that the theme of the conference provided an opportunity for creating a movement, while the future is a decision that should be made today.\n\nBuhari said the conference was timely coming up not too long after the membership registration of the party and just before the commencement of congresses starting from the wards.\n\nHe said he was confident that deliberations at the conference would impact the party\u2019s activities and even trickle down to his administration.\n\nThe president added that he was mindful of the fact that his administration came into leadership on the back of the victory achieved at the polls by the party on two consecutive occasions.\n\nHe stated that it was, therefore, pertinent that party members should remain bound by the tenets of the APC manifesto and constitution.\n\nAccording to him, while those documents might not be perfect, they were put together so that elected and appointed members of the party could conduct themselves in most responsible manner possible, while implementing and executing policies that are not only beneficial but fair to all Nigerians.\n\nBuhari urged the youths not to despair, or relent in their joint task of nation-building, saying they have no other country but Nigeria.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is the responsibility of every one of us to work towards the development and advancement of this country. Let us seize the opportunity to put unpleasant experiences and controversies of the past behind us as we forge a better future for the APC and for our dear country, Nigeria.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the Chairman, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party and the Governor of Yobe State, Alhaji Mai Mala Buni, had said the event came at a time the party was undergoing rebirth, recovery, rehabilitation, rejuvenation and repositioning.\n\nAccording to him, it is a fact that the future of the party and the country lies in the youth and the party cannot afford to discard the youth in its affairs.\n\nBuni said the ruling party had in the last 12 months been administered by the caretaker committee due to problems and internal squabbles.\n\nHe stated: \u201cI am pleased to say that collectively, we have rescued a troubled party that was heading towards imminent collapse and disintegration, to a very strong, solid, reliable and ever-growing political party.\u201d\n\nHe said APC youths had remained progressively united to the course of the party throughout the turbulent times.\n\nBuni added that this informed the caretaker committee\u2019s decision to engage the youth in every process.\n\nHe said as part of the strategic approach to youth engagement, a committee on youth, women and people with special needs was constituted during the membership registration and revalidation.\n\nThe chairman added that their support to the committee has translated into the rebirth of a new APC that gives every member a true sense of belonging and pride.\n\nBuni said the ruling party had repositioned itself as Nigeria\u2019s leading party and Africa\u2019s largest political party.\n\nHe said: \u201cI also want to assure you that the committee is making great efforts to approach the proposed congresses and convention with a united front to produce a strong leadership that would enjoy the support, trust, and confidence of all members. A leadership that would protect party interest above personal and primordial interests and promote unity and take the party to a more prosperous state.\u201d\n\nBuni added that as the theme of the conference suggests, the decision for the future of the party and country cannot be at any other time better than now when the corporate unity and security in the country are being challenged.\n\n\u201cAs the most energetic segment of the population, retrogressive elements with evil interests in causing confusion, creating and\n\nfanning hate and disunity will always rely on you to achieve such negative and unpatriotic tendencies and to destroy your future.\n\nYou must resist them. You should never allow yourselves to be used as tools in the hands of these treacherous elements,\u201d Buni stated.\n\nA former Governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha, urged youths to stop procrastinating, to be focused, and rise to take their place.\n\nOkorocha said: \u201cThere should be an industrial revolution. I travelled to China and I saw smoke everywhere. They\u2019re producing one thing or the other, but the only smoke you see here in Nigeria is that of Ishiewu.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Ejiofor Alike with agency reports\n\nThe Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has listed Nigeria and South Africa among nations being considered by Africa, in conjunction with the European Union (EU) and other partners, to create regional vaccine manufacturing hubs on the continent.\n\nOthers are Senegal and Rwanda.\n\nSpeaking yesterday during a virtual meeting monitored by Reuters, Okonjo-Iweala stated that regional production hubs would offer a more promising path to preparedness for a future health crisis.\n\n\u201cWe have now seen that over-centralisation of vaccine production capacity is incompatible with equitable access in a crisis situation.\n\n\u201cRegional production hubs, in tandem with open supply chains, offer a more promising path to preparedness for future health crisis,\u201d She stated.\n\nRwandan President, Mr. Paul Kagame, also confirmed yesterday at the Qatar Economic Forum that Senegal, Rwanda, and South Africa were in talks with investors to start the production of COVID-19 vaccines in Africa.\n\nAfrica was \u201ctrying to find partners, to start manufacturing vaccines on our continent,\u201d Kagame said.\n\n\u201cWe are discussing with people who will help with financing and I think in a few months we should hear a different story,\u201d Kagame added.\n\nThe continent of 1.3 billion people has fully vaccinated only about one per cent of its people against COVID-19 even as some wealthier countries have inoculated enough of their citizens to begin reopening their economies.\n\nOkonjo-Iweala; Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Ms. Kristalina Georgieva; Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus; and President of the World Bank, Mr. David Malpass, recently pledged to commit an estimated $50 billion in the fight against the COVID-19.\n\nThe amount was expected to help bring the pandemic to an end faster in the developing world, reduce infections and loss of lives, accelerate the economic recovery, and generate some $9 trillion in additional global output by 2025.\n\n\u201cIt is a win for all \u2014 while around 60 percent of the gains will go to emerging markets and developing economies, the remaining 40 per cent will benefit the developed world. And this is without taking into account the inestimable benefits on people\u2019s health and lives.\n\n\u201cInvesting $50 billion to end the pandemic is potentially the best use of public money we will see in our lifetimes. It will pay a huge development dividend and boost growth and well-being globally,\u201d they added.\n\nThe leaders of the four multilateral institutions said it had become clear there would be no broad-based recovery without an end to the health crisis.\n\nOkonjo-Iweala had stated that a rapid global and equitable vaccine rollout would be the best stimulus for a strong and sustained economic recovery for the global economy.\n\nShe had acknowledged that large monetary and fiscal injections in advanced economies helped prevent a bigger economic downturn last year and served as a major factor in why growth and trade both outperformed projections from last year.\n\nShe, however, had stated that these support measures would not \u201cbe enough to bring an end to the crisis. Only by ramping up production of vaccines and making them more widely available can we hope to get the world economy back to full speed.\u201d\n\nShe added that stakeholders should pay adequate attention to effective vaccine rollout because COVID-19 has continued to pose the greatest threat to the global outlook for trade.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Ndubuisi Francis\n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE), one of the world\u2019s top emerging tax havens, will begin collecting penalties and fines on its requirement for reporting of company beneficial ownership information, as it faces international pressure to address money laundering concerns, International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has revealed.\n\nThe tiny gulf country, which is a federation of seven emirates, is ruled by a mix of federal and local laws in addition to laws governing its sprawling free zones.\n\nThe legal environment, along with the absence of a single and centralised register and weak regulations, have turned the UAE to a safe haven for illicit activities, Transparency International said in a report last year.\n\nThe country is believed to be a safe haven for Nigerian officials who launder public funds.\n\nAn associate fellow, Chatham House, Matthew Page, recently disclosed that over 800 properties worth $400 million in Dubai, UAE were traced to Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) in Nigeria.\n\nPage, in a paper titled \u2018Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs) in Real Estate and Education Sector: Implications for Investigators,\u2019 delivered at a workshop organised by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), revealed that 35 state governors in Nigeria had acquired a total of 69 properties; five presidency staff members were controlling 13 properties, while 16 lawmakers are in possession of 45 properties.\n\nAccording to the findings, 15 ministers have 25 properties, 158 suspected politicians\u2019 proxies are in control of 226 properties, 14 security sector leaders (71), 50 PEP-linked business persons (91), 13 known Nigerian law enforcement agency suspects (216), 16 heads of department and agency (25), 11 NNPC officials (19), and a judge, one.\n\nAnother report by Human and Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA Resource Centre), a good governance advocacy group, titled, \u2018Fixing Nigeria\u2019s Illicit Financial Flows: A critical review of UK and UAE Policies, Laws and Practices,\u2019 had also linked 10 former Nigerian governors to properties worth \u00a356 million (about N30 billion) in the United Kingdom, while 13 top military officers were also linked to 216 houses in the UAE.\n\nThe report gave graphic details of illicit financial flows (IFFs) from Nigeria to the UK and the UAE, specifically Dubai.\n\nHowever, as the UAE prepares to implement the new rules on beneficial owners, there are questions about numerous exemptions and loopholes in the rules.\n\nCompanies may use brokers or banks as the legal owners, but the new laws that require the reporting of beneficial owners is focused on recording the true owners who reap the benefits of ownership, have 25 per cent or more of the company\u2019s shares and voting rights at the company or the power to dismiss and appoint directors.\n\nThe Policy Director of Global Financial Integrity (GFI), Lakshmi Kumar, said: \u201cBeneficial ownership truthfully provides you who is behind the company and gives you an individual to go after. It allows enforcement agencies that are genuinely invested in understanding and uncovering illicit financial flows to identify an individual.\u201d\n\nSince the September 11 attacks in the United States, the UAE has come under spotlight because of the role its banks and airports played in facilitating transfer of cash, weapons and other material to alleged terrorist groups, according to the Chicago Tribune.\n\n\u201cWhat makes the UAE attractive to illicit business is the absence of any kind of oversight, questioning (or) requirements.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of other countries, they may not have the technological capacity, but that is not Dubai\u2019s problem. Look at how the UAE monitors civil society groups, people who advocate against human rights violations with migrant labour. The UAE does an excellent job monitoring, enforcing and prosecuting them. There\u2019s a lack of interest behind this beneficial ownership law,\u201d Kumar said.\n\nIn 2020, the UAE was placed under a year-long observation by the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) for concerns over money laundering, terrorism financing, weapons of mass destruction, loopholes in the property and precious metal industries and the lack of legal action against money laundering.\n\nAccording to Kumar, this law, among others, may alter the perception among foreign investors that the UAE is a hub for illegal money movement.\n\nThe decision affects 513,000 non-financial businesses, according to Gulf News.\n\nUAE\u2019s minister of economy has yet to decide who the enforcement authorities of the law will be, according to the cabinet decision issued earlier this year.\n\nThe law applies to the entire country with the exception of the financial free zones of Dubai and Abu Dhabi.\n\nGovernment-owned corporations and publicly traded entities are also excluded from the ownership reporting requirement.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how this data will be stored, and the information will not be publicly available.\n\nThe ICIJ investigations, such as the 2016 Panama Papers, have helped prompt numerous countries to enact beneficial ownership registries in recent years, including in Cyprus, Ghana and Kenya earlier this year.\n\nMore recent expos\u00e9s by ICIJ, such as FinCEN Files and Luanda Leaks, have highlighted Dubai\u2019s rise as a go-to secrecy haven for people looking to hide illicit wealth.\n\nAdministrative penalties and fines of up to 100,000 UAE dirhams for companies that don\u2019t comply with reporting beneficial ownership information will begin July 1.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "By Duro Ikhazuagbe\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has reduced the life ban from football activities slammed on former Super Eagles Head Coach, Samson Siasia, to five years and also quashed the 50,000 Swiss franc fine on the ex international.\n\nCAS ruling Monday is the fallout of the appeal filed by Siasia challenging the decision rendered by the Adjudicatory Chamber of FIFA on 11 April 2019.\n\nThe FIFA decision found Siasia guilty of infringement of article 1 (bribery) of the 2009 FIFA Code of Ethics and sanctioned him with a life ban from taking part in any kind of football-related activity at national and international level (administrative, sports or any other) and a fine of CHF 50,000 was imposed on him.\n\nIn 2010, a match fixer tried to involve Mr Siasia as a coach of a club under his strict instructions. With the promise of employment benefits, Mr Siasia would have had to always field several players under the control of the match fixer.\n\nThe negotiations between the match fixer and Mr Siasia in relation to the conditions of employment were conducted by email over a period of two months.\n\nEventually, the club did not accept or could not afford Mr Siasia\u2019s requests and the negotiations ended.\n\nBut Monday, CAS Panel confirmed the Challenged Decision, with the exception of the following elements:\n\n\u201c*Mr Siasia is banned for 5 (five) years from taking part in any kind of football-related activity at national and international level (administrative, sports or any other) as of 16 August 2019.\n\n\u201d *The imposed fine of CHF 50,000 (fifty thousand Swiss Francs) on Mr Siasia is set aside. The Panel determined the imposition of a life ban to be disproportionate for a first offence which was committed passively and which had not had an adverse or immediate effect on football stakeholders, and that a five-year ban would still achieve the envisaged aim of punishing the infringement committed by Mr Siasia.\u201d\n\nThe CAS panel acknowledged the need for sanctions to be sufficiently high enough to eradicate bribery and especially match-fixing in football.\n\nHowever, the Panel considered in the particular circumstances of this matter that it would be inappropriate and excessive to impose a financial sanction in addition to the five-year ban, since the ban already incorporated a financial punishment in eliminating football as a source of revenue for Mr Siasia, and considering that Mr Siasia had not obtained any gain or pecuniary benefit from his unethical behavior.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The naval officers currently excavate and sell sand and they extort drivers and the rest of the villagers.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the Nigerian Navy personnel under the Western Naval Command, Apapa, had since then refused to leave the community.\n\n\u201cThe military men also destroyed some cocoa and banana farmlands spread on about 10 acres because they wanted to sell off the lands. Any attempt by us to resist the illegality of this naval personnel was met with torture and injuries,\u201d a resident narrated.\n\nSaharaReporters was told that one of the farmers who was injured by the military men was Micheal Shotinoye who had a rice farm.\n\n\u201cHis rice farm which engaged a lot of workers has now been abandoned; it is no longer safe to be there,\u201d a source stated.\n\nThe fleeing Baale narrated that the community had reported several times to the navy authorities but no action was taken to stop the navy personnel.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have petitioned the Senate, Ministry of Defence, Headquarters of the Nigerian Navy, office of the Chief of Naval Staff, among others, but the actions have yielded little or no result. The Ogun State Police Command has also invited Sufi Taiwo several times, but he never honoured the invitation once.\n\n\u201cWe hereby call on the Ogun State Government, human rights lawyers, and other well-meaning Nigerians to come to our aid. I am currently a fugitive as I dare not go to the Fowowawo, a town where I am supposed to be the head.\u201d\n\nSaharaReporters was told that Ofem Ubi is the Ogun State Navy Commandant but he has taken no action on the excesses of the navy personnel as he is said to be receiving financial proceeds from the crimes.\n\nDOCUMENTS: Nigerian Navy Personnel Sack Ogun Community to Take Over Land, Expel Traditional Ruler by Sahara Reporters on Scribd",

Even the first-class graduands were unattended to when they went to his office,\u201d Ekpo had said while allegedly distorting Udom\u2019s name to accuse him of scam.\n\nBut in the expulsion letter delivered to him, the university said Ekpo\u2019s article breached the matriculation oath he had signed and violated the university rules and regulations enshrined in the student information handbook.\n\nThe university also said that he was made to appear before a disciplinary committee but Ekpo denied any such hearing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs its 69th meeting held on Wednesday, 31st of March, 2021, the senate of Akwa Ibom State University deliberated on the report from the disciplinary committee,\u201d the varsity wrote to Ekpo.\n\n\u201cYou will recall that you appear before the committee on a case of publication of a derogatory and defamatory article on Facebook about the executive governor of Akwa Ibom state and the visitor to the university.\n\n\u201cThis act constitutes a breach of matriculation oath and violation of the university rules and regulations enshrined in the student information handbook. You are hereby expelled for this act of gross misconduct.\n\n\u201cYou are required to submit to the dean, division of student affairs, your student identity card and any other property of the university in your possession before your exit from the university.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEkpo threatens to sue Akwa Ibom varsity\n\nIn documents seen by TheCable Lifestyle, Ekpo gave the varsity seven days to restore his studentship or face legal actions.\n\nIn the documents dated June 18, 2021, and issued by Inibehe Effiong, his lawyer, Ekpo also demanded N20 million from the varsity as general damages for \u201cthe breach of his fundamental rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt no time did the Akwa Ibom State University invite or summon our client to appear before the university\u2019s Students\u2019 Disciplinary Committee prior to his indefinite suspension. Our client was not shown, confronted or availed with the purported abusive post,\u201d it read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is apparent that the university acted in contravention of Section 36 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 as amended and Article 7 of the African Charter on Human and People\u2019s Rights.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we hereby demand the following: immediate and unconditional reinstatement of our client; restoration of all studentship rights accruable to all students of the university; and the payment of the sum of N20m to our client, representing damages for the gross breach of our client\u2019s fundamental human rights and the resultant depression he has suffered.\u201d\n\nTheCable Lifestyle had, in 2019, reported how a student of the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB) identified as Michael Ifemosu was similarly expelled over his criticism of the institution on Facebook.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCopyright 2021 TheCable.

The real reason, however, is that she wants him to have a \u201cnormal\u201d childhood away from video games.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: Playfield is sinking. Their only potential angel investor bailed because their latest game sucked. A cheap buy offer from a rival is on the table.\n\nBut Troy convinces his mom to let him rebuild the game. He adds a rainbow that talks and a Barack Obama feature. And the rest is\u2026 actually, go watch the rest.\n\nReal life Troy stories are rare in Nigeria but an active gaming community is growing. Platforms like Twitch and Discord are spurring a global gaming economy and a means for financial independence for young Nigerians \u2013 like Olaide and Ying-Yi Akanji.\n\nThey met in 2012 at a GCE exam hall. When they started dating, Olaide introduced Ying-Yi (who is half-Nigerian, half-Taiwanese) to online gaming. Now married, they are an ardent gaming couple.\n\nWhile speaking with them on Tech Republic \u2013 a weekly radio show produced by 88.5 UFM Lagos in collaboration with TechCabal \u2013 I felt nudged to pick a controller and earn some recharge card money, at least. But how does a rusty Millennial get started?\n\nBelow is an excerpt of the chat with the Akanji\u2019s, edited for clarity. Most questions are from Tech Republic hosts Jay and Didi.\n\nJay: What\u2019s the situation with gaming in Nigeria?\n\nOlaide: I have been playing video games since I was a kid. My first Playstation 2 was from my dad. I became very good at gaming but I felt it couldn\u2019t take me anywhere because our 300kbps internet was so bad. Playing online was just impossible.\n\nThen I moved to the UK to study software engineering and everything was better. I dived into e-sports and built a following on Twitch. But I was not comfortable with a foreign audience. Gaming was more fun when I moved back. I could chat and banter on my streams in Pidgin and Yoruba.\n\nBut then came the issues \u2013 internet and electricity. It was demotivating to the point where I almost quit. The main problem was ping \u2013 a measure of how fast you get responses when you click to pass or shoot or any other action.\n\nOur problem here is that when you click on a button for any of those actions, it needs to travel to a server in Europe before it returns to Nigeria. And if you are playing against someone in Europe, their ping is much faster. I may shoot him first but it may not get to him when I do; then he shoots a second later and wins. That\u2019s why you have not seen Nigerians breakthrough internationally.\n\nDidi: Okay, how do I get into gaming? Can I start now even if I didn\u2019t play as a kid?\n\nOlaide: Yes you can! That\u2019s what I love about gaming. When people tell me they don\u2019t like video games, I say you haven\u2019t tried it out. There are so many games out there, it\u2019s impossible for you to hate them all.\n\nA 16-year-old kid won $3million playing Fortnite in 2019 and I actually played in that tournament. I made it into the top 1,000 from the initial 80 million people. The top 100 played in the finals in the US.\n\nBut that prize money shows how this sport has grown. I think the biggest prize money ever won in Nigeria was around \u20a65million.\n\nJay: This is really an untapped market in Nigeria\n\nOlaide: Oh my God, there\u2019s so much potential. I\u2019ve had many conversations with companies that want to get into online gaming but they fear the risks. And it\u2019s understandable because you need 24/7 electricity.\n\nI\u2019ve heard stories about NEPA taking power in the middle of a tournament. It\u2019s painful. When we compete against South Africans, they win because their internet is better.\n\nStill, the Nigerian gaming community is growing.\n\nDidi: How many female gamers are in Nigeria?\n\nYing-Yi: We have quite a few, but the gaming scene is saturated with guys. Girls in Nigeria have less time to play video games because they are more likely to do house chores, while guys can keep playing. Women gamers have to put in more effort. That means we are not a lot but we are getting there.\n\nParents also need to understand that gaming helps to improve cognitive reasoning of both boys and girls. Yes it can be sedentary but parents can set the balance between gaming and other activities.\n\nAlexander: So how do you pitch online gaming to people in government, as something good for the digital economy?\n\nOlaide: People are investing in electronic sports (esports) because every competition provides a level playing field for amateur and expert gamers. No connections needed.\n\nAnybody can buy a console, start playing and competing. Gamers like TimTheTatman are terrible at gaming but make millions because they make entertaining gaming videos. That opportunity should be open to all Nigerian youth looking for jobs and alternative income streams.\n\n\u2014\n\nListen to Tech Republic every Thursday at 2pm WAT on 88.5 UFM Lagos.

          "text": "\u201cDo you want to double your money in 10 days?\u201d\n\nInvestment scams tend to start off the same way.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a social media advert or a video of a celebrity telling you that an \u2018investment platform\u2019 made them millionaires overnight.\n\nThey all echo an alarming promise: \u201cgive us your money and we will give you more returns than you\u2019ve ever seen in the market \u2013 oh and did we mention your money is sure to come back to you?\u201d\n\nThese offers always seem too good to be true. And they usually are.\n\nOver the past few weeks, two different scams have been uncovered in Nigeria. Insha-Allahu Investment is the latest of them.\n\nWith a business name that roughly translates to \u2018If God Wills\u2019, the company\u2019s CEO is currently on the run after promising investors up to 20% Return on Investment (ROI) in two months. Many of the investors put in their life savings and in one case, their inheritance in a bid to multiply their money.\n\nInvestment is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It requires work. The work on your part as the investor is to perform due diligence and ensure your money is going to the right place.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that many more investment scams will continue to spring up. Days after Brisk Capital\u2019s CEO was arrested for fraud, a tweet featuring a popular celebrity made the rounds.\n\nThe power to become a millionaire is in your hands. Start your journey to become a millionaire today by Joining the great @mcivip known as Millionaire Club where you can invest and earn big.\n\n\n\nOfficial website: https://t.co/HMfsRY9aCspic.twitter.com/i0gqGXYzjJ \u2014 Instablog9ja (@instablog9ja) May 28, 2021\n\nIn it, the actor claimed that the company, Millionaires Club Investment, would give you 50% ROI (Return on Investment) in 3 days.\n\n\u201cOkay, but how?\u201d\n\nThis is a question that should follow every claim of returns. If a company tells you they plan to give you 30% of your money back in say, a month as Brisk Capital did, it\u2019s important to ask for details of how exactly they plan on making those returns.\n\nI spoke to Adedayo Bakare, COO of Money Africa and Oluwatomi Solanke, CEO of Trove Finance to get an idea of how to gauge if a deal is too good to be true.\n\nThey both agree that there is a relative benchmark to employ when discussing investments in the country \u2013 it\u2019s called the MPR (Monetary Policy Rate) \u2013 it\u2019s usually around the price of most of the government\u2019s debt instruments \u2013 like bonds and treasury bills.\n\nAs of March 2021, the MPR for Nigeria was 11.5% per year. To find out how much that is monthly, we just need to divide by 12 and we have roughly 0.96% per month.\n\nSo as a rule of thumb, if you have any \u2018investment platform\u2019 offering you significantly more than 0.96% ROI per month then you should proceed with caution. If they\u2019re offering less, then you shouldn\u2019t bother with them at all because you could get more by buying debt instruments directly from the government.\n\nInvestment is, by nature, risky. Legitimate investment platforms are usually keen to inform you of the risks involved when you\u2019re putting your money with them. If a person is promising you 30% monthly and telling you it is low-risk then they are already lying to you and you should not bother doing business with them.\n\nThis is the first step in finding out if an \u2018investment opportunity\u2019 is a scam \u2013 investigate their ROI claims and how they intend to turn them into a reality.\n\nIf a company tells you they are investing in the stock market \u2013 which admittedly can give you high returns \u2013 you must be aware of the risks. The market is volatile and can move up or down very quickly.\n\nIf they say they are investing in real estate then, as an investor, the onus is on you to ask questions about the real estate offerings. Are they selling land? Renting out buildings? How exactly are they able to make that much money from renting or selling land within a short time frame.\n\nIf you find that a company\u2019s explanation for the \u2018how?\u2019 is satisfactory, then you should go on to the next item on our checklist: Regulation.\n\n\u201cAnd you are licensed by\u2026?\u201d\n\nThis is probably one of the most essential checks you must perform before you hand over funds to an investment company.\n\nIt is not enough that a company is \u2018registered\u2019 as a business. Any street-smart hustler can register a business.\n\nAn investment platform you are considering must be either: registered with the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), or be affiliated with a company that is licensed by the SEC or the CBN.\n\nA company claiming to be a financial services company of any kind that has no connection to the SEC or CBN is one to approach with extreme caution.\n\nTo be extra sure, when a company tells you they are licensed with the SEC or gives you their affiliate company (or trustee), you can click here to confirm their eligibility.\n\n\u201cWho did you say you were again?\u201d\n\nContinue your due diligence by looking into the company\u2019s track record.\n\nIt is important to find out what credentials the owners or managers of these companies have. In the case of Dominic Joshua, a quick search would have raised some doubt about the veracity of a 21-year-old investment wunderkind with no real track record.\n\nThis step is especially important when you speak with referees or the company\u2019s brand ambassadors. You shouldn\u2019t put your money into a company just because a friend or family member told you it was great.\n\nYou should also check the company\u2019s track record and find out if fraud allegations have been levelled against its founders, senior leaders, or board members.\n\nPlatforms like ours, Nairaland and even Facebook have been around long enough to have picked up news on all kinds of scams and their perpetrators. It would be good to search for the names of those people and companies and see what comes up.\n\nFinally, making wise and well-informed investment decisions is a great idea but the journey to financial freedom is no walk in the park and requires careful research.\n\nSo the next time you or a loved one are faced with a new \u2018investment opportunity,\u2019 we recommend you share this article with them.\n\n*This is not investment advice\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Two unhealthy decades later\n\nOnly Rwanda, Botswana and Zambia have budgeted over 15% to health in the last two decades. In Nigeria, budget allocation for healthcare was 4.15% and 3.91% in 2017 and 2018 respectively, as data by TechCabal Insights shows.\n\n\n\nWith governments\u2019 poor performance, the burden of funding African healthcare has largely fallen on the shoulders of the private sector, which accounts for nearly 60% of financing. The continent relies on private providers for nearly 50% of its healthcare needs.\n\nEast and Southern Africa remain the regions most affected by HIV in the world. But as other diseases like Ebola and COVID-19 have shown, Africa\u2019s healthcare concerns are systemic, broad and in need of huge capital injection.\n\nAfrica has an estimated $66 billion-a-year health financing gap and in the absence of serious government efforts, donors and the private sector have come through.\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the value of PE and VC investments in African healthcare increased from 3% to 16% of total investments in the continent, according to the African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (AVCA).\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, 97 private equity and venture capital fund investments worth $1.3bn were made in health care in Africa. Most healthcare deals in that period happened in Nigeria (15%), Morocco (11%), Egypt (10%), South Africa (8%) and Ghana (8%). Boluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nHealth care, as an investment sector, can be narrowed down to a number of segments, according to the GICS classification system: Equipment & Supplies, Providers & Services, Technology, Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals, and Life Sciences Tools & Services.\n\nAnd health technology (healthtech) has received the most attention recently in Africa.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020, AVCA estimates that healthtech accounted for 35% of health care investments in Africa. In 2020 alone, healthtech was the bright star too \u2013 gulping 45% of health care investments.\n\nOne of the more eye-catching healthcare companies is mPharma. The Ghana-based startup is now present in 7 other countries and has raised over $40 million. It became a crucial partner in the Ghanaian government\u2019s vaccine distribution strategy this year and is tipped as one of Africa\u2019s next big companies..\n\nOther breakout healthcare startups in Africa include LifeBank, Helium Health and 54Gene in Nigeria, Ilara Health in Kenya, and Healthlane in Cameroon. These startups are filling critical gaps in blood products logistics, genetics data and hospital management technology to improve service delivery. More are coming on board.\n\nBoluwatife Sanwo/TC Insights\n\nAs with mPharma, new innovative health startups are relying on VC funding to rise to popular consciousness. To close the $66bn-a-year gap, the PE and VC community will be expected to invest larger checks at a faster rate in more startups. COVID-19, while an unfortunate pandemic, has spurred a welcome boost in visibility for healthcare startups.\n\nBut tough questions will have to be asked of governments as well. Are they doing their bit, at least keeping to what they agreed to 20 years ago? The first quarter of the 21st Century has only four years before it ends.

          "text": "The Buhari administration has stepped up efforts to regulate the online media in Nigeria in what is seen by many as attempts to further stifle the civic space in the country.\n\nTwo weeks after blocking Twitter\u2019s operations, the federal government has asked the House of Representatives to enact a law that will empower the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to control all forms of internet broadcasting and social media.\n\nThe request was made on Wednesday by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, during a public hearing organised by the house committee on information, national orientation, ethics, and values on a bill to amend the NBC Act.\n\nThe commission already controls television and radio broadcasting in Nigeria, based on provisions in Section 2(b) of the NBC Act. It states that \u201cthe Commission shall have [the] responsibility of receiving, processing and considering applications for the establishment, ownership or operation of radio and television stations including cable television services, direct satellite broadcast and any other medium of broadcasting.\u201d\n\nLai Mohammed now wants the commission to also regulate the online media, in addition to other channels of broadcasting. \u201cI want to add here specifically that internet broadcasting and all online media should be included in this because we have a responsibility to monitor contents, including Twitter,\u201d the minister told lawmakers.\n\nBefore Lai Mohammed\u2019s proposal, the broadcasting regulator had asked all social media platforms and service providers in the online broadcasting space in Nigeria to apply for a broadcast licence.\n\nPossible clampdown on freedom of expression\n\nWidespread criticism has trailed the proposal by the Nigerian government, which has only further stoked concerns over a possible clampdown on free speech and internet freedom by the Buhari administration.\n\nMedia stakeholders at the public hearing kicked against the inclusion of online media under NBC\u2019s mandate, asking the panel to instead make the commission more independent of the Minister of Information.\n\nOver time, the NBC has acted as an extension of the Ministry of Information and Culture, which rarely acts independently, and thus, the commission\u2019s operations have often been subject to political interference. This was condemned by the International Press Centre (IPC) and the Centre for Media Law and Advocacy in a joint statement that called for the neutrality of the commission.\n\nAccording to Akin Akingbulu, executive director of the Institute for Media and Society, the commission should not receive directives from the information minister. \u201cThe power to give directives to the commission, vested in the minister of information in section 6 should be removed and replaced with powers which include policy formulation for the broadcasting sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial media bill through the backdoor\u201d\n\nDespite the ban on Twitter, Nigerians continue to use the platform thanks to virtual private networks (VPNs) that help bypass the suspension. Many have taken to Twitter to express criticism over the proposed regulation of online media.\n\nBREAKING: NBC Amendment Bill Is Social Media Bill Through The Backdoor \u2014 SERAP (@SERAPNigeria) June 17, 2021\n\nAmendment of the NBC act;grafting the shoot of autocracy. \u2014 Senator Shehu Sani (@ShehuSani) June 17, 2021\n\nNigeria Govt is asking House of Reps to amend the NBC Act and include \u201cinternet broadcasting\u201d.\n\n\n\nThat means all online radio/TV stations must register with NBC and Lai Mohammed.

So, I advise those who have not taken their second jab to come forward to complete their vaccination.\n\n\u201cFor those who have not been vaccinated, the second phase vaccination exercise would commence shortly. I am using this opportunity to call on every Edo person who has not received the Covid-19 vaccination to get ready, so that when the process opens again in the next few weeks, they will come out and get vaccinated.\u201d\n\nThe governor continued: \u201cCOVID-19 is still very much with us; we may have another wave; some countries are currently experiencing their third wave.\n\n\u201cWe pray that we are not as affected as those other countries, but the only way to protect yourself today is to ensure that you get vaccinated.

These have been totally eradicated or totally brought to substantial control with the help of vaccines.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cFor the inauguration of the Independent Task Team on the Development of Vaccines and equitable, universal access to essential vaccines and vaccination in Africa, the initiative of CoDA and its partners is coming at the right time in the history of vaccines and vaccination.\n\n\u201cIn Edo, our government is currently implementing a wide range of healthcare reforms which are geared towards achieving high-quality healthcare and universal health care services for our people.\n\n\u201cConsideration for equity in access to health care, commodities and technology are at the heart of our reforms, especially for the vulnerable and under-represented groups.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have personally chaired the state\u2019s COVID-19 response team, since March 2020 and we have over 62 vaccinations teams working in all our 18 Local Government Areas of the state. We have vaccinated over 38,000 of our citizens out of our target of 47,944.\n\n\u201cEdo will partner with CoDA and other veritable collaborators in the task ahead, particularly that of achieving equitable access to vaccines and vaccinations in Africa,\u201d he reassured.\n\nDelivering his welcome address, former President Obasanjo, who was represented by Prof. Abdoulaye Bathily, from Senegal, said Nigeria and Africa must begin to harness its local resources to solve their problems.\n\n\u201cI have always believed that Africa\u2019s main challenge is not lack of funds or resources. Our main challenge is the inability to harness available resources to provide customized home-grown solutions leading to address the challenges we see across the continent.\n\n\u201cWe need to begin to take actions to harness our local resources to solve our local problems. Through initiatives like this one, Africa will be able to encourage and retain its talent and support them in finding solutions to its age-long health challenges.\u201d\n\nIn his contribution, Ehanire, who spoke via Zoom, urged for the support of all stakeholders towards ensuring the production of a COVID-19 local vaccine.\n\nIn a keynote address, former governor of Edo State, Lucky Igbinedion, said Africa has the best scientists in the world, adding that some of them have been involved in the production of Covid-19 vaccines.\n\n...",

He came in few minutes before it started raining this morning. And the judgement will be delivered today,\u201d the court official assured.\n\nAs our correspondent nosed around the court premises for a clue as to where Mr Lawan was seated, he observed that associates of the embattled former lawmaker were going in and out of an office where he was holed up, adjacent the courtroom.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES had reported that billionaire oil magnate, Femi Otedola, had narrated how he exposed Mr Lawan of collecting three-million-dollar bribe.\n\nMr Otedola had told the court how he was able to expose Mr Lawan.\n\nMr Lawan denied all the charges.\n\nMeanwhile, the court has resumed its sitting after the rains subsided.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe can hear ourselves now; nature has taken its court,\u201d Ms Otaluka said as she resumed sitting.\n\nMore details later\u2026",

This bill has been before the National Assembly for some time, they should pass the Bill into law.\n\nIf we start using electronic voting, it will reduce manipulation of votes. Many Nigerians have stopped voting because their vote doesn\u2019t count.\u2019\u2019\n\nAlso speaking, Senator Gbenga Kaka said, \u2018\u2019I am in 100 per cent in support of electronic voting, we are lagging behind in so many respects, the world is moving, if it could be accomplished in another sphere, I see no reason why we should not implement it here in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\u2018\u2019Even the largest democracy India has been practicing it for decades. I don\u2019t know why our own should be an exception. The only thing is that the Infrastructural facilities are readily available. Even the data capturing machine for registration of voters had to be powered with the small generators, so electricity is not available to power it.\u2019\u2019\n\nFor Senator Adeseye Ogunlewe, \u2018\u2019It is apparent that the majority of those who are against free and fair elections, are always against electronic voting, because they know it will expose their weakness and they will be defeated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u2018\u2019We have 17 percent of voting population participating in the election, and it gets weaker every time, because the people don\u2019t believe in the electoral system again, they don\u2019t believe in government.\u2019\u2019",

This bill has been before the National Assembly for some time, they should pass the Bill into law.\n\nIf we start using electronic voting, it will reduce manipulation of votes. Many Nigerians have stopped voting because their vote doesn\u2019t count.\u2019\u2019\n\nAlso speaking, Senator Gbenga Kaka said, \u2018\u2019I am in 100 per cent in support of electronic voting, we are lagging behind in so many respects, the world is moving, if it could be accomplished in another sphere, I see no reason why we should not implement it here in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\u2018\u2019Even the largest democracy India has been practicing it for decades. I don\u2019t know why our own should be an exception. The only thing is that the Infrastructural facilities are readily available. Even the data capturing machine for registration of voters had to be powered with the small generators, so electricity is not available to power it.\u2019\u2019\n\nFor Senator Adeseye Ogunlewe, \u2018\u2019It is apparent that the majority of those who are against free and fair elections, are always against electronic voting, because they know it will expose their weakness and they will be defeated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u2018\u2019We have 17 percent of voting population participating in the election, and it gets weaker every time, because the people don\u2019t believe in the electoral system again, they don\u2019t believe in government.\u2019\u2019",

          "text": "Doosuur Iwambe, Abuja\n\nThe Tertiary Education Trust Fund, TETFund, has said that Nigerian academics undertaking PhD studies at Morgan State University, MSU, in Maryland, USA will, henceforth, prioritise Public Health, climate change, and Computer Technology.\n\nThe Executive Secretary of TETFund, Prof Suleiman Bogoro, made the disclosure during a meeting with authorities of the university in Baltimore, USA.\n\nAccording to him, the areas of specialties were in view of the challenges of desertification, flooding, other climate-driven, health and developmental problems confronting the country.\n\nBogoro, who is leading a team from the fund to MSU on a partnership visit from June 21 to 23, 2021 said the three key areas were identified during his chat with MSU President, David Wilson.\n\nThe TETFund boss noted at the meeting, the area of climate change, climatology were identified as absolutely important.\n\nHe said, \u201cAnd we know it, with desertification, flooding and sorts of challenges that are climate-driven, with the uncertainties of climate and weather, we will be happy to have some of our scholars to go into that area.\n\nOn public health, he said, \u201cthis is very important, not just for the state of Maryland but for United States and perhaps, even more profound, for us back in Nigeria. The issues of public health are so obvious. Once there is population and in our own case, uncomfortably skyrocketing population.\n\n\u201cI am saying so because you know the challenges that go with it. The rate of population that is higher than GDP growth rate is never good for any nation. And if the provision for infrastructure and interventions cannot catch up with the increasing population it is a problem.\n\n\u201cAnd in the case of public health it is very obvious; the challenges for public health are very obvious. There are so many things associated with it. Is it the issue of sanitation, of course, availability or otherwise of portable water?\n\nYou can go on and of course the obvious public health challenges in terms of the diseases out there are uncountable.\u201d\n\nThe TETFund boss described Information and Communication Technology, ICT, as the master of very other thing and like a vehicle that drives, and shapes most other things.\n\nHe added that \u201cwe are in an era that science and technology, and innovation and cutting edge learning shape the world. These are the areas we want our scholars from Nigeria to come and share the benefit of academic knowledge with a great research university of MSU quality.\u201d\n\nRecall that over year ago, the Tertiary Education Trust Fund signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Morgan State University to enhance research and academic cooperation.\n\nBogoro said he and Wilson, had some moments in his office on Monday to discuss issuers that were profoundly beneficial to the MoU that was signed last year.\n\n\u201cWe had deep reflections; we do that regularly but we needed to compare notes. He spoke and I spoke, and midway, at some point he was saying some things that just look naturally, those kinds of things that I have been reflecting and even communicating out there in the media in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nHe expressed happiness over the performance of Nigerian PhD scholars in the institution, adding that the team was there to see some of them after TETFund signed the MoU a little about a year ago.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more proud for you to join us and make presentations on areas that have been carefully identified. This is one of the greatest moments. Partnership becomes imperative. It is a global trend.\n\nNo nation, if you thing you are the strongest you make mistakes, if you think you don\u2019t need partners.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, the Assistant Vice President, International Affairs of MSU, Yacob Astatke, expressed hope that PhD scholars from Nigeria will take the opportunity provided by TETFund to major on the areas outlined by Bogoro, adding that at the moment, the university has close to fifty PhD scholars from the country.\n\nAstatke, who was the host of the meeting, has been instrumental to cementing the partnership between TETFund and MSU.\n\nThe MSU official also gave opportunity to a number PhD scholars from Nigeria to make presentations on their Doctoral research being pursued in various fields.",

He started filming the abuse after he got sick of it, and sent the video clips of the abuse to the head of the Wafaq-ul-Madaris, the student claims.\n\nHe said: \u2018I was admitted into the madrassa in 2013 and had been attending it since.

          "text": "National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) has called on the United Nations, United States of America, United Kingdom and European Union among other world powers to stop Nigeria from \u201cthe dangerous paths it is treading\u201d and prevent another civil war in the country.\n\nNADECO in a letter signed by its general secretary, Ayo Opadokun, on behalf of the various ethnic nationalities in the country and addressed to the secretary-general of the United Nations (UN), and the leaders of the various nations, blamed the current situation of Nigeria on the \u201cimposed centralist and unitary 1999 constitution\u201d forced on Nigerians by the military.\n\nThe group said calls for secession by some groups in the country were as a result of mutual distrust between ethnic groups and inequitable treatment by the current administration.\n\nThe group also accused President Muhammadu Buhari of rejecting all pleas made by Nigerians for the country to return to the independence constitution negotiated by the nation\u2019s founding fathers.\n\n\u201cWe, the National Democratic Coalition, on behalf of Nigeria write to formally request you to use your good offices to take immediate and concrete steps to halt the fast deterioration of national security and political stability in Nigeria,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cNigeria\u2019s current situation is so deplorable because of the imposed centralist and unitarist 1999 constitution which was manufactured by a military clique and imposed upon us.\n\n\u201cEthnic Nationalities who were the building blocks upon which the British Colonialist constructed Nigeria had clamoured, appealed and cautioned the sectional military wing ruling Nigeria (foisting Obasanjo and Jonathan) as surrogates, for Nigeria to return to Federal Constitution upon which Nigeria secured its independence in 1960, but their interventions had always been met with disdain and provocative responses.\n\n\u201cNigerians have never accepted the suspension, and abrogation of the negotiated Independence Constitution.\n\n\u201cAgitations for a return to Federal Constitutional Governance, using the 1960 and 1963 Independence and Republican Constitutions as the working papers have been very loud, persistent and popular by Ethnic Nationalities and others with the youths of the South and the Middle Belt who constitute about 65% of the latest statistics of Nigerian population have resorted to street actions leading to political instability, incohesion and mutual distrust that are worse than what the situation was before the Nigerian Civil War between 1967-1970.\n\n\u201cWe are appealing to you to take appropriate steps to help Nigeria resolve the dangerous paths the country is treading now. Political upheavals, instability, another civil war are better prevented now by the international community because it will cost you far less if you prevent the possible eruption of open hostilities in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThis is also because anything that happens in Nigeria will have unwholesome and negatively impactful consequences on the West Africa Sub-Region, the African continent and the global community. Our request is urgent and timeous.\u201d\n\nNADECO asked that there should be no more elections under the 1999 constitution until a return to the 1960 and 1963 federal constitutions to which Nigerians subscribed to at independence.\n\n\u201cIn all the circumstances of this matter, NADECO has no alternative but to join in the insistence that there better be no more elections under the 1999 so-called Federal Constitution, until we return to the negotiated 1960 and 1963 Federal Constitutions to which Nigerians subscribed at independence and when we became a republic,\u201d it said.",

Yes, we have the right to agitate; I will say let us take it easy.\n\n\u201cIf we agitate and try to secede, move away, what is the benefit of it? What is the cost of taking Yoruba out of Nigeria? Is it going to be done peacefully?\n\n\u201cYou have to do this thing very clinically; you must get your parameters right; is it going to be peaceful? If it is going to be peaceful, Okay, if it is not going to be peaceful, what is the cost to us as a people and as a society? What is the cost on our infrastructure? A lot of things must be done carefully and well-calibrated.\u201d\n\nThe Orangun of Oke-Ila, Osun State, Oba Abolarin Adedokun, also called for patience and tolerance among the tribes and ethnic groups in the country.\n\nThe three-day conference on Yoruba culture and society had many national and international scholars on Yoruba and culture as speakers, including a foremost private art collector in Africa, Prince Yemisi Shyllon; Director of African Studies Institute, University of Georgia, USA, Akinloye Ojo, and Professor Arinpe Adejumo of the University of Ibadan.",

We are not, however, surprised because they were the same people who proscribed us before the federal government tagged us terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe purported statement by these shameless political generals without foot soldiers has only further exposed them as Caliphate boot-leakers. They know too well that they have since lost grip and control of the masses, hence, their desperation to regain the trust of their paymasters. The only publicly disowned IPOB thinking that doing so will make them regain the trust and favour of the Caliphate.\n\n\u201cThe governors, Ohaneze Ndigbo and the handful of traitors masquerading as the Igbo political elite should wake up to the realities that they have since lost the confidence of the people. We understand the worry of these Efulefus: They are rattled by the unflinching support and loyalty of the masses to IPOB.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only unfortunate, shameful and disgraceful that the so-called Igbo leaders will be quick to disown and betray their own in their quest to appease their slave masters. The South East Governors again, in 2017 they sat together in Enugu State to proscribe IPOB and the federal government declared them terrorists with the support of South East Governors while they are not. To their shame, how many times have their Northern counterparts disowned the bloody terrorists, bandits and Fulani herdsmen rampaging the country?\n\n\u201cSo, the South East self-acclaimed Leaders are quick to disown IPOB and ESN, yet they are calling us to accept the calls for peaceful negotiations? What hypocrisy!\n\n\u201cWe want to unequivocally declare again, that the five South East governors and the few self-appointed Igbo elite, are too infinitesimal to speak for the millions of Biafrans who are tired of being held hostage in this contraption called Nigeria. They don\u2019t even command the loyalty of all their appointees let alone the egalitarian Igbo nation that never gave them the stolen mandate they parade.\n\n\u201cAnybody listening to these traitors does so to his peril. There is no negotiation on the people\u2019s resolve to restore Biafra where human dignity will be respected.\u201d",

The video footage is not only capable of deceiving unsuspecting members of the public into believing that the men in the footage are members of the NA, engaged in the ongoing counter insurgency operations in the North East, but a deliberate effort to promote a culture of violence in the society by creating an erroneous impression that it is a legitimate action by troops.\n\n\u201cPreliminary investigations reveal that the said footage has been on the social media for quite a long time and is not originated by troops of the NA. Very importantly, the uniform of NA troops deployed in the North East is the Nigerian Desert Camouflage, while that of other operations around the country is the Nigerian Woodland Camouflage. Evidently, the military fatigue worn by the criminals is a far variation from the uniforms adorned by own troops in the various theatres of operation.\n\n\u201cThe NA therefore, wishes to clearly inform the general public that the video being circulated does not have any connection with its operations. Those in the footage are not troops of the NA and do not represent any operation of the NA. The video is circulated by mischievous elements aiming to tarnish the good image and reputation of the NA, in order to create mistrust in the minds of the public\u201d.\n\nGeneral Nwachukwu reiterated that the NA distance itself from the outrageous video and reassure the public that the NA under the leadership of the Chief of Army Staff, Major General Faruk Yahaya will continue to discharge its roles of securing the territorial integrity of the nation and aid to civil authority professionally and in consonance with extant laws and international best practice.",

ALIYU GARBA PSC+ HELD AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS, ABAKALIKI ON MONDAY 21ST JUNE, 2021.\n\nGentlemen of the press, it is with great honour and sense of responsibility that I welcome you all on behalf of the officers and men of Ebonyi State Police Command, to yet another press briefing today Monday, June 21st, 2021.\n\nThe briefing is an account of my stewardship and to highlight the recent successes recorded in our crime-fighting efforts through Operational strategies emplaced to achieve the goals of Operation Restore Peace (RP) as inaugurated by the Inspector General of Police. Without wasting much of your time, permit me to X-ray some of the achievements as follows:\n\nCONSPIRACY/MURDER/ ARMED ROBBERY AND THE ARREST OF SUSPECTED SELF-CONFESSED ESN/IPOB MEMBERS;\n\nAt about 1830hrs of 23/5/2021, while acting on credible information suspected ESN/ IPOB members were meeting at Agubia Ikwo in the resident of one Ebube Ivom \u2018m\u2019 age 31yrs, their suspected ESN/IPOB Sector Commander.\n\nThe said meeting had in attendance a Cross River State-based native doctor (Ezemuo), who was invited to fortify members of the group with marks on different parts of their bodies, as antidotes to bullets in preparation to attack Onueke Divisional Headquarters and INEC office both in Ezza South Local Government Area of the State by 8:30pm of the same day, 23rd May, 2021.\n\nOn the strength of the information, the command swiftly deployed a team of Police Operatives in collaboration with Neighbourhood Watch of Ikwo, in the process thirty-nine (39) male suspects, made up of indigenes of Ebonyi State and two non-indigenes from neighbouring Abia State were arrested and large quantities of juju charms were recovered from them together with living creatures such as Tortoise and hawk.\n\nEight (8) of these suspects made useful statements to the Police, while one of them, Elom Daniel \u2018m\u2019 age 17 years took Police Operatives to their hideout at Agbaja-Izzi community in Abakaliki Local Government Area of the State, where the owner of the house escaped leaving behind his wife and a child.

          "text": "\ufeff\n\nHalima Gayam, Lafia\n\nIn February, youths in Mada station community in Nasarawa state began to loosen and cut railway tracks that connect the area to the rest of the country.\n\nAlthough the Mada station tracks, about 130km away from Abuja, had not been in use for about five years, the infrastructure was still good enough for the vandals.\n\nBy June, most of the route\u2019s six tracks laid bare, except for its ballast.\n\nThe portions left untouched were only those protected by the wheels of an abandoned coach.\n\nEven the culvert under the tracks were dug and the water pipes vandalised.\n\n\u2018Night operation\u2019\n\n\u201cWe were not happy about it,\u201d a resident of the community Mikailu Abdullahi, told Channels Television. \u201cWe did our best to stop them, but we couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSome community members reported the vandalisation to the police and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), but they were told there weren\u2019t enough arms to enforce arrests, according to a staff of the Nigeria Railway Corporation in Mada station who pleaded anonymity.\n\n\u201cThe youths came in numbers at night to vandalise the tracks,\u201d the staff said. \u201cIn one of the incidents, six armed men came here to arrest a trailer loaded with railway materials. But they couldn\u2019t make the arrest because the youths refused.\u201d\n\nAnother railway staff suggested that the youths were motivated by a sense of entitlement.\n\n\u201cThe youths are claiming that the tracks are their father\u2019s and they have to chop (eat),\u201d he said. \u201cThey are also claiming they are indigenes of the area, so nobody can stop them to do whatever they want to do.\n\n\u201cWe did our best (to stop them). When we reported to the nearest police station and civil defence, they said there are no arms and mobility. So this is how the vandalism continued.\u201d\n\nIn May, the police stepped in and have now arrested 35 of the vandals, including two Chinese nationals, local politicians, police and NSCDC officials, and a railway official.\n\nChinese connection\n\nThe youths, according to the police, were in cahoots with several top politicians, corrupt police officers and NSCDC staff, and Chinese nationals.\n\nAfter welders perform the loosening and cutting, the tracks and sleepers are piled and arranged in lorries, before they are ferried to a steel company run by a Chinese suspect, Marra Thai.\n\nMr Thai is said to be the main collector of the vandalised tracks.\n\nAccording to the Nasarawa Commissioner of Police, Bola Longe, the tracks are compressed and dissolved \u201cand then later on they will mass produce new ones and use it for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether it is legal or not,\u201d Mr Thai, whose steel company is based in Abuja, said when asked why he received vandalised tracks. \u201cAnd we asked somebody to confirm it, and they said there was no problem. That\u2019s why we collected it.\u201d\n\nBut the police said Mr Thai\u2019s lawyer offered a N600,000 bribe when the police caught up with his client.\n\nAnietie Eyoh, the officer who heads the anti-vandalism template created by the police, rejected the bribe. One lorry driver implicated in the vandalism operation also offered Officer Eyoh N150,000.\n\nThe monies were displayed when the suspects were paraded this month.\n\n\u201cWe have resolved, with unbending determination, that whosoever comes into our radar, no matter who, will be seen, and the person will be arrested and treated in accordance with the provision of the law,\u201d Mr Longe, the police chief, said.\n\n\u2018An act of terrorism\u2019\n\nThe vandalisation of rail tracks is a recurring headache in Nigeria. While the Federal Government has prioritised the revitalisation of the country\u2019s railway network, vandals appear to have upped their activities.\n\nThis month, the police announced that it had cracked down on a criminal syndicate engaged in vandalising rail tracks across the North-West and North-Central.\n\nThe operation was uncovered after the police raided a warehouse in Gboko, Benue state.\n\nInside the warehouse, the police discovered different vandalised rail equipment, stolen rail installation racks, weld-shear, rail puller, other rail accessories and consumables.\n\nBut many of the syndicate members are still at large.\n\nThe Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, has described such vandalisation as acts of terrorism.\n\n\u201cRemoval of rail tracks can cause train derailment, with deadly consequences,\u201d he said at a town hall meeting recently.\n\nWhile promising to prosecute anyone suspected of vandalising public property, the Minister has also pleaded with Nigerians to take ownership of the assets, as they \u201cmust be protected for the benefit of all.\u201d",

          "text": "Analysts have welcomed the planned introduction of digital currency by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), saying it will improve the inflow of foreign exchange and boost the capacity of the apex bank to intervene in the economy.\n\nThe CBN had on June 10, 2021, unfolded plans to launch a digital currency before the end of the year.\n\nBut in separate interviews with THISDAY, some analysts said the move would also reduce pressure on the demand for forex and boost external reserves as well as enhance the value of the naira.\n\nThe analysts added that the development would deepen financial inclusion in the long run and lower the operational costs of handling physical cash and enhance the efficiency of payments systems.\n\nDescribing it as a step in the right direction, they added that the development will improve intra-African trade.\n\nThe Chairman of Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), Abuja Branch, Prof. Uche Uwaleke, said the plan by CBN to launch a digital currency was particularly welcome in view of the inherent benefits.\n\nHe, however, expressed concerns about the associated risks regarding the likely impact on monetary policy transmission, financial stability, inflation as well as the role of financial institutions.\n\nUwaleke said: \u201cThese concerns and the level of our economic development make the suggested time frame unrealistic.\n\n\u201cEven the central banks of developed economies such as the US Fed Reserve and the European Central Bank are still researching the implications of introducing a CBDC.\n\n\u201cTherefore, while welcoming the idea, I expect the CBN not to be in a hurry and to commit resources to research in the area of digital currencies, including possible mechanisms for controlling private virtual currencies such as cryptocurrencies.\u201d\n\nThe Divisional Chief Executive at Interswitch Group, Mr. Akeem Lawal, described the move as a forward-looking policy initiative from the regulator\u2019s perspective, adding that it will enhance the convertibility of the naira.\n\nHe said digital currency would also help the country to benefit from the technology, which is the future of payments in every sphere of endeavour.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is a path to enabling naira to become convertible. One of the disadvantages African countries and Nigeria face is that our currencies are not convertible but if we create a digital currency, it is probably one step towards creating a convertible version of the naira.\n\n\u201cIf you layer that on top of a pan-African payment ecosystem, it would create a very strong payment system for the continent where it is possible to exchange African currencies amongst themselves.\u201d\n\nHe said some forward-looking countries, including China, had already started creating their digital currencies.\n\n\u201cIf you listen to what IMF and some other international agencies have been talking about and all of them have agreed that a central bank digital currency would transform the way cross border payments are done,\u201d he stated.\n\nIn his contribution, Managing Director/Chief Executive, SD&D Capital Management Limited, Mr. Idakolo Gbolade, stated that the impact of digital currency on the economy will yield positive results.\n\nHe described the digital currency as the advanced means of exchange currently trending all over the world, adding that some countries have already legalised it.\n\nGbolade said the initiative would improve the inflow of forex into the country and increase the CBN\u2019s capacity to intervene in the economy.\n\nAccording to him, it will also help the bank to regulate the activities of digital currency traders and place Nigeria as a major player in the digital currency space.\n\nOn his part, Managing Director/Chief Executive, Dignity Finance and Investment Limited, Dr. Chijioke Ekechukwu, said the new legal tender would eliminate restrictions on accessibility to foreign currencies and thereby enhance foreign payments and trade.\n\nAccording to him, it will also reduce pressure on demand for foreign currency and external reserves.\n\n\u201cThe value of the naira will improve significantly and forces of demand and supply will hardly affect the exchange rate. I think it is a good initiative.\n\n\u201cThis is a welcome development. CBN wants a digital currency that can be regulated by them, unlike the cryptocurrency,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso, Investment Research Analyst at United Capital, Mr. Ayorinde Akinloye, said the initiative was a positive development by the CBN.\n\nHe, however, sought for more clarity on the modalities and framework for the implementation of digital currency so it could be scrutinised by analysts to get quality inputs.\n\nAkinloye said creating a digital currency was in line with most of the new trend seen across the globe, adding that \u201cit is definitely in line with what you think the future of money would be because money would evolve beyond paper.\u201d\n\nHe said the initiative would boost settlement time and support stock exchange activities by providing quick turnaround time on transactions.\n\nManaging Director/Chief Executive, Credent Investment Managers Limited, Mr. Ibrahim Shelleng, also described the CBN\u2019s plan as \u201cpossibly the boldest step that the CBN has taken and it will be interesting to see how it will be adopted and implemented.\u201d\n\nHe said digital currency was the way forward for financial systems, adding that the cost of printing fiat currency will eventually be eliminated in the long run.\n\nHe stated that the future possibilities are endless while the implications on contracts and financial management cannot be overemphasised.\n\nShelleng said: \u201cOf course change will always encounter resistance from those that have enjoyed the loopholes in the current financial systems.\n\n\u201cBut the only thing constant is change. Adopting a digital currency will also provide an avenue for more foreign investment given that the digital currency is not subject to manipulation from governments and therefore subject to supply demand dynamics.\u201d\n\nHe said while the underlying blockchain technology provided transparency and efficiency to financial systems, it would be of invaluable benefits to the country.\n\n\u201cBitcoin acceptance has gone mainstream now with global corporations and some countries adopting it as legal tender so certainly, the move by CBN is in the right direction,\u201d he added.\n\nJames Emejo in Abuja and Nume Ekeghe in Lagos",

We also know that some brought their private jets under a temporary import certificate, which has expired and not renewed. These are infractions.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the verification, some of the things we want to expose will come to light. We will make our findings known on July 6 after the expiration of the 30-day grace window\n\n\u201cThose in default risk detention of their aircraft as nobody is above the law.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the NCS believed that owners of private aircraft are highly placed individuals who would be willing to comply with extant laws governing the importation of the aircraft they own; including payments of all appropriate duties and taxes.\n\n\u201cAs an agency of government responsible for enforcement of laws governing imports and exports in Nigeria, NCS will not hesitate to invoke appropriate sanctions on any defaulting private aircraft owner immediately after the expiration of the verification period on Tuesday 6th July 2021,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe listed the documents required for verification as: Aircraft Certificate of Registration NCAA\u2019S Flight Operations Compliance Certificate; NCAA\u2019S Maintenance Compliance Certificate; NCAA\u2019S Permit for non- Commercial Flights; and Temporary Import Permit where applicable.\n\nAccording to him, the ongoing verification is not intended to inconvenience any owner of a private aircraft, as such individuals or representatives can come with the documents for verification.\n\nUdora Orizu in Abuja",

And this is without taking into account the inestimable benefits on people\u2019s health and lives.\n\n\u201cInvesting $50 billion to end the pandemic is potentially the best use of public money we will see in our lifetimes. It will pay a huge development dividend and boost growth and well-being globally,\u201d they added.\n\nThe leaders of the four multilateral institutions said it had become clear there would be no broad-based recovery without an end to the health crisis.\n\nOkonjo-Iweala had stated that a rapid global and equitable vaccine rollout would be the best stimulus for a strong and sustained economic recovery for the global economy.\n\nShe had acknowledged that large monetary and fiscal injections in advanced economies helped prevent a bigger economic downturn last year and served as a major factor in why growth and trade both outperformed projections from last year.\n\nShe, however, had stated that these support measures would not \u201cbe enough to bring an end to the crisis. Only by ramping up production of vaccines and making them more widely available can we hope to get the world economy back to full speed.\u201d\n\nShe added that stakeholders should pay adequate attention to effective vaccine rollout because COVID-19 has continued to pose the greatest threat to the global outlook for trade.\n\nEjiofor Alike with agency reports",

          "text": "Hong Kong\u2019s leader has defended a crackdown on the pro-democracy Apple Daily newspaper, insisting that the arrest of senior editors and a freeze on its assets did not amount to an attack on press freedom.\n\nCarrie Lam\u2019s comments on Tuesday came after the United States criticised the Hong Kong authorities\u2019 use of the China-imposed national security law to target the tabloid.\n\nHundreds of police raided the newspaper last week as part of a national security probe in which Editor-in-Chief Ryan Law and Chief Executive Officer Cheung Kim-hung were arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit \u201ccollusion with a foreign country\u201d.\n\nAuthorities also froze 18 million Hong Kong dollars\u2019 worth ($2.3 million) of the tabloid\u2019s assets.\n\nThe clampdown marked the first time authorities had targeted media articles under the security legislation, which punishes anything deemed secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with up to life in prison.\n\nRights groups, media organisations and Western governments have criticised the actions and expressed concern about freedom of the press and other rights in the semi-autonomous territory.\n\nIn Washington, State Department spokesman Ned Price said the US was deeply concerned by \u201cselective\u201d and \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d use of the security law.\n\nSpeaking at her regular weekly news conference on Tuesday, Lam singled out the US comments, telling reporters the accusations were wrong and applied double standards.\n\nShe said the actions taken by authorities did not target press freedom.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to underplay the significance of breaching the national security law,\u201d Lam said. \u201cDon\u2019t try to beautify these acts of endangering national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t try to accuse the Hong Kong authorities for using the national security law as a tool to suppress the media or to stifle the freedom of expression,\u201d she added.\n\nUnlike mainland China, where the press is overwhelmingly state-owned and heavily censored, Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution includes free speech protections.\n\nBut the new national security law has criminalised a host of political views and the action against Apple Daily has left the media wondering what views or reporting could trigger an investigation.\n\nApple Daily has come under increasing pressure since its owner Jimmy Lai was arrested last year under the national security law.\n\nLai, whose assets have also been frozen under the security law, is already serving a prison sentence for taking part in unauthorised assemblies.\n\nOn Monday, Mark Simon, an adviser to Lai, said the publication would be forced to shut down in \u201ca matter of days\u201d.\n\nEarlier on the same day, an internal sent to staff said the newspaper looks set to close for good by Saturday unless Hong Kong authorities released the frozen assets.\n\nThe memo said no articles would be uploaded to Apple Daily\u2019s website after 11:59pm (15:59 GMT) on Friday and that the last newspaper will come out on Saturday morning.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s RTHK broadcaster said Apple Daily aired its last live news show on Monday night, with journalists thanking the audience for their support since the programme went live last October.\n\nMore than 30,000 people logged on for the final show, it said.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, a brief statement addressed \u201cDear readers\u201d said it would no longer update its English language website.\n\n\u201cThank you for your support,\u201d it said.",
