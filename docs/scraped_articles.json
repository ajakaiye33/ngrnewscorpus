General Ibrahim Attahiru, and 11 others, among whom were senior military officers, died at the weekend in Kaduna.\n\nAkpodoro who is the National President of the National Coalition of Niger Delta Ex-Agitators, NCNDE-A, described the air crash as a national disaster, saying President Buhari and the families of the departed military officers should take solace in God, noting that: God takes and gives.\n\nHe said death is an enviable end of every mortal.\n\nThe ex-militant leader, who is an avowed supporter of President Buhari, noted that the death of the recently-appointed COAS was a big blow to the country, particularly as it concerns the war against the insurgents in the North-Eastern part of Nigeria.\n\nHe opined that given the zeal with which the late Attahiru pursued the fight against insurgency, he was poised to win it and called on the President to deepen his faith in the Holy Quran.\n\nAlso read:\n\n\u201cThe dead officers have done their parts and their Maker has called them home, who are we mere mortals to be sad over the decision of the Highest who is the ultimate decider of human fate and this is the reason we must strive to put in our best at all times,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ex-militant leader, who doubles as the Coordinator of Sector \u2018C\u2019 of the Surveillance and Enforcement Team of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, IPMAN, Delta State, however, called on the President not to rule out sabotage in the military plane crash, adding that the politics of the emergence of a COAS could stoke unhealthy rivalry and goad rivals into engaging in an unwholesome act of wickedness and evil.\n\nHe likened the Kaduna military plane crash to September 26, 1992, Nigerian Airforce Lockheed C-30H Hercule that crashed into a Lagos creek three minutes after takeoff from the airport at Ikeja, as he warned the President not to take the incident of the military plane crash of May 21st, 2021 for granted.\n\nHe noted that those he described as agents provocateur might have infiltrated the high echelon of the Nigerian Army.\n\nThe Nigerian State, Akpodoro said, \u201ccannot afford to train senior military officers to the pinnacle of their career only to lose them to human wickedness.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur Coalition is suspicious and with every sense of responsibility, we call on the President to step up his game with clinical efficiency. A particular army General told the National Assembly during the screening that it will take years to defeat Boko Haram.\n\n\u201d Shockingly, Attahiru mounted the podium and was dismantling the established Boko Haram structure with professional aptitude, while at the same giving bandits bloody nose and suddenly, Shekau was killed only for the nation to mourn a few days later the death of the man behind the huge success recorded by the new brigade of Army already making us proud as a nation. We call on the President to look inward for the sanctity of our national pride.\n\n\u201cIn Attahiru, we lost a top-flight Army General; in the late COAS, Nigeria lost a patriot who lived and died in the course of protecting his fatherland. May the souls of the departed rest in peace,\u201d the Urhobo-born former warlord stated.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

It was the power outage that sparked off the protests and we insist that all other issues are resolved as well,\u201d George said.\n\nHe explained that the community leaders and some government officials were expected at the Agip\u2019s Terminal gate to meet with the protesters and brief them on progress made in the negotiations, but they failed to show up as at Monday morning.\n\nHe said that women were at the front lines with the youths to avert further escalation and conflict with armed soldiers deployed to protect the facility, while ensuring that the agitation for community development remained peaceful.\n\nThe protests became rowdy on May 19 when the traditional ruler, King Alfred Diette-Spiff, appealed to the protesters to disperse while their grievances were being discussed with NAOC, but the angry mob attacked him and he had to be whisked away for safety, while a 24-year old was shot in the commotion.\n\nIn its reaction to requests for comments by NAN, Eni claimed that power had been restored and that the protests did not adversely impact on oil exports from the Brass Terminal.\n\n\u201cAn electrical cable connecting the terminal to the community was damaged by lightning, thereby leaving the community without electricity.

          "text": "Kindly Share This Story:\n\nBy Gabriel Ewepu \u2013 Abuja\n\nAs some government institutions have been targeted by unscrupulous elements, an election observer, Yiaga Africa, weekend, condemned attacks on offices and facilities belonging to the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC.\n\nThis was contained in a statement signed by the Director of Programmes , Yiaga Africa, Cynthia Mbamalu, where the organisation expressed worry over what it described as coordinated and premeditated attacks on INEC\u2019s facilities.\n\nThe statement reads in part, \u201cYiaga Africa is deeply worried about the recent \u2018coordinated and premeditated\u2019 attacks on the facilities of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). These are indeed dangerous signs for the country\u2019s fragile democracy as it will not just affect the commission\u2019s preparation for upcoming elections but also diminish citizens\u2019 confidence in the electoral process.\n\n\u201cThe disturbing trend of attacks on the offices and facilities of the Independent National Electoral Commission is not just an act of sabotage to a critical institution established by the Constitution to guarantee democratic leadership in Nigeria but an assault on democracy and credible elections. These attacks also pose a potential threat to citizens\u2019 right to vote in an election. Yiaga Africa is concerned that, attack on democratic institutions is antithetical to the drive for Electoral Reforms.\n\n\u201cFrom Yiaga Africa\u2019s recent tracking of incidents of attacks on INEC structures, at least 21 INEC offices across 10 states have been attacked, vandalized, or set ablaze within the last 24 months. The most recent being the vandalisation and burning down of INEC offices in Udenu LGA in Enugu State and in Ezza North LGA in Ebonyi State.\n\n\u201cWe empathize with the Commission as we can testify to the huge challenges that come with election management and deployment of materials to various polling units ahead of elections. These attacks will most likely have a negative impact on election planning, deployment of personnel and materials, and the overall cost of elections in Nigeria.\n\nThe statement also showed concern that \u201cThese sad incidents will create a financial burden on INEC and increase the cost on INEC and Nigeria by extension.\u201d\n\nThe statement also pointed that, \u201cIn addition, it is also a source of distraction to INEC especially with the ongoing expansion of voter access to polling units and the planned commencement of the Continuous Voters Registration (CVR) across the country.\n\nHowever, Yiaga Africa in the statement expressed shock that there has not been any arrests made since the attacks started.\n\n\u201cIt is even more worrying that there has been barely any arrest made in connection with these heinous crimes. We are afraid that, if these incessant arsons on election facilities are not checked, this will affect Nigeria\u2019s plan for the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cCitizens are interested in an in-depth investigation into these attacks and for perpetrators to be arrested and prosecuted as a deterrent to plans for any other attack. Failure to do these will enable this culture of impunity and create a violent climate for the elections.\n\nThe statement advised that \u201cAs the commission convenes an emergency meeting with all security agencies and major stakeholders, they must devise crucial means of tracking and arresting the perpetrators and prosecuting them along with their sponsors.\u201d\n\nIt also called on security agencies to ensure the protection of government offices and facilities including the citizens and not to allow few criminal elements to hold over 200 million Nigerians to ransom.\n\n\u201cSecurity agencies must step up an effort to protect government institutions against enemies of democracy who are bent on destroying democratic institutions. Amidst the declining security situation in the country and diminishing confidence of the citizens, this is an opportunity for Nigerian security agencies to live up to their mandate of protecting lives and properties.\n\n\u201cThere is no gain reiterating the crucial role the election management body plays in consolidating the nation\u2019s democracy. Thus the need to protect the commission, its independence, its facilities, and personnel remains sacrosanct\u201d, it added.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria\n\nKindly Share This Story:",

Marcel Ifejiofor, who conducted the governor and his entourage round the airport facilities said the international airport is Class 4F which can take any aircraft.\n\nHe also said \u201cThe orientation is that the aeroplane can land at either side of the runway. That was what happened on April 30th, 2021, when we did the test flight, one landed on 024 and the other one landed on 06. This airport has two Runway Air Safety Areas, RASA. This is the only airport in Nigeria with this type of RASA. It has category two light which means that the airplane can land at the worst of any weather in this airport.\n\n\u201cIt also has satellite facilities which means that if the light is not working, aircraft can land with the satellite facilities. So with what we have on this airport, it would be difficult to have a cancelled flight.\n\n\u201cIt is the only airport in Nigeria with this type of satellite facilities. This is the only airport in Nigeria that is current with the Friction Test. Before the airplane landed on the 30th, we carried out the test and got 0.79 which is the highest so far in this country. The height of the Control Tower is 34.5.\u201d\n\nThe Commissioner who said that work on the airport would be completed in no distance time, assured that passengers who would use the airport would have the best of air travel experience.\n\nWhile lauding the governor for the legacy project, the chairman of Nsukka Journalists Foundation, NJF, Chijioke Amu-Nnadi, who led a team of journalists from Nsukka extraction in Enugu State to the airport during the inspection, said the project will guarantee slow but steady re-ordering of the economy of the South East Region.\n\nAmu-Nnadi also described the governor as a visionary leader who has left an enviable legacy as the governor of Anambra State.

Isn\u2019t that the same flag #EndSars protesters waved and hoist when the so call Nigerian Army went to kill them 20/10/2020? They were even singing the National Anthem. Have y\u2019all agreed to the fact of that? Have y\u2019all shown any remorseful act? I stopped believing in the Flag on 20/10/2020. Nigerians May forgive the Army but people like me won\u2019t do that those that died died in the plane crash had families so does those that y\u2019all shot during the protest. You can shut our mouth but not our brain and our heart.\u201d\n\n@Banky__moon, \u201dPresident Buhari could not even come out on National TV to join the nation in mourning the lost of the COAS and his crew. Instead we had his aides talking and you wonder why Mazi Nnamdi Kanu keeps saying that Buhari is dead and that there\u2019s an impostor at ASO ROCK.\n\n@Benwealth01, \u201dWhat is more honorable to do to a man that died in active service than attend his burial or declare holiday in his honor. Doing these because Nigerians have been calling you out is not the best, rather being proactive is the best not reactive, you could as well send VP.\u201d\n\n@RSpotless1985, \u201dEffect of criticism on the President\u2019s attitude towards the death of these Officers.\u201d\n\n@Otagbuo_Orie, \u201dThe flag has been desecrated after the #EndSARS shooting of protesters. It has lost honor. May you get the wisdom to honor your #COAS and his soldiers who lost their lives. Amin.\u201d\n\n@Ahmad0048170681, \u201dYour attendance at their burial would have been more important than this useless directive.\u201d\n\n@chriscve4ik, \u201dDamage control. The worst form of government is the one that works on impulse. This is the main reason everything has fallen apart in the land.\u201d\n\n@Oviephilip01, \u201dHe should have attended the burial of his General and not using this as a smoke screen. Highly disappointing, you the handlers are not helping him at all, tell him the truth!\u201d\n\n@iamowokoko, \u201dAfter how many days in a working country the flag would have been flown at half immediately the news was confirmed but hey this is Nigeria where the commander in chief is an ordained ILLITERATE.\u201d\n\n@MarammaAzil, \u201dThe same people he failed to honour, the same people he failed to mourn with their families. At this point I will recite this nursery rhyme for him\u201d shame, shame, shame, shame!It\u2019s obvious Tom &Jerry get sense pass him.\u201d\n\n@PDP_2023, \u201dYou are just waking up?

          "text": "By Vincent Kalu\n\nConcerned about the state of the nation, particularly the serious security challenges facing the country, All Progressives Congress (APC) leaders in the South West met at Lagos House, Marina, yesterday.\n\nIn a communique read by former Interim National Chairman of the party, Chief Bisi Akande, the leaders endorsed the resolutions of southern governors who met recently in Asaba, Delta State on restructuring, state police and the ban on open grazing.\n\nThey expressed their strong opposition to separatist agitations and hate speeches,while urging those indulging in such to desist forthwith, they equally renewed their belief in the unity, stability and sustainability of the country.\n\nThey also commiserated with President Muhammadu Buhari, the military authorities, families of the Chief of Army Staff and other officers who died, and indeed the entire nation over last Friday\u2019s tragic plane crash in Kaduna.\n\nThe communique read in part: \u201cWe noted with significant concern the security situation in the country. Terrorism and violent criminality threaten many areas, adversely affecting the lives and livelihoods of too many innocent and peace-loving Nigerians.\n\n\u201cWhile mindful of the resource and other constraints facing the nation, we urge the Federal Government to continue to make the necessary expenditures and allocate sufficient resources to enable the military and security agencies to tackle the difficult security challenges confronting us. For Nigeria to overcome these challenges, we must do so with unity of purpose and action. The desire for peace and the chance for a prosperous and just society is universal and transcends all regional, religious or ethnic divisions.\n\n\u201cSadly, many public figures have made statements that sparked division and undermine the needed unity of purpose. We urge government at all levels, security agencies, and public leaders across the country to do everything possible to prevent tension so that we sustain the necessary unity to defeat these challenges to our national security. All responsible Nigerians must speak and act in a manner that strengthens our common cause against these common threats to our collective peace, justice and development.\n\n\u201cWe restate our abhorrence of violence as a means to achieve either political or economic power and influence. We strongly condemn violence of any form in any part of the country, regardless of ethnic or regional identity of the perpetrators of the violence or of the victims. Government must do all it can to protect potential victims and to assist those who have previously been victimised by terrorism or widespread banditry.\n\n\u201cWe hold to the view that true federalism where more power and resources are allocated to the states will be an essential part in strengthening society and improving democratic governance so that we beat the present challenges but also engender durable peace and security. True federalism and the reallocation of resources and authority that comes with it will empower the states to solve localised issues before they spread and transform into national ones.\n\n\u201cIn addition to mitigating political competition for control of the national government, greater federalism will empower grassroots economic development and political reforms that will stand as bulwarks against the terrorism and criminality now experienced in too many parts of the nation. A hallmark of this enhanced federalism will be the establishment of state police forces.\n\n\u201c We endorse the position of the Southern Governors taken at their May 11, 2021 summit in Asaba, Delta State, regarding ranching. We do so because such a decision will lessen tensions between farmers and herders while also helping the long-term economic viability of both the farming and herding communities. We are mindful of the short-term dislocation this might cause but are also mindful that this position is in the best interests of all parties concerned. We, therefore, recommend that the federal and state governments cooperate fully with each other to enact the necessary measures to encourage this more effective and modern method of cattle-rearing so that both farmers and herders can pursue their livelihoods with greater productivity and in a more cooperative relationship that minimizes the friction between these two important pillars of our agricultural economy.\n\nAt the event, National Leader of All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu said he had no favourite candidates for the forthcoming Lagos State local government election.\n\n\u201cI would like to be known that I have no preferred candidates for the upcoming local government primaries. I have no\n\nintention to endorse any of the people contesting for the party nomination in any election, whether for chairmanship or councillorship positions,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaker, House of Representatives, Femi Ggajabiamila was at the meeting.Three governors were also present: Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos: Dapo Abiodun, Ogun; Gboyega Oyetola, Osun.

Unequivocally, the governor\u2019s opinion on the Akure rally or any other of its ilk, is only to the effect that he is not opposed to any civil protest which is not in breach of the extant laws of the nation.\n\n\u201cHe neither believes nor supports the quest for the Yoruba nation outside of Nigeria in the manner canvassed.

Therefore, the vigour, zeal, leadership and candour displayed by Governor Akeredolu for a just and fair Nigeria is altruistic and borne out of patriotism for the nation as well as love for his people, the Yoruba ethnic nationality.

Negotiation means you give and take. In fact, right now, Nigeria is up for negotiation. I think that is where different groups come in to make their demands.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the nation is in danger and whatever anybody can do to prevent the worse, they should do it. There must be a way that we can save ourselves from self destruction. We cannot continue like this. Very few people are happy with the status quo. If we do not talk, we might end up killing one another.\u201d\n\nThe cleric also accused the National Assembly of neglecting its duties, stating that the role of the National Assembly is to discuss pressing issues plaguing the peace of the nation and to find possible solutions.\n\n\u201cUnder normal circumstances, it is the National Assembly that should handle these kind of things. The system is set up so that the National Assembly can challenge the government. But we have reached a situation where we have a National Assembly that is proud to be a rubber stamp. Somehow every member of that House has remained silent. We realise that there is no difference between the political parties;whether PDP or APC, nobody complains. Which means the things that are serious are not discussed.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we have reached a stage in Nigeria where we cannot trust politicians. TIV land, where are your politicians, what are they saying? What are the issues that they talk about in political gatherings? Are they blind to the fact that there\u2019s a bigger thing than who will win the next election?\u201d\n\nDuring the visit, the chairman, TPG, Prof. Zachary Gundu, alleged that the army, sometimes, supported the herdsmen attacks, as they look the other way instead of protecting the people.\n\nGundu, who described the Fulani livestock trade as a Trojan horse used to masquerade the true intentions of the herders, explained that the Fulani are merely riding on the back of the cow to grab land at the expense of indigenous crop farmers for the Fulani of the whole world.\n\n\u201cWe want the return of displaced people to their ancestral lands and full compensation be paid to those who have lost lives and property. The strategy to violently subsidise open grazing by blood and ancestral lands must stop.\u201d",

          "text": "By Seriki Adinoyi\n\nUnknown gunmen on Sunday night killed 14 persons in two attacks on Dong and Kwi communities on the outskirts of Jos, the Plateau State capital.\n\nThe assailants reportedly invaded the Dong community and shot at the people sporadically, killing at least seven, including women and children.\n\nThe attack on Kwi took a similar pattern, leaving at least another seven dead and several others injured.\n\nSpokesman of Police Command in Plateau state, Mr. Gabriel Ogaba, confirmed the incident. He said, \u201cOn Sunday 23/05/2021 at about 2000hrs, the Command received a distress call that yet to be identified gunmen came out suddenly from a nearby bush, invaded Dong Village, Jos South LGA and killed seven persons.\n\n\u201cA combined team of Policemen, Special Task Force, Vigilante operatives led by a Deputy Commissioner of Police, Department of Operation, raced swiftly to the scene but the hoodlums had already fled back into the bush.\n\n\u201cInvestigation is ongoing, frantic effort is on to arrest the fleeing suspects. Meanwhile, Security has been beefed up in that area to prevent escalation of violence.\u201d\n\nThose killed in Dong community are Chiyena Oboche, Divine Oboche, Victoria Matthew, Praise Matthew, Danladi Matthew, Mr. Gospel, and Mr. Istifanus.\n\nLamenting the attacks, the Senator representing Plateau North in the National Assembly, Istifanus Gyang, said in a statement that it was disheartening that, \u201cShortly after the Inspector General of Police issued a security alert on likely terror attacks on Jos and the FCT, the blood merchants have visited terror on Dong community, adjacent Wild Life Park, Jos and Kwi village, adjacent Yakubu Gowon Airport Jos where a total of 14 persons were butchered to dead, including children.\u201d\n\nCondemning the attacks, the Senator revealed that \u201cavailable information indicates that some persons at a meeting with the Police the week preceding the attacks vowed to visit mayhem on helpless communities. It is therefore incumbent on the Plateau State Police Commissioner to arrest and prosecute those very persons forthwith.\u201d\n\nHe also called for decisive action against persons that are known to security agencies for the serial killings, displacemment and forceful occupation of ancestral homelands of communities in Plateau North.

          "text": "\u2022Rewane, others call for increased investment, targeted interventions\n\nObinna Chima, Nume Ekeghe in Lagos and James Emejo in Abuja\n\nAnalysts yesterday urged the federal government to continue to develop policies to attract investments to Nigeria and to sustain targeted interventions in order for the country to sustain its positive economic growth trajectory.\n\nThe advice came as the country recorded a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate of 0.51 per cent (year-on-year) in the first quarter of 2021, (Q1 2021) compared with the 0.11 per cent recorded in the fourth quarter (Q4) 2020, according to figures the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released yesterday.\n\nThe data indicate two consecutive quarters of growth.\n\nHowever, the Q1 2021 growth rate was slower than the 1.87 per cent growth recorded in Q1 2020, but higher than the 0.11 per cent in Q4, which represented a slow, but continuous recovery of the economy.\n\nBut the GDP growth rate was still below the country\u2019s population growth rate of about three per cent.\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Gross Domestic Product Report (Q1 2021) released yesterday by the statistical agency, quarter-on-quarter, real GDP grew at -13.93 per cent in Q1 compared to Q4, reflecting a generally slower pace of economic activities at the start of the year.\n\nIn the quarter under review, aggregate GDP stood at N40.01 trillion in nominal terms. The performance was higher when compared to the N35.64 trillion recorded in Q1 2020, indicating a year-on-year nominal growth rate of 12.25 per cent.\n\nHowever, real GDP in Q1 stood at N16.83 trillion.\n\nAccording to the NBS, the nominal GDP growth rate in Q1 2021 was higher relative to 12.01 per cent growth recorded in Q1 2020 as well as the 10.07 per cent growth recorded in the preceding quarter.\n\nThe oil sector accounted for 9.25 per cent of aggregate real GDP in Q1 2021, slightly lower than 9.5 per cent recorded in Q1 2020 but higher than the 5.87 per cent in the preceding quarter.\n\nOn the other hand, the non-oil sector accounted for 90.75 per cent of aggregate GDP in Q1, higher than the 90.50 per cent in Q1 2020 but lower than the 94.13 per cent recorded in Q4.\n\nWhile the oil GDP contracted -2.21 per cent in Q1 compared to a contraction of 19.76 per cent in Q4 2020 and a growth of 5.06 per cent in Q1 2020, the non-oil GDP grew 0.79 per cent in Q1 compared to 1.69 per cent in Q4.\n\nIn the period under review, average daily oil production stood at 1.72 million barrels per day (mbpd), or 0.35mbpd lower than the average daily production of 2.07mbpd recorded in Q1 2020, but higher than the production volume of 1.56mbpd in Q4.\n\nAgriculture contributed 21.42 per cent to nominal GDP in Q1 higher than the 20.88 per cent in Q1 2020 but lower than the 24.23 per cent in Q1 2021.\n\nAlso, manufacturing contributed to 9.93 per cent to real GDP, higher than the 9.65 per cent recorded in Q1 2020 and 8.60 per cent in Q4.\n\nCommenting on the performance of the economy in separate interviews with THISDAY, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Financial Derivatives Company Limited, Mr. Bismarck Rewane, described the growth level as, \u201cas a move in the right direction, but very slow.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBut Q2 2021 is going to be much more successful.\u201d\n\nHowever, Rewane stressed the need for policies to continue to encourage investments in the country.\n\n\u201cThere are a couple of things that are happening that are positive. There is exchange rate convergence happening; interest rates are beginning to climb back up and there are certain amounts of clarity and inflation came down marginally.\n\n\u201cBut we still have the challenge of fuel subsidy and whether we like it or not, we have to do it. But the good news is that oil prices are high and our production is increasing and growth is beginning to creep back up,\u201d he stated.\n\nWhen asked if the challenge of insecurity was not going to hinder the current growth trajectory, Rewane, who is a member of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s Economic Advisory Council, said: \u201cAngola had 28 years of civil war and they were producing oil. Yes, insecurity is not a good thing, but we have to contain it. I think insecurity will not stop trade, construction, ICT, real estate and the production of crude oil.\n\n\u201cBut insecurity affects agriculture and food prices. So, insecurity is a problem for agriculture and inflation and we have to deal with it. Insecurity is something we don\u2019t need at all, but we can overcome it.\u201d\n\nAlso, Chairman, Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), Abuja branch, Prof. Uche Uwaleke, said the Q1 GDP report reflected an economy already on the path of gradual economic recovery with a positive real GDP growth rate following that recorded in the previous quarter.\n\nHe said although still weak at 0.51 per cent, \u201cit is interesting to note that the manufacturing sector is now out of the negative territory increasing from -1.51 per cent to 3.40 per cent.\u201d\n\nHe said it was noteworthy to observe the moderation in the negative performance in sectors like trade, accommodation and education.\n\nHe added: \u201cIt is clear that the improved performance in the oil sector relative to the previous quarter was largely on account of improvement in average crude oil production\n\n\u201cBut the report also reveals disturbing pattern in the real GDP growth rate. Declines were recorded in critical sectors of the economy such as agriculture, ICT, real estate and transportation. This may not be unconnected with the rising insecurity in the country.\n\n\u201cThat the non-oil sector dropped should be of concern to both the fiscal and monetary authorities.\u201d\n\nUwaleke added that the increase recorded in the health sector from 3.05 per cent in Q4 of 2020 to 4.65 per cent showed that the country is winning the war against the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAn economist, Dr. Muhammad Rislanuddeen, stated that although Nigerian economy had for the last few years been having sub-optimal growth below population growth rate, the \u201creport is very positive, especially given the positive growth also recorded in fourth quarter of 2020.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, this further indicated that the economy is picking up, albeit in a crawling, epileptic manner, from the challenges of COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRislanuddeen also attributed the positive performance partly to the various stimulus packages of the federal government towards supporting the gradual consolidation of GDP growth after the economy sank into recession mid-2020.\n\nHowever, he added that more targeted interventions should be done, especially in growth enhancing policies and programme to consolidate on the recovery.\n\nHe said this would help to reverse the current economic stagflation \u2013 high inflation of 18 per cent and unemployment rate of 33.3 per cent.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn addition, policies on fuel subsidy and foreign exchange market need to be much clearer and predictable to the private sector to support more investment, more jobs and sustainable growth.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the Managing Director, Karios Capital, Mr. Sam Chidoka, said: \u201cI think it is important that as a nation, we realise that any growth that does not match or stay close to our population growth is not the best for us.\n\n\u201cAs a nation, we need to be growing at around four to five per cent consistently. So, in my opinion, compared to where we are coming from in terms of going into a recession, it is good, but compared to where we should be as a nation, we are doing well and there is still a lot of room for improvement.\n\n\u201cFrom the figures I\u2019ve seen, oil GDP contracted while it is non-oil that helped us to push the growth up in Q1 2021.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is focus on the real engine of growth, which is the small and medium scale industries which can catalyse growth in a multiple of levels in terms of employment, productivity and more for us to see a better growth in Q2 and maybe towards the end year.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says govs\u2019 recommendation anti-people\n\nOur Reporters\n\nThe organised labour at the weekend cautioned the National Economic Council (NEC) against approving a recommendation by the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) seeking a N385 pump price for petrol.\n\nState affiliates of the organised labour, in separate interviews with THISDAY, said doing so will unleash hardships on the people and heat up the polity.\n\nTheir warning came ahead of a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), scheduled for Abuja tomorrow, to deliberate on the issue.\n\nThe 36 governors, under the auspices of the NGF, at a meeting last week, had endorsed the N385 per litre pump price recommended by a committee set up by NEC, and headed by the Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir el-Rufai.\n\nHowever, the recommendation is subject to approval by NEC, chaired by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.\n\nAlthough the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Mr. Timipre Sylva, had at the weekend allayed fears of an increase in petrol price, the various states\u2019 chapters of the labour unions vowed to resist the proposed price regime, if approved.\n\nReacting to the governors\u2019 proposal, the Chairman of the Niger State chapter of the NLC, Mr. Yakubu Garba, told THISDAY at the weekend that there would be a \u201cgreat revolt across the country if the pump price of petrol is increased to N385 per litre as proposed by the Nigerian Governors\u2019 Forum\u201d.\n\nGarba stated that the workers would resist the proposed price, as the proposal by the governors is not only anti-workers but also anti-people.\n\nAccording to him, the position of the \u201cstate NLC is the same with that of the national leadership of the congress, which is that government should make the refineries work.\n\n\u201cWhen the refineries are functional, they will serve two purposes \u2013 local supply of fuel will be adequate and at the right price, in addition to the country generating a lot of income from the export of petroleum products\u201d.\n\nGarba added that many Nigerians would also be employed.\n\nHe urged the NEC to reject the proposal by the governors, as approving it will heat up the nation.\n\nThe Sokoto State chapter of NLC said it would resist any attempt by the federal government to accept the proposal of state governors to increase the pump price to N385 against the current N165.\n\nIn an interview with THISDAY, the chairman of the council in the state, Mr. Aminu Umar Ahmad, wondered why the state governors who were supposed to care for the welfare of the citizens would sit down to take such a \u201cheinous decision.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cLet me tell you; I\u2019m disappointed at the action and attitude of the governors in taking such a decision that has adverse effects on the people.\u201d\n\nUmar added that the proposal by the governors would never see the light of the day, as labour will fight it with the last drop of their blood.\n\nOn his part, the Chairman of NLC in Zamfara State, Mr. Sani Magajinrafinya, told THISDAY that: \u201cThe action of the governors is a betrayal of public trust.\u201d\n\nSani urged the governors to look beyond crude oil and diversify their states\u2019 sources of internally generated revenue.\n\nHe also stated that labour will use all arsenal at its disposal to resist any attempt to increase petrol pump price.\n\nHe confirmed that the NLC executive will meet tomorrow to deliberate on the matter.\n\nAlso, in his reaction, the Chairman of NLC in Kebbi State, Mr. Umar Halidu Hassan, said the action of the governors was a breach of agreement they entered with their people.\n\n\u201cI think the governors were not in the right mood when they took this decision,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to him, any attempt to implement the proposal will trigger a nationwide industrial crisis.\n\nAlso, the Oyo State Chairman of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), Mr. Emmanuel Ogundiran, said the union would resist the proposed increment of price of petrol to N385 per litre.\n\nOgundiran told THISDAY that the governors have continued to constitute themselves into anti-workers and anti-people group by throwing up policies that would further impoverish Nigerians.\n\nHe added that the NGF is not known to the Nigerian constitution.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat I am very sure of is that labour would not sit idly and accept this from the governors.\u201d\n\nOn his part, the state Chairman of the NLC, Mr. Kayode Martins, said the union would not support such increment in the price of petrol.\n\nHe described the governors as enemies of the country who do not care about the hardship Nigerians are facing daily.\n\nHe stated that the position of the national leadership of the union would be binding on the state chapter.\n\nAkwa Ibom State chapter of the NLC also rejected the proposal by the governors, saying it will not see the light of the day.\n\nThe state Chairman of NLC, Mr. Sunny James, told THISDAY that \u201cthere is no way we could accept such a thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNLC is the only hope of a common man at the moment in the country. It is totally unacceptable to allow the governors to slam that kind of hardship on the workers.\n\n\u201cThey have the right to take their decision, but we will not allow them to implement such a thing. We are waiting for a directive from the national body. We are going to have an NLC executive meeting to look at all the situations in the country,\u201d he stated.\n\nAlso in an interview with THISDAY, the Nasarawa State Chairman of the NLC, Mr. Yusuf Sarki Iyah, described the governors\u2019 proposal as unfortunate.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet me use this medium to describe this call by the governors as an unfortunate call. It is uncalled for at this moment when the impact of COVID-19 pandemic is still biting hard on the citizens of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIya stated that there would be a national executive council meeting of the NLC tomorrow to discuss the petrol price increase proposal by the governors.\n\nThe Enugu State chapter of the NLC has also rejected the governors\u2019 proposal.\n\nThe state Chairman of the NLC, Mr. Virginus Nwobodo, said the national leadership of the union had summoned a meeting for tomorrow for the various organs of the congress to take a position.\n\nHe said it would not be easy for the governors to achieve their aim because they would not be the only ones to make inputs about petrol deregulation and increase in price of the product.\n\nThe first Vice Chairman of the Kwara State chapter of NLC, Alhaji Murtala Saheed Olayinka, told THISDAY in Ilorin that the planned fuel price hike would bring untold hardship to the workers and Nigerians, adding that the union will not support it.\n\nHe said labour would resist such move so as to avoid any burden on the average workers.\n\n\u201cI want to also say that even if the payment of minimum wage is implemented for workers today, the hike in fuel prices would not bring new lease of life to us and the entire Nigerians,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Chairman of the TUC in Ekiti State, Mr. Sola Adigun, said that the proposed full deregulation of the petrol sector could only take off when the refineries started working at optimal capacity.\n\nAdigun\u2019s counterpart in the NLC, Kolapo Olatunde, stated that governors\u2019 proposal can\u2019t be implemented at this time when the people are groaning under harsh economic condition.\n\nHe told THISDAY in Ado Ekiti that though the body backs full deregulation through absolute removal of the corruption-laden petrol subsidy, such a decision could only be enforced when refineries are working at optimal capacity.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are making it clear and as directed by our national leadership that we will resist implementation of new pump price regime, if our refineries are still moribund.\u201d\n\nOlatunde, who spoke through the union\u2019s Secretary, Eunice Akinyemi, said increasing the pump price to as high as N385 as mulled by the governors would foist on Nigerians dehumanising economic conditions.\n\nAlso reacting, the Ebonyi State chapter of the NLC described the proposed new pump price of fuel as a scam and unacceptable.\n\nThe Chairman of the state NLC, Ikechukwu Nwafor, told THISDAY that the governors\u2019 proposal was dead on arrival, as labour would mobilise all strategies to scuttle it.\n\nNwafor said: \u201cWe will not only protest on the streets, there are many strategies that NLC will deploy to ensure the proposal is completely scuttled. The new proposal is a scam and not acceptable. We have said it that there is no justification for the past new pump price.\u201d\n\nHowever, Leonard Noah, who is the factional chairman of the state NLC, recognised by the state government, said he would only implement the directives of the national body.\n\nThe Chairman of the NLC in Ondo State, Mr. Sunday Adeleye, told THISDAY that the state NLC was already discussing with the national headquarters, adding that a meeting has been called for tomorrow.\n\nSimilarly, the state Chairman of the TUC, Helen Odofun, told THISDAY that any increase in fuel price would affect the economy.\n\n\u201cNigerians have been impoverished already and any attempt to further make life difficult for them shall be resisted,\u201d she added.\n\nAlso, the Chairman of NLC in Abia State, Uchenna Obigwe, condemned the recommendation by the governors.\n\n\u201cIt is not the best policy and not in the interest of ordinary Nigerians who are already impoverished by government,\u201d he said, adding that it will lead to astronomical increase in the prices of goods and services.\n\nThe Kaduna State Chairman of the NLC, Mr. Ayuba Suleiman, while reacting to the governors\u2019 proposal, told THISDAY that \u201cit is just a proposal and it is not yet approved. The federal government has also come out to say that it does not intend to increase anything.\n\n\u201cThe NNPC also said it is only the federal government that can ask them to increase petroleum price not governors. The NLC is going to meet on Tuesday on the matter and a press statement will be issued on the matter. So you have to wait for the statement,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chairman of Edo State Chapter of the NLC, Mr. Sunny Osayande, said the branch would wait for outcome of negotiation between its national secretariat.\n\n\u201cI know our national leadership is tackling the matter with both the federal government on the proposed increase by the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF),\u201d he said.\n\nThe state Chairman of TUC, Marshal Ohue, said TUC at the national level was handling the issue.\n\nOn his part, the Chairman of the NLC in Katsina State, Dr. Hussain Hamisu Yanduna, told THISDAY that the federal government had no intention to increase petrol price to N385 as proposed by the governors.\n\n\u201cGovernment has said it very clear that they have no intention to increase the price of the petrol,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nNigeria lost at least 52 million barrels of crude oil between May and December 2020 to COVID-19-induced compulsory supply cuts imposed by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), according to a data by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).\n\nWhile Nigeria\u2019s crude oil production level before the curbs was two million barrels per day (bpd), recent data from NNPC indicated that while the average daily crude oil production for the entire year stood at 1.775 million bpd, total production for the whole year was 704.741 million barrels.\n\nIn January, the country recorded the highest production level of 2.072 million bpd while last December, NNPC recorded its lowest production of 1.419 bpd.\n\nOn the average, the difference in production of crude oil between January and December, 2020, for instance was 652,967 barrels, that is, the highest and lowest production levels.\n\nAlthough the document did not separate the quantity of crude oil produced from condensates, with a 225,000 bpd approximate under-production, at least 6.75 million bpd of crude oil was shut in to comply with the oil cartel\u2019s agreement.\n\nThe figures showed that NNPC fulfilled its pledge to rev up production to hit its targeted three million litres, when the pandemic broke out, slashing average daily production to 1.74 million barrels in the first instance in May after the OPEC intervention.\n\nIn June, production further reduced to 1.68 million barrels per day on the average, 1.65 million bpd in July and 1.64 million bpd in August.\n\nFollowing the virus-induced plunge in oil prices, OPEC and its allies known as OPEC+ in May last year, embarked on the largest coordinated oil production cut regime in history, agreeing to cut 9.7 million bpd in an effort to support the market, amounting to about 10 per cent of global oil supply.\n\nHowever, according to the data from NNPC\u2019s market and production activities, in September, oil drilling further dipped to 1.59 million bpd, but slightly increased to 1.61 million bpd in October before falling again in November to 1.54 million and tumbling in December to 1.419 million barrels.\n\nIn all, the Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) portion of the total national output took the lion\u2019s share of oil drilled in 2020, hitting 281.1 million barrels of the total 704.7 million barrels of crude oil produced during the year.\n\nThe Joint Venture (JV) agreements yielded 226.5 million barrels, while the Alternative Financing (AF) sources resulted in the production of 75.2 million barrels.\n\nIn addition, the activities of the National Petroleum Development Company (NPDC), an NNPC subsidiary, yielded 72 million barrels in the year under consideration, while the independent marginal fields generated 49.6 million barrels in 2020.\n\nThe figures reflect the huge impact the outbreak of the virus had on the international oil market and the efforts by OPEC to curb output to rein in the falling prices, which early last year tumbled to about $10 for Brent, Nigeria\u2019s benchmark, while West Texas Intermediate (WTO), America\u2019s benchmark reeled in the negative territory.\n\nAlso, national gas production was 1.93 bcf from JV, 593mmcf from PSC, 440mmcf from NPDC, totalling a production of 2.9 bcf during the year.\n\nBefore the pandemic, the NNPC had set a target of three million bpd oil production, with the Group Managing Director of the corporation, Mallam Mele Kyari, stating that the drilling of Kolmani River III well was already ongoing, with a high prospect of finding oil.\n\nThe corporation also said seismic data collection was ongoing in the Bida Basin as well as re-launching of exploration work in the Chad Basin, while several alternative funding facilities had been secured for the NPDC to facilitate the development of additional assets.\n\nBut that did not materialise as contrary to the projection, the corporation and its partners embarked upon shutting down several platforms to ramp up compliance with the OPEC cuts, which has led to some price stability in the international oil market.\n\nThe NNPC report also revealed that the NPDC December 2019 to December 2020 cumulative production from all fields totalled 72,029,656 barrels of crude oil, translating to an average daily production of 181,435 barrels per day.\n\nIn addition, at an average oil price of $50.78/barrel and exchange rate of N379/$ at the time, the domestic crude oil lifted by NNPC was valued at $382.8 million or a naira equivalent of N145,094,050,521.81 for last December.\n\nThe remaining crude oil lifted for export was valued at $24.3 million at an average price of $48.92/barrel, with the total value of crude oil lifted on the account of NNPC in December 2020 being about $407.1 million.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nigeria\u2019s Full Of Cracks That Need Fixing Not Negotiations By Owei Lakemfa",
          "text": "A country, like a multi-storey building, may not collapse of a sudden; it starts with cracks. The cracks maybe a symptom of greater magnitude that might not be immediately visible. They may be due to improper structural design and specifications, structural stress, poor construction or poor maintenance. The solution is not to deny the cracks or paper over them, but to repair them and subject the building to structural integrity.\n\nWe are buffeted by empty phraseologies like \u2018the unity of Nigeria cannot be negotiated\u2019. This is by the very people who through their mindless actions, clannish, exclusionary, ethno-religious and regional myopia daily assault that unity.\n\nThere are those who claim Nigeria is ordained by God, has come to stay and can, therefore, not be divided. These are mainly sycophants. No country is natural; all countries were built by humans and are subject to wear and tear. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, USSR, was a super power and a nuclear power house. Whoever thought it could crumble like a pack of cards or dividing like amoeba into 15 different countries? Who thought the power house called Yugoslavia could disintegrate into seven countries: Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Kosovo, Macedonia and Serbia? Is the Nigerian structure stronger than Yugoslavia or the USSR? Certainly not.\n\nAn African proverb says the sun shines on all homes in a society, be it a crumbling hut or an intimidating mansion. Part of the causes of Nigeria\u2019s dislocation is that those who claim they are the big boys, think they can monopolise the sun and decide whether it should shine or not on the smaller federating houses. They forget that the smallness of the needle does not mean it can be easily swallowed by the big cock.\n\nOwei Lakemfa\n\nWe are in a house, and some people are digging round the foundation; our reaction should not be to continue shouting that they should not do so, or keep threatening them. It is better to find out why they are trying to dig up the foundation, dialogue and persuade them not just to stop, but also to repair the foundation.\n\nThere are those who have put the Nigerian building into improper use and have now endangered it. The solution is not lamentations, but what concrete steps can be taken to remedy the situation. In the first instance, are they ready to mend their ways or want to continue in their destructive ways? Do other inhabitants want to continue to tolerate or accept this destructive and disruptive behaviour?\n\nThere are inhabitants of the Nigerian house who think the solution to the defective structure is to restore the building to the large open spaces it was before mini-flats were carved out. So, they call for internal restructuring as a solution to the defective structure. They may yet discover that their own part of the building also has its own serious defects which cannot be fixed by singing of a glorious past and white-washing it.\n\nThere are those who think the solution is to protect their own floor of the multi-storey building forgetting that one foundation carries the whole structure and that if it gives way, the entire building will come crashing down.\n\nThere are some, including men of God, who have no faith and think the best thing is for Nigerians to have a so-called \u2018Plan B\u2019 which is to abandon the Nigerian structure and take shelter in other structures as refugees. The Holy Books of such people do not contain stories of prophets who stand by the truth, speak the truth to power, and rather than flee, stand to fight the ungodly tormentors of the people. If all such priests do is gather the riches of the country and flee at the slightest hint of distress like birds of passage, where then is their faith? They also have allies in their profession who are apologists, negotiators and spokespersons of the powerful and their bandit handbags.\n\nIt is a failure to think things through that has led to some leaders, as I said earlier, declaring that the \u2018unity of Nigeria is not negotiable\u2019. It is illogical to declare that a building, with visible cracks all round it, should not be talked about and possible solution discussed as a way forward. Normal people do not allow or disallow negotiations about cracks in a building, they fix them.\n\nThere are also the myopic who believe that all they need do is bring in more of their kinsmen to live in the Nigerian building so they can seize a few more rooms. This is idiocy because they do not know the agenda of those they are importing, especially when these people have no building skills, professional competence, no stake in the Nigerian project and bring nothing to the table except violence. These imported bandits are mainly from rundown or makeshift structures that have collapsed or are collapsing. In any case, what logic says the solution to fixing a building that shows distress is to bring in squatters?\n\nThere are the caretakers of the structure whose primary preoccupation is the common purse and how to utilize it for their private ends. Their specialisation include imposing incompetent workmen and women and supervisors, buying fake materials, decking themselves in flowing gowns and appearing to be religious.\n\nAs members of an extended family, we doubtlessly have wayward, parochial, selfish children and of course, elders whose sense of wisdom is destructive as they exhibit signs of senility. But we also have intelligent and well behaved children, and elders who can point us to the direction of collective development. One of our major challenges is that the culture of the former has been allowed to permeate and dominate. Over the years, we have reversed the law of osmosis which dictates that the stronger solution draws the weaker solution.\n\nGiven our cumulative 29-year military brigandage and misrule, we cannot but be in dire straits. Even when urchins are still noisily singing the praises of our leaders as they drag the country to Golgotha, those with a sense of decency and social justice, need to reverse this trend.\n\nWho knows whether the cracks we see all over have not affected the structural integrity of the country. If it has not, then all we need do is carry out the necessary repairs, depending on the exact cause or causes of the cracks. If it has, we can collectively agree to rebuild the structure.\n\nA structure, like a country, is not a religion to which no enquiry can be made, or re-examined in the light of advanced technology and knowledge. So, we cannot exhibit the foolery that once a building has been constructed, it can no longer be rebuilt.",

          "text": "But some factors \u2013 including the Federal Reserve\u2019s COVID-induced printing of dollars \u2013 fuelled an all-time peak of $28,000 by December 2020. As countries (like Nigeria, South Africa and Turkey) with weaker currencies copied the Fed\u2019s money printing, Bitcoin surged in 2021: crossing $30,000 in January, $50,000 in February and $60,000 in March.\n\nAfrican investors and traders welcomed this rise as a hedge against assets depreciating in local currencies and dollar inflation. But last week provided a reality check on that expectation: crypto is also vulnerable to winds that affect fiat money.\n\nThe dip morphed into a crash after China\u2019s State Council signalled a crackdown on Bitcoin mining and trading. China is the 2nd largest economy in the world, with unrivalled cultural and political power to march their 1.4 billion citizens in order and swing global markets. Also, most Bitcoin has been mined in China for the last four years.\n\nTo be sure, China wants to harness blockchain technology. They are piloting a digital currency that they hope will be the future of money. But they are actively opposed to crypto for reasons that will be familiar to Kenyans, Nigerians and others in Africa whose central banks have opposed crypto: the problem of transactions not being traceable.\n\nOver the coming weeks and months, we will know exactly what China will do to stifle crypto.\n\n\u201cThe case for Bitcoin hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Eloho Omame, co-founder of FirstCheck Africa, a Nigerian startup investment firm, told TechCabal in the wake of the recent crash.\n\n\u201cCrypto markets were always volatile. So honestly it\u2019s not fun, but it\u2019s not unexpected. Long term, I\u2019m bullish. So it doesn\u2019t really matter what happens today.\u201d\n\nBut the warning is clear: the crypto crowd may be confident about the future, but pressure from unique actors like China will have significant sway.",

          "text": "Two weeks after the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) said it had issued 54 million people their national identity numbers, it is in the process of deploying a Device Management System (DMS).\n\nThe NCC said in a statement, \u201cTo curtail the counterfeit mobile phone market, discourage mobile phone theft, enhance national security, protect consumer interest, increase revenue generation for the government, reduce the rate of kidnapping, mitigate the use of stolen phones for crime, and facilitate blocking or tracing of stolen mobile phones and other smart devices, one of the means to achieve this is through the deployment of Device Management System.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe implementation of a Centralised Equipment Identity Register otherwise known as Device Management System will serve as a repository for keeping records of all registered mobile phones\u2019 International Mobile Equipment Identity and owners of such devices.\u201d\n\nDespite the government hinging the policy on fighting insecurity, there are privacy concerns that the government can easily abuse access to such data.\n\nDoes this new requirement infringe on privacy?\n\nAs of March 2020, Nigeria was one of eleven countries with mandatory biometric SIM registration laws. One of the arguments against compulsory registration is that it allows the government to track SIM card owners and makes it easier to track calls and messages.\n\nA Device Management System will take this step even further, allowing the government even more access to what should be private information. While the argument from the government is that it improves security, there\u2019s the risk that the government can spy on its citizens.\n\nGeneralized surveillance in countries like Nigeria with weak security agencies controlled by the executive can become police states where opposition leaders can be tracked and arrested. But with the rise in crime in Nigeria in the past year, it is easy to understand the government\u2019s argument.\n\nDoes the government\u2019s argument make sense?\n\nIn a 2016 paper, \u201ccomplete mobile phone registration has many generalised benefits to the society especially in combating crime.\u201d\n\nWith increasing reports of kidnappings taking place around the country, a centralised registry may help to find bad actors even quicker, and it could help combat the sale of stolen phones. When there\u2019s a central registry for IMEI, the police could identify the owners of lost and stolen phones thousands of times daily.\n\nA critical part of this paper argues for a central database of mobile phones that law enforcement agencies presumably can access. Yet, it is this central assumption that still provides a problem.\n\nWhether Nigerians trust that the government will not abuse access to such critical information remains to be seen.\n\n*An earlier version of this report stated that the NCC asked telcos to register the IMEI numbers of their subscribers; the NCC has now clarified its position",

          "text": "Exceptional results require a high-performance team but how do you build one?\n\nIn what can be termed a mini-MBA session, Seni Sulyman and Chichi Offodile in an edition of TechCabal Live shared expert advice on how to build high-performance teams.\n\nSeni Sulyman is the founder and community manager of Black Ops, a network of top African operators building great companies and cultures across the world. Before starting Black Ops, Seni helped scale Andela\u2019s operations from series B to series D with over 1,000 team members across US and Africa offices.\n\nChichi Offodile is the COO of Helium Health. She has over 15 years of experience working at EMC/Dell and Deloitte.\n\nTheir Journey at Helium Health and Andela\n\nThe conversation begins with Chichi and Seni talking about their journeys at Helium Health and Andela respectively. They both stepped in when each company had a viable product/service, some traction, and funding.\n\nFor Chichi, she was brought in when Helium Health had figured out what it was doing but was uncertain about how to move forward. Her strength lies in figuring out how to build a sustainable company and that\u2019s what she set out to do via a transformation plan.\n\nSeni joined Andela in 2016 when the company was in only two markets \u2013 Nigeria and Kenya. At that time there had been a few leadership exits and the general employee morale was low. His mandate was to stabilize the ship. Which he did before focusing on operational expansion.\n\nHow do you begin the transformation process?\n\nFor Seni, he believes the transformation process should start with the why\u2014 otherwise known as communicating a vision that galvanises everything. At Andela, he had to create a modified version of the vision that was more compelling to the team.\n\nAfter clearly articulating the vision, decide on the steps to take to achieve the vision. This involves setting performance indicators and reviews, so it\u2019s clear what the goals are and whether people are hitting them.\n\nHow does a high achiever culture permeate a company?\n\nBoth Seni and Chichi believe that it starts with hiring people with the potential to be high achievers and then setting a good example as a leader.\n\nGiving people room to execute the tasks they\u2019ve set out to do is also an important factor.\n\n\u201cI make sure that leadership allows people to be creative. Allow people to execute. If you don\u2019t give people the opportunity to succeed, you\u2019ll be stifling them. I motivate people by allowing them to set their goals and fix a timeline to achieve it,\u201d Chichi said.\n\nBuilding cohesiveness within the team\n\nGreat things are rarely ever done by one person. How do we ensure that the team sticks together?\n\nSeni believes the people have to align on the why. This alignment has to start from the top, there has to be a unified strategy at the top level.\n\n\u201cStrategy is a lot more of what you\u2019re saying No to than what you\u2019re saying Yes to,\u201d he said.\n\nCiting an example of when he had to build cohesiveness within a team, he said that during his time at Bristow he noticed that two senior executives weren\u2019t aligned on the company\u2019s direction. One person wanted a high-end airline, while the other person wanted a low-cost airline.\n\nTo resolve this issue, he had to call both of them together to iron out their differences before the company could move forward.\n\nHow do you get teams to keep going without burning out\n\nA common challenge high-performance teams face is that they experience burnout due to the intense and fast-paced nature of work.\n\nSeni responded to this question by stating that he thinks that the issue with the pandemic and people experiencing burnout is that a lot of people were thrown into remote work without warning.\n\nThe solution to this is to encourage people to take time off work since the line between work and rest can be blurry. As a leader, you have to practice what you preach.\n\nIn order to encourage people to take some time off work, he often schedules his emails sent in the middle of the night to go out by the next morning to avoid creating unnecessary work or a sense of urgency.\n\nAnother activity that helps is social gatherings, it\u2019s important for companies to have occasional fun hours. One-on-one sessions are also helpful. These are open-ended meetings with employees, where the manager finds out how they\u2019re doing as human beings and what\u2019s going on in their lives.\n\nHe ends with a caveat \u2013 it\u2019s a little difficult to build a high-performing team without working really hard.\n\n\u201cYou cannot work 80 hours a week every week, you\u2019ll burn. You also can\u2019t work 40 hours every week and materially change the world.\u201d\n\nYou have to be thoughtful and deliberate in getting work done.\n\nChichi adds that she believes companies also need to do two things.\n\nThey have to be deliberate with capacity planning. If you\u2019re growing as a company, you can\u2019t expect to have the same set of people working at the same level while the company is expanding. You need to hire more people or adjust people\u2019s roles.\n\nBe open about flex working. The output is the most important thing, let people work in ways that work for them.\n\nAt what point should a company hire an operations lead?\n\nChichi\u2019s response to this question is that the first thing to do is to have a thought process to manage operations but as soon as you have funds for it, please hire.\n\nWatch the full conversation here",

The Harmonized Nigeria Living Standard Survey reports that Nigeria spends about N25 billion daily on food items. There is a high propensity to consume but a low propensity to save. This is quite alarming for a developing nation. High consumption would mean low savings, low investment, and low capital formation.\u201d said Tobi Dada, Head, Operations at Richvest 360.\n\nDada added that \u201cThere are a lot of investment companies that have made investment easy and provided a lot of people with smart ways to grow their money. Richvest 360 is one of the leading investment companies in Nigeria that offers people opportunities to build their financial legacy by providing multiple sponsorship channels in the industry of your interest.\u201d\n\nRichvest is looking at empowering several young Nigerians with the platform.\n\nABOUT RICHVEST 360 \u2013 Richvest 360 is an investment company that is on a mission to raise young, smart 21st-century investors and help people make smart financial decisions.

With over 5,000 users and 3,000 active users, they have successful projects that have been completed thus opening more investment opportunities for the users.\n\nRichvest 360 partnered with Eatrichfarms and collaboratively raised funds for their Greenhouse Farm, Eatrich Water factory and also with Martify Supercenter opening two outlets in Lagos among other amazing projects. All these were achieved in less than a year which is mind blowing.\n\nThe bigger picture for Richvest360 is to bring banking to the unbanked.

          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].\n\nGhanaians to re-register SIMs | Newsbites\n\nMay 17: New Episode!

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nObservers in aviation industry note that in February, a military aircraft crashed near Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, in which seven person died.\n\nThey recalled that in 2021 alone, we had three crashes associated with the military \u2014 in Feb, 27, March 31 and the third one was in May 21.\n\nAn aviation consultant has also observed that there has been an increase in the number of plane crashes and victims in recent times.\n\nAviation consultant retired Group Capt. John Ojikutu, therefore, identified some gaps that could have caused the recent plane crashes.\n\nOjikutu said that the nation\u2019s airports had had some deficiencies in terms of safety equipment over the years that might have led to crashes.\n\nHe said that weather had been one of the major causes of most of the crashes in the country, such as the ADC and Sosoliso crashes in 2005 and 2006.\n\nOn the crash of NAF Beachcraft that killed the Chief of Army Staff and 10 others, he said that the statement by the Chief of Defence Staff indicated that inclement weather was responsible.\n\nHe observed that one of the problems that led to the accidents in 2005, 2006 was also as a result of inclement weather.\n\n\u201cThat was the thing that caused the crash of ADC in Abuja and Sosoliso in Port Harcourt and other one like that.\n\n\u201cIt was the wind shear and the government put in money to install wind shear system in all international airports.\n\n\u201cI think if I am not making mistake, somewhere along he line, all airports were installed with wind shear system.\n\n\u201cThe question I keep asking everyday is do we have proper periodic maintenance of these equipment because these are seasonal incidents that have to do with weather.\n\n\u201cThis happens at low level and it happens when you are about to land or about to take off along the approach path.\n\n\u201cI also read that the said aircraft was diverted from military to civilian airport because there must have been a weather issue and I am sure that military airport there has wind shear system.\n\n\u201cMy worry is that are we sure the wind shear system in Kaduna airport is working,?\u201d he asked.\n\nWind shear, sometimes referred to as wind gradient, is a difference in wind speed or direction over a relatively short distance in the atmosphere.\n\nOjikutu said that the recent bird strike incidents was also worrisome.\n\nHe alleged that equipment were procured for bird strike to some airports, especially in Lagos sometimes in 2006 or 2007.\n\nHe alleged further that there were concerns about whether or not those equipment were still functional.\n\nThe expert also spoke on the need for proper oversight on the air worthiness of aircraft and safety of the airport where aircraft are landing.\n\nBut a security expert, Dr Kabir Adamu, Managing Director, Beacon Consulting Ltd. Abuja, pleaded with the federal government to evaluate the nation\u2019s airport and it fleets to ascertain their current state.\n\nAdamu noted that it had become imperative due to the incessant plane crashes in the country.\n\nThe expert decried the current state of the nation\u2019s airports, particularly the fleets and the condition of service for the pilots.\n\nAccording to him, once the evaluation is carried out, then the authorities or the agencies involved can actually know the actual cause of the frequent crashes.\n\n\u201cWith this, the authority involved can now come to the conclusion whether the challenges need to be addressed immediately, or to ground all the aircraft.\n\n\u201cHowever, globally, there are three or four reasons that are attributed to air crashes in any part of the world.\n\n\u201cIt can be mechanical, human error, act of nature and shot down as a result of hostile activities.\n\n\u201cThis is usually associated with conflict areas where there malicious act of certain individual or group.\n\n\u201cSo, whether the regulatory body released report or not, these four areas are the likely consequences.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, only a thorough investigation will reveal which of these is more frequent in the country because we do not have the technology to determine what the reasons are immediately,\u201d he said.\n\nThe expert recalled that in 2021 alone, we had three crashes associated with the military on Feb, 27, March 31 and the third one was in May 21.\n\n\u201cHowever, given the frequency, it is absolutely important that an investigation is conducted.\n\n\u201cIf the reason is poor maintenance, then it means it is an internal thing and the military needs to deal with that urgently.\n\n\u201cIf on the other hand, it is something that has to do with the pilots\u2019 capabilities, then that should be taken up by the Nigerian Air Force (NAF).\n\n\u201cAt the same time, if it is maintenance, then what type of equipment is there at the airport and are they of international standard\u201d?\n\nHe, however, expressed optimism that if the country could carry out a thorough evaluation of the airports and its fleets, it would go a long way in addressing the frequent air crashes in the country.\n\nSimilarly, Nigerians from different walks of life has urged the government to invest more on training and retraining of the nation\u2019s pilots locally and internationally, to check plane crashes.\n\nIn reactions to Friday\u2019s aircrash that claimed the lives of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt.

This is not good for the military.\n\n\u201cThe implication is very bad concerning the military, I think this is the time to look inward and find out what is happening to our men, what is happening concerning our equipment; could this be man-made error, equipment error or engine fault.\n\n\u201dThere is need too, to invest more in the training of our men, locally and internationally.\n\n\u201cWe need to bring in the people to train them, or send them outside the country, for more exposure and training.\n\n\u201cLet us engage in training the trainers for our men.\n\n\u201cAlso, we need to regularly evaluate the fitness of our pilots, psychologically and mentally,\u201d he said.\n\nMakinde stated that the development was particularly sad because the country has lost its very best hands, who were at the peak of their careers.\n\n\u201cWe have lost our Chief of Army Staff, who was contributing a lot to the fight against the insurgency, he had been doing a lot since he assumed office,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his view, Mr Ovie Edomi, Publisher and Editor-In-Chief, South South International Magazine, urged the federal government to ensure recruitment of sound professionals in air travel.\n\n\u201cFor a country\u2019s military to experience three air clashes in three months, it implies that the military high command needs to look at so many things including the theory of conspiracy, lack of maintenance and inadequate funding.\n\n\u201cThough, l am not an aviation expert, l know from my years of flying that a twin-engine aircraft is not designed to just fail and crash.\n\n\u201dThey should check their fuel suppliers and maintenance engineers thoroughly,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso, Mr Mohammed Sodipo, Chairman Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) Badagry Chapter, said \u201cthe solution is simple; all the country needs is justice, equality and fairness.\n\n\u201dWe need an incorruptible and courageous judicial system.\n\n\u201cWe also need upright and selfless leaders, as well as orientation of the public on good leadership and followership\u201d.\n\n_______________________________\n\nA News Analysis by News Agency of Nigeria (NAN)\n\n...",

          "text": "The United States Department of Justice has written to the United States Magistrate Judge in Eastern District of New York, Ramon Reyes, claiming that the surety provided by Dapo Abiodun\u2019s aide is a suspected fraudster.\n\nThe Acting U.S. Attorney, Tessa Gorma, in a letter obtained exclusively by PREMIUM TIMES on Sunday, said the \u201csurety is suspect in an investigation into an email impersonation scheme.\u201d\n\nThis newspaper reported how Mr Rufai was arrested while trying to get out of the U.S. on May 14.\n\nHe was accused of allegedly using the identities of more than 100 Washington residents to steal more than $350,000 in unemployment benefits from the Washington State Employment Security Department (ESD) during the COVID-19 pandemic last year.\n\nMr Rufai has since been suspended by Governor Abiodun.\n\nLast Tuesday, his lawyer, Michael Barrow, said Mr Rufai denied \u201cinvolvement in these transactions.\u201d\n\nHis first appearance in court was Wednesday and he was denied bail because his brother, Alaba Rufai, who is listed in court records, could not post the $300,000 surety bond for his bail.\n\nHowever, a surety was presented on Friday with the court ruling that a New York state resident and family friend of Mr Rufai could post the bond.\n\nThe surety, Nekpen Soyemi, a registered nurse, whose family comes from Nigeria, told the court that she would guarantee the $300,000 bond and allow Mr Rufai to stay at her and her husband\u2019s home.\n\nHowever, the Magistrate Judge, Mr Reyes, delayed the release of Mr Rufai until May 25 to give enough time to federal prosecutors to appeal the order.\n\nMr Rufai and a suspected fraudster as surety\n\nThe Acting U.S. Attorney, Ms Gorma, said in her letter to the court that Ms Soyemi is a suspected fraudster and should not be allowed to stand surety for Mr Rufai.\n\n\u201cFirst, the FBI has conducted research into the Surety and has learned information indicating that the Surety is not an appropriate person to perform that role,\u201d the letter partly read.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, the Surety\u2019s bank (Bank of America) issued a report naming the Surety as a suspect in an investigation into an email impersonation scheme.\n\n\u201cAccording to the bank\u2019s report, a person purporting to be a donor deposited $134,000 into the bank account of a legitimate nonprofit. The \u201cdonor\u201d (who was never identified) then contacted the non-profit and stated that some of the deposited funds were intended for a different recipient.\n\n\u201cThe donor asked the non-profit to wire the excess funds to three different accounts, one of which was a Bank of America account in the Surety\u2019s name. The report indicates that the Surety then made cash withdrawals of the proceeds at two different B of A locations. The Surety did not respond to inquiries from Bank of America.\n\n\u201cSecond, FBI\u2019s research was unable to confirm that the Surety owns the listed real property. Mortgage and deed records for the property indicate that it was last purchased by an individual with the initials L.S.G. on November 7, 2014.\u201d\n\nShe further said that the FBI could not locate records showing that the Surety has an interest in the property.\n\n\u201cThe Surety has also submitted records showing that she has $335 in Robinhood investment account and $1,838 in a checking account. Neither submission suggests the Surety is in a position to secure a $300,000 bond.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe U.S. government earlier told the court that it is dangerous to release Mr Rufai on bail, claiming the suspect presents an extreme risk of flight and \u201cif he does escape to Nigeria, extradition will be extraordinarily difficult or impossible because of his ties to the Nigerian government.\u201d",

          "text": "By Laolu Ayoola, Bayo Obajemu, Emeka Ejere and Obinna Ezugwu\n\nThese technocrats, business leaders and politicians differed in orientation, status, personality and background, but they are currently playing a big part in building a new Nigeria.\n\nBefore their individual interventions, the nation has had a challenge of infrastructural development, despite it having a population of over 200 million and abundant natural resources, including miles of arable land, huge deposits of minerals, crude oil and natural gas reserves, as well as an estimated GDP of over $442.976 billion (2020).\n\nFrom Ikeja, to Port Harcourt, Owerri, Aba, Enugu, Kano, Kaduna, Ibadan, Calabar and many other Nigerian cities and towns, the landscape was littered with hundreds of failed infrastructural projects.\n\nVital utilities like power plants, transmission grids, hospitals, roads, railway lines, schools, seaports and airports that would have spurred economic and social growth were virtually decayed and needed repair or total replacement.\n\nKnowing fully well that infrastructural development is crucial to Nigeria\u2019s economic growth, particularly for the realization of the federal government\u2019s economic diversification agenda, these individuals set out to work.\n\nWith a view to stem the tide, the gladiators set about the task of bridging the infrastructure deficit. And in a spate of six years, the nation has become a huge construction site.\n\nThe hitherto epileptic and weak power infrastructure is today up and running, derelict and out of commissioned hospitals and schools are now wearing new look, many unmotorable and treacherous highways are now paved and pleasurable to drive on, abandoned and unserviceable railway lines have been restored, and are now conveying Nigerians to their desired destinations, while bridges that connect cities and towns, particularly the 2nd Niger Bridge are daily sprouting up to the admiration of many Nigerians.\n\nThe faces behind these transformations are not angels, but mortal beings. They are not expatriates but fellow Nigerians who have largely succeeded where others failed.\n\nIn this special edition, Business Hallmark is unveiling the faces behind the masks. The list of Champions of infrastructure in no particular order is made of former Governor of Rivers State and incumbent Minister of Transportation, RT. Hon. Rotimi Amaechi; Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, Group Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer of Access Bank Plc, Herbert Wigwe, Minister of Works, Babatunde Fashola (SAN), Minister of Aviation, Sen. Hadi Sirika and the Executive Vice Chairman, Nigerian Communications Commission ((NCC), Professor Umar Danbatta.\n\nAlso on the list are Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti State, Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State and Governor Dave Umahi, of Ebonyi State\n\nWithout their selfless commitments and efforts, there might not have been a remarkable improvement in infrastructure development, with the nation waiting for yet another season of redemption.\n\nBOSS MUSTAPHA: An efficient and effective organiser\n\nIt is said that difficult situations and circumstances do bring out the best in men. This indeed has been the lot of His Excellency, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Gida Mustapha, Esq.\n\nSoft-spoken and unassuming, but indeed most cerebral and professional, when the incidence of COVID-19 broke out and the Federal Government had to set up a team to plot, streamline and execute the Nigerian Governments response to the crisis, it was this man of steel and candour that the onus now rested to coordinate the effort. And it is testimony to his solid sense of leadership and commitment that he has been able to most successfully lead the team on to achieving the quite impressive records that have been seen this far.\n\nMustapha earned his Bachelor of Law (LLB) from the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria in 1979 and was called to bar in 1980. After his National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) programme at the Directorate of Legal Services in the Army Headquarters, his work life has seen him at Sotesa Nigeria Limited, an Italian consultancy firm, where he was Executive Director, Administration, Counsel in the prestigious law firm Messrs Onagoruwa & Co and Principal Counsel in the firm Messrs Mustapha & Associates. He has served as Social Secretary and Chairman at the Yola Branch of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), and later as a member of the National Executive Committee. He has also been a member of the Body of Benchers and member of the Committee on the Reform of the Judiciary in the defunct Gongola State.\n\nIn the public arena, he served as an Executive Member of the Interim Management Committee (IMC) of the defunct Petroleum (Special) Trust Fund (PTF), from 2000 to 2007, and was thereafter appointed Principal Partner of the law firm, Adroit Lex & Co.\n\nOn the political turf, Mustapha has actively contributed towards the growth of our democracy and democratic institutions. He was a member of the Constituent Assembly in 1988 and the 2005 National Political Reform Conference. He has been State Chairman, Peoples Solidarity Party and Social Democratic Party in Gongola State and gubernatorial candidate for SDP in Adamawa State in 1991. He was Deputy National Chairman of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), Founding member of the All Progressive Congress (APC) and member, APC Board of Trustees.\n\nIn June 2016, President Muhammadu Buhari appointed him Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA). In nine months of his appointment, he led NIWA to generate three times the revenue it usually generates in one year. It was from here that he was appointed as the Secretary to the Government of the Federation.\n\nMinister of Transport, RT. HON. ROTIMi CHIBUIKE AMAECHI: Silent political actor with great influence\n\nWithin six years of assuming office as minister in November 2015, Minister of Transportation of the Republic of Nigeria, RT. Hon. Rotimi Chibuike Amaechi, has emerged one of the most colourful and energetic public office holders in the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nBorn on 27 May 1965 in Ubima, Ikwerre Local Government Area of Rivers State to the family of the late Elder Fidelis Amaechi and Mary Amaechi, Mr. Amaechi has been an active politician for more than three decades, serving as Rivers State governor from 2007-2014, and holding a number of government positions in different offices, including Secretary of the National Republican Convention (NRC) in Ikwerre Local Government Area of Rivers State from 1992 to 1994 and Rivers State\u2019s Secretary of the Democratic Party of Nigeria (DPN) caretaker committee in 1996;\n\nHe was Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly from 1999 to 2003 and the Chairman of Nigeria\u2019s Conference of Speakers of State Assemblies for two terms. He was also Chairman of Nigerian Governors Forum from 2011-2015.\n\nAs Rivers State Governor, Mr. Amaechi executed infrastructure projects like construction of roads, hospitals, schools and modernization of transportation services.\n\nAmong the projects is the iconic monorail project which was developed to provide mass transportation within Port Harcourt, as well as power plant projects at Afam, Trans Amadi, and Onne to improve the states power supply. Impressed by these strides, grateful Rivers people nicknamed him \u2018Mr. Infrastructure\u2019.\n\nIt was therefore not a surprise when President Buhari gave him the transportation portfolio in 2015 and 2019 to drive his grand and ambitious infrastructure development agenda, a task he set out to undertake with zeal and vigour.\n\nUnder his watch, the 156 kilometre LagosIbadan corridor of the Lagos-Kano standard gauge project was recently completed and already in use. Also, the 1435mm gauge North-South railway linking Itakpe, Ajaokuta and Warri has been formally opened for commercial operation, following its inauguration by the president in 2020.\n\nAs part of the wider vision, Mr. Amaechi has secured cabinet approval to start work on new lines linking Port Harcourt with Maiduguri.\n\nIn recognition of his numerous achievements, he has won several awards, including the Blueprint Newspapers Award for his contribution to the rail development and building of the first monorail system in Sub-Sahara Africa 2018; Polo Stallion Star Awards for his revolutionary approach in the transportation sector of Nigeria 2019; Ministerial Award for Mass Transportation Infrastructure Development at the National Tourism Transport Summit and Expo 2019 and National honour of the Commander of the Order of the Niger (CON).\n\nHis achievements also include safer Nigerian waterways, as well as the improvement of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) in the area of regulation.\n\nGiven his antecedents in Rivers State and current strides as transportation minister, Mr. Amaechi\u2019s profile over the past year has seen him emerge as one of most famous public officers in the Nigerian system and therefore a national leader in his own right.\n\nRotimi Amaechi is married to Judith Amaechi, and they are blessed with three boys.\n\nBabatunde Fashola: An administrator per excellence\n\nBabatunde Raji Fashola, SAN , is an erudite lawyer and current Federal Minister of Works and Housing. He served two terms as Governor of Lagos State from May 29, 2007 to May 29, 2015.\n\nHe was called to the Nigerian Bar as a solicitor and advocate of the Supreme Court of Nigeria in November 1988 after completing the professional training programme at the Nigerian Law School, Lagos which he undertook between 1987 and 1988.\n\nHis legal career of over one and a half decades, commenced in the law Firm of Sofunde, Osakwe, Ogundipe and Belgore, where he cut his legal teeth as a litigator over such wide-ranging areas of specialisation such as, intellectual property (registration of trade marks), commercial law, covering general contracts, company activities, mergers, acquisitions, right issues, ownership of shares and equity of corporations, as well as land disputes, criminal law and chieftaincy matters, in all of which he has come to acquire appreciable expertise and vast experience.\n\nFashola, a Notary Public of the Supreme Court of Nigeria, has been variously honoured with awards and certificates of merit including the Distinguished Alumnus Award conferred on him by the University of Benin Alumni Association in recognition of contributions to the Alumnus association and humanity.\n\nHe is also a recipient of Lagos State public service club Platinum Award for outstanding contribution towards development. As well as Alliance for Democracy \u201d Igbogbo Bayeku Local Government Award\u201d in recognition of activities towards the success of the party.\n\nBabatunde Fashola is also a Patron of the Law Students Association of the University of Benin and he is the second law graduate from the University of Benin and the first member of the Nigerian Law School graduating class of 1988 to be conferred with the professional rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria.\n\nFashola is also the First ever Chief of Staff to be so honoured. Babatunde Fashola is a member of the Nigerian Bar Association, the International Bar Association and an Associate of the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria.\n\nFashola was Chief of Staff to his predecessor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Fashola, had during his tenure as Chief of Staff, also dubbed as the Honourable Commissioner to the Governor\u2019s office. Fashola was the first person to hold both offices simultaneously.\n\nHe also served in Lagos state in various capacities, including:\n\nSecretary of the Lands Sub-Committee of the Transitional Work Groups- 1999.\n\nMember of the panel of Enquiry into allocation of houses on the Mobolaji Johnson Housing Scheme at Lekki.- 2000.\n\nMember of the State Tenders Board- 2002 2006.\n\nMember of the Lagos State Executive Council-2002-2006.\n\nMember of the State Security Council-2002-2006\n\nMember of the State Treasury Board-2002-2006\n\nChairman Ad-Hoc Committee on the Review of Asset distribution among Local Government.\n\nFashola is the first and arguably the best of the technocrats turned politician to utilize politics for public good in contemporary Nigeria.\n\nAs a candidate of the Action Congress party, now known as the All Progressives Congress, Fashola succeeded Bola Ahmed Tinubu, on 14 April 2007, and was sworn in as Lagos State governor on 29 May 2007.Fashola was re-elected on 26 April 2011.\n\nOn account of his sterling performance as governor of Lagos State, on November 11th 2015, he was appointed by President Muhammadu Buhari as the Minister of Power, Works and Housing; he was reappointed Minister of Works & Housing on 21 August 2019.\n\nFashola was born in Lagos on 28 June 1963. He attended Birch Freeman High school Lagos and Igbobi College Lagos. He studied Law at the University of Benin from where he graduated with a Bachelor of Laws, LL.B.(Hon), degree in 1987.\n\nFashola is also a member of the Nigerian Bar Association, the International Bar Association and an Associate of the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria.\n\nFashola, had during his tenure as Chief of Staff, also dubbed as the Honourable Commissioner to the Governor\u2019s office. Babatunde Fashola was the first person to hold both offices simultaneously.\n\nGovernor of Lagos state\n\nBabatunde Raji Fashola commenced a four-year tenure as the Executive Governor of Lagos State in Nigeria on 29 May 2007.\n\nAccording to The Tribune Newspaper, Babatunde Raji Fashola remains a reference point in 21st century Governance.\n\nHe is widely considered one of best governors since the return of democracy in 1999.\n\nBabatunde Fashola during his term as governor saw to the successful overhaul of the tax collection system in Lagos that successfully increased revenue for the state and indirectly financed various other reforms. He secured public support for the overhaul after revealing the corruption in the previous tax agency through an orchestrated, public sting operation, which revealed that corrupt officials sold fraudulent tax documents on the street.\n\nHe replaced the old tax agency with a smaller internal revenue service staffed by no-contract employees governed by performance incentives rather than state civil-service workers. The new service better enforced existing tax requirements and expanded the taxpayer base by introducing a simplified, single-page tax form for informal businesses.\n\nHe introduced so many innovations to governance, increased the State\u2019s infrastructure. He embarked on gigantic construction program that changed the face and landscape of the state, and is highly regarded as the architect of modern Lagos.\n\nFashola was born 28 June 1963, and married with children to Dame Abimbola Fashola\n\nLai Mohammed: An efficient communicator with gift of garb\n\nTo many, Alhaji Layiwola Mohammed is a complex man, this is on account of his differing interpretation of his role and duty depending on the side of the political divide he finds himself.\n\nAs an opposition information manager, he employed psychological warfare, propaganda and modern tool of influencing public opinion to deliver on his duty with ruthless efficiency, and the ruling APC owed its success in part to Mohammed\u2019s standing as an efficient communicator.\n\nAs minister of information, he has deployed his skills to manage the information ministry and sell Buhari\u2019s programs to local and international public.\n\nA lawyer by training, and former National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress.\n\nAs a practicing Lawyer, Alhaji Lai Mohammed co-founded the legal firm of Edu & Mohammed as a Senior Partner in 1989.\n\nHe was born into the family of Alhaji Mohammed Adekeye in 1952. He is a native of Oro in Kwara State. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in French from Obafemi Awolowo University, in 1975. He then proceeded to obtain a law degree from the University of Lagos, and then Nigerian Law School in 1986.\n\nMohammed is an astute businessman and served as the Chairman of Optmedia Limited, a subsidiary of Afromedia Plc since 18 December 2008.\n\nHe served as a Director of Afromedia PLC since May 2011 and is also a fellow of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) and had previously worked as Public Relations Officer for almost 10 years with the Nigerian Airport Authority, now Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN).\n\nIn October 2002, Alhaji Lai Mohammed was a candidate for governor in the April 2003 Kwara State elections on the Alliance for Democracy platform. He was assaulted and five vehicles in his convoy were smashed in front of Senator Suleiman Ajadi\u2019s campaign office at Oke-Onigbin during a festivity. But he has had huge following in his native Kwara State, and widely considered one of the most effective and brilliant image makers the country has ever produced.\n\nHe served as Governor Tinubu\u2019s Chief of Staff during his first term.\n\nLai Mohammed is an active politician and has been accused by some local and international news about giving contradictory accounts of events in his country.\n\nThe truth is that as government\u2019s image maker, he is bound to make enemies, but one thing that even his detractors can not deny is his competence and brilliance, his wide canvas and rich repertoire of knowledge of the country, and his ability to connect with events and situation.\n\nHe had accused CNN of being \u201cdesperate\u201d, after the international media released several footages, to prove the massacre of the protesters at the Lekki tollgate, Lagos, Nigeria.\n\nHe is one of the most astute and competent information ministers, and in the course of his career, he has displayed wide knowledge and understanding of his country\u2019s convoluted politics.\n\nIn a recent interview, Mohammed, said calls for secession in some quarters in Nigeria was unacceptable.\n\nMohammed, however, said it was rational and ideal for citizens to call for restructuring and true federalism, adding that whatever challenges facing the country can be overcome.\n\nWhile it is alright for citizens to call for restructuring and true federalism, what is not acceptable is the call in certain quarters for secession.\n\nWhatever challenges we have today as a nation, can and will be surmounted. In fact, the Federal Government had set in motion the necessary machinery to tackle the challenge of insecurity.\n\nWe should therefore not allow todays challenges, whether in the area of economy or security, to jeopardise our unity, he said.\n\nThat task has never been more urgent than now against the background of discordant voices in the country and calls for separation.\n\nHe stated that he wanted everybody to be partner in the governments effort to douse the tension in the land and beat the drum of unity rather than the drum of war.\n\nHe added that everyone should raise voice against those fanning the embers of disunity and discord in the country. Without a country that is peaceful and secured, there can be no development.\n\nThis administration is doing everything possible to return peace and security across the country, the minister said.\n\nMany Nigerians will not forget in hurry the role played by Mohammed in the defeat of the then ruling Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in the 2015 general election that brought in the Buhari administration.\n\nThe man who took charge of the realm of communicating what the APC wanted to say was no other than Alhaji Lai Mohammed, the National Publicity Secretary of the APC who would surely go down in history as the competent explainer-in-chief. It was Lai Mohammed\u2019s lot to define the then ruling party to the Nigerian voter in ways that would make its rejection a forgone conclusion. Lai Mohammed went about this job with the kind of fiery passion that sometimes got him bogged down in the murky waters of partisan debates. The then ruling party was quick to play on the sound of his first name to give the impression that he was full of lies against a performing government. He was also taken to task when he attempted to create a different narrative at the time the government was making progress in its onslaught against terrorists in the North East.\n\nMohammed\u2019s critics insist that on national security, especially where the lives of Nigerians were involved, the then opposition spokesman should have been a little more restrained.\n\nThe knocks notwithstanding, Mohammed acquitted himself as a vibrant and effective opposition spokesman. In a challenging environment like Nigeria and considering the clout of the government in power, the role of the opposition is made much more difficult. But Lai Mohammed understood his environment. He leveraged on the power of constant messaging to shape perceptions. He gave the government sleepless nights by outplaying them in all departments. His strategy was to make any discussion a referendum on the performance of the government. Doing so meant that the contradictions within his own camp were not well scrutinized. Considering issue based attacks as the best form of defence, Mohammed was constantly on the offensive against the Presidency of Goodluck Jonathan. It is to the credit of Lai Mohammed that the tag of cluelessness became one of the albatross that Jonathan as President struggled to shake off. In the realm of strategy too, Lai Mohammed was light years ahead of the then ruling party and even the Presidencys communications team.\n\nWhile some would argue that as opposition spokesman, he was free from the responsibility of communicating in a nuanced and balanced way, the reality is that the APC spokesman understood that to have the upper hand, he had to pin the ruling party to the ropes all the time. And he did so brilliantly, so much that the Jonathan Presidency with all the resources at the disposal of its communications team was constantly on the back foot reeling from the hammer blows delivered by Mohammed.\n\nOn the front lines of the media war, things became so pathetic for the Jonathan Presidency that it could no longer speak with the confidence and authority of the government in power. Hurried responses to allegations lobbed at it by the opposition became the governments sole response as it huffed and puffed, but failed to find a lasting answer to Mohammeds strident onslaughts.\n\nSirika Hadi: Aeronautics expert in charge of aviation\n\nTo many in Nigeria, Senator Sirika Hadi is just a run of the mill politician, whose appointment as aviation minister is typical of one well connected.\n\nFar from it, Hadi has had the best education available in the aviation world , having studied at the prestigious Petroleum Helicopters institute in USA, Flight Safety International, USA and Delta Aeronautics, United States of America, where he honed his aviation skills and developed his extensive knowledge of the industry.\n\nThus far from political, his appointment as aviation minister was a question of proverbial round peg in a round hole.\n\nHe is a former Member House of Representative, and assumed the Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2011, where he represents Katsina North Senatorial District under the platform of Congress for Progressive Change. Sirika held the position of (Vice-Chairman) of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) Committee set by the Nigerian Senate.\n\nIn 2003, Hadi was elected into the Federal House of Representative and he left office in 2007. Had was again re-elected to represent Kastina North in the Nigerian Senate under the platform of Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) in 2011 elections.\n\nWhile in the Senate, Hadi Sirika was the portal vice chairman; Millennium Developmemt Goal (MDG) and a member of the Senate Committee on Aviation. He also served in a number of different committees in the Senate.\n\nIn the early 2015, Hadi became a member of the newly born party APC, after a merger which brought about the All Progressive Congress (APC). Hadi announced in the same year that, Muhammadu Buhari have been convinced to run for the presidential seat in the 2015 general Elections under the banner of the APC.\n\nAfter the Muhammadu Buhari emerged winner of the 2015 Presidential elections, Hadi was appointed minister for state for aviation until 2019. He was reappointed as the Minister of Avaition by President Muhammadu Buhari after he won his second term bid.\n\nAs a former pilot, Sirika is a member of the Senate Committee on Aviation.\n\nAs aviation minister, he has done a lot to reposition the ministry in order to make it more viable, drawing on his extensive expertise and knowledge.\n\nHe was General Manager of Katsina State Transport Authority from 1999 and 2000.\n\nOn the potential for private involvement in airport renovations and ownership and where he sees Nigeria\u2019s airports in the near future, he said in a recent interview that\n\n\u201cThere has been modest investment by government to develop the sector. In terms of airport terminal buildings, Nigeria had to source some funding through an import-export bank loan to build or rebuild terminals at four of our airports.\n\n\u201cEntrepreneurs will find that there is huge potential for investment, especially in the general aviation infrastructure, including terminal buildings, runways, communication and navigation equipment, and security systems. The entire sector is greenfield, waiting for suitable investors to come in. It is important for interested investors to act now because the doors will be closed once we have all of the investors that we can find.\n\n\u201cAirfares in Nigeria are high compared to other emerging markets. From a regulatory and policy perspective, how might airfares fall?\n\nThe first and most important step is to create competition, which is the whole idea behind the national airline we are about to create. This way we can leverage all the bilateral and multilateral agreements between us and other nations that are bringing in their planes. Emirates flies to Nigeria 21 times per week, and British Airways has a similar number of flights.\n\nRecently, he said it is in order to speak truth to power but counterproductive to curse a leader, since in his reasoning, a cursed leader may be pushed by the curse to take evil decision that will affect generality of the people.\n\nLast week, the amiable minister was reported to have said that Nigeria will begin the operation of a new national air carrier in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nIn this 2021, we will try to do all the needful and probably we intend to start operations somewhere around first quarter 2022, he said.\n\nHe said the emergence of COVID-19 delayed the conclusion of plans as well as the takeoff of the project which he said the federal government is still committed to.\n\nMr Sirika said the national carrier was expected to take off initially this year, as an economic necessity for the country with the size of the population, the vantage geographical location, and other natural factors.\n\nIt is still in top gear, we are coming back to Council, hopefully within the next two weeks, to present the memo on the national carrier, he said.\n\nWe went to Council to approve the outline business case for the carrier and then the Council raised some questions and asked us to go and file the memo again and bring it back.\n\nSo, once it comes back and the outline business case is approved by Council, then, of course, we will now go to the full business case, which is now going to the market and then establishing the national carrier.\n\nIt was our intention to have a national carrier running in 2021, which is this year. Unfortunately due to COVID, which took the greater part of last year, since March last year, activities are almost impossible.\n\nOf course, for obvious reasons, we now have access to equipment, that they will come faster to us, deliveries of the aircraft will be faster, perhaps even the rates might be cheaper and so on, and so forth.\n\nHe is widely considered to be an efficient , brilliant administrator.\n\nHadi sirika was born on 2nd March 1964 in Dutsi Local Government area of Katsina state.\n\nJohn Kayode Fayemi: Philosopher King on throne of Ekiti State\n\nJohn Olukayode Fayemi is arguably one of the most cerebral politicians in contemporary Nigeria, hugely in a class of his own.\n\nHis unassuming nature has tended to belie his immense strength and influence, as one of the most important political actors in the current dispensation.\n\nAs the current governor of Ekiti State, he has quietly made his mark redefining the state on the path of growth and development. His foray into politics has a streak of radical in it, having been an important member of National Democratic Coalition, NADECO, the coalition of intelligentsia, political elites, retired military officers, business elites and pro-democracy organizations that fought the Abacha dictatorship and ensured the military handed over power to civil rule.\n\nIt is widely believed that Fayemi was the voice of Radio Kudirat, the opposition voice back then.\n\nAs Governor of Ekiti State, he has been in office since 16 October 2018. He previously served in office between 2010 and 2014 before losing re-election to Ayodele Fayose. He was also the Minister of Solid Minerals Development in President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s cabinet from 11 November 2015 to 30 May 2018, when he resigned to contest for a second time as Governor of Ekiti State. Today, he is the chair of the All Progressives Congress, APC\u2019s governors\u2019 forum.\n\nAn intellectual of international repute, Fayemi has written extensively on governance and democratization, civil-military relations and security sector issues in Africa.\n\nFayemi had his primary education at ICC Primary School, Agodi, Ibadan, Oyo State between 1970-1975 and attended Christ\u2019s School Ado Ekiti from 1975 to 1980. He later went on to receive degrees in History, Politics and International Relations from the University of Lagos and University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University). From 1989 to 1992, he earned a Doctorate in War Studies from King\u2019s College London, specializing in civil-military relations.\n\nCareer\n\nAfter his first degree in 1984, he proceeded on the mandatory one year National Youth service Corps from 1985 to 1986, during which he was a lecturer at the Nigeria-Police Training College in Sokoto.\n\nAfter his service year, he served as a Research Officer at Development & Management Consultants in Ikeja between 1987-1989. When he moved to the UK to pursue his doctoral studies between 1991 to 1993 he worked as a Research Officer at the African Research and Information Bureau in London. In 1992, he was a Tutorial Fellow at the War Studies Department at Kings College, London during his doctoral studies. Later between 1993 to 1995, he was the Strategy Development Adviser of Deptford City Challenge in London and later served as the Secretary General of the Media Empowerment for Africa (The Radio Foundation) in London between 1995-1997.\n\nHe was also a journalist with The Guardian and City Tempo; and the Editor of Nigeria-Now, a defunct political monthly magazine. In 1997, Fayemi returned to Nigeria where he established the Centre for Democracy and Development Centre for Democracy & Development, a research and training institution dedicated to the study and promotion of democratic development, peace-building and human security in Africa, where he served as Director from 1997 to 2006.\n\nIn April 2014, Fayemi was endorsed as the governorship candidates of the All Progressives Congress in the state\u2019s gubernatorial elections slated for 21 June 2014. The emergence of Fayemi was preceded by congress held before the governor who had no contestant was endorsed as the flag bearers of their state in the governorship elections. Kayode Fayemi was defeated at the polls on 21 June 2014 by previous governor Ayodele Fayose.\n\nFayemi recontested for second term as Ekiti state governor under the platform of the All Progressive Congress in the 14 July 2018 governorship election after resigning as the Minister of Solid Minerals Development. He was officially declared the winner of the 2018 Ekiti State gubernatorial election by the Independent National Electoral Commission and subsequently sworn in.\n\nIn October 2020 during the nationwide #EndSars protest he joined the protesters at the pretest grounds to express his support for their demand but advised on the need for them to have an exit strategy and on the need to create a window of dialogue with the Federal Government on their demands before the protest was hijack.\n\nHe narrated his experience as one of the notable faces of the anti-military and protesters that facilitated the current democratic order. He said his group knew when to pause to negotiate with the government and that made them successful. He said this at a virtual symposium held by the Harvard Kenny Alumni Association of Nigeria with the theme :The Africa Policy Dialogue Series: Harnessing Africas Demographic Dividend for Peace, Security and Productivity through Investments in Youth.\n\nHe admitted that the youths, who were actively participating in the #Endsars protest at the time, had a right to demand for good governance and an end to police brutality, saying the government owes that to them.\n\nFayemi is a Fellow of the Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, University of Ibadan\n\nAdjunct Professor of Security Studies at the African Centre for Strategic Studies, National Defense University, Fort McNair, Washington, D.C., USA.\n\nHe was also a Visiting Professor in the African Studies Programme at Northwestern University, Evanston, USA in 2004.\n\nHe serves on numerous Boards including the Governing Board of the Open Society Justice Institute, Baobab for Women\u2019s Human Rights, African Security Sector Network, and on the Advisory Board of the Global Facilitation Network on Security Sector Reform and on the Management Culture Board of the ECOWAS Secretariat.\n\nMember, Africa Policy Advisory Panel of the British Government.\n\nFayemi is an outstanding intellectual who has written on governance and democratization, civil-military relations and security sector issues in Africa. Among his recent books are: Deepening the Culture of Constitutionalism: The Role of Regional Institutions in Constitutional Development in Africa (CDD, 2003), Security Sector Governance in Africa: A Handbook (edited with Nicole Ball, CDD, 2004) and Out of the Shadows: Exile and the Struggle for Freedom and Democracy in Nigeria (CDD, 2005).\n\nNasir El-Rufai: The action man of Kaduna State\n\nProbably now more than ever before has Nigeria needed all the help it can receive to rebuild her aging and dilapidated infrastructures.\n\nAnd one of those that seems to be coming through for the country is the incumbent governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai. Some would say this is not too surprising considering that the Kaduna governor is a developmental expert.\n\nBorn on 16 February 1960 in Daudawa, Faskari Local Government Area of Katsina State, Nasir El-Rufai had early roots in the management and development sectors. Alongside three other partners, he founded a Quantity Surveying and Project Management Consulting firm in 1982, through which they executed several building and civil engineering projects in the country.\n\nIn November 1999, he was appointed the director of the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) by former President Olusegun Obasanjo and secretary of the National Council of Privatisation (NCP) where he used his expertise to spearhead the privatisation of several government owned corporations.\n\nHis efforts were recognized on a larger scale when he was appointed as Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in July 2003 to help restore the bastardised Abuja Master plan to its original vision.\n\nDuring his tenure as FCT minister, he presided over a radical transformation of the federal capital earlier riddled with corruption and vast deviation from the original Master plan.\n\nHe led several bold policy and innovative initiatives, including the establishment of the Abuja Geographic Information System (GIS) in June 2004, making the federal capital the first municipality in Nigeria with a computerised land register and information system and restoration of the Abuja master plan to its original status with the demolition of illegal buildings, which prompted many to give him the nickname \u2018Mr. Demolition\u2019.\n\nMallam El-Rufai also superintended over two other ministries, Commerce and Interior, where he chaired several cabinet committees that facilitated the establishment of a mortgage system in Nigeria, National ID card system, improvement of the nation\u2019s electric power supply, as well as the sale of Federal Government properties in Abuja.\n\nThere was to be no time on the sidelines for El-Rufai after the end of his tenure as minister. After briefly leaving public service, he completed legal and public management training programmes at the University of London and the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.\n\nIn 2011, he re-entered politics by joining the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), and was appointed the first deputy national secretary of the newly formed All Progressives Congress (APC) after the merger of the CPC with the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) and the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in 2013.\n\nEbonyi: Unveiling Umahi\u2019s uncommon transformation\n\nEbonyi, Southeast Nigeria\u2019s youngest state, was in many ways, a child of necessity. When, in 1996, the areas that today constitute Ebonyi, were carved out of Enugu and Abia states \u2013 mostly from the former \u2013 it was the realisation of a desire by a section of the Igbo nation that had long felt that their interests were not adequately represented, first in the old Anambra State, and later in Enugu.\n\nIt was for understandable reason. The areas saw little presence of government. Abakaliki, today\u2019s capital of Ebonyi, was a backwater town, often derided by the rest for its lack of development. But today, two decades and a half down the road, the story of Abakaliki has changed from a city being mocked to one leading the light as one of Nigeria\u2019s most beautiful, and modern state capitals.\n\nAbakaliki is Ebonyi. And the story of this transformation, more than anything else, has been down to the sheer ingenuity of Engr. Dave Umahi, the incumbent governor of the state.\n\nUmahi, like every political office holder, has had his issues; and critics, too. But even his worst critics cannot deny that the governors accomplishment in the state is a marvel, particularly in terms of infrastructure, he has been a wonder of sorts.\n\nThe state has witnessed and continues to witness unprecedented road and sundry infrastructure building, and placed side by side with the revenue profile of the state, the governor arguably stands shoulders high above his peers.\n\nYet, besides infrastructure, the state is also making rapid improvement in education and agriculture. Rated as an educationally backward state only a few years ago, Ebonyi has walked up the ladder, largely unnoticed, and now makes top ten in most national examinations.\n\nAnd even as the present economic realities, occasioned by fall in global oil price as Coronavirus pandemic shut down economies, have crippled state finances, Ebonyi remains a construction site. The Enugu-Abakailiki Express Road is easily the best federal road in the Southeast courtesy of the governor, and he has also intervened in other strategic federal roads in the state, including Afikpo Road, Uburu-Amasiri Road among many others.\n\nUmahis projects are particularly noted for their solidity. Road constructions in Ebonyi are mostly eight inches concrete pavement with a lifespan of over 50 years. Along the Enugu-Abakailiki road, at Presco, Spera Indo junctions and the International Market are three massive flyovers well constructed and decorated for aesthetic value. The bridges are part of the trans-Saharan route to Cameroon.\n\nRemarkably, it is a state with annual average internally generated revenue of about N4billion, and yearly federal allocation of about N25 billion, one of the least revenue earning states in Nigeria. But with its little, the state has achieved amazing feats under the governors watch.\n\nThe magic behind what the governor is achieving is highest level of probity and accountability, highest level of transparency, highest level of compliance with the principle of fiscal responsibility and procurement, noted the states Commissioner for Information, Mr. Uchenna Orji.\n\nStill, with little revenue, the governor has not, like a few other states facing financial constraints, plunged Ebonyi into heavy debt burden. Ebonyi is one of the least indebted states in Nigeria. Yet, all over the state, roads and other infrastructural projects are ongoing while many have been completed.\n\nUmahi is doing wonderfully well in Ebonyi, noted Chief Sam Maduka Onyishi, CEO, Peace Mass Transit Limited, a leading transporter in the country. The roads there are very well constructed. The kind of things he is building there, sometimes you begin to wonder if its the federal government that is there building those things.\n\nAs part of their trivial online debates, people of the Southeast once in a while, hold online debates about which capital city in the zone is most beautiful. Abakailiki has arguably emerged as the indisputable winner of that contest. A trip around the city only lends credence: smooth roads, smart roundabouts, modern storey buildings and fine streets.\n\nThe Udensi Roundabout with its fountain waterfall and spotless labyrinth of roads is a marvel, yet same can be said about the Government House Roundabout and the Abacha Roundabout, among others.\n\nWe are happy with what the governor has done, Abakailiki is now a beautiful place, noted a bike rider, Nwede. Yes, Im very satisfied with what he has done.\n\nBut in Abakailiki, its not just about beautiful roads and roundabouts. The administration has also completed the huge international market, the Margret Umahi International Market, which was started by the Martin Elechi administration.\n\nThere is the impressive centenary city and a new governors lodge and ecumenical centre with combined sitting capacity of 12,000, the largest ever built by any government in Nigeria, if not on the African continent.\n\nThere is the Ebonyi International Airport, where it is said, promise met action. A dream conceived few years ago, but which has now fully materialised, with work at advanced state. There is the Uburu College of Medicine; a medical university with huge promise.\n\nFor a state with Ebonyis revenue profile, contemplating an international airport on paper would have seemed like an unrealistic dream. But in Ebonyi, Umahi has continued to prove that impossible is nothing. The airport he promised, he has almost completed.\n\nA now renovated Abakailiki stadium at Ntezi-aba is huge by Nigerian standard, but the governor has since decided that for the future he wants for the state capital and the state, only a brand new stadium that would attract athletes from Africa and beyond would do.\n\nApart from the three massive flyover bridges in Abakailiki, he has also started constructing other eight flyovers at Abaomege in Onicha local government, Nkalagu Junction, Uburu Junction, Ohaozara, among other locations.\n\nThe state capital is easily the best well-organised and has best road network of any in the Southeast, if not the entire country. But its not just about Abakailiki. Across the state, there are numerous road projects. The Abakailiki to Ikwo road is well-constructed, the Abakailiki-Afikpo road is not less so.\n\nAnother secret behind what has been achieved is the fear of God and the fact that the governor was very prepared from the very beginning to govern Ebonyi State. For us, it is a divine project. He came on board via a divine mandate, Orji says.\n\nAnd if you look at his track record, you will understand that he truly came from God. I will also say that his track record, to an extent, explains what is happening now. Im talking about his experience, his exposure, education but most importantly, his passion. The passion is the engine that drives those three elements: exposure, education and experience.\n\nAgriculture Revolution\n\nNoted for its Abakailiki rice, Ebonyi is a largely agrarian state. The Umahi government has continued to support farmers and farming to improve productivity through his administrations agricultural development programmes.\n\nThe government now runs three rice mills with capacity of 24 metric tonne per hour. It also has par-boiling plant with a total of 24 metric tonne capacity that feeds the mill. The governor had also procured four rice mills, each with four metric tonne capacity with parboiling plants with same capacity per hour each, giving to individuals or cooperatives to operate.\n\nEmpowerment\n\nThe governor has introduced a number of empowerment programmes. He trained and empowered 2000 youths and women with N250,000 grant each. Through his Street to Skill Empowerment Programme, the governor had also trained and empowered 520 hawkers with N250,000 each and 400 Okada riders with tricycles.\n\nHe also shortlisted, trained and empowered 403 spouses of security officials of Ebonyi origin with N200,000 each and 508 clergymen with N508 million.\n\nFor the states civil servants, he introduced the Second Address Scheme, a scheme which compels civil servants to have second address in farming either at the primary, secondary or tertiary production. They are subsequently given loans ranging from N250,000 to N1million to support agricultural produce, among other programmes aimed at promoting entrepreneurship.\n\nBeyond Ebonyi, Umahi, as chairman of Southeast governors forum, has also in many ways, held his own as the political leader, in some sense, of the zone. Under his leadership, the southeast governors forum has risen up to the security and sundry challenges of the zone, and only recently launched uniform security outfit, Ebube Agu.\n\nGodwin Emefiele: Redefining central banking\n\nMr. Godwin Emefiele is the first governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to get a two-term mandate since the return to civil rule in 1999. President Mohammadu Buhari had reappointed him in 2019 following the giant strides of his first tenure that started in 2014 under former President Goodluck Jonathan.\n\nThe recent sack of the entire board of directors of FBN Holdings Plc and its subsidiary First Bank of Nigeria Ltd by the Emefiele-led CBN in pursuit of corporate governance decency is widely seen as capable of restoring investors and customers confidence; and perhaps, a demonstration of the new dynamism he has brought into the job. He also did the same with Skye bank, now Polaris bank.\n\nThe big irony is that even as the then managing director of Zenith, many did not think that Emefiele was qualified to be saddled with the onerous responsibilities of managing the monetary policy of Africa\u2019s leading economic power house.\n\nDespite his glittering successes at Zenith, a bank whose top line numbers he grew at a very impressive rate, he was still regarded lightly within banking and finance industry circles. Of course, the luminous image of Mr. Jim Ovia, the founder of Zenith Bank had so dominated the banks landscape that Emefieles effervescence was beclouded.\n\nBut with his austere nature and ability to instill financial discipline in the banking sector, which significantly reduced rascality and frivolity in loan approvals, it took him little or no time to disappoint all those who expected nothing but failure from an operator-turn regulator.\n\nSince mid-2014, when he took over the reins of CBN, with a huge task to stabilise an economy that went awry since 2015, Nigeria has experienced stable economic monetary policies, even as it did not witness any crude oil windfall, which is the backbone of the economy, in terms of revenue supply.\n\nConversely, the oil price volatility impacted not only the countrys revenue base, but the inflow of foreign exchange (forex), stoking currency depreciation, system arbitrage and consequent policy measures, leading to calls for the devaluation of the naira.\n\nThe 12th CBN governors ability to hold on to his belief in the economy and not allow the ship sink on his watch may have also earned him the second term, which many of his peers say is well deserved.\n\nEmefiele, through his monetary policies and even interventions in fiscal issues over the past seven years, has insisted that the country still holds a high return on investment, with huge opportunities given its over 200-million-people market.\n\nTherefore, with a cocktail of policy measures, the naira, which fell to N520/$1 in 2017 at the open market, became stabilised around N360$1 , and stayed through to the period of the general elections that brought Buhari to power.\n\nSpecifically, Emefiele oversaw Nigerias widely acclaimed response to plummeting oil prices, a spiraling inflation, significant exchange rate pressures, sharp fall in forex inflows, delisting of Nigeria from the JP Morgan Bond Index, normalisation of U.S. monetary policy, geopolitical tensions amongst global superpowers, and overall uncertainty after the change of administration in 2015.\n\nIndeed, the stability he brought into the system has been attributed to his innovative Investors and Exporters Window worth $25 billion, which liberalised official transactions of forex, as well as directive to banks to sell forex to customers over the counter for basic travel allowance (BTA) and medical and education bills.\n\nBeyond forex stability, which saw massive accretion in Nigerias foreign exchange reserves from about $23 billion in October 2016 to nearly $48 billion in June 2018, Emefieles policies also significantly helped Nigeria achieve fast recovery from recession, which was caused by sharp and sustained oil price declines from 2015 through 2017.\n\nAlso, Emefiele recorded the longest month by month decline in inflation from about 19 per cent in January 2017 to about 11 per cent in July 2018, before the recent climb due to forex crisis while also helping to avert a major economic crisis with labour groups by innovatively offsetting billions of arrears in salaries, pensions and gratuities.\n\nEven in the area of fiscal interventions, the CBN governor sustained large-scale financing of agriculture through the Anchor Borrowers Programme, which has disbursed hundreds of billions of naira in small loans to hundreds of thousands of peasant farmers, thereby creating millions of jobs across the country.\n\nAs an evidence of the new discipline through tight monetary policies, his first tenure witnessed unprecedented profits in the banking industry, with GT Bank and Zenith Bank leading the way with record performances.\n\nOperational discipline also accounted for significant reduction in bad loans, thereby leading to massive expansion of banking services with financial inclusion rate reaching nearly 64 per cent in 2018, up from only 32 per cent in 2012.\n\nWith all these, Emefiele succeeded in facilitating major improvement in Nigerias ranking on the World Banks Doing Business Indicators, through the creation of the collateral registry and credit reference bureaus.\n\nWhile his second term has witnessed a conspiracy of COVID-19 pandemic and global oil price crash to undo his first term achievements in the areas of inflation and exchange rate among others, his effective policy responses are fast restoring normalcy.\n\nFor instance, Nigerias inflation rate reduced by 0.05 per cent in April, the first fall in inflation rate in the last 21 months, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics released last week.\n\nEmefieles CBN is also working tirelessly through a number of policies, including the naira for dollar Scheme, to strengthen the naira. To increase the inflow of diaspora remittances into the country, the bank had in March launched the scheme that pays naira to senders and recipients of international money transfers.\n\nClearly, the efforts of Emefieles CBN have not gone unnoticed as he has received several awards at home and abroad. Perhaps the one that stands out most was the 2017 Best of Africa Achievement Award given to him by Forbes in Washington DC, United States of America.\n\nForbes Emerging Markets honours a person whose achievements fall within the mission of the organization, which is to promote further investment in Africa by United States investors. The only other Nigerian who had received the award is the president of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote.\n\nForbes chief executive officer, Corporate Council on Africa, Florizelle Liser, noted that Emefiele merited the honour, because the body was happy to see the work that is being done on the Ease of Doing Business in Nigeria and they believed it would pay off. He said: Many of our members welcome it as an opportunity to see how they can trade more with Nigeria and invest more in Nigeria.\n\nBefore his banking career, Mr. Emefiele was a lecturer in Finance and Insurance in two Nigerian Universities. He holds degrees in Banking and Finance from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, and is also an alumnus of Stanford University, Harvard and Wharton Graduate Schools of Business where he took courses in Negotiation, Service Excellence, Critical Thinking, Leading Change and Strategy.\n\nProfessor Umar Garba Danbatta : Servant leader\n\nProfessor Umar Garba Danbatta, the Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Office of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), is a brilliant engineer, astute administrator, philanthropist and an outstanding nation builder who has brought his wealth of experience to bear as head of the NCC.\n\nDambatta has, within the few years at the helm in the commission, transformed it into a regulator of global acclaim through implementation of the auspicious strategic 8-Point Agenda, which gave much needed direction to the activities of the commission.\n\nThrough several innovative initiatives such as Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) registration and 112 Emergency Number, Danbatta has helped in the effort against insecurity in the country even as his efforts have led to improvements in Quality of Service (QoS) delivery, broadband infrastructure deployment, broadband penetration, effective spectrum utilisation, consumer empowerment, technology innovation.\n\nProf Danbatta through the NCC has led the charge to drive Nigerias industrial revolution and knowledge economy leveraging telecommunications.\n\nToday Telecommunications contribution to GDP has grown by 70% between 2015 to 2020, whilst broad band penetration has leaped from 8% to 42% in same period. His leadership has enhanced transparency and innovation in the sector, such that recently NCC was acknowledged by International Telecoms Union (ITU) as one of Africas foremost Telecoms regulator.\n\nDanbatta has also made huge impact in the areas of Staff Welfare, Infrastructural Development, Consumers Empowerment and Satisfaction, Job Creation, Standard Information and Communication Technology Revolution, Research, Rebranding of the Telecom Sector, Cordial Relationship with Stakeholders, Increase in Active Mobile Broadband Penetration, Efficient Monitoring and Value Driven usage for the provision of Different Types of Services.\n\nAn academic of repute and a prolific author, Danbatta is a recipient of 18 distinguished awards and certificates of honour. He is a COREN registered engineer, Fellow of the Nigerian Society of Engineers (FNSE), Fellow of the Renewable and Alternative Energy Society (FRAES) and Fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Engineering. He was the Vice President of the Digital Bridge Institute (DBI), International Centre for Advanced Communications Studies, which was established in the year 2004 by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) to build capacity for the Nigerian/African telecom industry in the diverse areas of Information and Communication Technology (ICT).\n\nMr. Kennedy Uzoka, Group Managing Director/CEO, UBA Plc: Banker\u2019s Banker\n\nKennedy Uzoka GMD/CEO, UBA Plc is one of the most accomplished bankers on the African continent today. A bankers banker, he has vast experience in banking, business development, financial and business advisory, strategic planning and execution as well as human resource management. He is an advocate of disruptive technology and has led many game changing innovations in the African banking industry over the past two decades of his career.\n\nIn an extremely challenging industry with a high mortality rate of its professionals, Kennedy has excelled. He has previously served as the Group Deputy Managing Director/CEO UBA Africa, with oversight over the Groups subsidiaries in eighteen countries whilst also providing supervisory oversight on the Groups information technology and digital banking suites as well as the personal banking business.\n\nBy August 2016, he assumed the top rank as GMD/CEO. His performance has been sparkling. He has consistently led the Bank to set a year-on-year track record of profitability, wealth creation and innovative financial products across its operations in the African continent despite global economic challenges. Not even the current challenge of COVID-19 has been a dampener as the bank under his watch continues to scale new frontiers and post assuring results.\n\nAudited Year end results for 2020 show that UBA continues to enjoy both top and bottom line growth with Profit after Tax growing by 27.7% to N113.8billion, up from N89.1 billion in the same period of 2019. This performance puts the Bank\u2019s annualized return on average equity at 17.2%. The Bank continues to maintain very strong balance sheet with total Assets of N7.7 trillion, a 37.0% growth over last year. Customer Deposits have also grown to N5.7trillion while shareholders\u2019 funds remained very strong at N724.1trillion.\n\nMore importantly, UBA has become a global player driving infrastructure projects across the continent. Today, locally and internationally, UBA has become a household name and has transformed into a financial powerhouse, and a totem of the new Africa \u2013 A continent of possibilities.\n\nA through-bred professional who honed his skills in various ivy league institutions in Nigeria, Europe and the USA , Kennedy sits on the boards of reputable institutions and is a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Bankers in Nigeria.\n\nHerbert Onyewumbu Wigwe GMD/CEO, Access Bank Plc: Great Achiever\n\nOther chief executive officers might have looked at a smattering of branch network in states of the federation and the capital territory and wonder how they could ever match the growth of bigger and more established banks.\n\nNot Herbert Onyewumbu Wigwe, who viewed Access Banks relatively light branch network in states like Lagos, Rivers, Ogun, Rivers, Kano and the FCT as an opportunity to pursue aggressive growth.\n\nIn collaboration with his partner, Aigboje Aig Imoukhuede, the duo had acquired Access Bank in 2002. So small was the bank then that it ranked 65th in the nation and could only boast of 89 branches across the country, that transforming it into one of Nigerias biggest bank by branches and customer base became a task that must be met.\n\nA strategist, Wigwe and his team deployed assets and skills in management to restore investors confidence in the bank. The move, aside shoring the bank\u2019s brand equity and giving shareholders more reasons to believe, improved its balance sheet.\n\nTwo decades after, Access Bank under Wigwe\u2019s leadership has remained a value-focused financial institution while setting the pace in corporate governance and fiscal.\n\nFrom number 65 in 2000, Access Bank is today the largest bank by asset base, and one of the top five banks in Nigeria in terms of loans, deposits and branch network. In fact, with its merger with Diamond Bank Plc in 2019, Access Bank becomes the largest bank in Nigeria and Africa by customer base (36 million customers), with a network of over 600 branches and service outlets covering three continents and 12 countries.\n\nThe story of infrastructural development, not only in Nigeria, but in Sub-Saharan Africa, cannot be complete without mentioning the contribution of the burgeoning bank. As one of the nation\u2019s foremost corporate bankers, Wigwe has helped develop some of continent\u2019s biggest companies in the construction, telecommunications, energy and oil and gas sectors through the provision of financial support and expertise, particularly MTN.\n\nDespite its successes, Wigwe is not contended with been a local player. He has continued to look at opportunities to build the bank\u2019s network in global trade and payment centres.\n\nThe bank recently acquired controlling stakes in several African banks, including South Africas 74-year-old Grobank for $60 million; Kenyas Transnational Bank and Zambia-based Cavmont Bank.\n\nUnder his leadership, Access Bank has received many awards. They include the BusinessDay Bank/CEO of the Year awards; Outstanding Business Sustainability Achievement Award by Karlsruhe.\n\nIn 2016, the Boys Brigade (BB), inaugurated Wigwe as Patron for the Lagos State Council in recognition of his exemplary role in the society and contributions to youth development.\n\nBorn on August 15, 1966 in Lagos to parents of Ikwerre descent from Omueke Isiokpo, Wigwe attended the University of Nigeria where he acquired a degree in accountancy, an MA in Banking and Finance from the University College of North Wales and an M.Sc in Financial Economics from the University of London. He is also an Alumnus of the Harvard Business School Executive Management Program.\n\nThe Access Bank CEO started his professional career at Coopers & Lybrand, Lagos as a management consultant, later qualifying as a chartered accountant.\n\nAfter a brief stint at Capital Bank, he joined GTBank where he spent over a decade working in corporate and institutional banking, rising to become the executive director in charge of institutional banking.\n\nSince January 2014, he has been the chief executive officer and Group managing director of Access Bank. Before then, he served as the bank\u2019s deputy managing director for over a decade.\n\nApart from being the current Chairman of Access Bank (UK) Limited, Wigwe is a board member of Nigerian Mortgage Refinance Company and a member of the advisory Board for Friends Africa.\n\nHe is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN FCA), a Fellow of The Institute of Credit Administration, and an Honorary member of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria.

          "text": "By OKEY ONYENWEAKU\n\nNigeria\u2019s debt profile will soon hit $36.3trillion as soon as the federal government accesses the N2.343trillion (about $6.183billion) as contained in the 2021 budget. The new borrowing will raise the country\u2019s debt stock to between N33 trillion to N36.3 trillion.\n\nIt will be recalled that only a few months ago, the federal government has secured the approval of the National Assembly to access N1.296 trillion ($2.7billion) which the Senate approved for the government.\n\nThe new external loans comprise $1.5 billion, to be sourced from the World Bank, and \u20ac995 million ($1.2 billion) from other international agencies, for the federal and state governments.\n\nAccessing the loans will consequently jack up Nigeria\u2019s total public debt, which as of December 31, 2020 was N32.915 trillion ($84.574 billion), according to data from the Debt Management Office (DMO). This will also affect the level of debt hanging on the head of every Nigerian alive today and those who will be born in the next two years or more even as they are already neck deep in debt. But even with this, part of the irony is that not many people know that they are debtors by virtue of the indebtedness of the country.\n\nExperts explain that public debt is how much a country owes to lenders outside of itself. These can include individuals, businesses, and even other governments. The term \u201cpublic debt\u201d is often used interchangeably with the term sovereign debt.\n\nPublic debt according to them usually only refers to national debt. Some countries however also include the debt owed by states, provinces, and municipalities. Therefore, experts advise on the need for caution when comparing public debt between countries to make sure the definitions are the same.\n\nNigerias ballooning debt profile has raised major concerns from various stakeholders. The last time Business Hallmark research ventured up that field, it was discovered that Nigeria already owes as much as N32trillion ( $86.39billion) and nurses other plans to borrow more. The Federal Government feels convinced that since its debt-to GDP ratio was still below 25% per cent, it still has a lot of room to accommodate more debts.\n\nThe Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed made a public statement recently that although the country has expanded its borrowing portfolio, it was still below 25 per cent of the debt-to-GDP ratio and thus still operating within its borrowing limit.\n\nShe said: The total borrowing of the country as of 31 of December (2020) is 21.6 per cent of the GDP. So, if we were not looking at adding the other category of loans that I mentioned, we dont even need to increase that at this time.\n\nAs of 2019, the debt-to-GDP ratio was 19.2 per cent, so only two per cent was added. According to her, though the loan issue is a touchy one, it is not out of place for government to borrow to stay afloat while striving to increase its revenue.\n\nDetails show that Nigeria has a deficit of N5.2trillion, representing 3.6 per cent of the N13.5trillion. Nigeria will spending about 60 per cent of its revenues as interest on the loans burden. The country expects revenue of about N8trillion which it is not absolutely sure to realise given the headwinds and other challenges.\n\nIn this instance, the government may be borrowing a leaf from economies that have sustainable ways of servicing and refunding the loans as and when due. For instance, in October 2020, the total U.S. debt was over $27 trillion. The debt-to-GDP ratio was 139% at that time. That\u2019s based on the second quarter 2020 GDP of $19.5 trillion. Whereas the U.S economy and other developed economies are productive and can realise good revenues, Nigeria is still a mono-economy depending for up to as much as 80 per cent for its foreign exchange inflow. The development does not place Nigeria on the same pedestal with the developed economies.\n\nUnfortunately, as the debt stock of Nigeria continues to rise, an expert who wouldnt want to be mentioned said governments tend to take on too much debt because the benefits make them popular with voters. Increasing the debt allows government leaders to increase spending without raising taxes. Investors usually measure the level of risk by comparing debt to a country\u2019s total economic output, known as gross domestic product (GDP). The debt- to -GDP ratio gives an indication of how likely the country can pay off its debt.\n\nSome economists have explained that a countrys debt is sustainable if it is able to finance its debt obligations without external help or going into default.\n\nThere is no single accepted measure of debt sustainability but the two most common metrics are the Debt-GDP ratio which compares the size of a countrys debt to its economy and Debt Servicing-Government Revenue ratio which compares how much a country pays in debt financing with how much it earns in a given period., they maintain.\n\nThe fear of many discerning Nigerians has been that the countrys debt may be headed to about $40billion if conscious effort is not taken to apply adequate strategies that would checkmate such a worrisome possibility.\n\nBut many experts have faulted this line of argument of the government on debt ratio to GDP instead of using debt ratio to revenue. Already analysts believe that the nation is being plunged into another round of deeper indebtedness given that debt to revenue now stands at about 60 per cent.\n\nWhen debt approaches a critical level, investors usually start demanding a higher interest rate. They want more return for the greater risk, an analyst told BH.\n\nNow, public debt is on the rise again, driven by aggressive borrowing by the present administration and currency devaluation that has further increased the size of the foreign debt. Many international bodies such as the World Bank have raised concern over the speed and scale of Nigerias borrowing, often highlighting its weak Debt Servicing Ratio, another analyst who pleaded anonymity said.\n\nA respected economist and former Managing Director of a big bank in Nigeria, Mr. Emma Nwosu had in an article argued that , The Minister of Finance begs the question by rationalizing the borrowing spree with her purported 21 per cent Debt to GDP Ratio, relative to the universally acceptable 50 55 per cent. She ought to know that GDP-based ratios could only be presumed for dynamic economies, with efficient allocation and domestic capacity to respond promptly to government spending and other measures for driving the economy to a new equilibrium. It is the Debt to Revenue Ratio that applies to inelastic, mono-product and import-dependent economies like ours. Transition is not imminent either. Our rulers are primarily interested in measures for clinging to power. The ones for economic transformations are secondary and half-hearted\n\nBy maintainable revenues, Nigeria is over-borrowed and has crossed the threshold of the debt trap, as would be demonstrated. The economic outlook is very bad. Crude oil and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are in decline. There is the threat of full-blown recession, accelerated by Covid-19 lockdown. Tax coverage and other sources of revenue remain limited. The ethical track record of the government is also bad, Nwosu had added.\n\nThere is a consensus that the level of debt that an economy can bear depends on numerous factors: the economys expected rate of economic growth; whether domestic or foreign borrowers, or domestic government institutions, own debt; the countrys fiscal capacity; inflationary expectations; currency risk; and default risk. While it easy to determine where Nigeria ranks in this parameter now given the new budget, both local and international communities are aware that the country economy is very weak in every standard measurement. However, Nigerias debt to Gross Domestic Product may look good, but analysts believe that the devil is in the details of debt to revenue and servicing.\n\nOn his part, the banker and public personality, Dr. Alex Otti has expressed a strong view opined about the need to open the eyes of many Nigerians to the sad and alarming situation of the countrys indebtedness. He stresses that the issue was not in accumulating debt but in the capacity to service it.\n\nEconomists define debt service as the cash that is required to cover the repayment of interest and principal on a debt for a particular period. This ratio helps to determine the borrower\u2019s ability to make debt service payments because it compares the company\u2019s net income to the amount of principal and interest the firm must pay.\n\nAccording to them, debt service ratio is the ratio of debt service payments (principal + interest) of a country to that country\u2019s export earnings.\n\nA country\u2019s international finances are healthier when this ratio is low.\n\nAmong other things, there is an entrenched structural defect that ensures that we spend over 70% of our budget on recurrent expenditure and less than 30% on Capital expenditure. The recurrent vote goes mostly into running government while the rest of the people are meant to benefit from the capital expenditure. Our final submission is that we must restructure this country to streamline and tame cost of governance and focus on pulling our people out of poverty. We can choose to do it voluntarily or wait for economic forces to force us to do it. The choice is ours, Otti reportedly expressed in an interview with a newspaper in Nigeria recently.\n\nDid the Holy Book not say that the borrower is slave to the lender? These are indeed quite troubling times. But as Nigerians also say, the struggle continues!",

          "text": "By AYOOLA OLAOLUWA\n\nAn increased number of Nigerian youths in a desperate bid to survive the impact of economic meltdown, are daily flocking to sports betting centres with the hope of winning money from bets to make ends meet, Business Hallmark findings can reveal.\n\nAccording to findings, while betting firms are making billions daily by leveraging on Nigerias huge football addiction to big European leagues, such as the English Premier league, Italian Serie A, German Bundesliga and the Spanish La Liga, millions of unemployed and underemployed youths are now engaged in betting activities in the hope of earning income.\n\nAlso, the customer base of betting firms has broadened to include young middle-class Nigerians seeking to earn more money to supplement dwindling income.\n\nData from Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), shows that mobile penetration increased from 36% to 70% in the last five years, adding to the increased awareness through aggressive expansion and marketing by operators as well as technological improvements in payment platforms.\n\nThe rise in sports betting is aided by high unemployment rate in the country which remains remains high at 33.3% (28,764,614) in Q4 2020 from 27.1% in Q2 2020, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), while 15,915,639 were under-employed (i.e., working between 20-29 hours per week).\n\nThis singular factor, it was gathered, has contributed greatly to the rise in sports betting, with many Nigerians in sports betting calling it the easiest way to make money through wealth redistribution.\n\nThough, there is no specific official figure, different studies by industry experts indicate that Nigerians spend over N730 billion annually on sports betting and at least two billion naira is generated daily. Data also revealed that over 60 million Nigerian punters spend over 3, 000 naira daily placing bet stakes.\n\nThis figure does not include the poor masses who are in the majority, and who spend as little as N100 daily. With a young population of nearly 190 million, Nigeria is a great opportunity for gaming businesses, noted a booking agent with NaijaBets who did not want his identity disclosed.\n\nNigerians plough about $5.5 million into sports betting every day, totaling an incredible $2 billion a year. Bet9ja, the biggest betting brand in Nigeria, returned a monthly turnover of $10 million as at 2016, said another accounting firm, KPMG.\n\nAccording to KPMG, NairaBet is also mining gold from gaming, with an estimated turnover of $3 $5 million dollars every month.\n\nDuring a visit to a gaming shop belonging to Betnaija in Jankara, Ijaiye-Ojokoro, scores of youths were observed trying out their luck either through lotteries or virtual games (dog race and horse race). It was also observed that betting encompasses all sports, including boxing, wrestling, golf and lawn tennis, with football been the preferred game due largely to the fact that most Nigerians are more conversant with happenings in the football world and are trying to play safe by favouring football.\n\nA player, it was observed, can play with as little as N100 to win as much as N100,000. However, findings revealed that only a few are lucky, with many losing their money to the bet companies.\n\nThis, however, seems not to deter stakers and would be betters as more desperate youths visit betting centres daily to try out their luck. Betting firms preferred by Nigerians include Bet9ja and NaijaBet, Surebet247 and Nairabet.\n\nWhile most educated youths tried out their luck with sports betting, the less educated seem to prefer lotteries, or what is popularly known as Baba Ijebu.\n\nUnlike sports betting where a player can stake from N100, those playing lotteries can stake as little as N50 to win on the Premier Bet Lotto or Baba Ijebu platform owned by lotto billionaire, Chief Adebutu Kessington.\n\nChecks also revealed that Nigerians not only patronise local betting sites and firms, but foreign platforms like Skybet and Bet365 in the UK in the hope of winning in foreign correncies.\n\nA staff in one of the branches of Nairabet told BH that most people place their bets on football teams in the big European leagues.\n\nHardly will you see anyone placing a bet on basketball, horse race, tennis, boxing etc. A few people do though. But this thing is mainly football.\n\n\u201cAnd people win every day. People also lose. But the losers are far more than the winners\u201d, he said.\n\nAnother player, Andrew Ebelo, said without betting, he would committed suicide or have taken to crime.\n\nI am addicted to sports bettng. I just cant do without it. It has become a part of me. I went into it because I dont have a job. If I had something doing, I would have still gone into it for the fun of it because I love football and really know about it. But my situation today is that my life depends on it\u201d, one addict who simply gave his name as said a staker in a Bet9ja shop in ikeja, Lagos.\n\nOn the risk of losing money, he maintained: Like every business in life there are ups and downs. You win some and you lose some. But in my own case I have won more than I have lost because I play wisely.\u201d\n\nAnother Nigerian youth heavilly involved in sports betting,.Solomon Ekanem, said betting has become a means of livelihood to him.\n\nThis is how I survive. I thank God for sports betting. Without it, I am sure many people would have turned to crime for survival. Why dont we look at the brighter side of it instead of bringing out the negative aspect of it?\u201d, the 27 year old graduate explained.\n\nOn what will happen at the expiration of the current European football season in May, an agent of one of the betting forms told our correspondent that there is no cause for alarm as other games like virtual matches are available to stakers during off-seasons.\n\nSpeaking on the development, the Chief Executive Officer, SOFUNIX Investment and Communications Limited, Mr. Sola Oni, said that people are easily lured to lotteries, sports betting and other schemes like MMM owing to the hardship in the country.\n\nAs the economic recession bites harder, it is easy to lure unsuspecting but gullible people to fall prey to these wonder schemes, Oni said.\n\nMeanwhile, the nation\u2019s sports betting industry has continued to attract an unprecedented level of interest, as foreign investors sought to have a piece of the over N2billion daily stakes, BH investigations have revealed.\n\nAccording to checks, the huge appetite for equity in high yielding and lucrative gaming firms has intensified lately as investors hungry for higher returns see bullish future in the nations gaming industry.\n\nAvailable data suggests that while more than 50 betting sites currently operate in the country, over 60 million Nigerians are actively involved in sports betting, staking over N2 billion daily.\n\nSome of the sports betting companies operating in the country include Betking, Bet9ja, Nairabet, Merrybet, Naijabet, Sporting Bet, Surebet24, and several others.\n\nAccording to a report titled, The gaming industry in Nigeria by top accounting and auditing firm, PwC, obtained by BH, Nigeria is the second largest online gambling market in Africa, behind South Africa, with a Gross Gaming Revenue of $58 million in 2018. The report projects that the GGR will rise by 16% over a five-year period.\n\nA lot has changed within the Nigerian gaming landscape since April 2016. The gaming industry has continued to expand, benefitting fron the large and youthful population, improving internet penetration, and the increasing access to internet-enabled devices, the PwC report stated.\n\nOne of such companies that has shown interest in gaining foothold in the Nigerian sport betting industry is South African pay TV operator Multichoice.\n\nMultichoice recently announced that it acquired a 20% stake in a gambling company with major operations in Nigeria, BetKing. The value of the deal is worth R1.8 billion.\n\nAccording to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Multichoice, Calvo Mawela, sport betting augments his companys business as sport is major revenue source for the company. He added that BetKing has grown fast in Nigeria and that there are plans to expanding to South Africa.\n\nWe have a lot of sport on our platform, and many people that are betting watch more games. They plan to be pan-African and will be entering South Africa at some stage too, Mawela said.\n\nSources privy to the deal said it is valued at $81 million upfront, with a further $31 million performance-dependent payment possible later.\n\nEarlier in July 2020, BetKing entered a sponsorship deal with the Football Kenya Federation (FKF). The deal is the biggest sponsorship deal in the history of Kenyan football.\n\nValued at $11 million (1.2 billion Kenyan shilling), the sponsorship deal will end in 2025. According to the FKF, each club in the Kenyan league will receive 8 million Kenyan Shillings a year ($1= 107.85 Kenyan shillings) thanks to the partnership.\n\nIn 2018, British online betting firm, Betway, launched in Nigeria to fight for its own share of the market. Likewise, Russias 1XBet and Slovakias DOXXbet have both set up in Nigeria in the last two years while Italys Goldbet was ahead of the trend, taking a 50 percent stake in market leader Bet9ja when the Nigerian firm launched in 2015.\n\nAnother sport betting firm that is currently making waves in Nigeria is SportyBet, recently founded by an Indian businessman, Sudeep Dalamal Ramnani. It is an international sports betting and real-money gaming operator that delivers an omni-channel entertainment experience in regulated emerging markets.\n\nSportyBet is wholly owned by the founder who is also the chief executive officer. Sudeep is also an investor in Fintech and mobile payments and an advocate of the growing African internet ecosystem.\n\nOn the other hand, a Nigerian owned betting firm, NairaBet, in a bid to reach the more buoyant middle class who are concerned with the stigma associated with gaming in Nigeria, employed the services of fintech giants, Paystack and Flutterwave to provide easy and affordable electronic payment platforms.\n\nAccording to the Chief Executive Officer of NairaBet, the company added Flutterwave and Paystack as payment options without any fanfare, and within months the company becomes Nigerias second biggest betting firm, with over 4 million regular customers on its website, up from 500,000 in 2013.\n\nThere is a gradual shift to online now, that is where the industry is going. The ease of electronic payments, cost of running shops and ability for customers to avoid the stigma of gambling in public meant online transactions has really grown our business, Alabi stated.",

The parent company maintains a controlling share through Setfirst Ltd and SmithKline Beecham Ltd.\n\nThe Company recently published its unaudited first quarter (Q1) 2021 consolidated financial statements for the period ended 31 March 2021, and it was not an encouraging result, as it reflected the prevailing economic temperature.\n\nA lot of key indicators showed a year-on-year decline. For instance, Group revenue (turnover) plummeted from \u20a64.99 billion in Q1 2020 to \u20a63.46 billion in Q1 2021 reflecting a decline of over 30.66%. The revenue fall, according to analysts was attributed to a sharp decline in the local sale of its healthcare products.\n\nAmbrose Omokordion Chief Research Officer at Investa, said \u201cthe woeful performance of GSK has actually reflected market sentiment in the last two years. The purchasing power of average Nigerian has dropped significantly due to poor economic management by this administration, the pandemic and influx of contraband pharmaceutical products to the country.\u201d\n\nTotal loss after tax as of Q1 2021 was \u20a6238.07 million compared to a profit after tax of \u20a6113.47 million for the same period to Q1 2020.\n\nThe company is basically divided into two segments viz: Consumer Healthcare and Pharmaceuticals, and while the Healthcare segment was largely profitable in Q1 2021 (making a profit before tax of \u20a6 8.73 million by March 31, 2021, the pharmaceuticals segment made a loss of \u20a6262.93 million in the same period.\n\nThe Consumer Healthcare part of the company consists of oral health products, digestive health products, respiratory health products, pain relievers, over the counter medicines, and nutritional healthcare; while the pharmaceutical segment is made up of antibacterial medicines, vaccines, and prescription drugs.\n\nWhile goods for the consumer healthcare segment are produced in the country, the pharmaceuticals are all imported.\n\nBusiness Hallmark\u2019s investigation showed that imported pharmaceutical products are thus hugely exposed to the vagaries and hazards of foreign currency fluctuations. There\u2019s a negligible income from export as there was no revenue from the foreign sale of its healthcare products (same as in Q1 2020), as the company did not export its products out of the country.\n\nAll these have had negative effects on sales. A lot of factors actually wiped off the marginal profits made by the company such as the cost of importing the antibacterial, vaccines and prescription drugs, and the significant local operating expenses.\n\nIn effect, the gross profit of \u20a6508.12 million made by the pharmaceutical segment of the company was wiped off by an operating expense of \u20a6735.7 million and this resulted in a net loss for the pharmaceutical segment of the business.\n\nApart from the impact of imported pharmaceutical products as already discussed, other issues that affected the companys Q1 2021 results and are likely to continue to affect its performance in future include: A limited product mix that has only the likes of Macleans and Sensodyne (Oral Healthcare); Pain relievers (Panadol and Voltaren).\n\nOthers are Digestive Health (Andrews Liver Salt); and Respiratory Health (Otrivin and Panadol Cold and Catarrh) all within the Consumer Healthcare segment. Increased competition, particularly from local pharmaceutical manufactures of similar over the counter medicines and other prescription medications and vaccines.\n\nAkin Adeoye, a brand analyst said \u201ccompanies like GSK needs to restrategise, it has not shown its hand in the area of products promotion in this era of stuff competition. Besides, our borders are open to all forms of pharmaceutical products that are not supposed to be here.\u201d\n\nHe further told this newspaper that unless a new strategy to sale their products are put in place, companies like GSK will continue to suffer.\n\nRecall that in October 2016, GSK Plc divested its drinks bottling and distribution business that manufactures and distributes Lucozade and Ribena in Nigeria, and other assets including the factory used for the drinks business to Suntory Beverage & Food Limited. The loss in revenue from these popular brands continues to impact its topline.\n\nGlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is a global healthcare company and is well-known and acknowledged for its pioneering role in discovering and distributing vaccines for the likes of hepatitis A and B, meningitis, tetanus, influenza, rabies, typhoid, chickenpox, diphtheria, whooping cough, cervical cancer and many more.\n\nIt is also renowned for its manufacture and distribution of prescription medicines such as antibiotics and treatments for such ailments as asthma, HIV/AIDS, malaria, depression, migraines, diabetes, heart failure, and digestive disorders.\n\nPerhaps GSK Plcs fortunes may change if the company is able to obtain the parent companys licence to manufacture GSK-owned vaccines and prescription medicines within the country while also exploring the possibility of extending the sale of its products outside the shores of the country.\n\nSince different expertise is required for vaccines and prescription drug manufacture and distribution as compared to manufacture and sale of consumer healthcare products, perhaps another alternative may be for the company to create two separate companies with one company being a 100% vaccines and prescription drug pharmaceutical manufacturing and distribution company while the second company specializes entirely in the manufacture and sale of consumer healthcare products.\n\nAs a result of the Q1 2021 performance, the company\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) dropped to -20 kobo compared to the 9 kobo earnings per share reported in Q1 2020. At the start of 2021, GSK Plc\u2019s share price was \u20a66.90 but the company has since lost over 10% of its price valuation as the company\u2019s share price closed at \u20a66.20 on April 30, 2021..",

These are the proper and legal fora for national debate, not some lopsided, undemocratic body with a pre-determined set of objectives\u201d.\n\nBMO said the public hearing for amendment of constitution as facilitated by National Assembly committee on Constitution review is the only acknowledged constitutional platform recognized by law, as part of the process of amending the Constitution and should be acknowledged by everybody.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly has been very much up to speed on national opinions around the amendment and updating of the Nigerian Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe much-awaited zonal public hearings on the review of the 1999 Constitution would hold from May 26 to 27 and the event would hold simultaneously across 12 state capitals in Nigeria. It would witness two public hearings per geopolitical zone and a national public hearing is expected to hold in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cWhile Jos and Minna would host the public hearings in the North Central geopolitical zone, North East and North West would hold in Bauchi and Gombe, as well as Kaduna and Sokoto respectively. Similarly, South-East would hold in Owerri and Enugu, South-South and South-West would be hosted in Port Harcourt and Asaba, as well as Akure and Lagos respectively.\n\n\u201cChairman, Senate Committee on Constitution Review, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege called on those who have already submitted memoranda to speak to the documents at the events\u201d.\n\nAccording to the group, this is a huge opportunity for all \u2018marginalised\u2019 groups, canvassers of a new Constitution, canvassers of new input into the Constitution and champions of redemption of errors in the Constitution to present their arguments for amendment of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cEthic irredentists that have made restructuring a symposium should also exploit this opportunity. This is the right and true process to amend the Nigerian Constitution with intent at restructuring as highlighted by the committee and anyone who has an interest in any aspect of the Constitution that needs to be amended can forward to the Constitution review committee,\u201d the statement added.",

There is a heavy downpour now that a temporarily suspended airstrike continued in Odenkwume Odenkwume.\u201d\n\nHURIWA added that the continuous deployment of military force will rather than solve the current security challenges in the South East of Nigeria and South South with specific reference to the unwarranted attacks targeting police formations and operatives by unknown gunmen, will increase since most people will assume that President Buhari has declared a unilateral and illegal warfare against the law abiding citizens of South East of Nigeria.\n\nThe group has therefore asked the government to stop these unlawful airstrikes before they lead to loss of innocent lives of villagers who now live in a state of fear and a climate of panic.\n\nAlso, HURIWA described the death of the Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Ibrahim Attahiru and other officers in a military plane crash as regrettably avoidable and tragic, has tasked the yet to be named successor to the office of the Chief of Army Staff in Nigeria to be mindful of the inherent human rights of Citizens recognized by law.\n\nThey charge on the new Chief of Army Staff to compel soldiers to comply by rules of engagement and adhere strictly to the human rights provisions enshrined in the grundnorm was because according to the Rights group, the notoriety of the military Under the short spell of time that the late Lieutenant General Ibrahim Attahiru spent constituted global opprobrium and was reprehensible.",

It said Johnson, who played a leading role in Black Lives Matter protests last year, had received \u201cnumerous death threats.\u201d\n\nUK Police told ARISE News that Johnson \u2018s injuries are life threatening. The activist has received many death threats in the past, her friends told ARISE News.\n\nJohnson has been operated on at Kings College Hospital for a serious head injury. Another man has also been shot \u2013 his condition isn\u2019t known.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police force said a 27-year-old woman was in a hospital in critical condition after being shot in southeast London early Sunday. It did not identify her, but said \u201cthere is nothing to suggest it was a targeted attack or that the woman had received any credible threats against her before this incident.\u201d\n\nThe force said officers were called to reports of gunshots in the Peckham area of the city just before 3 a.m. on Sunday. Police said the shooting took place near a house where a party was taking place.\n\nDetectives have appealed for witnesses and have not made any arrests.\n\nThe recently founded Taking the Initiative Party said Johnson, a member of its executive leadership committee, was \u201ca strong, powerful voice for our people and our community.\u201d\n\nJohnson rose to prominence last year during the Black Lives Matter protests, as a leader of the TTIP, which has been called \u201cBritain\u2019s first Black-led political party.\u201d\n\nShe is a mother of two, and also works to deliver food and groceries to families in need, according to the party.",
