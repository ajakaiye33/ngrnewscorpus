          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nMaternal health experts have warned against not taking all necessary precautions before engaging in labour induction during child delivery, noting that the procedure can cause serious complications and fatality.\n\nThey also stressed that private health facilities without skilled birth attendants should not carry out a caesarean section or perform labour induction.\n\nAccording to the experts, labour induction is never an emergency procedure, noting that it can lead to maternal and neonatal deaths when poorly performed.\n\nThe maternal health experts stated that labour induction is usually planned and also done based on certain reasons and indications.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with PUNCH HealthWise, the gynaecologists warned traditional birth attendants and private hospitals without safe CS delivery facilities to desist from carrying out labour induction.\n\nOne of the experts, a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Idi-Araba, Dr. Babasola Okusanya, says labour induction is not what anybody can do.\n\nOkusanya explained, \u201cThere are indications for labour induction. The most common indication is for a prolonged pregnancy. Other indications could be hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, intrauterine growth restriction and diabetes mellitus in pregnancy.\n\n\u201cInduction of labour has reasons and when the reasons have been met, it is usually planned. It is never an emergency procedure. The main reason for labour induction is to achieve vaginal delivery.\n\n\u201cBefore you start it, you must be sure that there is nothing in that woman that will prevent her from delivering vaginally. You must make sure that the baby is lying straight and not lying across the woman\u2019s abdomen. You must make sure that nothing is blocking the birth canal. You must be sure that the baby is of normal size.\u201d\n\nThe gynaecologist noted that labour induction should not be performed on pregnant women with big babies, warning that it could lead to the rupture of the uterus.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t do induction on a woman whose baby has been assessed to be very big and may not be able to pass through the birth canal of the woman.\n\n\u201cIn any place where labour induction should be done, that facility should be able to perform safe caesarean delivery. While we hope and plan that induction of labour will succeed, there are instances where you have to have a very good and quick recourse to CS.\n\n\u201cFor instance, all has been well with the baby while induction of labour has started, then the foetal heart rate of the baby shows that the baby cannot tolerate the induction anymore, you have to go for CS. Again, maybe you have started the induction and the woman is bleeding, you have to go for CS\u201d, he said.\n\nOkusanya urged pregnant women not to put their lives and the lives of their unborn babies at risk by patronising health facilities without skilled birth attendants and by allowing themselves to be induced by quacks.\n\nThe gynaecologist cautioned, \u201cTBAs should not even think of labour induction. Private health facilities that don\u2019t have skilled birth attendants and cannot do CS should not induce labour. Women should patronise qualified hospitals where they can get quality care. If labour induction is poorly managed, it can lead to maternal and neonatal deaths.\u201d\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, induction of labour is the process of artificially stimulating the uterus to start labour. It is usually performed by administering oxytocin or prostaglandins to the pregnant woman or by manually rupturing the amniotic membranes.\n\nWHO says induction of labour should be performed only when there is a clear medical indication for it and the expected benefits outweigh its potential harms.\n\nThe United Nations health agency recommends induction of labour for women who are known with certainty to have reached 41 weeks of gestation.\n\n\u201cInduction of labour should be performed with caution since the procedure carries the risk of uterine hyperstimulation and rupture and foetal distress. Wherever induction of labour is carried out, facilities should be available for assessing maternal and foetal well-being.\n\n\u201cFailed induction of labour does not necessarily indicate caesarean section. Wherever possible, induction of labour should be carried out in facilities where caesarean section can be performed\u201d, WHO says.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says sometimes, labour induction does not work.\n\n\u201cA failed attempt at induction may mean that you will need to try another induction or have a caesarean delivery. The chance of having a caesarean delivery is greatly increased for first-time mothers who have labour induction, especially if the cervix is not ready for labour.\n\n\u201cThere are risks associated with labour induction. With some methods, the uterus can be overstimulated, causing it to contract too frequently. Too many contractions may lead to changes in the foetal heart rate, umbilical cord problems, and other problems,\u201d ACOG says.\n\nAlso speaking, another Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at LUTH, Dr. Ephraim Ohazurike, says labour that is being induced is high risk and should be managed by experts.\n\n\u201cThe commonest risk that we see around here is the rupture of the uterus. The baby can die. Injudicious use of drugs for induction can cause rupture of the uterus and the woman can die from it.\n\n\u201cLabour that is being induced is high risk. It is not even a labour that you do without the presence of a gynaecologist or an obstetrician because it is a high risk labour. Once you start inducing labour, that labour can go in any direction.\n\n\u201cSo, it is something that an obstetrician should do or somebody who is skilled in CS and all kinds of surgeries so that when an issue comes up, it can be effectively handled. Labour induction is not something you do where there is no obstetrician\u201d, Ohazurike said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Why there is trouble in South- East \u2014 Ngige",
          "text": "By Victor Ahiuma-Young, Abuja\n\nMinister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige has called for an end to the propaganda orchestrated by the elites in the South-East zone against the Federal Government.\n\nThe former Anambra State Governor said the propaganda provoked the troubles being noticed in that part of the country.\n\nNgige spoke in Abuja at an Emergency Stakeholders meeting of the Association of Eze Ndigbo, 19 Northern States and Abuja.\n\nA statement from the minister\u2019s Media Office said the meeting was summoned to discuss the wanton destruction of lives and properties in the South-East zone and the insecurity bedevilling Ndigbo as a people.\n\nAlso Read: Democracy Day: Protests sponsored, uncalled for \u2014 Idahosa\n\nAddressing the participants, Ngige said Buhari has shown friendship to Ndigbo, maintaining that the South East has gotten a fair share of what is due to the zone, especially infrastructure wise.\n\nHe said, \u201cThere is no maltreatment there. We are in the Federal Executive Council (FEC), which is composed of a minister per state. But we have one extra ministerial slot. So, the South East is effectively represented to ensure justice is done to our people. We are there to talk when there is no justice.\n\n\u201cPeople can say that we are not honoured with appointments of Inspector General of Police, Chief of Army Staff and Secretary to the Federal Government (SGF). These are positions we have enjoyed before in the Nigerian Federation. We had two Inspectors General of Police (IGP), Ogbonnaya Onovo and Mike Okiro. We had an SGF, Senator Pius Anyim. We had four Senate Presidents. Twice we produced Deputy Senate President and Deputy Speaker, Ike Ekweremadu and Emeka Ihedioha. They were in charge of federal budgets for eight years from 2007 to 2015. That is the rule in the National Assembly.\n\n\u201cSo, if you now talk about appointments, it becomes a matter of perception. I won\u2019t blame them. Perception and reality are in the same line. A lot of them don\u2019t understand how government works. A lot of them don\u2019t understand that I a member of FEC can influence things that will come to my State, my zone or any other area and where we think things should be sited or done in Nigeria. For me, those people perceiving that are ignorant. I don\u2019t want to use the word mischievous.\n\n\u201cBut much, more importantly, propaganda against the government by the elites in the South-East should stop because it is that propaganda that provoked troubles that we are now noticing. People have been brainwashed and the separatists humped on that foundation to now shout from the rooftops that we will give you Biafra and when we give you Biafra, all these things will disappear.\n\n\u201cThere is no country that does not have its own problems. We have economic problems here and that is why we have unemployment and of course, we have a youth bulge in our population. About 60 per cent of them are youths and a lot of them are unemployed. So, the government is devising ways to tackle that. It is a work in progress.\u201d\n\nThe Minister recalled that the Buhari government had paid off all the gratuity and pensions of all the police pensioners in the South East that were neglected since after the war, which no government did before.\n\nHe said the Government assisted the 36 Governors with bailout funds to pay a shortfall in salaries in their respective states and went further to give them budget support to help them to execute budgetary projects and programmes and give life to their people.\n\nAccording to him, the Governors in the South-East zone received the support even though at the time, the zone was a PDP zone.\n\n\u201cInfrastructure wise, if you go to the South East, from Enugu-Okigwe and Umuahia-Aba-Port Harcourt expressways, three companies, the Chinese Company, the Arab Contractors and RCC are there. Some of them have completed their work. A journey that normally takes us five hours from Enugu-Aba is now about one hour, 15 minutes. When the Port Harcourt section is finished, a journey from Enugu to Port Harcourt will take two hours.\n\n\u201cComing to Enugu-Awka- Onitsha, two sections have been finished. RCC is working at the stretch from Awka to Onitsha now. The stretch from Ninth Mile to Oji River has been completed. We are now at the third Section which is being done by Niger-Cat from Amansea to Oji River. The Old Road from Ninth Mile to Awka has also been done by Arab contractors. If you go there now, you will see it is fully completed with drains on both sides.\u201d\n\nHe said the Owerri-Aba and Owerri-Umuahia roads are ongoing, just like the the international highway from Enugu to Abakiliki to Cameroun where the stretch from Enugu to Abakiliki is completed while the stretch from Abakiliki to Cameroun is ongoing.\n\n\u201cEnugu The airport used to be the worst airport in Nigeria. We had three Aviation Ministers, Fidelia Njeze, Stella Odua and Osita Chidoka and did nothing there. Buhari put N10 billion in Enugu Airport. He does not hate Ndigbo.\n\n\u201cThen, the Second Niger Bridge is the biggest of them all. President Buhari took it up from a Private Public Partnership (PPP) Project by which tolls were to be collected. By which foreign loan companies\u2019 financiers were relieved of doing what they wanted to do to stay there forever and ever and it is now a legacy project out of the five that is being done in the whole country.\n\n\u201cThe five legacy projects are Lagos-Ibadan highway, Mambilla project, East-West Road, Abuja-Kaduna-Kano and Second Niger Bridge and the Second Niger Bridge is gulping one of the biggest amounts of money; N386 billion and has undergone 55 per cent completion. Julius Berger said they will deliver in the middle of 2022 and we have no reason to doubt them.\u201d\n\nNgige stated that all these projects were being executed with Sukuk funds, loans and extra-budgetary provisions, since budgetary provisions were not enough.\n\nHe explained that the current administration has not earned enough revenue owing to crash in the price of oil and production level since it came to power, adding that \u201cwe are now getting about 50 per cent of what the previous the government got in terms of internally generated revenue.\u201d\n\nEarlier, in their separate speeches, Eze Ndigbo, Niger State and President of Ndieze Igbo 19 Northern states and FCT Abuja, Eze (Dr) Pampas Nwahiwe and Eze Ndigbo Kano, Boniface Ibekwe, condemned the violence by suspected agitators in the South East who were attacking police and military formations and killing our security personnel, warning that their actions were capable of endangering the lives of their brothers who are living in other parts of Nigeria.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "title": "Uproar over plan to reopen grazing route",
          "text": "From Magnus Eze, Enugu Noah Ebije, Kaduna and Paul Osuyi, Asaba\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s pronouncement last week that his administration would reinstate cattle routes and grazing areas across the country to ensure herders have free access for their animals have continued to generate flaks\n\nIn apparent response to the ban on open cattle grazing by the 17 Southern governors, the president said when the governors gave the directive that open grazing would be banned, he referred them to the gazette that makes provisions for cattle routes and open grazing areas. He then said he has resolved to revive those routes and grazing areas in the country to resolve the issue.\n\n\u201cWhat I told the governors was to ask them to go and dig up the gazette. There are certain routes and grazing areas so that when cattle rearers were moving from the north to the west, they were allowed to go through there. But if you allow your cattle to stray into any farmer\u2019s farm, you are arrested and the farmer is invited to submit his claims. Those who encroach on these cattle routes and grazing areas would be dispossessed.\u201d\n\nHowever, in separate reactions, Arewa, Igbo and Yoruba groups roundly condemned the statement saying the move rather than resolve the issue would exacerbate it.\n\nAs far as the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) is concerned, reactivating open grazing routes may cause legal and security problems.\n\nSpokesman forf the group, Dr. Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, in a telephone interview, reminded the president that the 1999 Constitution gives state governors powers cover land and to even revoke federal land.\n\n\u201cThe reactivation of open grazing routes in southern part or any other parts of the country is problematic both in legal terms and security. I would have said the best way to go is for us to seek legal interpretation beyond the Office of the Attorney General. The Federal Government can actually sue governors that ban open grazing and the court will rule whether they are right or wrong.\n\n\u201cI will reserve final judgment on the president\u2019s position. We caution that there is more to open grazing than availability of land and routes. It is not about opening the grazing routes, it is also about the security of the cattle and herders, and getting the support of communities that they will go through. Our open grazing requires political will. The Federal Government has already adopted the National Livestock Transformation programme to equip the Fulani. We, in the North, are in favour of ban of open grazing but we want it to be done in phases, in an orderly manner that does not harm the cattle and the Fulani. We also support the active intervention of the Federal Government, the northern governors and everybody to make sure that in the next one year or two, open grazing is abolished completely. I think this is the way to go.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Association of South East Town Unions (ASETU) in collaboration with other respected Igbo groups, including Nzuko Umunna, Aka Ikenga, Igbo World Assembly (IWA), World Igbo Congress (WIC), Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF), Ekwe Nche, European Igbo Communities, Igbo Board of Deputies, Council of Igbo States in America, Nkata Ndi Inyom Igbo and South East Community Youth Leaders, rose from a one-day emergency security meeting with a vow to resist open grazing in the region.\n\nThe coalition warned that governors in the zone who fail to implement the ban would be treated as foes.\n\nNational President, ASETU, Chief Emeka Diwe who made their position known, said the meeting totally condemned the continued attacks by killer herdsmen in Igbo communities and urged governors to rise to the occasion and protect their people.\n\nStressing that the primary purpose of political governance was the security of lives and property, the Igbo groups charged governors who had not kick-started the processes of enacting anti-open grazing laws, to as a matter of urgency, send Executive Bills to their respective Houses of Assembly.\n\n\u201cOur position is very clear, which is the stand of Ndigbo; we say no to open grazing and are not making any pretences about that. We insist that any cattle in the South East must be ranched. So, we urge all nomadic herders to leave our land. We also urge our governors to do everything possible to implement the ban on open grazing. In fact, Ndigbo will treat any governor who fails to carry out this heartfelt desire and demand as an enemy. We equally urge each state to have forest guards with legal backing to ensure that our forests do not harbour terrorists and criminals,\u201d Diwe said.\n\nThe groups regretted that President Muhammadu Buhari who had never spoken strongly against the atrocities of Fulani herdsmen and bandits was threatening to visit another festival of blood on the Igbo.\n\nADF recalled that it had been in the forefront of the agitation for the banning of open grazing in Igboland since 2015, hence its insistence on the enactment of anti-open grazing laws as the most potent strategy to prevent armed Fulani herdsmen from overrunning the Southern states.\n\nIts spokesman, Abia Onyike, said the law to be passed in the State Houses of Assembly should be accompanied by clear modalities, instrumentalities and machineries for their enforcement. He added that the effectiveness of this move depended on the synergy between the governors, the legislators and the people, including the civil society organisations.\n\nSimilarly, the pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Jare Ajayi, said the president\u2019s pronouncements fell far short of what was expectation.\n\n\u201cWe have some questions for Mr. President and the Attorney General in this respect. One, who created the so-called grazing routes? At what time in our history did our founding fathers gather to designate specific routes from the north to the south as \u2018grazing routes\u2019? Two, assuming without conceding, that there were so-called grazing routes, what would now happen to structures that have been built in areas where the so-called routes are to be re-opened? Would such structures, including residences and factories be pulled down so that cows would have places to graze? Compared to what would be lost economically, socially, politically and in security terms if these structures are to be pulled down, is it not better to encourage the building of ranches? We can go on and on.\u201d\n\nAfenifere claimed President\u2019s pronouncement on open grazing and his confession on how he determines who occupy positions at the national level seems to indicate that Buhari\u2019s government is operating a constitution that is different from the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cFor instance, Section 2 of the Land Use Act, the law governing land matters in the country, vests the administration and control of lands in a given state in the hands of the governor of the state. It is such that even when the Federal Government wants to use a portion of land, it has to seek the consent of the governor of the state concerned. Since most governors in the country have outlawed open grazing in their respective states, on which land does the Federal Government want to \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018re-open\u2019 its vaunted grazing routes? Why talking of grazing routes in this age when ranching is the fad in all civilised climes?\u201d\n\nThe group claimed President Buhari seems to derive pleasure in shifting blames and responsibilities when pressed on what his government ought to do.\n\nUnknown persons threaten mayhem in Delta\n\nMeanwhile, unknown persons, yesterday, raised the tension in Delta State as they threatened to attack Asaba, the state capital, and Agbor, if Governor Ifeanyi Okowa does not withdraw his support for the ban on open grazing within 72 hours.\n\nAn unsigned letter containing the threat was pasted in strategic locations in Asaba including the fence of the Living Faith Church (Winners Chapel) at Infant Jesus Road.\n\nThe letter titled \u2018Fulani Jihadist Warning: An Open Message of 2 Paragraphs to Delta State\u2019 dated June 13, 2021 warned that \u201cfailure to adhere to this demand for been the host of the 17 governors, Delta State, most likely the city of Asaba and Agbor, shall encounter severe consequences than that of Bornu, Kebbi, Kastina, Kaduna, Enugu, Benue, Oyo and many more that will not respect the Fulani\u2019s heritage, as we take responsibility for the detonate explosive uncovered in the state capital secretariat, which should serve as warning to the Delta State Government for what is to come, should the governor fail to abide to our demand.\u201d",
          "summary": "As far as the Northern Elders Forum (NEF) is concerned, reactivating open grazing routes may cause legal and security problems.\n\u201cThe reactivation of open grazing routes in southern part or any other parts of the country is problematic both in legal terms and security.\nThe Federal Government can actually sue governors that ban open grazing and the court will rule whether they are right or wrong.\nAt what time in our history did our founding fathers gather to designate specific routes from the north to the south as \u2018grazing routes\u2019?\nSince most governors in the country have outlawed open grazing in their respective states, on which land does the Federal Government want to \u2018open\u2019 or \u2018re-open\u2019 its vaunted grazing routes?",

          "text": "From Agaju Madugba, Katsina\n\nKatsina Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has faulted President Muhammadu Buhari on reasons for worsening insecurity in the country.\n\nThe president had during a television interview last week attributed the menace to failure of states and local governments across the country to manage security issues in their respective domains.\n\nBut citing Constitutional provisions, Masari said it was wrong for anybody to blame states and local governments.\n\n\u201cIt is the responsibility of the Federal Government to ensure protection of lives and property of citizens in all nooks and cranny of the country. When you look at the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the issue of security is under the Exclusive List. So, it is the responsibility of the Federal Government and states can only complement and that\u2019s what we have always done and are still doing.\n\n\u201cFrom the local governments, we assist the police, the DSS, the NSDC. There may be states that do not complement efforts of the security agencies and perhaps those are the states that the president was referring to.\n\n\u201cBut sincerely speaking, based on provisions of the Constitution, the blame should go to the Federal Government for the general state of insecurity in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nMasari said he was 100 per cent in support of the clamour for restructuring and devolution of more powers to states which should also entail enhanced revenue to the tiers of government to enable them adequately perform their constitutional roles.\n\nAccording to him, the establishment of a state police would enhance general security as the personnel will be expected to perform their defined roles without infringing on duties of the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cThe issue of a state police is part of what we are talking about and I am for it. All we need to do is to formalise activities of the vigilance groups and community policing and give them clear definitions on their limits and those of the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cWe have the Nigerian police and the NSDC that we currently support their operations and nothing stops a state police from coexisting side by side with the Nigerian police.\n\n\u201cThe issue of security is actually the responsibility of everybody as we all have roles to play. It\u2019s not about the president or the governor or local government chairman or a legislator or minister.\n\n\u201cThese bandits and their informants have addresses. They live within the communities and the people know them and security has no colorations in terms of political party affiliations or religion.\n\n\u201cI am also 100 per cent for restructuring and devolution of powers or whatever you call it. If you devolve, states and local governments will have more financial independence. We should earn resources according to the size and economy of our states.\n\n\u201cDuring the First Republic, Emir of Kano was the highest paid because of the state\u2019s revenue base. What we have today as Katsina State was a province made up of Katsina and Daura emirates. They ran their civil service and police and prisons and judiciary then were under the Native Authority and they did well.\n\n\u201cThey built and managed schools. If it was done successfully then, who says it cannot be done today? We ought to take another look at the Constitution. With the right leadership and proper arrangement, these things are still possible.\n\n\u201cThere are some federal ministries with so many parastatals under each one. How can one person as minister provide effective oversight for these parastatals?\n\n\u201cWe should devolve more power to the states but in such a way that we don\u2019t have to weaken the authority of the Federal Government in terms of performing its constitutional responsibilities.\u201d",

          "text": "From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja\n\nFormer national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari and the ruling party to address the separatist agitations in the country through democratic means instead of deployment of military.\n\nHe said the fact that things are bad and people hungry and angry was not questionable, saying that these were worldwide phenomenon.\n\nHowever, Odigie-Oyegun decried the current security challenge in the country.\n\n\u201cIt is my hope that we will begin to get control of the security of this nation,\u201d he said.\n\nHe spoke during the public presentation of a book, APC\u2019s Litmus Tests, written by Director-General of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Salihu Moh. Lukman, in Abuja, yesterday.\n\nThe former Edo governor said the earlier the APC-led government addressed the escalating agitations, the better to diffuse the kind of stresses the nation is passing through.\n\n\u201cLet me refer to just one aspect of what Governor Atiku Bagudu said. That is the document on true federalism which the party put together that passed through all the organs of the party. The executive of the party, the NWC, the Caucus, the NEC which is the highest organ of the party.\n\n\u201cWhy did we do it at that time? We did it because like, it is happening today, there was this cacophony of voices. Two people in the party could not agree on what they meant by restructuring. So, the party needed to take control of the debate, define the issues, proffer solutions and went so far as to have some drafts legislation. It is not by any chance a perfect document.\n\n\u201cBut it reflects then the thinking and the desires of the Nigerian people. Everybody kept quiet after we brought that document out, publicised it, held press conferences over it and most Nigerians were very, very happy. But once again, we did not make the kind of progress that we could have made and it has become once more, the topical subject in the Nigerian polity.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it has gone beyond us, we now have one or two things that did not happen before, people now wanting to disengage from the federation, which did not happen before and that is a warning sign. If a child ask for garri today you don\u2019t give him, tomorrow he may decide it\u2019s cake he wants and we must not, as political party, we must not as the government of the federation, give the impression that only military governments can fundamentally tamper with the basic structure of this nation.\u201d",

          "text": "\u2022MEND warns Fulani group against planned attack\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Omon-Julius Onabu in Asaba\n\nThe leader of Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) and Chairman of Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF), Chief Edwin Clark, yesterday expressed concern over the silence of President Muhammadu Buhari and Northern elders to threats by Fulani jihadists and Miyetti Allah to attack Delta State for supporting the ban on open grazing.\n\nHe told reporters in Abuja that given their promptness in reacting to similar threats to herdsmen, he had expected Buhari and the Northern elders to condemn the threats to Delta State.\n\nThe group, on Sunday, had given Delta State a 72-hour ultimatum to review its ban on open grazing or risk an attack.\n\nThe group stated that it was angered by the fact that the Delta State Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, hosted the May 11, 2021 meeting of the governors of the 17 Southern states in Asaba, where they resolved to ban open grazing in their domains.\n\nWhile claiming to be protecting the Uthman Dan Fodio heritage of free open grazing in Nigeria and the entire West Africa sub-region, the group asked Okowa to disown the position of the Southern governors on open grazing of cattle.\n\nThe group threatened to attack Asaba and Agbor unless Okowa withdrew his support to open grazing ban.\n\nIt also claimed responsibility for last week\u2019s fire at the Federal Secretariat in Asaba, which destroyed the second floor office of the NYSC completely.\n\nBut in a counter move, another group, which identified itself as the Movement for the Emancipation and the Defence of the Niger Delta cautioned the self-styled \u2018Fulani Jihadists\u2019 group against attacking the state.\n\nClark, while condemning the silence of the federal government and Northern elders said open grazing was buried for good in all the 17 Southern states.\n\nAccording to him, the Northern elders who are always quick to accuse Igbo leaders of not publicly condemning the Nnamdi Kanu-led Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) have not deemed it fit to call the jihadists to order.\n\nHe expressed concern that less than one week after leaders of thought, traditional rulers and others, including himself, met on the state of the nation, the Fulani jihadists issued a threat to attack Delta State.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have watched with restrained patience, the reckless and irresponsible utterances of the so-called Fulani jihadists and the Miyetti Allah, who believe that they own Nigeria from the North to the sea, and, therefore, have the impunity to warn state governments, particularly the Delta State government and governor, to withdraw, within 72 hours, his decision against open grazing, recently taken by the 17 governors of the South, in a meeting held in Asaba.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe have decided to issue this advice and warning to the federal government and the Fulani jihadists that the people of the Niger Delta will resist in such a way that will make it definitely impossible for the federal government\u2019s security forces to cope with should this action escalate.\n\n\u201cWe are reacting because this is not the first time the Fulani and their collaborators have insulted our people. It will be remembered that sometime in 2009, a legislator from Kebbi State in the National Assembly asked the federal government to resettle the people of the Niger Delta in another territory to create a conducive and unhindered atmosphere for the oil companies to operate.\n\n\u201cThat we warn, the resulting consequences will be very unpleasant to them. The federal government has continuously condoned them and behaving as if the federal government is the one giving support to these Fulani Jihadists and the Miyetti Allah because what is happening today in Nigeria, which has resulted in unprecedented insecurity and bad governance in Nigeria will be worse if they are not called to order by the federal government within the shortest time possible.\n\n\u201cFor some Fulani Jihadists to issue such insulting and provocative 72 hours\u2019 notice to the governor of Delta State, without the federal government and the elders of Northern extraction ever calling them to order, is most disappointing, considering that the same Northern elders were quick to accuse Igbo leaders of not publicly condemning IPOB.\n\n\u201cSuch impudence of the Fulani Jihadists will no longer be tolerated. They even claimed responsibility for the burning/bombing of the secretariat in Asaba, which also houses the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Office.\u201d\n\nHe said the decision on open grazing and other decisions are taken on national interest by the 17 Southern governors received the full support of the people of Southern Nigeria, particularly the leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo of the South-east, PANDEF of the South-south and the Afenifere of the South-west.\n\nHe stated: \u201cWe will no longer tolerate hate and divisive statements targeted at deriding and insulting others, from these Fulani who believe Nigeria is exclusively theirs and other Nigerians are their subjects, and not their fellow citizens.\n\n\u201cI repeat, on behalf of Southerners, that open grazing has been finally buried in Southern Nigeria. For Mr. President to insist that open grazing should continue whereby he asked the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, to dig out the gazette that approved open grazing in the First Republic is unbelievable, unpatriotic and unacceptable to our people.\u201d\n\nClark also explained how far critical stakeholders have gone in addressing the crisis rocking the country, saying that \u201cin order to maintain and promote a peaceful Nigeria, I was among other 50 prominent Nigerians, including former heads of state, traditional rulers, former chief justices, that met for nine hours, under the leadership of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, recently on Thursday, 11th June 2021, at the Conference Hall of the Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja, where valuable decisions were taken to maintain and sustain the unity of this country.\u201d\n\nClark told Buhari to regard himself as president of one Nigeria, and not as president of the Fulani or the Northerners, adding that Nigerians shall resist, at all cost, any attempt to subjugate them.\n\nHe cautioned the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, against what he described as his irresponsible and unprofessional language, which he said is misleading the president.\n\nHe said: \u201cI also use this opportunity to seriously advise the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, over his irresponsible and unprofessional language, which is misleading and misdirecting Mr. President. Because the rhetoric question Mr. President asked during his interview with ARISE Television, whether Nigerians want him (Mr. President) to contradict the Attorney-General of the Federation, was based on his understanding of the AG\u2019s advice to him.\n\n\u201cThe AG\u2019s position is provided for in the constitution and he is expected to be independent of parochial and unconstitutional government decisions. He behaves as if his position is that of a minister of justice alone.\n\n\u201cThis was the reason why at the 2014 National Conference it was recommended that the post of the Attorney-General recognised by the constitution should be separated from that of the minister of justice who owes his allegiance to the government in power that appointed him.\n\n\u201cPerhaps, Mr. President is not aware, or he has not been advised by the AG that the Land Use Act, which vested ownership of land on the state governor is entrenched in the constitution of the country. Therefore, any gazette or law passed by any State or National Assembly is and will be null and void because the 1999 Constitution supersedes all such laws or gazette notices.\n\n\u201cThe President has no power or authority to impose open grazing on state governments. Such illegal actions which are a breach of the 1999 Constitution will not be accepted and will be legally resisted at all costs.\n\n\u201cTherefore, any law banning open grazing by state governments is not only legal and binding but is unchallengeable and binding on any person or group of persons, including the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nClark, however, appealed to the president to call for national dialogue over insecurity and general violence, with Nigerians of various ethnic nationalities, adding that the various calls by groups for secession and breakup of the country are not healthy.\n\nHe said the Buhari needed to have a peaceful government until his exit from office in 2023, and canvassed the restructuring of the nation and return to a federal system of government as it was in 1963, before the military took over in 1966.\n\nMEND Warns \u2018Fulani Jihadist\u2019 Group against Attack on Delta\n\nMeanwhile, a group, which identified itself as the Movement for the Emancipation and the Defence of the Niger Delta has cautioned a self-styled Fulani jihadist group against attacking Delta State.\n\nThe group warned of dire consequences should the Fulani or Usman Dan Fodio heritage leadership group carry out their threat to Delta and the governor, after the three-day ultimatum.\n\nIn the statement titled, \u201cResponse to the Fulani Threat to Okowa on Open Grazing by Southern Governors\u201d and signed off as \u201cDragon War, MEND\u201d, the group said: \u201cWe are warning that if your threat is made to come to fulfilment, No Fulani will ever exist across the Niger Delta and all oil facilities linked to a Fulani will be brought down. If one soul is lost, 10 Fulani souls will pay for it. If one facility is destroyed, 10 Fulani facilities will be destroyed. We will respond proportionately ten times whatever you give, the corresponding response will not be limited to the Delta, it may be with your politicians or with your rulers.\n\n\u201cWe will launch three rocket launchers and ballistic missiles at any facility of our choice as a warning in seven days if you make bold your threats.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t make cheap our threats. We have shut down the country and we can at any time shut you down. We are the Niger Delta. We stand for the interest of the Niger Delta and we will not allow any coward to threaten us. We fight without running. Be warned!\u201d\n\nHowever, the Delta State Police Command, in a statement by its spokesman, Mr. Bright Edafe, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, waved off the reported threat by the faceless group, describing it as inconsequential and something to simply ignore.\n\nThe statement by the police advised the people in the state to go about their lawful activities without fear of intimidation or attacks from any quarter.\n\nThe police attributed the source of the leaflet reportedly posted at different conspicuous points at Agbor and Asaba, including on walls near the Government House, as the handiwork of miscreants who were intent on creating panic among law-abiding residents in the state and escalating insecurity in the country.\n\nThe statement said the police were unwavering in their commitment to the security of lives and property of the people of Delta State.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Urges Buhari not to bully secessionists, forget open grazing\n\nJames Emejo, Emmanuel Addeh, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Mary Nnah in Lagos\n\nA Nobel laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka, yesterday stated that Nigeria cannot remain one country if it fails to decentralise as fast as possible, adding that analysts, retired generals and others have maintained the same position.\n\nSoyinka spoke to ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, urging President Muhammadu Buhari to be more sensitive to the agitations of secessionists rather than bully them.\n\n\u201cIf it (Nigeria) fails to decentralise, some people use the word reconstruction, some use whatever. But if Nigeria fails to decentralise as fast as possible, manifestly, not as rhetoric, then Nigeria cannot stay together,\u201d he warned, adding: \u201cAgain, it\u2019s not Wole Soyinka saying this. Everybody has said it; generals have said it; ex-heads of state have said it; politicians have said it; analysts have said it; economists have said it. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening to people in the streets. That\u2019s why they are moving; that\u2019s why they are demonstrating; that\u2019s why they are defying threats from the police and from the government that if you demonstrate, you are traitors or you do this, we\u2019ll deal with you.\u201d\n\nSoyinka explained that people are no longer intimidated by Buhari\u2019s threat that \u2018we will talk to you in the only way you understand.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t wash with anybody any longer because if a nation is on a suicidal slide, the people who feel that they do not deserve that kind of suicidal plunge have a right to say \u2018sorry, I am getting off before it nosedives,\u201d he said.\n\nOn how to make the system work again, he said: \u201cIt relates to what I was saying earlier. It is because he (Buhari) is not listening or he\u2019s listening and he\u2019s not understanding so that we do not have this extreme moment to say, wait a minute, there is nobody out there, we better look after our own security, we better look after our own very existence.\u201d\n\nHe accused governors and senators of not doing enough to confront the challenges facing the country.\n\nHe said while the Senate has not utilised its powers to force the government to act the way it should, the governors appeared to be too timid to act.\n\nSoyinka added that Buhari is not listening to the yearnings of Nigerians, and his administration did not really understand the applications, full responsibilities and commitments involved in a democratic regime.\n\nHe said he was alarmed at the understanding of democracy by the top hierarchy of government.\n\nHe stated that the suspension of Twitter\u2019s operations in Nigeria aborted the various channels of self-expression open to any kind of polity and abrogated the essence of democracy.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe politicians are not doing enough, especially the Senate. If you study the constitution very carefully, you will find out that they have certain powers which they haven\u2019t touched. I have discussed this with constitutional lawyers. There are certain areas in which they can act, they can force this government, compel this government to act the way it should.\n\n\u201cAnd that also applies especially to governors. The governors themselves are too tentative; they are too timid. There are certain areas of the constitution, in which, as I go back to my favourite expression, they can push the envelope, completely, so that we get a sense of governance at all tiers, and have synergy going on. I think people are ready to stand behind the leaders.\u201d\n\nSoyinka said Twitter\u2019s suspension showed that democracy means different things to different people.\n\nHe also condemned the language used by Buhari in his interview recently and even in his statements from Aso Rock in relation to those who are clamouring for secession.\n\nAccording to him, when a group makes such agitations, any sensitive leadership must learn to understand this and respond to the reasons behind those agitations and not start threatening and bullying and trying to intimidate people because they are giving vent to deep-seated grievances.\n\nHe added: \u201cFor instance, there was a question I listened to President Buhari on this very channel (ARISE) about the position of the various governors on open grazing. At least 50 per cent of the nation has their representatives, saying that within the constitution, within the democratic dispensation that we say we are operating- we are saying on behalf of our people that we do not want open grazing anymore. And then somebody sits in Aso Rock and says to them that well, there is a cattle constitution, I am instructing my attorney-general to dig up some kind of law, colonial law which arbitrated between farmers and herders\u2026so that I can recover on behalf of a certain private business, the whole routes \u2013 which means that he is not listening to what people are saying, he\u2019s not listening to what the governors representing them are saying.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s saying I am going to restore the routes by referring to some colonial arrangements. Now, when I listen to a thing like that I really despair. I want to say this, it was a very instructive interview, and no doubt there was nothing new. One was just hoping that this government had transcended that kind of partisan thinking.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022FG committed to its loans repayment obligations, Says Amaechi\n\nJames Emejo, Kasim Sumaina in Abuja and Mary Nnah in Lagos\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, yesterday unfolded plans by the federal government to take more Chinese loans to expand rail services to more states.\n\nAmaechi, who featured on \u2018The Morning Show,\u2019 a programme on ARISE NEWS Channel, the broadcast arm of THISDAY Newspapers, said the federal government had already begun negotiations for the loans.\n\nIf granted, it will balloon Nigeria\u2019s public debt stock, which, according to data from the Debt Management Office (DMO), stood at $87.239 billion as of March 31, 2021.\n\nAlready, there has been an outcry against Nigeria\u2019s rising debt profile since 2015.\n\nLast Thursday, Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Mrs. Zainab Ahmed, had admitted that the federal government was exceeding its borrowing plan for 2021.\n\nAhmed, in an interview with France 24, monitored by THISDAY, had blamed the development on the COVID-19 pandemic and the fall in oil prices.\n\nHowever, Amaechi said Nigeria had been fulfilling its loan obligations as it had never defaulted in the repayment of loans, especially for the railway projects.\n\nHe stated that the federal government had so far repaid over $150 million out of the $500 million facility secured by the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan for the Abuja-Kaduna railway.\n\nThe minister added that monthly revenue from the Abuja-Kaduna railway operation has increased from N70 million to N350 million as of May.\n\nHe also refuted the suggestion that some obnoxious clauses in the Chinese loan agreements may lead to mortgaging Nigeria\u2019s assets in the case of default.\n\nThe minister clarified that he was not behind the recent suspension of the Managing Director of the Nigeria Ports Authority (NPA), Ms. Hadiza Bala-Usman.\n\nHe said Bala-Usman was not suspended but only asked to \u2018step aside\u2019 to enable an investigation into the management of the authority from 2016 to date.\n\nAmaechi said President Muhammadu Buhari would decide on the resumption of the embattled NPA boss after the conclusion of the probe.\n\nAmaechi said: \u201cWhen you take the loan, you are expected to pay back and as we are talking today we are paying back.\n\n\u201cUnder the regime of former President Goodluck Jonathan, the loan for Abuja \u2013 Kaduna was about $500 million. As of today, we have paid over $150 million on that loan.\n\n\u201cAnd Nigeria has never defaulted when it comes to loan repayment. And I don\u2019t also expect that we will default on any other loan we have taken.\n\n\u201cThe loan for Ibadan-Kano is about $1.5 billion. The rest of $500 million came from our budget. I expect that whatever loans we take we will be able to pay.\n\n\u201cI am not aware that there is any clause in the loan agreement that hands over any of our national assets to China.\n\n\u201cYes, in default they go to court and it depends on the outcome of the court case, but I am not aware that there is anything in all the clauses signed by this government or the previous government of Goodluck Jonathan that mortgaged any of our national assets.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the total reconstruction of the narrow gauge line of the Port Harcourt to Maiduguri railway as well as that of Kano -Maradi will commence in June.\n\nHe added that the Lagos-Kano narrow gauge is currently being negotiated with different interest groups willing to rehabilitate it.\n\nHe explained: \u201cWhat we are going to start this June is the total reconstruction of the narrow gauge line.\n\nWe are rehabilitating Port Harcourt -Maiduguri and at the same time the president has directed that contract be awarded for the standard gauge, which should be funded when the next government comes.\n\n\u201cBut the difference between the narrow gauge and the standard gauge is just the speed. The Lagos -Kano narrow gauge is the one we are negotiating with different interest groups who want to rehabilitate.\n\n\u201cThat one is for rehabilitation. And when they finish rehabilitation, they will then run it by themselves and make their money and pay themselves back. We\u2019ve not even commenced negotiation.\u201d\n\nAmaechi said more Chinese loans would be needed to extend the railway services to other states.\n\nHe said although the Lagos-Ibadan rail line had been completed, the services were still skeletal because it would take six months to test equipment to ensure they are in perfect condition.\n\nHe, however, stated that to extend the railway service from Ibadan to Osogbo and from Kano to Kaduna as well as other states in the country, the country would need to get more Chinese loans of which negotiations were already in progress.\n\n\u201cIt takes six months to know that that equipment is in perfect condition. We would continue to test the equipment so that we do not have any train accidents. So we are moving from just two services in a day to four. It will be a gradual progression and I believe that by the end of the year, we will be doing 16 trips in a day,\u201d the minister said.\n\nHe also said the continuation of the rail line would only commence when the Chinese loan was obtained, adding that the ministry has already mobilised contractors with some funds pending when the implementation of the loan facility would be concluded.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we get the Chinese loan, we would commence the construction of Ibadan to Abuja, but before the end of this month, we should commence some of the Kano-Kaduna rail. We have already mobilised the contractors with some funds and we would fund it initially from our budget pending when the implementation of the loan facility would be concluded\u201d, Amaechi said.\n\nOn the security of the railway system against the backdrop of the activities of vandals and other economy saboteurs, Amaechi canvassed the amendment of the law to make perpetrators liable for manslaughter as well as serve as a deterrence to others.\n\nHe said terminal operators must contribute to the total reconstruction and reorganisation of the Apapa seaport.\n\nAccording to him, the Apapa seaport\u2019s only problem is efficiency, citing the drastic change in the port on the day the president visited to inaugurate the Deep Blue Project.\n\nHe said: \u201cI was in the train with the president on that day and noticed that everything had disappeared, even inside the port that looked like a marketplace was very well organised; no persons were found loitering about, no trucks. What it shows is that the problem of the seaport is the problem of efficiency.\u201d\n\nHe stated: \u201cIf they had the capacity in just one night, because I was there the previous evening, and when I came back in the morning, everything had disappeared; if that can happen in one night, it means that the problem is management, nothing else. Do we need to wait for the president to come before we can be efficient?\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve done was to have a meeting with the terminal operators and I told them that they have to contribute to the reconstruction of the Apapa seaport. We must rebuild the Apapa seaport, taking into cognisance all the issues that we are seeing now that is frustrating the seaport, like where do you park the trucks, how many trucks are coming into the Seaport at what point in time?\n\n\u201cHow can a person come into the seaport who has no business being there, what is he doing at the seaport? The seaport is a security area and it\u2019s not for everybody, even me, after my tenure as minister, I\u2019m not entitled to go into the seaport unless I have business in the seaport.\u201d\n\nAmaechi said the Ministry of Transportation would partner the Customs and the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) to solve the problem, adding that freighting of cargoes from the seaport through the rail, when it begins, will also ease congestion at the ports.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Says terminal operators to contribute to reconstruction of Apapa port\n\nSays deep blue project to solve maritime insecurity, boost revenue, reduce oil production cost\n\nBy Kasim Sumaina\n\nThe Minister of Transportation, Mr. Chibuike Rotimi, has said the problem of Apapa seaport is efficiency, citing the drastic changes in the Port on the day the President visited to commission the Deep Blue Project.\n\nHe also said that terminal operators must contribute to the total reconstruction and reorganisation of the Apapa Seaport.\n\nThe Minister stated this Monday when he appeared as a guest on The Morning Show on Arise TV, THISDAY broadcast arm.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cI was in the train with the President on that day and noticed that everything had disappeared, even inside the Port that looked like a market place was very well organised, no persons were found loitering about, no trucks. What it shows is that the problem of the Seaport is the problem of efficiency.\u201d\n\nHe observed that if they had the capacity in just one night, \u201cbecause I was there the previous evening, and when I came back in the morning, everything had disappeared; If that can happen in one night, it means that the problem is management, nothing else. Do we need to wait for the President to come before we can be efficient?\u201d Amaechi queried.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve done, was to have a meeting with the terminal operators, and I told them that they have to contribute to the reconstruction of the Apapa Seaport. We must rebuild the Apapa Seaport, taking into cognisance all the issues that we are seeing now that is frustrating the Seaport, like where do you park the trucks, how many trucks are coming into the Seaport at what point in time?\n\n\u201cHow can a person come into the seaport who has no business being there, what is he doing at the Seaport? The Seaport is a security area and it\u2019s not for everybody, even me, after my tenure as Minister, I\u2019m not entitled to go into the Seaport unless I have business in the seaport\u201d, he added.\n\nAmaechi noted that the Ministry of Transportation will partner with the Customs and the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) to solve the problem, adding thatt freighting of cargoes from the Seaport through the rail, when it begins, will also help in arresting the situation at the Port.\n\n\u201cWe are going to partner with customs because they are largely involved. Between them and the NPA, they are the operators (or regulators) of the Seaport, and see how to arrest this situation. I believe that when we begin to freight cargoes from the seaport through the rail, we\u2019ll reduce some of the challenges that we have at the seaport\u201d, he said.\n\nAmaechi also spoke on the recently launched Deep Blue Project being overseen by the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) in partnership with the Ministry of Defence, stating that the project will not only boost security in the country\u2019s waters, but will also improve trade in the Gulf of Guinea and reduce cost of production for the Oil industry, while improving revenue for Nigeria\u2019s economy.\n\nHe stressed that, \u201cbefore we came, various contractors were contracted to provide security for oil companies in the water. There was a case between the government and OMSL in which the company provides about 3 or 4 boats to the Navy and they collect $2500 per vessel for the first day and $1500 for about 30 days. In a year, like in 2020 they made about $67m, and when you hand over the security of a country to individuals, it becomes very challenging and irresponsible.\n\n\u201cSo, the President kindly approved that the Police, Army, Air force and other security agencies should be involved in providing security with the equipment that we have provided.\n\n\u201cWe have about 3 helicopters, 2 fixed-wing planes, 17 interceptor boats, 2 vessels, drones, and more; what it does is that it gives you information about where the criminals are, those who go and destroy pipes just because they are looking for oil to bunker.\n\n\u201cIt provides you that information, then you deter them or arrest them. So, we are able to provide security in the coastal region, both on land and on the sea. Now, those who provide the coastal security on land will be the Nigerian Army and the Police, and we\u2019ve provided them with all the necessary tools they need.\n\n\u201cWe have ammunition, we have vehicles, like Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) and all that for patrol by the coast. All that, we believe will begin to yield fruits between now and next year.\u201d\n\nExplaining further, Amaechi said, \u201cWhat , we\u2019ve done with Deep Blue project is that we will reduce the cost of producing oil in Nigeria, because in producing oil, they also build-in the cost of security. By the time we provide this security in the water, the economy will be improved because there will be more money coming into the economy. That\u2019s the impact it will have when it comes to the Deep Blue project.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the Israelis who did the training said in six months to one year, if there is no improvement in the economy in terms of how much comes in, both to NIMASA, NPA and the oil industry, \u2018come back to us and we\u2019ll be willing to refund.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut you know it is simple mathematics; It is true that the moment you can take away the criminals from the water, and the contractors from the water, then the cost of security which is borne either by NNPC or the Oil Companies will be part of what will come back to us as income. Then on land, in all our rail and train coaches, you have enough armed policemen in any trip we are making to withstand any criminal attack.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The president has kept within his powers as president and does not interfere with the funds of the state governments. The governors have interfered and kidnapped the funds of the local governments through what is called the state/local government joint account,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t even give to the local governments the monies that they realise as internally generated revenue, which is why the joint account was made \u2014 internally generated revenue plus the statutory allocation, you add it and distribute to the local governments.\n\n\u201cNow, the insecurity problem we have today, the governors cannot escape the criticism of the people because everybody is a witness. If the governors allow the monies of the local governments to get to the local governments, the local governments would have been able to at least capture within their net, certain persons of certain class at that local government level. They will be seen as a tier of government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf the governors had given the monies meant for local governments, there would be agriculture at that level; there would be some intervention in infrastructure at that level; there would be governance at that level. What happens today is that chairmen of local governments and local government officers only go to work when there is allocation.\n\n\u201cIf governors would take the monies of local governments, and when they face insecurity, they say \u2018President Buhari\u2019. Then-President Buhari will be applying the federal government allocation to fund the armed forces \u2014 the security agencies going to every spot to intervene.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, each of these spots belongs to a local government, or a state, and the states will believe that they can deal with local governments the way they are dealing with them, and then have peace?

          "text": "Ethiopia has announced a tender process for the sale of a 40% stake in state-owned telecommunications company, Ethio Telecom. That means potential investors can now register their interest starting Tuesday. This is the first stage in a lengthy process that will lead to the selection of a successful bidder.\n\nThe proposed minority sale of the carrier is part of a broader plan to liberalise the country\u2019s monopolistic telecoms sector. In addition, two foreign carriers are to be granted licenses to operate in the hugely untapped market.\n\n\u201cThe government wants state-owned enterprises to be competitive and productive, the authorities\u2019 motivation for selling a part of Ethio Telecom to private operators,\u201d Deputy Director of Public Enterprises, Holding and Administration Agency, Zinabu Yirga, said at a press conference in the capital Addis Ababa on Monday. \u201cAs part of the broader opening up of the sector, Ethiopia is also moving to license private operators to compete with Ethio Telecom.\u201d\n\nAnnounced in 2019 and driven by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, the liberalisation plan has been met with several delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic and an internal crisis in the Tigray region.\n\nHowever, the plan has gathered pace over the past six months. In May, the government awarded one of the two available private operating licences to break up Ethio Telecom\u2019s monopoly on the sector.\n\nThe Global Partnership for Ethiopia, a telco-consortium led by Kenya\u2019s Safaricom, was announced as the winner after a successful bid of around $850 million. Meanwhile, a second offer of around $600 million from South Africa\u2019s MTN Group was deemed too low by the regulator, which is now preparing to reauction the final licence.\n\nAccording to Brook Taye, a senior advisor at the finance ministry, the 40% in Ethio Telecom will be sold as a single stake to a single investor. It is however unclear how much the stake would be worth but the tender process is sure to attract significant interest from many telcos around the world.\n\nThis is due to the attractiveness of Ethiopia\u2019s untapped telecoms market. In a population of over 100 million people, only about 20% have access to the Internet, less than 40% have a mobile phone and only 5.8% of the people use social media, according to a report from DataReportal.\n\nFounded in November 2010, Ethio Telecom currently has around 53 million subscribers and has since December generated a revenue of around $600 million. According to reports, the government plans to retain a 55% stake in the operator while the remaining 5% will be offered to domestic investors through an initial public offering.",

          "title": "Here are ten VPNs you can use in Nigeria",
          "text": "Virtual private networks (VPNs) have been around for a long time but have become more popular recently. Whether you want to use it to watch a show that\u2019s not available in your country or access a site that\u2019s been banned by the government, there\u2019s one question that most people have had to deal with: Which VPN should I use?\n\nIt can be daunting to choose from the hundreds, if not thousands, of VPN services available. So we\u2019ve come up with a list of ten reputable VPN services you can use.\n\nExpress VPN\n\nExpressVPN is rated highly because of its very fast speeds across over 3,000 remote servers in 160 locations and 94 countries. It provides advanced security on both apps and servers.\n\nIts high quality comes at a price. The lowest monthly plan is priced at $6.67, making it slightly more expensive than its rivals. It\u2019s also currently unavailable on the Nigerian App Store.\n\nA user TechCabal spoke to said, \u201cI\u2019ve been using ExpressVPN for over a year now, mostly to watch Netflix from other countries. I also use it for HBO Max and Disney+. I\u2019ve had to move to another VPN because I need to use it on my phone \u201d\n\nNord VPN\n\nUnlike ExpressVPN, NordVPN is available on the Nigerian App Store, it has one of the fastest speeds on the market and it\u2019s cheaper than ExpressVPN: Its lowest price is $4.89/month. It has more than 5,200 servers in 62 countries.\n\nNordVPN has a feature that ExpressVPN doesn\u2019t have, it\u2019s called VPN chaining. It routes your traffic through two servers, encrypting data packets twice. A helpful security feature, but it slows down your connection.\n\nProton VPN\n\nProton has the best free subscription in the market. Unlike NordVPN and ExpressVPN, the first subscription tier of ProtonVPN is its free VPN offering, which includes just three VPN server locations (Japan, Netherlands, and the US). It has over 1,246 Servers in 55 countries.\n\nThis free subscription offers unlimited browsing bandwidth but at slower internet speeds. It only allows one device to be connected at a time and also has few server locations compared to most other VPN providers.\n\nTunnelBear\n\nTunnelBear offers its users both free and paid VPN services. However, the free version is only limited to 500MB/month bandwidth.\n\nIt\u2019s not as fast as ExpressVPN and NordVPN but has a decent speed. It has servers in 22 locations, which means fewer options for its users.\n\nA user Techcabal spoke to said, \u201cI started using Tunnelbear, but I\u2019m being very Nigerian about it so I refuse to pay after I exhaust my 500MB limit in a few days.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t do much on the internet, TunnelBear would be a good fit.\n\nWindscribe VPN\n\nJust like TunnelBear, Windscribe VPN has a free version and it gives 10GB free every month. It\u2019s safe and secure to use. It works on most devices and most streaming services. It has 180 servers in over 63 countries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve moved to Windscribe. They give 10GB free every month, so that\u2019s nice.\u201d A user TechCabal spoke to said, \u201cThe only thing is it definitely drains my battery. I don\u2019t like the mental stress of having to connect to a VPN before opening Twitter, then having to remember to turn it off before I do other things like open YouTube. I opened YouTube earlier today from Dallas, Texas and it loaded straight into 1080p. I was shocked. Americans are enjoying themselves. I hate this VPN life. Also having to remember to turn off my VPN before I use my bank app. \u201c\n\nIPVanish\n\nIPVanish stands out because it allows unlimited simultaneous connections. It has over 500 servers spread across 55 countries.\n\nIt has no free version. It costs $10 per month, or $77.99 billed annually. You can alternatively opt to pay $26.99 every three months.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t allow for more customisation and it has a confusing privacy policy.\n\nCyberGhost\n\nCyberGhost has been around for a while and it serves more than 15 million users. It boasts 6,700+ servers in 110+ locations across 90 countries. That\u2019s far more than all others.\n\nCyberGhost offers a VPN service for virtually every device out there but it\u2019s more expensive than a few others. It costs $12.99 per month, $47.94 for six months and $49.50 for eighteen months. Additionally, a student discount is available, the cost of the student offering is $2.75 per month, and you\u2019ll have to sign on to a year-long contract.\n\nPsiphon\n\nThis VPN separates itself away from the pack by not needing an email address to use it. You can download the free app (on all platforms except MacOS, Linux, or routers) and start using it immediately. It uses an open-source code which increases transparency\n\nA downside is that because it\u2019s free, it has a very small server network \u2013 a little over 20 countries. It\u2019s slower than other alternatives out there. It doesn\u2019t work with Netflix or torrenting. It explicitly says that it\u2019s not a privacy tool.\n\nPsiphon is supported by ads, and it does share statistics with sponsors so they can see, for example, how often their sites are visited through Psiphon and from which countries. These are further aggregated by date, sponsor and region. All of the data Psiphon collects is discarded after 60 days.\n\nSurfShark\n\nSurfshark has been around for roughly a year now. It offers a safe and private connection. It\u2019s available on many platforms. Its speed is pretty good.\n\nIt has over 1,000 servers in more than 61 countries. For a relatively new service provider, this is a very large network and something that many VPN service providers haven\u2019t achieved even after years in the business.\n\nYou can use SurfShark on unlimited devices and its lowest price per month is $2.49/ for 2 years.\n\nPrivate VPN\n\nPrivateVPN is a great all-rounder with excellent privacy and high speeds. Its reliable connections and ability to unblock sites like Netflix make it ideal for streaming. It can also be used to torrent and works well in China.\n\nWith only around 200 servers, it\u2019s still pretty much a good choice. It\u2019s lowest monthly cost is $2.08.\n\nThat\u2019s all from us. These are our top ten VPNs. Which other VPNs do you use and what do you like or don\u2019t like about them?",

          "text": "When Pearl\u00e9 Nwaezeigwe is not busy creating policies that protect African users on TikTok, she spends most of her time planning for her future, creating inspirational videos targeted at young people with ambitious career goals, and settling into her new community in Ireland.\n\nTikTok\u2019s presence and influence cannot be denied in Africa. The app is perfect for hyper-creative content creators who know their way around editing tools and special effects. But even amateur video creators, dancers, and comedians are also making waves and growing their TikTok following every day. As TikTok\u2019s popularity soars, the company is intentional about creating policies that protect both creators and viewers.\n\nI\u2019m bringing Pearl\u00e9 to Centre Stage because I\u2019m inspired by how dedicated she is to honing her craft, learning more about product policy, and fighting for human rights. As a social activist, Pearl\u00e9 isn\u2019t afraid to speak against policies that harm our fundamental human rights, making her the perfect fit for her role at TikTok.\n\nFor the love of TikTok in Africa\n\nWhat about TikTok\u2019s presence in Africa excites you?\n\nPearl\u00e9: It\u2019s exciting to see how well the creative industry is thriving and booming, especially on TikTok. I feel very inspired when I see creators showcasing their many talents on our platform. And TikTok videos go beyond captions and hashtags \u2013 creators have to bring their A-game and capture multiple viewers\u2019 attention within the first ten seconds and keep them watching for up to a minute. Also, African TikTokers are showing us that we all have shared experiences. They are also showing the world how diverse Africans at home and in the diaspora.\n\nWhat kind of freedom does TikTok give to African content creators?\n\nPearl\u00e9: It gives them the freedom to showcase how rich our culture is and how talented we are as a people. Nigerian and South African creators are especially famous for their dance and comedic videos. TikTok gives them the opportunity to be as expressive as they want to be as long as they stick to our community guidelines.\n\nLet\u2019s get personal\n\nTell me about the last good book you read?\n\nPearl\u00e9: A lot of people find self-help and motivational books very cheesy, but I enjoy reading them.\n\nI recently read \u2018You Are a Badass\u2019. I like the way the book was written because it does not contain a lot of rules and regulations. She uses storytelling to encourage her readers to focus on what matters and the beauty of life. I also love that each chapter ends with a reminder to love yourself and the special parts of you.\n\n\u2018Loud black girls\u2019 is next on my list. It contains a compilation of short stories by different black women living in the UK. The book delves into their experiences with living, working and navigating life in the UK. I\u2019ve always seen the black and POC experience from the lenses of women living in Nigeria and the US, but Loud Black Girls opened my eyes to see how black women deal with racism and microaggression in the UK. \u201c\n\nWhat are some of your favourite accounts on social media?\n\nPearl\u00e9: I tell people that I am obsessed with The Verge because they have a section dedicated to Tech Policy. I\u2019m a policy nerd. I also read TC Daily and I have to say, it\u2019s exciting to see how much innovation is coming out of Africa. For tech policy related news and updates, I follow Wired, MITTech, and Access Now.\n\nWho are your favourite content creators?\n\nPearl\u00e9: Beyonc\u00e9, obviously. I also follow Shesecures, Useshukran, and Fbeinghumble on social media. On TikTok, I enjoy watching King Science. He uses animated videos to address sensitive topics and create content that is easy to digest and understand.\n\nInfusing creativity, learning new skills and making an impact\n\nWhat kind of skills do you need to be successful in your role?\n\nPearl\u00e9: Firstly, you need a fundamental understanding of human rights. We want people to express themselves and feel inspired to create but we also want them to feel safe on our platform.\n\nSecondly, you need to understand the local context. The trends that are peculiar to one region will be different from the rising trends in a different region. We have to pay close attention to gender, religious, and cultural nuances. Most of the popular trends we see on TikTok are fun, but some have potential to be harmful.\n\nLastly, you need to research industry standards. We aren\u2019t as focused on competition as much as we are on collaboration. There are trends that crossover from other social media platforms into TikTok \u2013 which isn\u2019t unusual \u2013 but we have to ensure that crossover trends don\u2019t harm or impede our users\u2019 privacy and rights.\n\nWhat impactful lessons have you learned on the job so far?\n\nPearl\u00e9: My dad calls me an activist because I like (non-violently) fighting for people. When I think about impact, I think about the fact that I see the policies we create getting enacted in real time. The speed at which we push these policies matters because our users need to feel safe at all times. I\u2019m especially excited that the policies we come up with are focused on protecting creators in Sub-saharan Africa.\n\nWhat is your role teaching you about content creation?\n\nPearl\u00e9: I\u2019ve learned that content creation has many layers. When I think about the time that goes into creating a really dope animated video or beauty vlog, I appreciate how much creators put into giving us their best works. You might watch a one minute animated video on TikTok without realizing how much effort went into putting it together. I\u2019d say watching these TikTokers create magic is my favourite part of the job.\n\nWhat makes TikTok stand out from other content creation platforms?\n\nPearl\u00e9: I can\u2019t speak for other platforms but TikTok draws a lot of Gen-Z and millennial creators. Again, people feel safe on our platform. When creators come on TikTok, we give them the tools they need to express themselves without fear of being shut down, threatened, or abused. It\u2019s better to create from a place of freedom than fear.\n\nHow do you infuse creativity into your role?\n\nPearl\u00e9: Watching TikTok videos inspires me to keep going and encourages me to do more at work. When you see the policies you create getting executed and doing what they\u2019ve been designed to do, it inspires a level of creativity within you.\n\nWhy is product policy important to the creative tech industry in Sub-Saharan Africa?\n\nPearl\u00e9: For us, as product policy managers, we are at the centre of every company. People like me are responsible for seeing all sides to the story. Yes, we see the creative side of things, but we also have to consider safety and security. Big tech companies still have a long way to go where product policy is concerned. Our ecosystem is very funding and investment-focused \u2013 which I understand because capital is essential \u2013 but policy and security are equally important.",

          "text": "Socially responsible investors put principles before profit. They choose stocks of corporations known for fair and sustainable practices. Environmental protection, animal rights and the absence of workplace discrimination are in the spotlight. Only some companies in Nigeria have praiseworthy policies. So, which stocks are sustainable?\n\nDangote Cement\n\nDangote, a construction and manufacturing giant, follows sustainable procedures throughout its project cycle. Its policies bring benefits to the environment, community, and economy. This is an exception, as the industry, in general, is responsible for massive pollution and depletion of natural resources.\n\nSo, what exactly does the company do? Dangote is committed to green growth \u2014 development through eco-friendly activities. Its corporate culture is data-centric and sustainable.\n\nThe staff collect data via Microsoft SharePoint to ensure its integrity. The group provides full-time study leave for its employees, which is a rare benefit. In 2018, it provided training for almost 10,000 employees across sites and headquarters.\n\nAnother example is the company\u2019s safe work initiative. It reduces the frequency of accidents and near misses. Meanwhile, employees providing customer service commit excellence across value chains.\n\nThe company supports small and medium enterprises. It has paid over 3 billion nairas for 125 trucks for its distributors and provided a 5-year payback period. Finally, the company\u2019s key subsidiary, Dangote Cement, has a range of sustainable operations.\n\nFirst, it repurposes its own waste, which is used to generate power for the kiln. Secondly, fractional mineral traces from waste are used instead of primary minerals in cement production. The shares of Dangote Cement are some of the most sustainable. If you invest through the Forextime Forex trading app, they will make a great addition to your portfolio.\n\nSterling Bank\n\nThe sustainable policies of Sterling Bank allow it to prevent credit fraud and reduce its own carbon footprint. They include systems for environmental management and management of social risks. The company has a range of energy-saving projects.\n\nThe bank recycles its waste in cooperation with a recycling agency and waste management services of Lagos. It abides by the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights. The campaign includes competitions between creative entrepreneurs focused on the use of recycled materials. The winner receives 1 million nairas for their startup.\n\nThe bank has reduced its carbon footprint by turning to renewable energy. Its branches in Nigeria and abroad use more sustainable sources of power. The company has been involved in solar and hybrid power projects. At the moment, such policies have been implemented by 10 branches.\n\nAside from environmental sustainability, the bank has improved its social and financial impact. All stakeholders receive regular updates, and the company boosts engagement through social media. Sterling Bank has an impressive 3.1% deposit market share and a 12.6% capital adequacy ratio.\n\nFidelity Bank\n\nFidelity Bank abides by the international bill on human rights. It also complies with the principles of banking sustainability of the Central Bank of Nigeria. These include promotion of financial inclusion, women\u2019s empowerment through inclusive workplace culture, and minimization of environmental impact.\n\nThe bank\u2019s mission is to make financial services accessible to all groups of customers. Its operations contribute to the reduction of poverty in Nigeria and sustainable economic development overall. The Environmental Social\n\nGovernance practices for the basis of the bank\u2019s policies; the lending services and decisions are focused on three aspects: economic viability, environmental responsibility and social relevance. Fidelity Bank acts in line with local and international standards. These include The Nigerian Sustainable Banking Principles (NSBP), Equator Principles and the\n\nInternational Finance Corporations (IFC) Performance Standards.\n\nSustainable Investment in Nigeria\n\nThese are three examples of sustainable stocks in Nigeria. These should be considered by local investors with a focus on eco-friendly practices. They are often added to multi-asset portfolios. Stocks may be combined with Forex trading and derivative trading.\n\nWhen socially responsible companies disclose their practices, this contributes to the transparency of opportunities and risks. The country\u2019s manufacturing brands, conglomerates and commercial banks provide annual sustainability reports. These help investors decide whether their stocks are worth buying.\n\nFor socially responsible individuals, profitability is not the first priority. They allocate their capital based on multiple factors. These include the company\u2019s relationships with customers and staff, the treatment of animals, and the environment. The general public must have access to full descriptions of the values, assets, and policies of an enterprise.",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "title": "#WorldBloodDonorDay: 5 startups improving access to safe blood in Africa",
          "text": "You don\u2019t need to be a medical expert to know the value of blood to humans. At a basic level, most people understand that the absence of blood in a human is fatal, yet blood donation rates in most African countries are low.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), about 112.5 million blood donations are collected worldwide. Still, more than half of this number is gathered in high-income countries \u2014 home to only 19% of the world\u2019s population.\n\nWorryingly, the United Nations estimates that more than 536,000 women die during childbirth, with 99% of them living in developing countries. Postpartum haemorrhage is the leading cause of deaths, responsible for 40% of maternal deaths in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nBlood donation and supply remain major challenges in Africa as health officials battle logistical problems and cultural barriers. Consequently, family and friends donate most of the blood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is not sustainable as family and friends of accident victims, for example, may not be readily available to donate blood. Worse still, they may not be matching blood donors.\n\nSolving Africa\u2019s blood donation problem requires more than calling for voluntary donors. In most places, officials have to contend with superstitions or cultural limitations that make people unwilling to donate.\n\nAlso, the infrastructure needed to transport the blood is often absent in most parts of the continent. With Africa\u2019s infrastructure challenges, it is difficult to say how many lives have been lost because they lacked access to blood.\n\nWHO advises that most of the blood donated come from voluntary donors, but that is not the case in all countries, especially in developing ones.\n\nIn Nigeria, the National Coordinator of the National Blood Transfusion Services (NBTS), Dr Omale Amedu, revealed that only 5% of the blood collected in the country were from voluntary donors, with the remaining 95% commercially provided.\n\nMost African countries can\u2019t meet their annual blood requirements and increase millions of women, children, and accident victims\u2019 risk of mortality (ROM). In 2016, WHO estimated that Africa only covered 50% of its blood requirements.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Ministry of Health, for example, reports that the country needs 2 million units of blood annually but only collects 60,000 units. Cameroon, on the other hand, needs about 400,000 units of blood but collects only 90,000 units. The trend of supply failing to meet demand is common across Africa.\n\nThe startups below are using technology to solve the problems blood banks and hospitals face and close the gap between supply and demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLifebank\n\nTemie Giwa-Tubosun founded Lifebank in 2016. After suffering complications during pregnancy and needing a blood transfusion in the United States, she began to think of the millions of women back in Nigeria who could have lost their lives if they had been in her shoes.\n\nIn a 2019 interview with CNN, the entrepreneur said, \u201cI realised after I had my son that the highest cause of maternal mortality is postpartum haemorrhage. The most important thing you can do when a mum is haemorrhaging is replacing the blood she has lost, even if you can\u2019t stop the bleeding.\u201d\n\nThis epiphany was all she needed to start Lifebank to connect blood banks with hospitals and their patients. Since its inception, the startup has reportedly served over 500 hospitals while maintaining a presence in Nigeria and Kenya.\n\nIt has also expanded its operations from moving only blood to other medical supplies like oxygen and blood products.\n\nThe startup has gained global recognition, with Facebook Founder, Mark Zuckerberg, commenting on the startup.\n\n\u201cThis is a thing [Lifebank] that needs to exist. If she can actually pull it off, she\u2019ll show a model that will impact not just Lagos, not just Nigeria, but countries all around the world.\u201d\n\nInfiuss\n\nWhile Cameroonian entrepreneur, Melissa Jane Bime, was in nursing school, a young girl at the hospital where she worked who had come down with malaria could not get a blood transfusion. She died as a result. Plasmodium falciparum is the most common malaria parasite in Africa accounting for 99.7% of estimated malaria cases in 2018. It multiplies very quickly, causing serious blood loss.\n\nBime would later ascertain that a hospital 20 minutes away had the right blood all along. That was all the motivation she needed.\n\nIn 2016, Bime started Infiuss, a blood bank management system that connects hospitals with blood banks with hospitals without a blood bank. The startup is the recipient of the 2018 Cartier Women\u2019s Initiative Award and was the grand prize winner of the 2018 Anzisha Prize.\n\nDamu-Sasa\n\nAfter Nairobi\u2019s Westgate terror attack in 2013, the government appealed for blood donations to save survivors. And thousands of Kenyans turned up, but there was a problem. Although many people around the country were willing to donate, logistical challenges meant that only those in Nairobi could.\n\nThis led Francis Kilemi and Aaron Ogunde to create a solution that leverages technology to solve the problems of sourcing and donating blood.\n\nWith help from Kenya\u2019s Information and Communication Technology Authority, the startup piloted the project in Kenyatta Hospital in 2017. Since then, their reach has spread to over 100 hospitals across Kenya.\n\nDamu-Sasa is a Kenyan healthtech startup that works across the blood ecosystem. It connects hospitals with blood banks or donors and assists in screening, tracking, storage, distribution, preparation of blood products, and inventory management.\n\nRedbank\n\nRedbank homepage\n\nFounded in 2014 by Francis Adereti, Toluwanimi Adeyanju, and Tunde Ojediran, Redbank functions quite similarly to Lifebank.\n\nHowever, in addition to a mobile app, blood requests can be made via SMS and voice calls. The startup matches received requests with the appropriate blood banks. And according to the company, people can expect responses within 30 seconds of making their requests.\n\nUnlike other startups in the space, Redbank does not handle deliveries. It only provides information on which blood banks have the blood that is needed.\n\nThe startup has increased its reach by striking partnerships with the Nigerian Red Cross Society and the Blood Bank Society of Nigeria.\n\nHaima Health Initiative\n\nHaima Health Initiative homepage\n\nBukola Bolarinwa is a lawyer and a recipient of the Queen\u2019s Young Leader Award. As a child, her parents often told her there were things she could not do. But it was not until she was older she learnt why \u2014 she had sickle cell disease.\n\nWhile in law school, she became friends with Nkechi Azinge, who would go on to found the Sickle Cell Aid Foundation (SCAF). During this time, Bolarinwa volunteered at hospitals and discovered that sickle cell patients frequently needed blood transfusions.\n\nHowever, the hospitals often lacked sufficient blood. This led her to start Haima Health Initiative, which has evolved into an online voluntary blood donor register. It organises blood drives and educates people on the benefits of blood donation.\n\nWhile these startups are doing their part in ensuring that blood and blood products are available to those who need them, the success of their efforts depends on regular voluntary donors. According to WHO, 90% of people eligible to donate blood aren\u2019t doing so.\n\nResearch shows that one donated unit of blood can save up to three lives. We can\u2019t all build startups that save lives, but we can donate blood regularly and save lives in our little way.\n\nHappy World Blood Donor Day.",

It still does not recommend the use of cryptocurrency and advises caution.\n\nAny major difference? Probably not. Several African countries \u2014 Nigeria, Ghana, Mauritius, Kenya and South Africa \u2014 have been known to take a critical stance in the cryptocurrency arena. However, the government seems to be making moves to codify its intentions faster than others.\n\nInterestingly, this comes after the Central American nation of El Salvador announced the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender in the country last week. It also follows the decision of countries such as Nigeria, China, Venezuela, Russia, North Korea to launch digital currencies.\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure, The crypto space will continue to see more controversies dog its steps.\n\nFor a more in-depth read, Check out South Africa Working Group Releases New Position Paper Calling for Regulation of Crypto Asset Providers\n\nNigeria\u2019s new International Termination Rates\n\nThe Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC) has concluded plans to roll out a new Mobile International Termination Rate (ITR).\n\nThe Commission has finalised the process of determining the cost-based price of ITR to ensure healthy competition on traffic handling for voice services between local and international operators in Nigeria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s ITR though? They are charges paid to local operators by international operators to terminate calls in Nigeria. Say your family member calls from America, the foreign telco has to pay a certain amount for ending the call on your local network.\n\nThe rates were last reviewed in 2016 from \u20a63.90/min to \u20a624.40/min (0.0095 cents/min to 0.059 cents/min) pending the result of the just concluded cost-based study.\n\nWhy does this matter? In 2018, Per The Punch call masking and SIM boxing fraud cost Nigeria $3 billion, and as Vice Chairman NCC, Umar Danbatta explained, investigations revealed the issue began immediately after it increased ITR in 2016\n\nCall masking and SIM boxing involve rerouting international calls illegally using a specialised box connected to the internet. The calls appear to be from local Nigerian numbers. You\u2019ve probably received such a call before.\n\nThis has been a long time coming. Although the NCC has not revealed the exact amount to be paid by foreign operators, this is undoubtedly good news for local operators who have suffered significant losses due to call masking and SIM boxing.\n\nToptal sues Andela\n\nPlentyWaka bus. Source: PlentyWaka Twitter\n\nToptal, a freelancing platform for software engineers, project managers, designers etc, has filed a lawsuit against direct competitor Andela and several ex-employees, alleging theft of trade secrets to create a perfect clone of its business.\n\nThese ex-employees include, Andela\u2019s current Vice President of Enterprise, Head of Talent Operations, Vice President of Product, and Executive Vice President of Talent Operations.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about this is the fact that up until 2020, Andela\u2019s business model differed from Toptal\u2019s. The Nigerian-founded company decided to pivot into fully remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIt had struggled with its initial model of creating physical hubs to train needed talents, laying off 420 junior developers in 2018 in three different African countries.\n\nIronically, Toptal and Andela\u2019s business model are pretty on par with freelancing platforms such as Fiverr, Upwork, Freelancer.\n\nThe US-based company is, however, claiming that its ex-employees, apart from revealing trade secrets, have stolen Toptal personnel, clients and talent.\n\nFear of competition? Toptal disagrees, but with a history that includes possibly disgruntled investors and employees, there might be more than meets the eye here.\n\nRead: Freelancer marketplace Toptal sues Andela and ex-employees, alleging theft of trade secrets\n\nIn case you missed it\n\nFrom ballot paper to blockchain ledger, can the tech behind Bitcoin heal Nigeria\u2019s democracy?

          "text": "The recent ban on open grazing in Southern Nigeria by the governors has presented billion-dollar investment opportunity in ranching for entrepreneurs to tap into.\n\nThe opportunities range from the cultivation of Napier grass for fodder to the building of ranches and integrated farming systems that boost livestock productivity and welfare.\n\nHowever, tapping into these opportunities means changing Africa\u2019s most populous country\u2019s current method of animal husbandry, ensuring an end to the prolonged farmers-herders conflicts, addressing critical issues stalling the growth of the industry, and creating jobs.\n\n\u201cTotal ban on open grazing in the country creates huge investment opportunity for investors. From the production of livestock feeds to ranch management, conservation, hauling, and marketing, investors can tap these opportunities across the value chains,\u201d Ahmed Adeyemi Amisu, lecturer at the Department of Pasture and Range Management, Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, says in a telephone interview.\n\n\u201cRanging is a big business and its adoption in Nigeria is fundamental as it will help create jobs, create a database for livestock production and address the farmers-herders crisis,\u201d Amisu states.\n\nHe notes that entrepreneurs can only tap from the huge investment opportunity ranching creates when government at all levels puts an end to open grazing and ensure that ranching becomes a business.\n\nCurrently, Nigeria imports over 95 percent of finished and raw milk, spending an average of $481 million (N197bn) on its importation yearly, the National Livestock Transformation Policy document stated.\n\nRearing herds of cattle within the confines of a ranch with all needed facilities help in boosting their milk production productivity, which according to experts, in turn, will reduce the country\u2019s milk importation.\n\nThe experts note that Africa\u2019s biggest economy can only reduce its milk importation amid FX shortages and create the much-needed jobs for its teeming population when it adopts innovation and ranching model in its animal husbandry.\n\nA 2019 PWC report on Nigeria\u2019s dairy industry stated that local productivity of cow breeds managed by pastoralists was low at 0.5 to 1.5 litres of milk per day compared with an average milk yield of 8 litres per day by cows in Nigeria\u2019s managed pastures.\n\n\u201cWith pastoralists traversing the country in search of available forage and water sources, they pay little or no attention to the nutritional content and suitability of the feed and water their cows consume,\u201d Commercial Dairy Ranchers Association of Nigeria said in a note.\n\n\u201cEnergy gained from the innutritious feed consumed through grazing is mainly used for trekking and will contribute little or nothing to the animal\u2019s economic productivity,\u201d the association said.\n\nCurrently, Botswana, which has more cattle than the human population, points the way for investors who are looking at taking advantage of the opportunity in the Nigerian livestock value chain.\n\nThe Southern African country has adopted ranching techniques similar to the ones practiced in South Africa, Australia and Argentina.\n\nMost of its ranches are medium- and large-sized cattle ranches fitted with a flavour of modern global dairy practice mostly driven by the private sector with the government providing the right policies and infrastructure.\n\nAccording to experts, Nigeria can adopt Botswana\u2019s model to develop its livestock industry and tackle the decades-long farmers-herders conflicts.\n\n\u201cThere are huge investment opportunities in ranching, which we are yet to tap,\u201d states AfricanFarmer Mogaji, chief executive, X-Ray Consulting Limited.\n\n\u201cBotswana is an example we can learn from in ranching as their economic growth is mainly from livestock production,\u201d Mogaji says.\n\nIn 2019, Africa\u2019s biggest economy unfolded a 10-year National Livestock Plan as a way of checking incessant clashes between farmers/herders, which have claimed innumerable lives and properties.\n\nAlso, the government announced moves to create 94 ranches in 10 pilot states under the plan and budgeted N179billion for the project.\n\nA move stakeholders applauded but noted it must be a private sector investment while the government provides the enabling environment.",

This is imperative because access to blood and blood components is an essential service that must be guaranteed if we are to make progress toward universal access to health and universal health coverage.\u201d\n\nHe however reassured that ongoing reforms in the Edo health sector, through the Edo Health Improvement Programme (Edo-HIP), would provide mechanisms to ensure patients in rural areas have access to safe blood.\n\nAccording to the WHO, \u201cWorld Blood Donor Day aims to raise global awareness of the need for safe blood and blood products for transfusion and of the critical contribution voluntary, unpaid blood donors make to national health systems.\n\n\u201cSafe blood and blood products and their transfusion are a critical aspect of care and public health. They save millions of lives and improve the health and quality of life of many patients every day. The need for blood is universal, but access to blood for all those who need it is not. Blood shortages are particularly acute in developing countries.\n\n\u201cTo ensure that everyone who needs safe blood has access to it, all countries need voluntary, unpaid donors who give blood regularly.

Hence, external debt service payments fell to N126.02 billion (or $332.07 million) in the first quarter (Q1) 2021 from N170.60 billion (or $472.57 million) printed in Q1 2020.\n\nFurther breakdown of the total external debt stock in Q1 2021 showed that multilateral loans accounted for 54.26 per cent ($17.83 billion) of which loans from the International Development Association (IDA) was $11.09 billion, loan from IMF was $3.48 billion while others stood at $3.26 billion. According to DMO, bilateral loan accounted for 12.73 per cent ($4.18 billion) of which loan from China (Exim Bank of China) was $3.40 billion and loan from France was $0.49 billion in Q1 2021.\n\nNigeria\u2019s total public debt stock rose year on year by 15.64 percent to N33.11 trillion as of March 2021 (from N28.63 trillion as of March 2020), figures from the DMO show.\n\nThe year on year increase was mainly due to a 24.86 per cent rise in external debt to N12.47 trillion (or $32.86 billion at N379.50/$) as of March 2021 from N9.99 trillion (or $27.67 billion at N361.00/$) in March 2020. Within a year, Nigeria received $3.48 billion worth of loans from the International Monetary Fund. Also, an additional loan of $1.43 billion was gotten from IDA. More so, the depreciation of the Naira against the greenback exacerbated external debt: yo-y, Naira depreciated against the US dollar by 5.10 per cent to close at N379.50/$ as of March 2021. Commercial loans accounted for 32.47 per cent ($10.66 billion) of which Eurobonds was $10.37 billion while diasporal bond was $0.30 billion. Local debt stock increased by 10.71 per cent to N20.64 trillion in Q1 2021 (from N18.64 trillion in Q1 2020).\n\nFurther breakdown of the domestic debt figure showed that federal government (FG\u2019s) domestic debt stock rose to N16.51 trillion in Q1 2021 (from N14.53 trillion in Q1 2020). Despite the significant rise in FG\u2019s domestic loan, local debt service payment increased marginally by 0.59 per cent to N612 billion in Q1 2021 from N609.13 billion recorded in Q1 2020 amid a relatively low rate.",

It is also the largest AUD trade ever issued by the bank.\n\nMore than 30 investors participated in the deal, with a total order book of more than A$775 million, leading to an upsize of the trade from the announced size of AUD250-300 million to the final size of AUD600 million. These included a strong cohort of Australian investors, while fund managers were the major investor type.\n\nCommenting on the bond, AfDB Treasurer, Hassatou N\u2019sele said the Covid-19 pandemic had led to a rise in global issuances of social bonds. \u201cFollowing on from the ground breaking USD$3.1 bln 3 year \u2018Fight Covid-19\u2019 Social Bond we issued in 2020, we\u2019re glad to see that public domestic markets, like the Kangaroo bond market, are now seeing similar development in terms of interest from dedicated ESG investors, which provided additional momentum enabling us to print the largest trade we\u2019ve ever done in AUD.\u201d\n\nThe African Development Bank\u2019s social bonds have use of proceeds allocated to projects that alleviate or mitigate social issues such as improving access to electricity, water and sanitation, and improving livelihoods through flood-risk reduction and access to clean transportation and employment generation.\n\nRecent data shows that the African Development Bank had AUD1.75 billion of bonds mature between its 2015 benchmark deal and its most recent.

The conference was in partnership with the Technical Unit on Governance and Anti-Corruption Reforms (TUGAR), Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism, (PTCIJ), National Orientation Agency (NOA) and AFRICMIL.\n\nResource persons at the conference included Dr Adebukola Adebayo, Chairman, Joint Association of Persons with Disabilities, (JONAPWD), HEDA Resource Centre, Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption, (PACAC), Prof Isah Sadiq Raddah, Barrister Muhuyi Magaji Chairman, Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission, Dr. Abiola Akiode-Afolabi among others.\n\nThe Chairman of the conference was Prof Sadiq Raddah while key note address was delivered by Mr Femi Falana SAN.\n\nPresentations were made by Prof Isah Sadiq Raddah, Barrister Monday Ubani, Muhuyi Magaji, Representative of EFCC Chairman, Mr. Ahmed Ghali, Lagos Zonal Head of EFCC, Dr Abiola Akiyode Afolabi and Dr. Mustapha Musa representative of the Code of Conduct Chairman, Prof. Isa Muhammad.\n\nThe statement also said rofessionals from different fields said tax manipulation and evasion by individuals and corporate organisations remained one of the most devastating sources of corruption in Nigeria.\n\nSuraju said corruption remained a teething problem in Nigeria with grave consequences on political stability, poverty, lack of jobs, growing wave of violence and extremism.\n\nHe urged Nigerians to work in unity to tackle corruption headlong.\n\nAccording to the statement, some of the participating groups at the summit include but not limited to representatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, (EFCC), Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB), MacArthur Foundation, Open Society Initiative for West Africa, (OSIWA), Society for West Africa Internal Auditors Practitioners of Taxation of Nigeria, (CITN),\n\nLagos Chambers of Commerce, Chartered Institute of Loan and Risk Management, (CILRN), Chartered Institute of Stockbrokers, (CIS), Justice Development and Peace Commission, (JPDC) of the Catholic Church, Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), CACOL among others.\n\nThe participants, in a communique, issued at the end of the day long event said, \u201cCorruption cannot be fought effectively unless Nigeria deals with tax fraud. Many individuals and corporate organisations evade or manipulate tax.\n\nThey do this in colThe laboration with professionals like accountants and lawyers. Tax remains the only steady source of income. Unless there is a transparent tax regime, more than 100b will be lost by Nigerians every year to tax related fraud.\n\n\u201cCorruption affects every citizen, young and old, men and women, physically challenged, children and youths, rich and poor, armed and defenceless people alike.\n\n\u201cNigeria has some 30m people with disabilities. There is a link between corruption and disabilities through poor health services like lack of access to efficient antenatal care, lack of access to balanced diet, bad roads leading to accidents, increasing wave of violence and lack of protective government policies.\u201d\n\nThey identified corruption patterns such as illicit money transfer, bribery, electoral malpractices, sharp practices by professionals, increasing number of cyber criminals who are arrested everyday with deep concern for commensurate diligence prosecution of the suspects\n\nThe participants said corruption remained one of the major obstacles blocking the uplifting of Nigeria to her required status as a great, dignified and prosperous country.\n\nThey expressed deep concern about how corruption affects women and the girl child across the country, either through exclusion, discrimination or sex corruption.\n\nThe participants said they recognised the fact that the Nigerian government in the past years had done a lot in the fight against corruption, and that such efforts included the implementation of policies like the Bank Verification Number, Treasury Single Account, trial and conviction of high profile politically exposed persons, and many more.\n\nThey noted that the country may not have arrived where she ought to be, but definitely not where she used to be.\n\nThey, however, said that despite government efforts and the various anti-graft agencies, corruption remained a major problem confronting the country in all areas, leading to poverty, hunger, lack of jobs, extremism, violence, breakdown of family and societal values and the declining fortunes of Nigeria social, political and economic future.\n\nThey recommended that the tiers of Government should enforce an effective tax system.\n\nThey noted that taxation is the only sustainable source of revenue for the government and said it was regretful that many actors in the Information Technology sector, multinational companies and many individuals allegedly evade tax in Nigeria making tax fraud a big corruption scourge.\n\nThey stated that in any country where corruption thrives, development, growth, the Income Per Capital and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will diminish and added that there can be no genuine investments where corruption is dominant.\n\nThey urged the people and the Government to keep alive hope and the collective determination to defeat corruption in order to bring back Nigeria on a path of glory and renaissance.\n\nThey said, \u201cThe Presidency should sustain the political will in the fight against corruption while the people should discharge their rights and duties in fighting corruption in all strata through personal acts of discipline, respect for law and defence of the society\u2019s moral heritage all required in the campaign to curtain corruption, promote transparency and accountability.\u2019\n\nThe experts also urged members of the Federal Executive Council to faithfully embrace the President\u2019s mantra of anti-corruption and transparency while the social units, the family, schools, faith-centres, peers and associations and law enforcement agencies should commit themselves to the campaign against corruption.\n\nAccording to them, fighting corruption effectively required assets tracing, recovery and disposal which they said should be efficiently executed by the Federal Government with sincerity, transparency and accountability.\n\nThey noted that the sub national actors have strategic roles to play in the fight against corruption, hence states and local governments should bring corruption to the front burner in their policy implementations.\n\nThe participants said to fight corruption successfully in Nigeria, professionals; lawyers, engineers, accountants, auditors, journalists, builders, medical practitioners should discharge their obligations with the highest sense of transparency and accountability while Nigeria should strengthen law enforcement against tax evasion to ensure control and punishment for culprits in private and public sectors including actors in digital economy.\n\nThe reports of the Auditor General released annually, according to the communique, should be constructively engaged by the National Assembly while all indicted MDAs should be referred for investigation by the anti-corruption agencies.\n\nThey asked the 36 states of the federation to emulate the example of Kano State by creating an independent and effective institutional framework to fight corruption at the grassroots and added that the capacity of investigators in anti-corruption agencies should be further strengthened through effective use of technology.\n\nThey also urged public officers to conform with the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB) regulations, as enshrined in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria\n\n\u201cA robust and free media is necessary in any meaningful anti-corruption campaign.

We have seen turbines that have been running for over 40 years. We have seen efforts being made by Egbin management to effect a turnaround at the plant through overhaul of he entire system.\n\n\u201cWe have also seen the support you have been giving to the youth through employment and capacity development opportunities.\n\n\u201cI have listened to the concerns you raised, particularly, in the area of transmission restrictions. I am aware that works are ongoing in this regards to ensure that all the power we generate is safely evacuated.\n\n\u201cAn area of concern to me is when you talked about the gas constraints. We are going to support you to make sure that the power supply is steady. We are having a session with gas suppliers in this regard.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Sonubi said the Egbin Power Plc under, its Phase Two investment expansion plan, would add between 1,750MW and 1,900MW to Nigeria\u2019s power generation pool.\n\nSonubi said the plant had gone through major overhauling, which had helped to increase its generation from the low capacity it had before 2013.\n\nHe said: \u201cEgbin has 1,320 MW capacity. As at the time we took over, the plant was generating 300MW which is abysmal 22 per cent.\n\n\u201cAs at today, our generation capacity has surged and we do 89 per cent.\n\n\u201cWe have reached the highest peak of 970 MW and we are working hard to ensure sustainability of this feat.\n\n\u201cThe 970MW we hit is the highest in the history of the plant and based on our core value of sustainability, we are working round the clock to make sure that we sustain the gains we have made.\u201d\n\nSonubi listed the challenges being faced by the company to include grid limitation, gas constraints and liquidity.\n\nHe, however, said stakeholders including the NNPC, Central Bank of Nigeria and the Transmission Company of Nigeria were working tirelessly to solve the issues.\n\nSonubi appealed to the NNPC to sustain effort towards gas development and supply of the product to keep turbines at Egbin working productively at optimal capacity.

          "text": "Kingsley Chukwuka, Jos and ISAAC JOB, UYO\n\nDespite efforts of the various security agencies to curb killings by suspected herdsmen and bandits, hoodlums have again killed no fewer than 12 persons, including a police inspector, in a fresh attack on Wazoji village in Zamfara State.\n\nAccording to a source, the attack, which happened on Sunday, was carried out by gunmen driving vehicles allegedly given to \u201crepentant\u201d bandits by the State Governor, Bello Matawalle.\n\nThe source said the attackers, riding in a Hilux vehicle and motorcycles, came to rustle cattle and loot shops in the village.\n\nThis development comes just a few days after bandits attacked Magarya ward, Kadawa, in the Zumi Local Government Area of Zamfara State, killing 67 persons.\n\nIn a related development, no fewer than 12 persons were also reportedly killed on Sunday night by suspected Fulani herdsmen in Kushe community in Kuru District of Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau State.\n\nOur correspondent gathered that the killing took place at about 9:30pm when suspected Fulani herdsmen storm the community and shot on the people sporadically.\n\nIt was gathered that five persons sustained gunshots injuries and are receiving treatment at various hospitals in the state.\n\nThe District Head and Gwom Rwey Kuru, Da Patrick Mandung confirmed the incident at the scene and said his people were attacked without any form of provocation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why people will come from different places to come and kill people and just go. I appeal to security agencies to fish out the perpetrators. I condemn this act in totality and I want these people to be fished out.\u201d\n\nMember representing Jos South/Jos East Federal Constituency of Plateau State in the House of Representatives, Hon. Dachung Musa Bagos condemned the act and urged the people to defend themselves.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine that 12 lives were wiped out in this attack, government must raise to it responsibility of protecting lives and property, security must not be one sided, government must provide security to all.\n\nI want to assure the people that I will stand by them, I will stand with the families that have lost their loved ones.\n\n\u201cIf government cannot protect the people then the people must defend themselves.\n\nThis is the reason why we have been talking on the need for State Police and therefore intelligent gathering is very key in this regard.\n\nSecurity must not allow this kind of barbaric act again, a generation has been wiped out.\u201d He cried out.\n\nManagement Committee Chairman of Jos South Local Government Area, Amb. Gideon Davou Dandereng described the killings as unacceptable and urged the security to unravel those behind the attack.\n\n\u201cYou can see what happened here, this is a home where people live, they were attacked and killed. This is barbaric and as human, this is what human can do to their fellow human being; I completely disagree with this and it is unacceptable.\n\n\u201cI want the security agencies to do their best and fish out those who carry out this attack, once this is done confidence will be restored. I urge the community people to remain calm and allowed the security to do their job.\u201d\n\nMember representing Jos South in the Plateau State House of Assembly, Hon. Dalyop Fom condemned the act and lamented that his people have been helpless for a long time.\n\nDeputy Chairman, Senate Committee on Defence and Senator representing Plateau North, Istifanus Gyang charged the security agencies to live up to their responsibility of protecting people, particularly those in the villages.\n\nAlso, armed men suspected to be Fulani herdsmen on Sunday morning attacked Ikot Atasung community in Ikot Ikpene Local government Area of Akwa Ibom State and killed one Sylvanus Usen while the deceased brother sustained various degree of injuries.\n\nIt was gathered that the brother; Andrew who was severely injured during the early morning attack was taken to an undisclosed hospital now receiving treatment to survive.\n\nOur Correspondent gathered that the incident occurred simultaneously with one in Ini Local Government Area of the state almost the same hour where a police officer was shot dead by armed men suspected to be members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB).\n\nA source who pleaded anonymity told our correspondent on Monday that the timely intervention of some community leaders prevented a possible reprisal attack that would have erupted between the youths and the Hausa community in the area.\n\nThe source added that the situation in the community is still very volatile and tensed.\n\nThe source said \u201cSuspected herdsmen in the early hours of yesterday attacked Ikot Atasung Village in Ikot Ekpene where one Silvanus Peter Usen was killed and his brother, Andrew was severely injured and is currently at the hospital battling to survive.\u201d\n\n\u201cA possible face off between the angry youths and the Hausa Community in Ikot Ekpene was avoided yesterday through the intervention of some political actors and the police. However, there is an air of uncertainty in Ikot Ekpene now.\u201d\n\nThe State Police Command\u2019s Public Relations Officer, Odiko Macdon who confirmed the incident described it as \u201cunfortunate\u201d adding that the Commissioner of Police, Andrew Amiengheme has already ordered a discreet investigation into the incident.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the perpetrators of the crime would soon be brought to book.\n\n\u201cWe have received that report, it is an unfortunate one. The CP has ordered a discreet investigation into the incident with the aim of apprehending the perpetrators of the act.\n\n\u201cAnd I want to believe that in no distant time we will have an update on the incident because those who have committed the act must be brought to book,\u201d he said.",

But due to the opposition which greeted the concept of cattle colony in many quarters the Federal Government jettisoned the policy and adopted the Livestock Transformation Policy including ranching in 2018,\u201d Falana recalled.\n\nHe noted that the Chairman of the sub-committee on farmer/herder crisis, Dave Umahi, who is also the Governor of Ebonyi State, disclosed that the Federal Government would bear 80 per cent of the sum of N100bn earmarked for ranching while participating states would support with N20bn and provision of lands for the programme.\n\nIn 2019, the Central Bank of Nigeria also announced plans to provide loans for ranching and milk production.\n\nFalana said last month, the Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, Governor Simon Lalong, announced that all the states in the North had adopted the National Livestock Transformation Programme and called on the Federal Government to release funds to willing states to start.\n\nLalong was quoted as saying that some states had begun processes to end open grazing in their states.\n\n\u201cKaduna has a ranch with Dano milk as a pilot; Plateau has sent a bill on ranching to the state assembly, Zamfara, Kano, Taraba, Niger, Nasarawa have started ranch constructions,\u201d the Plateau State governor was quoted as saying.\n\nFalana argued that in view of the unanimous decision of the Northern Governors Forum and Southern Governors Forum to ban open grazing and adopt ranching, President Buhari ought to drop the search for grazing routes and ensure the success of the National Livestock Transformation Programme of the Federal Government.

But due to the opposition which greeted the concept of cattle colony in many quarters the Federal Government jettisoned the policy and adopted the Livestock Transformation Policy including ranching in 2018,\u201d Falana recalled.\n\nHe noted that the Chairman of the sub-committee on farmer/herder crisis, Dave Umahi, who is also the Governor of Ebonyi State, disclosed that the Federal Government would bear 80 per cent of the sum of N100bn earmarked for ranching while participating states would support with N20bn and provision of lands for the programme.\n\nIn 2019, the Central Bank of Nigeria also announced plans to provide loans for ranching and milk production.\n\nFalana said last month, the Chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, Governor Simon Lalong, announced that all the states in the North had adopted the National Livestock Transformation Programme and called on the Federal Government to release funds to willing states to start.\n\nLalong was quoted as saying that some states had begun processes to end open grazing in their states.\n\n\u201cKaduna has a ranch with Dano milk as a pilot; Plateau has sent a bill on ranching to the state assembly, Zamfara, Kano, Taraba, Niger, Nasarawa have started ranch constructions,\u201d the Plateau State governor was quoted as saying.\n\nFalana argued that in view of the unanimous decision of the Northern Governors Forum and Southern Governors Forum to ban open grazing and adopt ranching, President Buhari ought to drop the search for grazing routes and ensure the success of the National Livestock Transformation Programme of the Federal Government.

Borrowing for frivolous items such as funding the Nigerian Television Authority is scandalous.\n\n\u201cMoney should only be borrowed for productive purposes as Nigeria\u2019s current debt of over N36 trillion is becoming clearly unsustainable relative to our earnings and GDP.\u201d\n\nThe meeting also frowned at the opaque manner the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) carried out its operations, particularly its recent decision not to make statutory contributions to the Federation Account.\n\nThe governors knocked the NNPC for starving the States and Local Governments and indeed Nigerians of funds needed for employment, development and general well-being.\n\n\u201cUnder the Constitution, the NNPC is duty bound to make proceeds of sale or business of Petroleum available to the Federation Account which belongs to the three tiers of government, excluding reasonable and verified and verifiable cost of operations.\n\n\u201cThe Federal government through NNPC is a manager of our oil wealth merely as A TRUSTEE for all Nigerians.\u201d\n\nThe PDP governors decried a situation where the NNPC decided in a totally discretionary and often whimsical manner, how much to spend, how to spend it and how much to remit to the Federation Account, contrary to the letters and even the spirit of the 1999 Constitution.\n\nThe PDP governors demanded that States should have a say in determination of the operating cost of other agencies of Government such as Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC), Federal Inland Revenue Services, Customs and Excise and similar organisations that are statutorily required to make contributions into the Federation Account, to ensure transparency and accountability.\n\nThe meeting expressed deep concern that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is operating as an independent government within a Government, which is a perversion of the autonomy of the Bank.\n\n\u201cA situation where CBN creates money, decides how much of it to spend, on what to spend it on without any form of controls or supervision is patently subversive of our constitutional order.\n\n\u201cIt has become not just a LEVIATHAN, but also a father Christmas of sorts, dabbling into every sphere and scope of governmental activity, not just as a lender of last resort, but as a full executing agency of government.\n\n\u201cThe meeting observed that the CBN has become such an octopus that it threatens State governments publicly, without decorum, about sanctions on any attempt to question its MODUS OPERANDI. The CBN should take immediate steps to halt the depreciation of the Naira,\u201d the said.\n\nThe Forum called for the resignation of the chairman and members of Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission for failure to send the revised Revenue Allocation Formula that would make more resources available to States and Local Governments where ordinary Nigerians reside, to President Muhammad Buhari for onward transmission to the National Assembly for enactment.\n\nThe PDP governors, who also examined the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria, condemned the personalised reasons given for the action by the presidency and demanded a review of the action in national interest.\n\n\u201cThe mere ego of Mr President is not enough for such a drastic action that deprives millions of Nigerians from such an affordable means of expression and communication.\n\n\u201cWe hope that this is not a harbinger or early warning signs of descent into dictatorship.\n\n\u201cThe meeting noted that social media regulation can only be done within the existing laws on the subject and should not be used as an attempt to punish or gag Nigerians from enjoying constitutionally guaranteed rights.\n\n\u201cNigerian youths do not have adequate access to employment and a lot of Nigerians rely on Twitter for their livelihood, businesses and self-employment.\n\n\u201cThis will further worsen Nigeria\u2019s 33% unemployment rate which is the highest in the world, improve Nigerians ranking as the country with second highest poverty rate in the entire world, all of which happened under APC\u2019s unfortunate stewardship.\u201d\n\nThe PDP Governors observed the emerging threats to the country\u2019s democracy, constitutionalism and rule of law and cautioned the Federal Government to exercise power with restraint.\n\n\u201cThe need for law and order is paramount to secure our nation but mindless killings of innocent civilians should be avoided and is hereby condemned. It is in the same vein that the meeting reiterated its earlier revulsion at any attack on security personnel and their property anywhere in the country as a criminal and egregious act for which perpetrators should be brought to book.\u201d\n\nThe PDP governors noted with regret that President Buhari seem not to be aware that the coercive instruments of State security is firmly within his hands and not the Governors, considering his recent media interview on the subject.\n\nIn attendance were Governors Udom Emmanuel (Akwa Ibom), Nyesom Ezenwo Wike (Rivers) Douye Diri (Bayelsa), Samuel Ortom (Benue State), Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta), Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu).\n\nOthers were Governors Oluseyi Makinde (Oyo), Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri (Adamawa), Godwin Obaseki (Edo), Bala Mohammed (Bauchi), Darius Ishaku (Taraba), Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia) and Deputy Governor Mahdi Mohd (Zamfara).",

          "text": "Adeyeye Olorunfemi, an anti-President Muhammadu Buhari activist, walked out of a Channels Television show on Monday after refusing to take off his #BuhariMustGo T-shirt.\n\nOlorunfemi remarked that continuing the interview would be equal to surrendering his beliefs, thus he chose to walk out of the studio rather than continue.\n\nHe said he was offered a jacket to wear to conceal the #BuhariMustGo message on his T-shirt, but he declined because he thought it was \u201ctoo ludicrous.\u201d\n\nThe activist wrote, \u201dHere is my reaction to those who opined that I should have gone ahead with the interview this morning, instead of walking out in protest.\n\n\u201dIt appears many don\u2019t understand how oppression works. Sometimes, it comes in subtle forms- in ways that do not really hurt.\n\n\u201cThere is no small oppression. So, to say I should have gone ahead with the interview without my #BuhariMustGo shirt means that I should allow my rights to freedom of expression to be trampled on, just \u2018slightly\u2019.\n\n\u201cI should have submitted myself to censorship and that I should have compromised the stance of the movement, right before the other person who was brought to defend how protesters were attacked during the #June12Protest. Never!\n\n\u201cWhen the Producer offered me a jacket to wear, so as to cover the #BuhariMustGo inscription, it was like initiating me to some identity crisis cult. It sounded too absurd.\n\n\u201dThe civil rights movement in America has a history and the \u2018small\u2019 defiant role of Rosa Parks cannot be discarded. In fact, it birthed the whole resistance against segregation.\n\n\u201dShould we say it wouldn\u2019t have mattered if Rosa Parks had allowed the white man sitting in the bus? Is it not \u2018small standing she will just stand\u2019? She would get to her destination sitting or standing, right? Is that not what you are saying? But what you need to know is that she would have postponed the campaign for freedom with such a \u2018slight acceptance\u2019 of oppression.\n\n\u201dThe right for blacks to sit in a bus at that time was not recognised anyway, but it was fought for, due to Rosa Parks\u2019 intolerable attitude towards \u2018small oppression\u2019. So if it\u2019s written in any code, known or unknown, that it is unethical to go on TV with insignia perceived to be anti-government, let the fight to make it right begin.\n\n\u201dNo matter how you package poison, it is still poison. It does not matter how you hide oppression in rules, regulations, \u2018ethics\u2019, conduct, flowery words, in your own docility, some of us can fish it out and we would never bow to it.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s a big shame on the drowning Buhari regime that all institutions that should promote and defend rights have been subdued, owing to the dictatorship of the regime. It\u2019s almost time up for the regime. We shall overcome. Victory is near.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s spokesman, Garba Shehu, said on Monday that the president is now more determined than ever to rid the country of \u201cartificial divisions that are impeding national cohesion and growth.\u201d\n\nThe Buhari administration has been plagued by widespread discontent, with secessionist agitations rising in the South-East and South-West.\n\nThe agitations, which have been led by the Independent People of Biafra, IPOB, and proponents of the Oodua Nation, have mostly been motivated by alleged injustices against some parts of the country and evident favoritism of the president\u2019s region in the distribution of federal benefits.\n\nMr Shehu, appearing on state-run broadcaster NTA, believes that the regime\u2019s adversary is the outlawed microblogging site Twitter, which is used to spew hate messages and endanger Nigeria\u2019s business survival.\n\n\u201cI think in the last few days, we are seeing a firmer determination by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari to tackle artificial divisions that are standing in the way of national cohesion and progress of the country,\u201d Mr Shehu said.\n\n\u201cAs I said, Twitter is one of them, but from the pronouncement of the president, in the interview he did on Arise TV and the one on NTA here, the speech he gave in Lagos and the broadcast he gave, I think they are suggestive of the fact that the growing heat in the country must not continue.\u201d\n\nSince the government announced the suspension of Twitter activities in Nigeria, the decision has been met with harsh criticism both locally and globally. Many citizens accused the president of infringing on citizens\u2019 right to free speech and depriving them of their primary source of income.\n\nWith over 30 million users in Nigeria, Twitter is not only a social networking site, but also a venue for Nigerians to communicate their thoughts on national issues and build social cohesion.\n\nBut, in justifying the ban, Mr Shehu claimed that it was the proper method in ensuring that the country\u2019s \u201crising heat\u201d was put to an end.\n\nThe decision, according to the presidential adviser, also reflects the current administration\u2019s willingness to address challenges that endanger Nigeria\u2019s peaceful coexistence.\n\nMeanwhile, the Buhari dictatorship has been extensively chastised for gross human rights violations, increasing insecurity and the economy, corruption, and nepotism, among other things.",

          "text": "Some five months after, reprieve has come the way of Abubakar Garba Idris, a senior protection assistant with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and some nine others, as they were released by the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP).\n\nAlso released alongside Alooma, as the UN staff is fondly called, were a businessman, Muazu Bawa, a senior Christian cleric, Reverend Zango and one Barka Wasinda, a former staff of the Nigerian Ports Authority and some aid workers abducted March from a facility in Dikwa.\n\nDikwa, which lies some 90 kilometres away from Maiduguri, the Borno state capital, had consistently come under attacks by the insurgents from January till date.\n\nAlooma and some of the captives were abducted several times between January 2 and March along Maiduguri/Damaturu highway.\n\nBlueprint gathered that they all regained their freedom after series of negotiations.\n\nThe UN staffer was as at the time of this report, undergoing medical and military check with troops of Operation Hadin Kai in Maiduguri after which he would be released to his family.\n\nSimilarly, Bawa, a business mogul, who was also kidnapped same day, as well as the other eight captives were all undergoing debriefing by the military.\n\nThe attacks\n\nFor instance, during the March attack, the terror group overran the town, destroyed support facilities, including a primary healthcare centre, and also laid siege to the UN humanitarian hub, which forced aid workers to seek shelter in a bunker.\n\nThe development forced the world body to suspend operations in the war ravaged northeast in response to the attacks on humanitarian operations in Dikwa and Damasak.\n\nThe council on foreign relations\u2019 security tracker says over 37,000 people were killed and millions displaced by the Boko Haram conflict.\n\nThe insurgents, it would be recalled, had attacked a convoy of travellers close to Matari village between Mainok to Jakana along Maiduguri/Damaturu highway, during which the UN worker was kidnapped at about 8.30am of the ill-fated day.\n\nAccording to reports, the criminals who were all in military attire mounted a roadblock on the highway with about three Hilux vans and several motorcycles to force to a halt.\n\nHowever, Alooma drew the ire of the insurgents when he threw off his identification card in an attempt to possibly conceal his identity from his abductors.\n\nUnfortunately, according to report, he was sighted by one of the insurgents who ordered him out of the car.\n\nAnd for Bawa, Blueprint learnt the businessman was driving his private vehicle and attempted to beat the checkpoint of the insurgents.\n\nIn the process, his car was shot at the rear by the Boko Haram elements, who in anger pounced on him and took the businessman to an unknown destination.\n\nConfirming their release, Executive Director Yobe State Network of Civil Society Abubakar Baba Shehu said \u201cit\u2019s cheering news.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was together with someone who called a family member of Alooma and he has confirmed the release of his brother. This is encouraging news and we pray that more captives should be released soon,\u201d Shehu said.\n\nPlateau\n\nAnd from Plateau state, there are reports that 14 people were confirmed dead in two separate attacks by gunmen.\n\nBlueprint gathered that while 12 people were killed in Sabon Layi Village, Kuru community, Jos South local government area, two other persons were killed in Zogu Village, Miango community in Bassa local government area of the state.\n\nSources said the attacks were carried out Sunday night while the people were already in their sleep.\n\nConfirming the development, the lawmaker representing Jos South local government area in the State House of Assembly, Fom Gwattson, said: \u201cSome gunmen last night attacked my constituency and killed twelve persons in Sabon Layi community. I have just been informed of the development and this is completely unacceptable.\u201d\n\nNational President Irigwe Development Association Ezekiel Bini, who also spoke in similar vein, said two persons were killed in Zogu village, while two others were injured during the incident.\n\n\u201cTwo persons died during the attack last night, while two were injured. It\u2019s unfortunate that we have continued to bury our people on every attack by gunmen without anything being done to stop the killings by the authorities,\u201d Bini lamented.\n\nPolice confirm killings\n\nBut in a reaction, the police image maker in the state, Ubah Ogaba, put the casualty figures at 10 on Jos South local government area.\n\n\u201cWe had an incident in Jos South LGA. 10 persons, unfortunately, lost their lives but I am yet to get reports on the attack in Bassa.\n\n\u201cThe Plateau State Police Command received a report that 10 persons were shot dead in a drinking joint at Sabon Layi, Kuru in Jos South LGA by yet to be identified gunmen who drove in with a Hilux and shot sporadically.\n\n\u201cPersonnel of the Command and the military have been deployed in the affected area.\n\n\u201cThe Commissioner of Police has ordered an immediate investigation to unravel the circumstances surrounding the killing and to bring the perpetrators of that dastardly act to book,\u201d Ogaba said.\n\n11 killed in Benue\n\nIn a related development, 11 people were killed in two separate incidents in Agatu local government area of Benue state.\n\nThe incident came barely one week after gunmen attacked and killed 27 people in Odugbeho community of the same local government area.\n\nIt was gathered that the latest killings occurred in Odugbeho and two other rural villages of Aila and Adagbo.\n\nSources said while two people were killed in Odugbeho, the nine others met their fate in Aila and Adagbo villages Sunday night.\n\nConfirming the development, chairman of the council, Adoyi Sule, said the attack on Odugbeho community was done by some suspected herdsmen.\n\nThe council boss further said the suspects invaded the community Sunday night, killed the two people and burnt 21 houses.\n\nSimilarly, he said the death of nine others were occasioned by the communal crisis between Aila and Adagbo communities.\n\nHe said about eight persons wounded during the fracas were currently receiving medical attention at an unknown hospital.\n\nAnd when contacted, spokesman of the state Police command, Catherine Anene, said she was yet to be briefed.\n\nZazzau emir\n\nAlso, the Emir of Zazzau,n Mallam Ahmed Nuhu Bamalli has raised the alarm over persistent level of attacks carried out by armed bandits in the Emirate and the state as a whole.\n\nHe therefore called for more deployment of troops to enhance maximum security of lives and property of citizens in the area.\n\nThe Emir raised the concern Monday when the Kaduna state Commissioner of Home Affairs and Internal Security, Samuel Aruwan, led a security delegation on a confidence building visit to the palace in Zaria.\n\nThe monarch said the increasing rate of banditry in the emirate and the state in general was becoming so alarming with gunmen striking in the ancient city almost on daily basis in the last one week.\n\nBamali said: \u201cIt is disheartening that a hospital can be razed and a Medical Doctor kidnapped, while a District Head who is leader can be subjected to attacks and his family kidnapped.\n\n\u201cYou are also aware that a student was shot death while two lecturers and about 10 students were kidnapped in Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic Zaria all within one week.\u201d\n\nThe Emir said more deployment of troops became highly imperative considering the strategic importance of Zaria which serves as a gateway to people in the North West.\n\nBamalli however appreciated the efforts of both the federal and Kaduna state governments at combating the menace, but called for more stringent measures to safeguard the lives of the people.\n\n\u201cWith all the number of Military, Air Force and Police Formations in the state,it is worrisome that such level of insecurity could persist. I therefore appealed for more concerted efforts in addressing the ugly trend,\u201d the emir pleaded.\n\nEarlier, Commissioner Aruwan had said they were at the palace to commiserate with the Emir over recent activities of gunmen in the Emirate and also reassure the people that government and all security personnel would continue to protect the lives and property of the citizens.\n\nHe conveyed Governor Nasir Ahmed El-Rufai\u2019s condolence and sympathy to all those involved in the attacks.\n\nOn the visit were Commander 453 Base Services Group Nigerian Air Force Training Command Kaduna, Air Commodore Kenneth Iyamu, Garrison Commander 1 Division, Kaduna, Brig.-Gen. Ofuno and Commissioner of Police Umar Musa Muri, who all pledged their readiness to tackle insecurity challenges head on.\n\n\u2018We need security summit now\u2019\n\nAnd amidst these challenges, pioneer Director General Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) Osaro Onaiwu has urged former governors from 1999 to 2019 to converge as soon as possible to deliberate on issues bordering on national security.\n\nHe charged the former governors to speak up against the insecurity and other vices ravaging the country, as keeping quiet in the face of killing and destructions would not help the country and its citizens.\n\nThe former NGF head further noted that none of the ex-governors had raised his voice against the killings and carnage in the country in the past few years.\n\nHe said \u201crain doesn\u2019t fall on one roof,\u201d insisting that the earlier the insecurity ravaging the nation is tamed the better for everyone.\n\nOnaiwu pointed out that nowhere is safe in the country, adding that \u201cthe nation is not at war, but the blood that has been spilled in the past few years could be counted as a nation at war.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe former governors should meet like other leaders of thought that have been working round the clock to proffer solution to what is happening in the country.\n\n\u201cKeeping silence will not help the nation as there is nowhere that is safe presently. This is the time for them to meet and take action. Religion, ethnicity and other cultural affiliation should be put aside so that this country can be delivered from the hands of bandits, terrorists, kidnappers, robbers and others destroying the nation.\n\n\u201cIt is high time somebody speaks out and the former governors still have influence in this country and they should not keep quiet. Keeping quiet will not help the country to overcome the monster of insecurity and other vices,\u201d Onaiwu said.",

          "text": "Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have accused the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) of not making its statutory contributions to the Federation Allocation Account (FAAC) thereby starving the states and local governments and indeed Nigerians of funds.\n\nThis was contained in a communiqu\u00e9 issued Monday at the end of PDP Governors\u2019 Forum meeting held in Uyo, Akwa Ibom state.\n\nThe PDP Governors\u2019 Forum also admonished other agencies of government such as the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC), Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS) and the Department of Customs & Excise to up their contributions to the Federation Allocation Account.\n\nChairman of the forum and Sokoto state Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal made the positions known at the end of the meeting.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Forum examined the operations of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), and expressed alarm at the opaque manner it carries out its operations. It decried the recent NNPC\u2019s decision not to make its statutory contributions to the Federation Account, thereby starving the States and Local Governments and indeed Nigerians of funds needed for employment, development and general wellbeing.\n\n\u201cThe meeting emphasised that under the Constitution, the NNPC is duty-bound to make proceeds of sale or business of petroleum available to the Federation Allocation Account which belongs to the three tiers of government, excluding reasonable and verified and verifiable cost of operations. The federal government through the NNPC is a manager of our oil wealth merely as trustee for all Nigerians.\n\n\u201cThe meeting frowned at a situation where the NNPC decides in a totally discretionary and often whimsical manner, how much to spend, how to spend it and how much to remit to the Federation Account, contrary to the letters and even the spirit of the 1999 Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe communiqu\u00e9 further said: \u201cThe PDP Governors also expressed deep concerns on the operational system and methods of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). It viewed with regrets that the CBN is operating as an independent government within a Government, which is a pervasion of the autonomy of the Bank. A situation where CBN creates money, decides how much of it to spend, on what to spend it on without any form of controls or supervision is patently subversive of our constitutional order.\n\n\u201cIt has become not just a leviathan, but also a father Christmas of sorts, dabbling into every sphere and scope of governmental activity, not just as a lender of last resort, but as a full executing agency of government.\u201d\n\nThey frowned at the rising and seemingly uncontrollable debt profile of Nigeria with over 80% of normal Appropriation spent on debt servicing, noting that \u201cmoney should only be borrowed for productive purposes as Nigeria\u2019s current debt of over N36 Trillion Naira is becoming unsustainable relative to our earnings and GDP.\u201d\n\nThe Forum also reiterated its call for the \u201cRevenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission to urgently send the revised Revenue Allocation Formula to Mr President for onward transmission to the National Assembly for enactment, such that more resources are made available to States and Local Governments where ordinary Nigerians reside.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe meeting expressed support for the implementation of judicial and legislative autonomy in the Federation and States, in conformity with the extant provisions of the 1999 Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe meeting examined the suspension of Twitter from operating in Nigeria and condemned the personalised reasons given for the action. The mere ego of Mr President is not enough for such a drastic action that deprives millions of Nigerians from such an affordable means of expression and communication. We hope that this is not a harbinger or early warning signs of descent into dictatorship.\n\n\u201cThis will further worsen Nigeria\u2019s 33% unemployment rate which is the highest in the world, improve Nigerias ranking as the country with second highest poverty rate in the entire world, all of which happened under APC\u2019s unfortunate stewardship.\n\n\u201cThe meeting consequently requested Mr. President to review the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria in the national interest,\u201d the communiqu\u00e9 further stated.\n\nIn attendance at the meeting were Governors Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia state) who is the vice chairman, Udom Emmanuel (Akwa Ibom), Douye Diri (Bayelsa), Samuel Ortom (Benue), Ifeanyi Okowa (Delta), Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu), Nyesom Wike (Rivers), Oluseyi Abiodun Makinde (Oyo), Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri (Adamawa), Godwin Obaseki (Edo), Bala Mohammed (Bauchi), Darius Ishaku (Taraba) and Deputy Governor Mahdi Mohammed of Zamfara state.",

He did not demand the constitution and inauguration of A BOARD of NDDC.\n\n\u201cThis simply means that he was specifically referring to the Board of NDDC already screened and confirmed by the Senate in line with the NDDC 2000 Act, as amended, but whose members have been unjustly placed on standby under the guise of allowing for forensic auditing of NDDC.\n\n\u201cIn conclusion, we are once more patriotically renewing our Advice to President Buhari to be very wary of those Governors, and some of his political Associates/Aides misleading him and putting pressure on him to continue to unjustly and unlawfully delay or jettison the inauguration of the Governing Board of NDDC that he rightly nominated and passionately requested the Senate to confirm, which the Senate did.\n\n\u201cAs we stated in our previous Advice to him, those Governors and Politicians who went pleading with him not to inaugurate the NDDC Board were not sincere to him and his APC but only wanted to pitch our people against him and his APC leadership. Have we not been vindicated now?\n\n\u201cIt will be against his commitment to restoring Peace, Order and Security in our Oil Producing South-South Region if he allows himself to be misled to further delay the inauguration of this substantive Board of NDDC. Nigerians can\u2019t afford to see our South-South Region added to the Regions that are sadly now engulfed in breakdown of Peace, Security and Public Order.\n\n\u201cAs High Chief Tompolo rightly stated in his Statement, the renewed demand for the inauguration of the substantive Board of NDDC is for the Love of our Region and Country, Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe can no longer allow the guise of forensic auditing to be used to mislead President Buhari on this matter,\u201d it stated.",

          "title": "Re: 1,500 Christian Killed in 6 Months in Nigeria -NigPilot",
          "text": "While taking a vivid look at the article being published on the spiteful statements made by the immediate past United States Secretary of State and former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Mike Pompeo, all I saw was nothing but a tool (Pompeo) that is craving for relevance, and being used by the news agency to propagate pernicious propaganda aimed at the heart of Nigeria\u2019s unity by creating extreme religious bigotry among the peaceful citizens, and to also disrupt President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration.\n\nThe article written by Mike Pompeo on the 10th of June is nothing but a tool aimed at breeding discord and blindly criticizing the patriotic leaders of our dear country Nigeria. It is nothing but false political propaganda created to serve no good deed.\n\nHe stated that at least 1,500 Christians have been killed in Nigeria in the last six months. This is an awful fabrication of facts. Yes, there are several issues of insecurity rocking the nation, but it is not nearly as bad as Mike Pompeo paints it to be. It is shameful for him to have stated such false facts without providing proof or a source of reference.\n\nI was perplexed to my very core when I read what was written in the fallacious article, as it was obvious that Mike Pompeo wished to blindly attack the Nigerian government without cause or reason, and I asked myself, \u201cWHY?\u201d\n\nIt is remarkable to know that the level of insecurity in Nigeria has drastically reduced overtime. The alarming Boko Haram insurgency has been dealt with in a pragmatic approach taken by President Muhammadu Buhari. Many successes have been recorded under his leadership as he has been steadfast in the discharge of his duty and providing aid to civil authority.\n\nThe issue of Muslims fighting Christians is a matter that has been present throughout history from the 7th century. The matter has encouraged a variety of views throughout history, but greeting the matter with the idiosyncrasy of condemning one party over the other is one that breeds hatred and hostility. Owing to the delicate nature of such a matter, it would have been wise for Pompeo to guard his statements regarding the killings of Christians in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria is on the edge presently, and statements that would further encourage discord and hostility between the two major religions in the country should be avoided.\n\nIt was myopic of Mike Pompeo not to have pointed out the fact that Christians are not the only ones being slaughtered in the country. Several faithful Muslims have also been killed in various parts of the country. It is obvious that his intents are born out of mischief.\n\nHe also failed to point out the fact that these acts were carried out by terrorists and bandits who do not discriminate when they kill. They do not care about what group or religion their victims belong to. They carry out their acts without mercy, no matter who you are.\n\nI strongly admit and concur that any government that cannot discharge this basic obligation of Protecting Lives and Property, losses any iota of legitimacy. President Muhammadu Buhari has been fervent in his handling of security issues in Nigeria that has led to massive killing and wanton destruction of property across the country, and making every region habitable to everyone irrespective of their religious view as opposed to what Pompeo insinuated.\n\nIn addressing the challenge to the survival of religion tolerance in Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari made it pertinent to consider, and also worked on security issues and problems that have affected or capable of affecting the attitude, confidence and cooperation of all groups and segments that make up the Nigerian federation, without leaving out the necessity to explore the gaps and gray areas in the national constitution that are responsible for various religion problems and crises.\n\nHowever, knowing that sensitive issues like that of religion intolerance is a weaponry that has fostered National and International Terrorist attacks on many Nations, Pompeo should have known better to verify every information gotten, or seen on the internet before relying on a creek in-house media as a source of verifiable information. This act makes a man like him reeks of low intelligence.\n\nHe also accused the Nigerian government of \u201cdownplaying the attacks and characterizing them as conflicts between herders and farmers rather than as religiously motivated acts of terror.\u201d One can never call a spade a bucket. We have all seen that there is no religious motivation behind the killings in Nigeria. These killings are merely carried out by merciless bandits and terrorists who know nothing about Islam or Christianity.\n\nPompeo cited the case of Leah Sharibu who has remained in captivity in the hands of the Boko Haram sect due to the fact that she refused to convert to Islam. He claimed that the young lady has remained in captivity over three years without consequence. By this, he insinuates that the Nigerian government failed to act merely because she is a Christian who refused to convert to Islam. This is an odoriferous innuendo that Mike Pompeo has so witlessly expressed.\n\nHe also made other claims about the matter, one of which he gave a self-declared statistic stating that Christians murdered in the country had risen to 60 percent in 2020 and was most likely going to get worse in recent times. This he stated without providing concrete evidence to his claim.\n\nWe should educate Pompeo and help his amnesia about his statement on the presence of radical Islamic jihadist groups in northern Nigeria.\n\nFirstly, he should know that radical Islamic jihadist groups are all over the world. Islamic State West Africa Province, ISWAP, is all over African countries and has registered their presence through different attacks. Has he forgotten so soon?\n\nThe memorable 9/11 attack on the twin tower by Alqueada, that was masterminded and executed on American soil?\n\nThe numerous attacks by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, ISIL, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, ISIS, or Daesh, which is detailed as follows:\n\nA car bomb in Iraq that killed 28 Shia pilgrims and injured 60 others as they were returning from Karbala, while in the capital Baghdad a roadside bomb exploded near a minibus, killing four pilgrims and wounding 15.\n\nA suicide bomber exploded targeting civilians in a commercial shop on a busy tourist destination and business center in Turkey, March 2016.\n\nISIL took responsibility for a stabbing that killed a French police officer and his companion in France, June 2016.\n\n29-year-old Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in a mass shooting inside Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida in United State, June 2016.\n\nBetween November 2 and 3, five were killed in Stadttempel, Vienna, including the perpetrator. The Vienna Police Department confirmed that the attacker was an Islamic State sympathiser, and that the attack was motivated by Islamic extremism. This happened in Austria, November 2020.\n\nIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant targeted Shia Muslims on 21 January 2021 in a clothing market in Tayaran Square, Baghdad. US, UN, EU and the Pope condemn the attack calling it a senseless act of violence. Iraq, January 2021\n\nAttacks where everywhere \u2013 United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain, Canada, etc \u2013 which were dated to 2021.\n\nHowever, with the above references and many more, should we now conclude just like Mr Mike, that all these attacks are on Christians, and every President in the attacked country supports religion intolerance?\n\nIt is obvious that Mike Pompeo\u2019s statements were borne out of hatred for the Islamic religion. It is important for him to realize that words are powerful. If he has any problem with the Islamic religion, he should keep it to himself and not sow seeds of discord in other countries. If he has nothing good to say about the country, it will be in his best interest to keep silent on the matter and focus on his own country.\n\nAt the end of his article, Mike Pompeo issued several lame threats to the federal government of the country. He stated that if the Nigerian government failed to carry out swift actions to put an end to the persecution of Christians, there would be consequences in the form of sanctions and increased diplomatic pressure.\n\nThe Buhari-led administration has been working tirelessly to safeguard the lives and properties of all Nigerian citizens no matter the religion you practice. It is an insult on Mike Pompeo\u2019s part to disregard the efforts put in by the current administration and try to create unnecessary agitation in the country.\n\nAt this point, sanctions and diplomatic pressure isn\u2019t what Nigeria needs. What the country needs is support from other countries. Mike Pompeo would do well to call for support in the country rather that criticize its leaders and proclaim unnecessary threats.\n\nPresident Buhari is efficiently leading the fight against insecurity in Nigeria along with the service chiefs and the Nigerian Military. Let us all join hands to support them rather than throw incessant criticisms at them.\n\nAdadu is a student of peace and conflict resolution and wrote from Gwarimpa",

          "text": "Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi, says his people have no land to give out for cattle ranching.\n\nGovernor Umahi stated this on Monday evening while appearing as a guest on Channels Television\u2019s \u2018Politics Today\u2019.\n\nUmahi said each state in the South-East already has laws banning open grazing and as such, it is way off as he is a servant to his people.\n\n\u201cThis is not about the governors, it is about the people, so, whatever position the people take in this regard, that is what will happen. There is no land in this regard that is not owned by individuals, corporate bodies.\n\n\u201cSo, this is beyond governors and that is the truth. People calling governors are making a very grievous mistake. Even if I say as a governor in South-East, I want people from this village, I want you to donate this land, the question is: will they allow it?\n\n\u201cI have heard about three communal crisis in my state, and it is all about land. There is a place that I am building a medical university and the people of that village, for a project that is almost completed, went and brought it down. They prefer to have their farms than a medical college. So, the land is a different ball game altogether,\u201d Umahi stated when asked whether he would provide land for ranching as a governor.\n\nREAD ALSO: Herders\u2019 Threat: What Is Going On In Nigeria Is Unconstitutional, Clark Tells Buhari\n\nSpeaking further Umahi noted that his people have \u201csaid they have no land for ranching. They put me where I am. If I have one acre of land and I am talking about giving land for ranching, I should be talking about that particular land. I can\u2019t be talking about somebody\u2019s land. Yes, constitutionally, I have control over the land but you have to kill all the people to get the land.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the year, Southern Governors banned open grazing of cattle across states in the region and urged the President to address Nigerians on the state of the nation.\n\nThe governors also called for the restructuring of the country to address increasing agitations in different parts of the nation, while restating their commitment to the unity of the country.\n\nIn reaction to the ban, the presidency said the governors failed to provide any solution to the lingering crisis between farmers and herders in the country.\n\nSeeking to profer the needed solution, President Muhammadu Buhari in a recent interview stated that the government will return to a practice in which herders will ply designated grazing routes across the country.\n\nThe President said the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, has been asked to begin the process to see how these routes can be legally put back to use, a directive which has not gone down with many Nigerians, with some claiming that the insistence on open grazing points to a hidden agenda.",

          "text": "Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Monday raised an alarm over the rate at which the All Progressives Congress (APC) is borrowing money to fund projects in the country.\n\nThis formed part of the resolutions reached at the end of the meeting of the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum held in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom State capital.\n\n\u201cMoney should only be borrowed for productive purposes as Nigeria\u2019s current debt of over N36 trillion is becoming clearly unsustainable relative to our earnings and GDP.\n\n\u201cWe should not saddle incoming generations with an undue debt burden. The borrowing spree of the APC administration if unchecked will certainly lead Nigeria into avoidable bankruptcy,\u201d a communique issued at the end of the meeting read in part.\n\nThe governors decried that the debt profile of Nigeria with over 80 per cent of normal appropriation spent on debt servicing was rising and becoming uncontrollable.\n\nThey stated that all the gains of the PDP government under former President Olusegun Obasanjo when the nation exited its foreign debt obligations had been destroyed.\n\nREAD ALSO: JAMB Asks Applicants To Complete UTME Registration By Tuesday\n\nThe governors accused the present administration of borrowing for frivolous items, stressing that such an action was scandalous.\n\nThey faulted the operational system and methods of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) which they claimed was functioning as an independent government-within-a-government.\n\n\u201cA situation where CBN creates money, decides how much of it to spend, on what to spend it on without any form of controls or supervision is patently subversive of our constitutional order.\n\n\u201cIt has become not just a leviathan, but also a Father Christmas of sorts, dabbling into every sphere and scope of governmental activity, not just as a lender of last resort, but as a full executing agency of government,\u201d the communique read.\n\nIt added, \u201cThe meeting observed that the CBN has become such an octopus that it threatens state governments publicly, without decorum, about sanctions on any attempt to question its Modus Operandi. The CBN should take immediate steps to halt the depreciation of the naira.\u201d\n\nTackling Insecurity\n\nThe governors also called for the decentralisation of the operations of the security apparatus of the state, even within the existing legal framework.\n\nThey explained that the move became necessary in the face of the disturbing spate of insecurity in the land, to ensure the input of local operators in state and local governments in policing and security.\n\nThe governors decried that President Muhammadu Buhari seemed not to be aware that the coercive instruments of state security were firmly within his hands and not the governors, considering his recent media interview on the subject.\n\nThey reminded the President that he has ultimate authority under the Constitution over the security organisations, even though the states have a role to play.\n\nThe leaders believe cooperation and synergy between states and the Federal Government in security operations were critical in securing the nation and its people.\n\nThey stated that despite being on the Exclusive List, the states spend huge sums of money to support the police and other security agencies to carry out their duties.\n\nThe governors called on the National Assembly to expedite action in passing the Electoral Act and Constitution amendments to ensure restructuring and decentralisation of governmental powers and functions.\n\nRead the communique issued at the end of the meeting below:",

A clear example is how social media was used to drive police accountability in the #EndSARs protests last year.\n\nThey lamented that the Nigerian authorities have also set plans in motion to force social media platforms to register in Nigeria and comply with local regulations before they are licensed to operate.\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian authorities have continued to propose laws to regulate the social media, and restrict the rights to freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom, including through legislative bills popularly known as the \u2018Hate Speech Bill\u2019 and \u2018The Social Media Bill\u2019 which both provide severe punitive sanctions such as the death penalty in some cases, for social media users convicted of \u201ccrimes\u201d provided under them,\u201d they added.\n\nThe civil groups said the suspension of Twitter in Nigeria is inconsistent and incompatible with the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 (as amended) and the country\u2019s international human rights obligations including under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights.\n\nThe statement was jointly signed by Amnesty International Nigeria; CISLAC (Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre); Global Rights; Nigeria Mourns; Business and Human Rights Roundtable; Tap Initiative for citizens development; Civil society consortium on civic space; Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD); Alliances for Africa; WILPF Nigeria; Echoes of Women in Africa Initiatives; Akubeze Okocha; B.E.E Initiative; Access to Justice; Sterling Centre for Law & Development; Concerned Nigerians; JENNON-PIUS &Co initiative; Education as a Vaccine; Invictus Africa; Dinidari Foundation; Raising New Voices Initiative; Centre for Impact Advocacy (CIA); Stand To End Rape Initiative (STER); BudgIT; The Interactive Initiative for Social Impact; Enough is Enough (EiE); Yiaga Africa; among others.",

          "title": "UK PM Johnson Delays Lockdown Easing for England by 4 Weeks",
          "text": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed Monday that the next planned relaxation of coronavirus restrictions in England will be delayed by four weeks, until July 19, as a result of the spread of the delta variant.\n\nIn a press briefing, Johnson voiced his confidence that he won\u2019t need to delay the plan to lift restrictions on social contact further, as millions more people get fully vaccinated against the virus. He said that by July 19, two-thirds of the British population will have been double-vaccinated.\n\n\u201cI think it is sensible to wait just a little longer,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is the time to ease off the accelerator, because by being cautious now we have the chance in the next four weeks to save many thousands of lives by vaccinating millions more people.\u201d\n\nAccompanying the decision to delay the easing, Johnson said the government has brought forward the date by which everyone over the age of 18 will be offered a first dose of vaccine, from the end of July to July 19.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unmistakably clear the vaccines are working and the sheer scale of the vaccine roll out has made our position incomparably better than in previous waves,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder the government\u2019s plan for coming out of lockdown, all restrictions on social contact were set to be lifted next Monday. Many businesses, particularly those in hospitality and entertainment, voiced their disappointment ahead of the official announcement.\n\nThe delta variant first found in India is estimated by scientists advising the government to be between 40% and 80% more transmissible than the previous dominant strain. It now accounts for more than 90% of infections in the U.K.\n\nWhen Johnson first outlined the government\u2019s four-stage plan for lifting the lockdown in England in February, he set June 21 as the earliest date by which restrictions on people gathering would be lifted. However, he stressed at the time that the timetable was not carved in stone and that all the steps would be driven by \u201cdata not dates\u201d and would seek to be \u201cirreversible.\u201d\n\nThe speed at which new coronavirus infections have been rising had piled the pressure on Johnson to delay the reopening so more people can get vaccinated.\n\nOn Monday, the British government reported 7,742 new confirmed cases, one of the highest daily numbers since the end of February. Daily infections have increased threefold over the past few weeks but are still way down from the nearly 70,000 daily cases recorded in January.\n\nMany blame the Conservative government for the spike in infections, saying it acted too slowly to impose the strictest quarantine requirements on everyone arriving from India, which has endured a catastrophic resurgence of the virus.\n\nAcross Europe, many countries, including France, have tightened restrictions for British travelers to prevent the delta variant from spreading. Others, like Spain, are allowing British tourists to arrive without being required to take a test if they have been fully vaccinated.\n\nDespite concerns about the delta variant, the U.K.\u2019s vaccine rollout has won plaudits as one of the world\u2019s speediest and most coherent. As of Monday, around 62% of the British population had received one shot, while about 45% had got two jabs.\n\nThe rapid rollout of vaccines and a strict months-long lockdown helped drive down the number of virus-related deaths in the U.K. in recent months. Despite that, the country has recorded nearly 128,000 virus-related deaths, more than any other nation in Europe.",

          "title": "NATO Leaders Declare China a Global Security Challenge",
          "text": "NATO leaders on Monday declared China a constant security challenge and said the Chinese are working to undermine global order, a message in sync with President Joe Biden\u2019s efforts to get allies to speak out with a more unified voice against China\u2019s trade, military and human rights practices.\n\nIn a summit statement, the leaders said that China\u2019s goals and \u201cassertive behavior present systemic challenges to the rules-based international order and to areas relevant to alliance security.\u201d\n\nWhile the 30 heads of state and government avoided calling China a rival, they expressed concern about what they said were its \u201ccoercive policies,\u201d the opaque ways it is modernizing its armed forces and its use of disinformation.\n\nThey called on Beijing to uphold its international commitments and to act responsibly in the international system.\n\nBiden, who arrived at the summit after three days of consulting with Group of Seven allies in England, pushed for the G-7 communique there that called out what it said were forced labor practices and other human rights violations impacting Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in the western Xinjiang province. The president said he was satisfied with the communique, although differences remain among the allies about how forcefully to criticize Beijing.\n\nBiden has also used his eight-day trip to Europe to urge allies to work more closely in pressing Russian President Vladimir Putin over his government\u2019s treatment of political dissidents and to do more to stem cyber attacks originating from Russia that have targeted private companies and governments around the globe.\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an alliance of European and North American countries formed after World War II as a bulwark against Russian aggression.\n\nThe new Brussels communique states plainly that the NATO nations \u201cwill engage China with a view to defending the security interests of the alliance.\u201d\n\nBut as Biden faced with the G-7 communique, some allies bristled at the NATO effort to speak out on China.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said NATO\u2019s decision to name China as a threat \u201cshouldn\u2019t be overstated\u201d because Beijing, like Russia, is also a partner in some areas. China is Germany\u2019s top trading partner and is heavily dependent on Russia in fulfilling the country\u2019s energy needs.\n\nMerkel noted that \u201cwhen you look at the cyber threats, the hybrid threats, when you look at the cooperation between Russia and China, you can\u2019t just ignore China.\u201d\n\nBut she added that it was important to \u201cfind the right balance\u201d as China is also a partner on many issues.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very important, just like we do in Russia, to always make the offer of political discussions, political discourse, in order to come up with solutions,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cBut where there are threats, and I said they\u2019re in the hybrid field too, then as NATO you have to be prepared.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron urged the alliance not to let China distract it from what he saw as more pressing issues facing NATO, including the fight against terrorism and security issues related to Russia.\n\n\u201cI think it is very important not to scatter our efforts and not to have biases in our relation to China,\u201d Macron said.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy to the United Kingdom on Monday issued a statement saying the G-7 communique \u201cdeliberately slandered China and arbitrarily interfered in China\u2019s internal affairs,\u201d and exposed the \u201csinister intentions of a few countries, such as the United States.\u201d There was no immediate reaction from the Chinese government to the new NATO statement.\n\nBiden arrived at his first NATO summit as president as leading members declared it a pivotal moment for an alliance beleaguered during the presidency of Donald Trump, who questioned the relevance of the multilateral organization.\n\nShortly after arriving at the alliance\u2019s headquarters for the first NATO summit of his presidency, Biden sat down with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and underscored the U.S. commitment to Article 5 of the alliance charter, which spells out that an attack on one member is an attack on all and is to be met with a collective response.\n\n\u201cArticle 5 we take as a sacred obligation,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI want NATO to know America is there.\u201d\n\nIt was a sharp shift in tone from the past four years, when Trump called the alliance \u201cobsolete\u201d and complained that it allowed for \u201cglobal freeloading\u201d countries to spend less on military defense at the expense of the U.S.\n\nBiden was greeted by fellow leaders with warmth and even a bit of relief.\n\nBelgium Prime Minister Alexander de Croo said Biden\u2019s presence \u201cemphasizes the renewal of the transatlantic partnership.\u201d De Croo said NATO allies were looking to get beyond four stormy years under the Trump administration and infighting among member countries.\n\n\u201cI think now we are ready to turn the page,\u201d de Croo said.\n\nTrump routinely berated other NATO countries for not spending enough on defense and even threatened to pull the U.S. out of the world\u2019s biggest security organization and even questioned the mutual defense provision of the NATO charter, a central tenet of the alliance.\n\nThe alliance also updated Article 5 to offer greater clarity on how the alliance should react to major cyber attacks \u2014 a matter of growing concern amid hacks targeting the U.S. government and businesses around the globe by Russia-based hackers.\n\nBeyond extending the potential use of the Article 5 mutual defense clause to space, the leaders also broadened the definition of what might constitute such an attack in cyberspace, in a warning to any adversary that might use constant low-level attacks as a tactic.\n\nThe organization declared in 2014 that a cyber attack could be met by a collective response by all 30 member countries, but on Monday they said that \u201cthe impact of significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed attack.\u201d\n\nThe president started his day meeting with leaders of the Baltic states on NATO\u2019s eastern flank as well as separate meetings with leaders of Poland and Romania to discuss the threat posed by Russia and the recent air piracy in Belarus, according to the White House.\n\nBiden\u2019s itinerary in Europe has been shaped so that he would first gather with G-7 leaders and then with NATO allies in Brussels before his much-anticipated meeting with Putin in Geneva on Wednesday.\n\nBiden met on Monday evening with Turkey\u2019s president, Erdogan, on the summit sidelines.\n\nBiden has known Erdogan for years but their relationship has frequently been contentious. Biden, during his campaign, drew ire from Turkish officials after he described Erdogan as an \u201cautocrat.\u201d In April, Biden infuriated Ankara by declaring that the Ottoman-era mass killing and deportations of Armenians was \u201cgenocide\u201d \u2014 a term that U.S. presidents have avoided using.\n\nIn a brief exchange with reporters, Biden described it as a \u201cvery good meeting.\u201d He and Erdogan met privately before being joined by other officials. They spent in total more than an hour together.",
