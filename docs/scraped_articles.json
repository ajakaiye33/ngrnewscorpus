          "title": "Insecurity: Internal wranglings in military hierarchy impeding war against insurgency, criminality \u2014 CSOs allege",
          "text": ".\n\nA coalition of Civil Society Organisations and Non-governmental Organisations have given insights into why the war against insurgency and other violent crimes is persisting in the country despite huge support given to security agencies by the Federal Government.\n\nAccording to the groups, unless urgent steps are taken to resolve internal wranglings in the military architecture and strengthen the Defence Intelligence Agency, the challenge of insecurity may regrettably persist.\n\nA statement jointly signed by, Dr Aliyu Bello of Peace and Conflict Resolution Initiative and Ambassador Jude Uchenna of Alliance for Justice and Peace warned that the vow made by President Muhammadu Buhari not to hand over an unsecured nation to his successor may not be achieved if the perceived lapses are not checked.\n\n\u201cThis is the second time we as a group are making intervention over the issue of insecurity within a period of one month. Frankly, the war against insurgency has gotten to the soul of the country. It has no doubt threatened the corporate existence of Nigeria. Almost every day, reports of attacks by BokoHaram/ ISWAP on communities dominate media reportage. There has been a display of bravado by the terrorists in recent times by attacking military bases or formations.\n\n\u201cThe government of President Muhammadu Buhari has vowed not to hand over an insecure nation to his successor. He has matched words with action by purchasing a lot of military soft and hardware. It is safe to say, at the moment the military does not lack the sophistication to crush the terrorists. The President, through the ministry of Justice, sought and obtained an order of court declaring bandits terrorists and anyone associated with them or found, encouraging or financing them. This is a great chapter in the war against insurgency and criminality in the country. It is convenient to state that President Buhari has provided all moral, financial, legal support and body language, needed to end insurgency in the country\u201d, the statement noted.\n\nHowever, the group stressed that the efforts were not giving the desired result because of the failure of the Defence Intelligence Agency in providing links that will lead the troops as well as rancour within the military hierarchy.\n\n\u201cThe attacks on military formations and some communities makes one begin to question the Defence Intelligence Agency strategy of intelligence gathering considering the fact that the agency is vested with the responsibility to provide an efficient system of obtaining military intelligence for the Nigerian Armed Forces and Ministry of Defence and enhance military cooperation with other countries, protect the lives of Nigerian citizens, and maintain the territorial integrity of Nigeria. Blame must be squarely put at their doorstep for failure to provide the best intelligence possible to deal with the terrorists.\n\n\u201cVery importantly, there is sabotage even within the military and other security agencies involved in the war against terrorism. There seem to be ill feelings within the ranks of the military as a result of the violation of the seniority and ranking order of appointing heads of formations.\n\n\u201cThe head of the Chief of Army Staff and the head of Defence Intelligence Agency are of course 37. With these appointments, all seniors in the intelligence unit, especially in the army have been moved to the Army Resource Center. This has relegated the experience of the members of the course 36 participants. This is seen as a grave injustice to course 36 and capable of nurturing sabotage and even mutiny\u201d the statement added.\n\nIt further urged President Muhammadu Buhari to look inward and right some of these wrongs raised, stressing that they are fundamental lapses that should not be allowed in the military especially within the intelligence unit.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari must urgently sack the Chief of Army Staff and head of Defence Intelligence Agency and overhaul the entire unit with the right appointments made\u201d.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": ".. Says power sector at dawn of a new era\n\n\u2026Assures investors enabling environment to thrive\n\nBy Chris Ochayi\n\nThe Federal Government, Thursday, declared that the partnership between the country and the Siemens in the power sector would expand Nigeria\u2019s electricity capacity from the current 4,500MW to 25,000MW.\n\nMinister of Power, Engr. Abubakar D. Aliyu, who made the remarks ,while speaking as Special Guest of honour at the annual workshop of the Power Correspondents Association of Nigeria, PCAN, in Abuja, noted the country was at the dawn of a new era in the power sector.\n\nThe minister noted that the plan of Government is to ensure that all players focus on the big picture with a proper alignment to achieve the desired growth.\n\nSpeaking further at the workshop with theme: \u2018Moving the Power Sector Beyond the Transition Electricity Market\u2019, Engr. Aliyu said, the primary purpose of Government is to develop policies and laws and to properly orient the players.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cOne of my cardinal goals, on assumption of office, is to reduce or totally eliminate the human factor issues limiting the growth of the sector. It is important to note, as I have observed. that the viability of the sector is not in doubt.\n\n\u201cWe just need to boldly deal with some challenges militating against the desired growth, some of which are Transmission and Distribution bottlenecks, funding difficulties,Transmission wheeling inadequacy,old and dilapidated distributioninfrastructure.\n\n\u201cOthers are confidence in the electricity market, energy losses,non-payment of electricity bills and lack of transparency within sector players, among others.\n\n\u201cGovernment is doing a lot in providing the needed infrastructure and is also being supported by multilateral partners like World Bank, AFDB, AFB and others. These support structures, plus the intervention fund from CBN, will go along way in addressing some of these infrastructure gaps.\n\n\u201cA proper implementation of all planned and ongoing projects will increase the electricity availability and quality.\n\n\u201cTo achieve the desired quick wins, Government launched the Power Sector Reform Plan (PSRP) to strengthen the Regulatory Agency, NERC, among other things, a properly monitored Performance Improvement Plans (PIP) to track progress of the Distribution Companies and a Transmission Rehabilitation and Expansion Program (TREP) to strengthen the wheeling capacity of TCN.\n\nThese efforts are geared towards ensuring that they earnings and desires of Nigerians are met as regards steady and reliable power supply.\n\n\u201cGentlemen of the Press, Reform processes all over the world are cumbersome and take time. This Government has initiated some transformational changes that will on the long run improve the quality of electricity in Nigeria and improve access. I can confidently tell you that with the efforts we have put in, and still putting in, we are at the dawn of a new era in the power sector in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOne significant effort the Muhammad Buhari\u2019s administration has put in is the Siemens Nigeria and the Federal Government\u2019s deal; this partnership seeks to expand Nigeria\u2019s electricity capacity from the current 4,500MW to 25,000MW.\n\nThe Presidential Power Initiative (PPI) which began in 2021 is in three phases and is estimated to be completed in 2025. The phases cover the upgrading and expanding the TN and Discos networks, improvement of access to affordable, efficient and reliable electricity and, providing support of industrial and economic growth in the country.\n\n\u201cThis first phase which began in 2021 will go on for a period of 10 months with the end goal of pushing to 7,000MW. So far, there has been no hitch as the team is currently on the pre-engineering phase. The second phase will raise the availability to 1,000MW and the third phase will raise the availability to 25,000MW.\n\n\u201cGiven Siemens AG\u2019s accomplishment of a similar plan in Egypt and also, its reputation as an international giant in the power sector related engagements, it is strongly believed that the Nigeria Electricity Road map (NER) is possible and achievable. \u201c\n\nIn his remarks, the Chairman of the occasion and the Minister of State for Power, Goddy Jedy-Agba , has assured all investors and would-be investors in that power sector that the government will continue to create favourable policies and business \u2013 friendly environments for their investments to thrive.\n\nJedy Agba stressed further that the President Muhammad Buhari\u2019s administration has introduced many favourable policies to water the ground for our partners.\n\nHe added that, \u201cWe want the media promote these policies so investors can know that truly, Nigeria is the investment hub of Africa.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe media is the strongest tool of any democracy. It has the power to mar or make any society.\n\n\u201cTherefore, I want to encourage you also to be good citizens and passionate development partners by inculcating the virtue of responsible Journalism.\n\n\u201cNo meaningful development can be achieved without the support of the media. If the people don\u2019t get to know what the government is doing and can\u2019t take ownership of our projects, then our efforts would be in futility. This is why the importance of the media cannot be overemphasized.\n\n\u201cI want to stress here that as power correspondents, you owe it a duty to factually project the reformation going on in the power sector. In areas where you need clarification, contact relevant authorities because as insiders, you are supposed to be more accurate with your reportage concerning the sector than others.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a government, we will continue to create an enabling environment for private investors to thrive in the power sector. We understand that government can\u2019t do it all, this is why we\u2019ve opened the vista for more people to invest in the sector.\u201d\n\nIn his welcome address, the Chairman of the Power Correspondents Association of Nigeria, PCAN, Mr. Obas Esiedesa, regretted that eight years after the partial power privatization exercise, the teething problems remain.\n\nNoting that all hands must be on deck to resolve them, Mr. Esiedesa added however that the challenges are enormous and cut across the entire value chain of the industry.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cFor us as journalists, we would continue to support the sector with our works to ensure that the right things are done and consumers are able to get best value for money.\n\n\u201cFor long, the industry has been stuck in the transition stage, we want it to move beyond this and go into the willing-seller, willing-buyer state, where free market rules will apply.\u201d",

Says power sector at dawn of a new era\u2026Assures investors enabling environment to thriveBy Chris OchayiThe Federal Government, Thursday, declared that the partnership between the country and the Siemens in the power sector would expand Nigeria\u2019s electricity capacity from the current 4,500MW to 25,000MW.\nSpeaking further at the workshop with theme: \u2018Moving the Power Sector Beyond the Transition Electricity Market\u2019, Engr.\n\u201cOthers are confidence in the electricity market, energy losses,non-payment of electricity bills and lack of transparency within sector players, among others.\n\u201cOne significant effort the Muhammad Buhari\u2019s administration has put in is the Siemens Nigeria and the Federal Government\u2019s deal; this partnership seeks to expand Nigeria\u2019s electricity capacity from the current 4,500MW to 25,000MW.\n\u201cI want to stress here that as power correspondents, you owe it a duty to factually project the reformation going on in the power sector.",

This is a clear characteristic of a leader that has run out of steam.\n\n\u201cThe Northern Youth Council of Nigeria is a constraint to call on President Muhammadu Buhari to humbly resign since it is obvious that he has run out of idea on how to subdue the terrorists that have taken over significant parts of Sokoto, Katsina, Kebbi, Niger, Zamfara states and the busiest Kaduna-Abuja expressway on one side, and recently, the daring moves attacks by Boko Haram/ISWAP which has continued unabated.\u201d\n\nIn the alternative, where he fails to eat the humble pie, the youths called on the National Assembly to expedite action and initiate processes of impeachment against the President, assuring that Nigerians would certainly stand with them and will equally help in redeeming their damaged reputation.\n\nThe youths quickly alerted that where the above recommendation fails, Nigerians should do everything possible to defend themselves, saying, \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to watch anarchists reign supreme over us, while we seat like cowards to be killed.

          "text": "A secessionist group, Biafra National Guard (BNG), has cautioned the Ralph Uwazuruike-led Biafra Independent Movement (BIM) not to play politics with the 19 members of the group recently released by the court after 15 years of incarceration.\n\nThe BNG also threatened to deal decisively with anyone or any group of persons that indulge in trading with its name for selfish and financial aggrandisements.\n\nThis was coming against the backdrop of the reported claim that the 19 BNG members, including the wife of its leader, Innocent Orji, are members of the BIM.\n\nDAILY POST also recalls that the said members were incarcerated in the Federal Correctional Centre in Onitsha for over 15 years on the accusation of violent agitation for Biafra.\n\nHowever, the BNG, in a statement by its spokesman, Agwu Francis, on Friday, disclosed that it took them three years to force the release of her members, who are not guilty of any known crime under local and international laws.\n\nThe pro-Biafra group also said while it was fighting for their release, the BIM did not ask questions or render any form of financial support, noting that its leader did all that was within and outside his powers to force the freedom of the members.\n\nIt further opined that it is not against any form of compensation to her members by the Nigerian government but the compensatory process must go through the defence counsel of its members freed by the court, C. I Mezie.\n\n\u201cIt has come to the notice that some unscrupulous elements who claimed 19 members of BNG-prisoners of conscience including the wife of Genera Innocent Orji are members of MASSOB or BIM-MASSOB and that gave them right to speak on their behalf or arrange a backdoor compensation.\n\n\u201cThese are men without shame. Our members have been incarcerated for more than 15 years without any of them asking questions or sending any form of support. For more than 15 years, MASSOB or BIM did not ask any question while boasting that BNG is toothless and that was why over 19 of our members were then still incarcerated.\n\n\u201cMASSOB and BIM have been boasting over the years that they have no single members of their groups left in detention while giving their respective leaders praises. BNG was scorned; abused and booed because our leader General Innocent Orji was incarcerated along with our 19 members. These unscrupulous elements worked against the release of our members. Supported election when we opposed it shamelessly wants to do money business with our members.\n\n\u201cIt took three years of Innocent Orji\u2019s freedom to force the release of these members of BNG who committed no known crimes under any local and international laws. The commander of BNG did all that was within and outside his powers with monumental sacrifices to force the freedom of our members. General Innocent Orji singlehandedly funded the defence team; paid for publicity and everything needed to be paid while in detention and when he was released. He showed exemplary leadership worthy of emulation for history to judge.\n\n\u201cToday, unknown elements are claiming members of BNG are their members so as to use our members and enrich their pockets. With the anger of what we have lost, the years wasted and the pains of oppression; BNG will devastatingly strike anyone that dares to use members of BNG to play money politics.\n\n\u201cBNG is therefore warning agents meeting and consulting politicians for compensation of our members. It is crucial to also categorically state that BNG has nothing to do with MASSOB or BIM-MASSOB and we will decisively deal with any group misleading or playing unhealthy politics with our members to enrich their pockets in the name of compensation.\n\n\u201cBNG is warning all politicians; within and outside Biafra to stay away from wrong channels if they truly want to work towards compensating our members. We don\u2019t oppose the compensation of our members, but any compensation must go through C.I. Meze, our defence counsel who suffered for our members.\n\n\u201cCompensate is a post legal affair and the power of attorney given to C. I Mezie remains valid and puts him in the position of negotiation. BNG is not yet aware of any compensation and our defence counsel have not informed us about any compensation. BNG will vehemently deal with anyone found to use or using our members to organize a backdoor,\u201d the BNG stated.",

          "text": "A group, Concerned Moriki Indigenes in Zamfara State, led by its Chairman, Alhaji Salisu Muhammad Moriki, has written an open letter to President Muhammadu Buhari over the worsening security situation in Moriki and neighbouring towns.\n\nAccording to the letter, the group raised serious concerns that over 100 houses have been invaded by bandits in Moriki town in the Zurmi Local Government Area of the state, saying that the road has become a death zone for commuters.\n\nThe group lamented that for over a month now, there have been incessant attacks that call for a well-coordinated security network.\n\n\u201cWe want to let you know that in the last one month, Moriki town has come under the control and influence of bandits raging havoc to residents via kidnap, killing and all sort of terrorism with no effort from the security operatives to curb the constant menace.\n\n\u201cMore than a hundred houses have been invaded by bandits within a month. We have been carved out from the rest of the state and country at large because the road to Moriki is now impassable. it has been taken over by bandits and their cohorts.\n\n\u201cFrom Kaura to Moriki to Shinkafi have become a dead zone for motorists and residents. There\u2019s no day bandits would not attack either the road, towns or both with no resistance from security personnel. The road has been deserted by motorists and other lawful users.\n\n\u201cThese days, it is hard to have commercial vehicles that would carry passengers from Kaura to Moriki to Shinkafi for fear of being killed or kidnapped by bandits.\n\n\u201cThe bandits are having field days in this road because they now operate at any time of the day. They operate in the morning, afternoon, evening or in night, depending on when they wish to. They are now the unofficial custodians of this road.\n\n\u201cThey have taken several days operating along Kaura \u2013 Moriki \u2013 Shinkafa way very comfortably, kidnapping, maiming and killing innocent people at will. Moriki town and its environs have now become the bandits\u2019 centre for operations and other illicit activities.\n\n\u201cWithin a month, bandits have killed tens of people and kidnapped hundreds along Moriki \u2013 Shinkafi road. Some of the flashpoints of bandits\u2019 operation along this road include Gidan \u2018yan bita, Kwanar Boko, Hawan Bakwai, Dabin Jaya, Kwanar Jalaf, Junction to Shinkafi \u2013 Gidan Gobirawa. These are the most deadly spots.\n\n\u201cYour Excellency sir, as we are writing this letter to you, the health system of the entire Moriki town has collapsed as the General hospital has been deserted by the people like the relatives of the patients evacuated them for security reasons.\n\n\u201cThe people of this town are farmers and traders, but all their economic activities have been collapsed. They couldn\u2019t attend to their farms for fear of being killed or kidnapped and they couldn\u2019t visit the markets because bandits have taken over the road. They are now being confined and incarcerated in the town alone. While they couldn\u2019t go out of the town, they are also not safe in their houses.\n\n\u201cEconomic activities, education of our children are in the dying stage as all the government schools in the state have been closed for the whole academic year for the deteriorating security situation in the state. Our children have even forgotten the way to their schools because of the long time they have taken sitting at home.\n\n\u201cMr President, sir, in Moriki town, it has become usual for the bandits to operate in the town. They either kidnap or kill their victims almost on daily basis. Many indigenes, especially those who are not living there are being prevented from visiting their origin to see their parents and relatives for fear of being killed or kidnapped. If one is lucky to escape the road, he might not be lucky to come out from the town safely.\n\n\u201cBandits\u2019 attacks and kidnappings have now become the usual happenings in this axis while the otherwise is the unusual. I believe only our humble emir is left living there among the creams of the town. All those who have the opportunity have left the town to protect their lives.\n\n\u201cThe most annoying is that we are being abandoned and left with our fates. Our Senator, House of Reps and House of Assembly members, our minister of humanitarian affairs, who happens to be from our Local Government Area and other political appointees, nobody is saying anything.\n\n\u201cThe state government is out of idea as this phenomenon had gone beyond the confines of the states, we believe.

          "title": "We\u2019re not all gloom and doom, are we?, by Femi Adesina",
          "text": "Let\u2019s go down memory lane. In May, 2016, President Muhammadu Buhari had led the Nigerian delegation to London to attend the global anti-corruption summit being hosted by the then British Prime Minister, David Cameron.\n\nWe arrived London to the storm of reactions accompanying comments Cameron had made in a private conversation with the Queen of England, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, in which he described Nigeria as \u201cfantastically corrupt\u201d alongside some other countries. The PM did not know that his unofficial comments were being picked by a nearby television microphone.\n\nThe development played out while we were airborne from Nigeria to London, and after I had got the full perspectives of what happened, I went to brief our President. He listened carefully, as he usually does. He pondered for a while, and then asked me: \u201cDo you disagree with the Prime Minister? Are we not a fantastically corrupt country?\u201d He then laughed.\n\nThe next day, I was by no means surprised when a foreign journalist accosted our President, and asked:\n\n\u201cAre you embarrassed by what the Prime Minister said?\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nDeadpan, President Buhari replied: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nThe journalist went on.\n\n\u201cIs Nigeria fantastically corrupt?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d our President said.\n\nHoopla. Hullabaloo. Bedlam back home, from those who claimed President Buhari had gone to de-market Nigeria and Nigerians abroad. But that is the man from Daura for you. Straight as an arrow. He doesn\u2019t talk tongue-in-cheek. He says it as it is.\n\nHe had inherited a country badly suffused with corruption, polarized down the middle by forces of ethnicity, religion, and other divisive tendencies, and he was not going to gloss over the issues, whether at home or abroad.\n\nHe\u2019s painting us in bad light. He\u2019s washing our dirty linen in the public, some people began to shout. He says we\u2019re lazy, corrupt, indolent. He runs us down abroad. That was the noise of those initial years.\n\nAfter a while, with some moral rearmament done, the psyche of the average Nigerian refocused, corruption robustly fought, and still being fought, infrastructure work in full steam, the President changed tune and style. He felt it was time to begin to market the country, time to tell the Nigerian story as it now is, and to seek foreign direct investment, which every country needs.\n\nWhat did the naysayers then begin to say? Oh, he\u2019s painting a false picture of our country abroad. We do not merit the attention of investors. We are corrupt, insecure, docile, decrepit. We do not deserve the attention of any investor. They should let us be, we should remain the way we are, cabined, cribbed, consigned to the backwaters of development.\n\nCan you ever satisfy some people? Never! Head or tail, you won\u2019t win with them. All they want now is to tell the story of killings by insurgents, bandits, kidnappers, and other criminals. Are those things happening in the country? Yes, they are. But are those the only things happening in Nigeria? They keep quiet. As far as they are concerned, it\u2019s all doom and gloom in Nigeria, and there are no redeeming sides. True? False.\n\nDespite the crippling challenges, our country has good stories to tell. Renaissance of infrastructure; roads, bridges, rail, airports, and many more. A vast market attractive to investors, human capital, vast natural resources, ease of doing business, policies targeted at business growth, and many more.\n\nBut they say shhhhhhhh. Don\u2019t talk about it. Talk about those that bandits are killing daily. How insurgents take the battle to our towns and communities in the Northeast. How farmers and herders are in perpetual conflict nationwide. How students are kidnapped for ransom. How life is nasty, brutish and short.\n\nWhen President Buhari moves from Riyadh, to Paris, to Durban, in South Africa, to Dubai, and many more, doing nothing other than selling the potentials of Nigeria to the world, asking investors; \u201ccome here and prosper, and reap handsome returns,\u201d they say no. Not true. We are not worth anything. We are fantastically corrupt, bleeding on all sides, not worth anything. How duplicitous!\n\nOn Monday this week, I was on Channels Television, guest of Seun Okinbaloye on Politics Today. And he sought to know whether the peregrinations of our President was worth it, searching for investors, when some research statistics show that we were good for nothing as a foreign direct investment destination.\n\nI said to the contrary, Nigeria was quite attractive. The huge market, the natural resources, the human resource, emerging infrastructure, and many more. But the TV host kept reeling off statistics from a fringe research report that said Nigeria was not even among the first ten investment destinations of choice in Africa.\n\nI told him I doubted the parameters of the report he was quoting, and he challenged me to provide a better one. I promised to liaise with the relevant agencies of government, and I would provide more reliable data on the status of Nigeria.\n\nIn a matter of hours, the Buhari Media Organization, an independent advocacy group devoted to showcasing the good works of our President, came out with the facts and figures. See their statement, verbatim, on the status of Nigeria as an attractive investment destination:\n\n\u201cPresident Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s description of Nigeria as Africa\u2019s most viable and attractive investment destination is incontrovertible.\n\n\u201cAccording to the Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) in a statement on Monday in Abuja, the President\u2019s assertion is based strictly on verifiable facts.\n\n\u201cIn the statement signed by its Chairman Niyi Akinsiju and Secretary Cassidy Madueke, BMO said that apart from available facts and figures, there are also the factors of the country\u2019s endowment as well as the conscious efforts by the Buhari administration to improve on the country\u2019s investment climate.\n\n\u201cPresident Buhari\u2019s address at the trade and investment forum at Dubai Expo 2020 in which he argued that the country is the most viable and attractive investment destination is not different from what he had said at three other stopover events in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cHis sales pitch to potential foreign investors in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and previously in France and Saudi Arabia have centred around outlining how the business environment in the country is changing as a result of efforts to make it better.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the President saId in his sales pitch that , \u2018our location, our natural resources, our population, and our regulations are there for all to see.\u2019 He also provided some insight into policies, projects and programmes his administration introduced to support private sector investors.\n\n\u201cThis is not different from what he said about two weeks ago at a similar investment forum in Durban, South Africa, where he also argued that the country is putting in place fiscal, monetary and trade policies to support investments and investors in Agriculture, Mining, Telecommunications and Digital Economy, Banking and Financial services, Tourism, as well as Manufacturing.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore not surprising that ABSA, one of Africa\u2019s largest financial services group named Nigeria among the continent\u2019s most attractive foreign direct investment destinations in its recent Africa Financial Markets Index 2021 (AAFMI)\u201d.\n\nBMO said it was shocking that at the time President Buhari was pitching the country as the most attractive place to invest, some people went to town with a questionable ranking of FDI in Africa.\n\n\u201cWe noticed how some unpatriotic Nigerians gleefully shared the questionable data on FDI in Africa from a small, unknown investment bank in South Africa, same time that the President was providing verifiable information on Nigeria.\n\n\u201cBut we want to point Nigerians in the direction of the 2021 AAFMI, posted on the website of one of Africa\u2019s foremost financial service companies which clearly showed that the Buhari administration has not been sleeping on the wheel as far as opening up the economy to foreign investors is concerned.\n\n\u201cThe research done in collaboration with the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) showed Nigeria in third place behind South Africa which retained the top spot for the third year running, and Mauritius\n\n\u201cAnd unlike what is being bandied around, the ABSA group outlined the parameters used, as well as country-by-country performance on a scale of 0-100: So this is how Nigeria fared- \u2018market depth, 62; access to foreign exchange, 20; market transparency, tax and regulatory environment, 86; capacity of local investors, 44; macroeconomic opportunities, 69 and enforceability of standard master agreement, 100.\n\n\u201cWe should add that Nigeria has consistently risen on the AAFMI since its inception in 2017 when it was ranked 6th, mainly because of the success of the Ease of doing Business regime and we also expect further improvement once the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) goes into operation next year.\u201d\n\nThe group urged Nigerians to always ignore doomsday scenarios regularly painted in social media platforms by those who cannot separate politics from reality.\n\n\u201cThe financial services group said in the report that Nigeria\u2019s official borrowing is relatively low at 8.4% of GDP, compared to other countries on the continent and it was emphatic that the country is not at risk of debt distress.\n\n\u201cCountries considered as high risk are Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya and Zambia; while those on the moderate risk threshold are C\u00f4te D\u2019 Ivoire, Lesotho, Malawi, Rwanda, Senegal and Uganda.\n\n\u201cBut generally, the report noted that Nigeria has \u2018continued to make strides in creating an enabling investment environment for foreign investors, with the necessary regulatory developments and policy initiatives.\u2019\n\n\u201cSo contrary to naysayers, the Buhari administration has been steadily and surely removing the bottlenecks that had been negatively impacting the country\u2019s FDI drive\u201d.\n\nThe group reassured Nigerians that the government will not relent until the country becomes the ultimate destination for foreign investment in Africa.\n\nNow, who has believed our report, and to whom has the hand of the Lord been revealed? Yes, which would you believe, and disseminate widely? Doomsday reports by shadowy groups, or scientific and well grounded ones? Whichever you embrace and share will determine your real attitude to your country. I keep saying it. Some people hate their country, hate fellow human beings, hate God, and even hate themselves. Pity!\n\nBut whether we believe or not does not stop the inexorable march of Nigeria to halcyon days, a season devoid of gore and blood, in which all the security challenges will become but a story told, and the land will flow with milk and honey once again. Believe, and be part of it.\n\n*Adesina is Special Adviser to President Buhari on Media and Publicity",

We need to come up with possible solutions to the problems of Nigeria, particularly as regards rising insecurity.

Kidnapper are everywhere and they don\u2019t only come out to kidnap but also to kill. So, you don\u2019t know who the next victim is going to be.\n\n\u201cWhy should these people be killing and hiding people in our territory without being challenged? Why should it be easy for them to hide people somewhere within the state and the security agencies in the state within few days or weeks will not be able to fish them out?\u201d he queried.\n\nThe CAN president, who is co-chairman of NIREC, thus, advocated intelligence gathering to tackle the challenge.\n\nHe advised Nigerians to volunteer information to security agencies so that the movement of criminals could be traced and apprehended ahead of time.\n\nThe Executive Secretary of NIREC, Rev.

          "text": "By Lukman Olabiyi\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, painted a graphic picture of how former Osun State governor, Chief Bisi Akande and his counterparts in the South west, with the exception of then Lagos State governor, Bola Tinubu, were politically ambushed by former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, in the 2003 poll.\n\nHe said the electoral \u2018massacre\u2019 masterminded by Obasanjo was what ended the second term ambition of Akande and others as incumbent governors of their various states.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars Click here to apply today .\n\nThe president described Obasanjo\u2019s tactic as diabolical double-cross.\n\nHe revealed this at the public presentation of autobiography of Akande: \u201cMy Participations\u201d at the Eko Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos.\n\n\u201cIt is common knowledge that Akande was the victim \u2013 along with other Alliance for Democracy (AD) governors, of a diabolical double-cross, which ended his gubernatorial career. Only the steadfast Asiwaju Bola Tinubu escaped the electoral massacre masterminded by President Obasanjo. Desperately disappointed though he was, and being a good Muslim, he accepted this setback as part of the trials of life. He looked to the future of service to the country,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari described Akande as a \u2018perfect public officer and the type of person he could go into the jungle with, saying he had retained his \u2018inflexible integrity in and out of public office, never accepting or offering bribes.\n\nThe president further described him as a decent, truthful and friendly person as well as an administrator of the first order, whose leadership qualities made him the unanimous choice as the first Chairman of the APC.\n\nBuhari narrated his first meeting with Akande, his passion for Nigeria, achievements, and disappointment as governor of Osun State as well as his many battles to wrest power from the then ruling party, the Peoples Democratic Party.\n\n\u201cMy first personal contact with Chief Akande was, if I recall correctly, in 2006 when preliminary consultations were coming to fruition for a grand coalition to unseat the PDP Government. Those efforts eventually came to nothing. Neither he nor I, nor many of our friends and associates gave up as, in Chief Akande\u2019s words: \u201cthe country was going down and down under PDP\u201d (p.396 of My Participations).\u201d .\n\nBuhari also narrated how Akande had risen to prominence from his participation in the Constituent Assembly established by then military government of General Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\n\u201cHe was always in the thick of things through the difficulties and political discontinuities of the 1980s and 90s. He emerged as Governor of Osun State in 1999 when the military handed over to the civilians.\n\n\u201cChief Akande had a horrendous baptism as governor of Osun State with discord from his own party; his State Assembly (including an attempt to impeach him without any reason whatsoever); from the trade unions and from his own deputy Governor!\n\n\u201cOn top of that, he inherited a deeply indebted Treasury, huge arrears of salary, allowances, and pensions. Enough challenges to overwhelm many aspiring leaders.\n\n\u201cBisi Akande stood four square and faced all the challenges head-on and overcame most of them. His first action was to stop payment of \u201ccritical allowances\u201d a euphemism for government money customarily shared by the big boys in Osun State. This set the tone of his administration\u201d the president said.\n\nNational leader of the APC, Bola Tinubu, said Chief Akande places high premium on integrity, straightforwardness and truthfulness and remains a hero and a figure so exemplary and excellent.\n\n\u201cBaba Akande represents what a public figure in Nigeria ought to be. He is what many should aspire to be.\u201d\n\nTinubu said that Akande\u2019s written record of the events, ideas and lessons of his profound life would serve to enlighten and educate both the present and the future.\n\nChairman of the occasion and Minister of Science, Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, said Akande\u2019s 82 years had been years of service to fellow human beings.\n\n\u201cHe always stood by what he believed in. His honesty spoke for him at all times. He was born poor but never allowed that to deter him.He became a politicians politician, but remained humble.\u201d\n\nLagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu also showered encomium on Akande for his leadership style and for also being a good role model to young ones.\n\nOsun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola described Chief Akande as a leader par excellence, who is always ready to give his best while in charge and always ready to give counsel, guidance and direction in familiar terrains, not afraid that his successors will surpass him.\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

You see, when we are making laws we have to look at all the factors. This is a country that when you are defeated in any primary you refuse to accept defeat. Now, imagine the number of our local government, 774. Imagine the number of wards, you now go to conduct primaries in all these wards, maybe for the president and after that the senate and the rest of the positions.\n\n\u201cEven if you are doing all of them in one day, expect petitions by the number of political parties times the number of wards.\n\n\u201cSo, it will just truncate our democracy; there is no doubt about that. Nobody has considered the amount of confusion that will arise out of that because everybody that contests election will like to go to court.\n\n\u201cAnd if I am contesting a particular office, I have to go to court if I am not happy over the election in the number of wards in my constituency. So, when will the litigation end? It is another ploy to derail democracy.\n\n\u201cSo, I want the National Assembly to look into this litigation aspect. When the cost of direct primaries is taken into consideration, it is going to be too much because for every ward that the court rules out, their must be a repeat of the exercise.\n\n\u201cSo, I think we have not got to that level of maturity, level of having the spirit of sportsmanship, level of accepting defeat. When people know that they have been defeated, they want to see if they can technically or fraudulently manipulate the system within the judiciary.\n\n\u201cSo I think that the issue of party primaries should be left to the political parties. This is not about APC or PDP, everybody is looking at the implication. So, let us take another look at it.\n\n\u201cSome people say governors have hijacked the primaries; is it not the governors that are at home every time? Do they not have representation in every unit? So, they are at home with the people, if you are not at home with the people how will the people know you?\n\n\u201cSome of you want to be governors, very soon, we shall not be governors any more but we are looking at what will bring stability to our democracy and sustain it. So, the National Assembly should take a deeper look at the application so that when it will start happening they will say we foresaw this and we advised against it,\u201d he said.\n\nProfessor Wushishi said he was in the state to thank the governor for his support to the council, which he said showed the governor\u2019s commitment to educational upliftment of the state.\n\n\u201cIt is evident that in the whole of the South East, it was only in Ebonyi State that our examinations were not disrupted during the nationwide EndSARS protest in 2020.\n\n\u201cAlso, as a result of your tremendous effort and involvement, Ebonyi State presented the highest number of candidates for this year\u2019s BECE not just in the South East but in the whole country with 22,011 candidates.\u201d\n\nLatest Jobs in Nigeria (Graduates/Non-graduates).

          "text": "*Chronicles how Osinbajo eventually emerged\n\n*Former gov attacks Adebanjo, Falae, others\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nFormer Governor of Osun state and ex-interim Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Bisi Akande, yesterday narrated how Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, as he then was, the presidential candidate of the party at the time, promised to pick Bola Tinubu as his running mate in the 2015 election.\n\nChronicling the events that led to the eventual selection of Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, Akande, in his autobiography, \u201cMy Participations\u201d, published by Gaskia Media Limited, disclosed how Buhari who was then under pressure to drop the former Lagos governor, later reneged on the agreement.\n\nIn the book which was launched in Lagos, the octogenarian also took a swipe at the trio of Ayo Adebanjo, Olu Falae and Sir Olaniwun Ajayi, coming short of accusing them of selecting themselves to represent the Yoruba people during Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s National Conference because of what he termed \u201cgenerous allowances.\u201d\n\nAkande stressed that despite the pledge to make Tinubu his vice presidential candidate, Buhari later faltered, saying that he only said that he wanted the former Lagos governor to \u201cpartner with him.\u201d\n\nBut the politician admitted that at the time Buhari was under enormous pressure, especially from some northern governors who insisted that a Muslim-Muslim ticket arrangement was a no-go area.\n\nHe revealed that it would be the second time that Tinubu would be getting very close to becoming a vice presidential candidate, noting that the first time was in when Atiku Abubakar, who was then contesting as president later chose Ben Obi.\n\nAkande confirmed that Tinubu was instrumental to the emergence of Osinbajo as running mate to Buhari after he was formally dropped and asked to submit three names from the South-west from which Buhari would pick one.\n\nAccording to the book, Buhari at a point during the formation of the APC started to admire Tinubu for his business acumen and his ability to organise people, key features that got then candidate Buhari close to the APC national leader.\n\n\u201cIn April 2014, I was in Abuja when Buhari called me and asked me to persuade Bola to run with him. Governor Masari was the one who came to call me. When I followed him into Buhari\u2019s private lobby, Bola Tinubu was already seated there.\n\n\u201cSo, when Buhari tabled the matter, I cautioned them that this must not get out beyond the four of us. \u2018How could he be talking of a running mate when he had not secured the ticket?\u201d I mused.\n\n\u201cI thought such information, if leaked to the general public, might affect the conduct of the party\u2019s congress at the presidential primaries, if not its choice of candidate. I thanked Buhari for thinking so highly of our friend.\n\n\u201cBola later told me that Buhari\u2019s emissaries had been coming to him, but he tried to dodge the gesture and not to show interest. We agreed that we would reopen the matter when Buhari had secured the ticket,\u201d he explained.\n\nHowever, he expressed surprise that thereafter, when Buhari became the party\u2019s candidate, things changed, with former APC chair, Odigie Oyegun, who was supported by Tinubu to become chairman of the party, asking for names from the geopolitical zones from where Buhari will pick his running mate.\n\n\u201cHe said it was from this list that Buhari would choose a running mate. I objected. I turned to Buhari. \u2018General, where are you choosing your running mate from?\u2019 He answered, \u2018The South-west.\u2019 \u2018Oh! I didn\u2019t know,\u2019Oyegun said. He apologised.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know why Oyegun made that proposition and at whose behest. As the chairman of the party, maybe some people pushed him to do that,\u201d he noted.\n\nAkande continued: \u201cThen, I called Buhari aside. \u2018Is our arrangement still standing?\u2019 I referred him to our discussion in April. He said yes! \u201c\n\nAccording to him some members of the party eventually agreed that a committee should be set up to search for Buhari\u2019s running , a move himself and former Governor of Edo state, Adams Oshiohmhole, opposed.\n\n\u201cAdams Oshiohmhole , then Governor of Edo State, stood up and said we were being dishonest. He said he was a serving governor and many of those in the Elders Committee had been governors.\n\n\u2018\u2019Did we set up a committee to give us our running mates?\u2019 He asked. \u2018It is not fair!\u2019 He further said what we were pushing was a dangerous act and that we should allow Buhari to choose his running mate. So, we left,\u201d he narrated\n\nAkande stated that he later came to know that some people constituted themselves into a group, called the Northern Interest Group, and they prevailed on Buhari not to allow a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nAccording to him, it was the following day after the Elders\u2019 Committee meeting which was deadlocked, that Buhari phoned Tinubu to give him three names from which he would pick a running mate.\n\n\u201cWe were all in Abuja and Tinubu rushed to me with this information. He wanted to know whether the understanding we reached with Buhari had changed. I called Buhari and he told me he now needed three names from us. I was angry with him.\n\n\u2018\u2018General, this was not what we agreed upon,\u2019 I said in annoyance. \u2018You are changing our agreement?\u2019 He knew I was getting angry. He said he was under pressure from some governors from the north, including those who were Muslims. I told him the slot belonged to the South-West and among the Yoruba, religion is not a factor in leadership,\u201d he said.\n\nAkande added: \u201cOshiomhole was surprised about the narration. \u2018If indeed you promised to make Asiwaju your running mate, it would not be fair to renege,\u2019 he said. Buhari now said he never meant it that way. What he meant originally was that Tinubu should partner with him.\u201d\n\nThe former Osun governor explained that he didn\u2019t know what that meant because before they discussed the issue of Tinubu as the partner or vice-president\u2019s ticket, a merger had been accomplished and they had already partnered.\n\n\u201cWe were registered in July 2013, and he called me to prevail on Tinubu to be his running mate in April 2014. Buhari knew I was upset but we tried to manage the situation. Perhaps he was overwhelmed by all those pressures. We decided to let him go,\u201d Akande said.\n\nHe insisted that once it became apparent that Buhari would be the presidential candidate, he was interested in making Tinubu his running mate.\n\n\u201cIn our years of interactions and engagements, he seemed to have come to know and admire Tinubu.\n\n\u201cHe constantly seemed to admire Tinubu\u2019s business acumen; his courage in politics, his large heart, his native intelligence, his readiness to forgive those who have betrayed him but who now show remorse, his empathy for the under-privileged, his capacity as a tactician, and a strategist of the highest hue, his loyalty to the ideas of Nigerian unity and good governance, and his steadfastness to his friends,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, without Tinubu, the \u201cAPC miracle\u201d would have been more difficult if not impossible. \u201cAll these made Buhari to admire and respect him,\u201d he said.\n\nHe narrated that what prompted the push for a Tinubu as vice president for the first time under Atiku was that anytime they said they needed money, Atiku would say \u201cBola please help us\u201d.\n\n\u201cBola (Tinubu) was the only one spending the money among us. The rest of us were poor. Tinubu also put all his energy and resources into the formation of the AC and we felt he deserved a spot on the ticket,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe also wrote about Tinubu\u2019s frustration with the entire rigmarole, eventually opting to leave Abuja for Lagos.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be part of whatever you are discussing now, \u2018he said. \u2018I don\u2019t trust Buhari anymore! Even if we give him names, he may decide to go outside the list. So, let him choose on his own. He was unhappy with Buhari.\n\n\u201cI told him that was not the attitude to adopt. We were trying to toy with some names and I wanted him to participate in the discussion. After some time, Amosun, Aregbesola and I were considering some names. Then I decided to call Tinubu again.\n\n\u2018We negotiated with Buhari in 2011 and gave him a name to choose instead of Pastor Bakare,\u2019 I spoke to Tinubu on phone. \u2018Who was that person?\u2019 l asked.\n\n\u2018It was Yemi Osinbajo,\u2019 Tinubu declared. I asked Aregbesola to find out where Osinbajo was. He called him on the phone. \u2018Yemi, where are you?\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t you know your case is coming up tomorrow?\u2019 \u2018l am in Abuja to argue your case.\u2019 Osinbajo answered at the other end. \u2018Which hotel are you staying?\u201d Osinbajo told him.\n\n\u201cI got a blank sheet of paper and wrote Yemi Osinbajo on it. I instructed Amosun and Aregbesola to deliver that note to Buhari immediately. It was almost midnight. Then the two of them left.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI was waiting for Buhari to call me after he must have received my message. He did not. It was Tinubu who came to me at the wee hours of the morning. He was not in a good mood and was worried that Buhari might visit our efforts with bad faith.\n\n\u201cLet us go back to Lagos\u201d, he said. Why? I asked. \u201cMaybe Buhari has his own agenda,\u201d he said. Even if we give him a name , he might not use the person. Maybe he just wants to use us for whatever his agenda might be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI reassured him that Buhari will not disappoint us and that he would agree with our choice as the vice presidential candidate of our party,\u201d Akande said.\n\nTaking a swipe at the trio of Adebanjo, Ajayi and Falae, Akande said it was surprising that the elders could not find any younger Yoruba to send to the conference to represent the interest of the ethnic group.\n\n\u201c They believed, even in their old age, that they were the only people who could have gone there. Sir Ajayi, who was close to 90 at the time of the conference, has since joined his ancestors. Chief Adebanjo celebrated his 90th birthday in 2018. Chief Falae is in his 80s. Note that Jonathan paid the conference delegates generous allowances.\n\n\u201cChief Olu Falae, a trained civil servant, who after retirement became decorated into leadership by his former military bosses, has since been trying to blindly straddle Nigeria\u2019s complicated politics,\u201d he opined.\n\nHe characterised Adebanjo as a blank politically-minded leader who recognises readily and always that he never has what it takes to aspire for high political positions.\n\n\u201cHe constantly harbours lumps of yellow hate-bile in his heart for any co-political leader with brighter chances for any major public office within or outside his political party,\u201d he posited.\n\nAkande further noted in the autobiography that the APC did not have \u2018restructuring\u2019 in its manifesto for the 2015 elections but promised to support devolution of powers from the centre to the States.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore mischievous to place the responsibility for effecting restructuring on the APC or its presidency and not to appreciate that it would require deft negotiations among such members from different ethnic nationalities and constituencies or zonal and religious background before any political party or any ethnic nationality could successfully issue any fiat on the National Assembly to make laws on power devolution or on restructuring, whatever it might connote,\u201d he argued.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Chinedu Eze\n\nIn a move signalling reciprocity of action, Nigeria\u2019s government, yesterday reduced Emirates flight to the country, both Lagos and Abuja, from daily to once weekly which would be only on Thursdays.\n\nThe action followed the decision of the government of the United Arabs Emirates (UAE) to cut Nigeria\u2019s Air Peace flight operations to Sharjah to once a week.\n\nThe Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) announced the decision of the government in a letter titled: \u201cWithdrawal of Ministerial Approval of Emirates Airlines Winter Schedule, dated December 9, 2021 and addressed to the Country Manager, Emirates Airlines Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe letter signed by the Director General of NCAA, Captain Musa Nuhu read: \u201cI wish to inform you of the withdrawal of the approval granted to Emirates Airlines winter schedule. This approval was conveyed via a letter with reference number FMA/ATMD/501/C.104/XV/536 dated 1st December 2021 at 2300Z.\n\n\u201cPlease, kindly note, henceforth Emirates Airlines is granted approval to operate only one weekly passenger frequency to Abuja on Thursdays. Please be guided accordingly.\u201d\n\nEmirates, last Sunday, operated flights to the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos and the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, to kick off its return to daily flights to the two Nigerian cities.\n\nOn the other hand, a letter seen by THISDAY that was addressed to Air Peace on the matter stated: \u201cGreetings from Sharjah Airport. This has reference to your earlier request that we have received from your side to resume scheduled operations into Sharjah Airport for the winter season W21/22.\n\n\u201cKindly note that the proposed timings were coordinated with the various stakeholders at Sharjah Airport, despite the terminal congestion and various challenges that will be faced, and with the best intentions we kept in mind our long business relationship we enjoy with Air Peace.\n\n\u201cAs such we are pleased to propose the following timings: Once weekly flight every Thursday (day 4) with arrival time at Sharjah to be STA 01:00 UTC, and departure time from Sharjah will be STD 05:00 UTC.\n\n\u201cWe will be looking closely in the near future for any potential opportunities for Air Peace for the upcoming summer season S22.\u201d\n\nBefore its flights were suspended in February this year by the federal government, Emirates was operating two flights to Lagos daily and one flight a day to Abuja, which made it 21 weekly flights to Nigeria.\n\nIn order to enable Emirates Airlines have monopoly of direct flight from Nigeria to Dubai, UAE has refused to allow the Nigerian carrier operate to the Middle East country.\n\nInvestigations carried out by THISDAY revealed that before the federal government banned Emirates from operation to Nigeria then, the UAE wanted to use Rapid Antigen Test to stop Air Peace from operating to Dubai.\n\nUAE in several media statements had insisted that other airlines would not airlift Nigerians to Dubai and gave other stringent measures, including that Nigerian passengers must have to spend 14 days in another country after leaving Nigeria before they would be due to travel to Dubai if lifted by other airlines.\n\nAir Peace then stopped flying to the city when it became clear that its passengers would be made to conduct about three COVID-19 tests on arrival in the UAE at their own expense, thus making the flights very expensive for its passengers.\n\nThe federal government had resisted that and insisted that it did not have infrastructure for the Rapid Antigen Test and also insisted that airlines flying to Nigeria must abide by its own COVID-19 protocols.\n\nAfter UAE removed the Rapid Antigen Test for Nigerian travellers, the federal government lifted the ban on the airline, but informed source from NCAA hinted that UAE might not want Air Peace to operate to Dubai, while Emirates had already scheduled to resume flights to Nigeria on December 5.\n\nNCAA source disclosed that the Director General of NCAA had withdrawn from the first meeting that was to be held between Nigeria and UAE over the resumption of flights to both countries, when he learnt that Air Peace was not invited for that meeting and it was rescheduled and the Nigerian carrier was in attendance.\n\nInformed source also disclosed to THISDAY that in tandem with the policy of reciprocity of the federal government, the NCAA had resisted all attempts to marginalise the Nigerian carrier by denying it slot to operate to UAE, a policy that was lacking in the past, which led to the shortchanging of Nigerian carriers.\n\nMinister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, had explained how the federal government resisted UAE attempt to allow only Emirates to operate to Nigeria, using stringent COVID-19 protocol, which the minister described as discriminatory and ensured that Nigeria resisted it.\n\n\u201cGovernment should be applauded for standing its ground before this absolute impunity by UAE. They refused to give Air Peace slot allocation but Nigeria allows Emirates to operate to Dubai and Lagos daily,\u201d an industry source told THISDAY.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Faults red listing\n\n*US COVID-19 vaccine donation to Nigeria reaches 13.5 million\n\n*Don\u2019t reciprocate travel ban, NMA tells FG\n\n*Urges caution against removal of fuel subsidy\n\nMichael Olugbode, Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja and Dike Onwuamaeze in Lagos\n\nThe Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) and the Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA) have urged Nigerians to embrace vaccination and other governments laid down protocols for the containment of the spread of COVID-19.\n\nBoth members of the organised private sector (OPS), stated this in separate statements made available to THISDAY yesterday, just as they also condemned countries that had placed travel ban on Nigeria and some other African countries as actions that were not based on science.\n\nThis is just as the United States yesterday put its COVID-19 vaccine donations to Nigeria at 13.5 million doses, as 2.5 million Pfizer vaccine arrive the country this week.\n\nAlso, the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has advised the federal government not to take reciprocal action by imposing travel restriction on incoming travellers from the United Kingdom.\n\nThe President of the LCCI, Dr. Michael Olawale-Cole, said in the statement urged, \u201cevery Nigerian and other nationals within this country to increase compliance with COVID-19 safety protocols and continue to take precautions against the virus.\n\n\u201cWe must all work toward a safer Nigeria. Let us free our minds and stop being hesitant about taking the COVID-19 vaccine. The fear of dying after receiving the vaccine and other conspiracy theories should be perished.\n\n\u201cIf we fail to abide by these simple and life-saving rules, we would be endangering our lives and that of others, and this may eventually lead to another lockdown which we cannot afford as a country.\n\n\u201cAny imposition of lockdown as a measure to contain and manage the spread of the virus should be avoided at all cost.\u201d\n\nOlawale-Cole said the government should provide the necessary support and enabling environment for the private sector to invest heavily in the manufacture of vaccines that can meet our domestic demand and for export.\n\n\u201cWe also appeal to the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, Indonesia, Singapore and Hong Kong to remove Nigeria from the travel red list of countries banned by them,\u2019\u201d adding that \u201cit would be unfair to ban Nigerians from travelling to your countries.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Director General of NACCIMA, Ambassador Ayo Olukanni, in a separate statement in the wake of the emergence of the Omicron said the association was in total support of strategic and proactive measures deployed by government and stakeholders to effectively prevent further spread of the new variant.\n\nOlukanni said this would prevent its impact on lives, livelihood and economic activities, thereby subjecting the country to another level of hardship.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn this regard, NACCIMA, therefore urged Nigerians to adhere strictly to well-established COVID-19 guidelines and application of non-pharmaceutical protocol, including wearing of mask, and regular washing of hands.\n\n\u201cThose who are yet to do so must also get vaccinated. Perhaps most importantly at the moment there is need for urgent action to ensure rapid and universal vaccination of our population.\n\n\u201cNACCIMA is, therefore, strongly in support of the global call for vaccine equity to ensure universal vaccination. In addition, on the local front, NACCIMA joins the call for local production vaccination urgently as one of the key strategic steps to tackle the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added that NACCINA, \u201cwishes to state that it is strongly against the unwarranted travel ban placed on Nigerians by the UK, Canada and other countries due to the Omicron variant. We therefore call on these countries, and others that have joined the bandwagon of travel bans to rescind their decision on the travel ban against Nigerians.\u201d\n\nUS COVID-19 Donation to Nigeria Hits 13.5 Million\n\nMeanwhile, the United States has disclosed that its COVID-19 vaccines\u2019 donations to Nigeria has risen to 13.5 million doses. Presently, the United States has donated more than 13.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine in partnership with COVAX, or bilaterally to Nigeria.\n\nA statement by the US Embassy in Nigeria welcomed the arrival of 2.5 million Pfizer vaccine doses in Abuja this week.\n\nAdditionally, the United States revealed that it has provided more than $119 million in COVID-19 related health assistance. This, it listed included a 40-bed mobile field hospital, ventilators and related training for 88 hospitals, personal protective equipment, technical assistance for vaccine readiness, risk communication and demand generation for vaccines, conducting an epidemiological COVID-19 detection and vaccine hesitancy survey, setting up electronic record systems, rapid response teams, training for over 200,000 military and civilian personnel on COVID-19 control measures, and technology for virtual training.\n\nIn addition, the United States stated that it leveraged the PEPFAR-supported National Integrated Specimen Referral Network (NiSRN) and laboratory investments to support expansion of the NCDC (153) molecular laboratory network nationwide.\n\nIt added that the National Primary Health Care Development Agency received the vaccines, ensuring they were taken to cold storage to prepare for distribution to over 3,000 health facilities across all 36 states and FCT-Abuja, revealing that over the next several weeks, the vaccines would be available at major markets, shopping malls, event centers, motor parks, airports, places of employment, and religious institutions as part of Nigeria\u2019s mass vaccination campaign.\n\nThe US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had noted earlier this month that: \u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic won\u2019t end for any country until it ends for all countries. Otherwise, the virus will keep replicating around the world, people will keep getting sick and dying, and we won\u2019t be able to safely reopen our economies or travel around the world for business and tourism the way we used to. That\u2019s why the United States is committed to helping end the pandemic in Nigeria and everywhere.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t Reciprocate UK\u2019s Travel Ban, NMA tells FG\n\nIn a related development, the NMA has advised the federal government not to undertake a reciprocal action by imposing travel restriction on incoming travellers from the United Kingdom.\n\nIt described the policy of the British government as unfortunate.\n\nAmidst the controversy over plan by the federal government to remove fuel subsidy, the doctors also advised that proper assessment of its impact be made before approving it.\n\nIt however advised the government to consider restricting travel from countries after undertaken critical assessment based on scientific evidence.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Abuja yesterday, NMA President, Prof. Innocent Ujah said red listing of Nigeria was not a proper thing to do considering the efforts the country was making to control the spread of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe issue of travel ban for Nigeria due to omicron variant by the UK, I must say is very unfortunate because I know that Nigeria is doing its best to control and contain the COVID19 pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nUjah, however said that though it was the right of countries to take measures to protect their citizens, such action should be taken after a critical assessment and should be science-based .\n\nHe urged the federal government to ensure that adequate measures are taken to protect our citizens from the COVID19 virus\n\n\u201c\u201dWe should also look at those coming from other parts of the world. Because you recall that previously, Turkey, India and Brazil were restricted from coming to Nigeria based on the volume cases of COVID19 from there.\n\n\u201cSo obviously we should do our critical assessment and if we feel that any country will pose a threat to our people, then people from such countries should be prevented from coming to Nigeria. There is nothing wrong with that because we need to protect our citizens,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile briefing journalists on the decisions reached at the just concluded National Executive Council (NEC); meeting of NMA held in Sokoto, Ujah said it considered progress made on the implementation of the Memornadum of Understanding signed with government in August this year.\n\nHe said that NMA appreciated the support of President Muhammadu Buhari towards resolving the industrial crisis in the health sector.\n\nHowever, Ujah said the NEC urged relevant government agencies to expedite action on the full Implementation of the MoU to engender peace in the sector.\n\nThe NMA president also spoke on some national issues such as the proposed withdrawal of fuel subsidy.\n\nHe said that NMA \u201ccalled on the federal government to ensure that the harsh effects of the subsidy removal do not outweigh the gains\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Onward Together,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president also commended the Nigerian Navy for maintaining a steady course in its drive for local content development, which he said was in tandem with the philosophy of his administration.\n\nHe said that the federal government\u2019s commitment to properly equip the Navy with the right mix of platforms had seen the service take delivery of NNS LANA in May this year from France.\n\n\u2018\u2018I commend the business dependability of Messrs OCEA Shipyard \u2013 France, the builders of our Navy\u2019s first-ever purpose-built Offshore Survey Vessel for a conclusive and successful execution of the contract.\n\n\u2018\u2018Local partners should share in this commendation for their efforts at local facilitation as outlined in the government\u2019s local content policy,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nHe maintained that the federal government was aware of the Navy\u2019s dedication towards ensuring the security of the vast oil and gas industry in the nation\u2019s maritime environment, as well as sea lanes of communications.\n\nAccording to him, given the present high dependence on oil and gas revenues, the Navy is undeniably a major contributor to the economic well-being of Nigeria.\n\n\u2018\u2018Arrests of those involved in illegalities have yielded results as some pirates, illegal bunkering syndicates, pipeline vandals and other miscreants have been convicted during this year.\n\n\u2018\u2018Such successes were made possible through the enforcement of our new anti-piracy law on Suppression of Piracy and Other Maritime Offences Act 2019.\n\n\u2018\u2018Furthermore, the provision of the new policy directives by the current administration of the Navy codified in such documents as the Nigerian Navy Strategic Plan 2021-2030; the Chief of the Naval Staff Strategic Directive 2021-5 and the Total Spectrum Maritime Strategy have given the service credible guidelines and leverage for improved operational efficiency,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief also used the occasion to laud the efforts of the Navy in the fight against maritime crimes in the Gulf of Guinea region, praising the Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Awwal Gambo, and all the officers, ratings and civilian staff of the Navy for remarkable achievements.

          "text": "As committee presents third and fourth report to FG\n\nKasim Sumaina in Abuja\n\nThe federal government on Thursday stated that the preliminary report of the National Integrated Mineral Exploration Project (NIMEP), which is in its third and fourth phases has identified silver, zinc and lead in 133 prospect areas along Benue trough of the country.\n\nThis is even as two other contracted exploration companies had in October presented the first and second preliminary reports to the ministry.\n\nThe Director General, Nigeria Geological Survey Agency (NGSA), Dr. Abdulrazaq Garba, while presenting the report to the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Mr. Olamilekan Adegbite, in Abuja, revealed that Nigeria has succeeded in elucidating its mineral types.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe information in the report has never been there these while.\n\nWe have two presentations: Rare metal pegmatites, Lead-zinc- silver mineralization in the Benue trough.\n\n\u201cWe have identified lead, zinc, silver and lithium in 133 prospect areas. Exploration is about looking for and it is not a means to an end. So what we are saying is that from the results we are getting, if we are able to identify areas that are open at the mining cadastral, government can carve out these areas and put it up for good investors to come and invest.\n\n\u201cWhere they are not open and you have a lot of licences in those areas, then government should encourage the owners of these licences to partner with investors in the right type of mineral.\u201d\n\nResponding, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Adegbite, stated that presentation is a result of expenditure made by the ministry and federal government to de-risk the mining sector.\n\nHe said that mining was all about data, adding that: \u201cYou are never sure of what is beneath the ground and at what quantity. That is the risk. Of course, it is a high risk because you need to find out this fact which is data generated.\n\n\u201cInvestors always shy away from this risk. They do not want to risk their money and find out that there is nothing there.\n\n\u201cSo often times, government have to undertake this. This is where we have to say thank you to President Muhammadu Buhari. He is the first president ever to have granted this type of funding.\u201d\n\nAdegbite further opined that about $50 million has been spent on the project, adding: \u201cThis is about $15 billion. Five projects have been defined under the NIMEP.\n\n\u201cThis was a well thought-out project and the results are fantastic. The data are coming in and it tells us that we are very rich in mineralisation and the next phase is for us to market this so that it can bring in investors, yield revenue and create jobs for our people.\n\n\u201cSo we have received two reports earlier in October and two today. Just one outstanding and then the project will be closed. We can now take the report in less technical format to the council that the money granted in 2017 has been judiciously expended and this is the result and we will ask for more finance.\u201d\n\nThe minister further said: \u201cBecause we have only covered a very small fraction of the country with this kind of fund. Exploration is a very expensive project. The money given has been well spent but only covered a fraction. We can discover more and that will enhance the sector and attract more investors.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, one of the contractors and Managing Director, Juggernauts Industries Limited, Mr. Bello Mohammed, told journalists at the sidelines of the presentation that the report showed Nigeria has lithium in high grade.\n\nHe stressed that it puts the country in a mining destination map as the surge for electric cars increases.\n\n\u201cWe know that there is high demand for electric vehicles in the world. This project will put Nigeria on the map, showing that Nigeria has higher lithium potentials,\u201d Mohammed said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "How Police Unjustly Arrested, Detained Me With No Food, Water In Osun\u2014 Activist Alleges Police Brutality",
          "text": "A member of the Take It Back Movement, Mr Samson Tola has said he was brutalised and humiliated by the men of Osun State Police Command.\n\nTola said he was unjustly arrested, battered and detained for no reason. He also accused the policemen of not carrying out any investigation or questioning before he was charged to court with other innocent people.\n\nSamson Tola\n\nHe said the ugly experience started on November 15 around the Olaiya area of Osogbo, the Osun state capital.\n\nHe alleged that the policemen from Dugbe Police Station in Osogbo are responsible for his humiliation and molestation, adding that they also demanded a bribe of N50,000 each from 12 of them who were picked up.\n\nTola narrated his experience to SaharaReporters on Thursday, adding that police brutality persists in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cOn Monday, November 15, I returned from a trip to my hometown where I was working on a small project. I got to Osogbo around 3:30 pm. And then, I changed to go and see a friend who just had a baby.\n\n\u201cI left my wife\u2019s shop and went straight to my friend\u2019s place. While coming back around 7:45 pm, I started hearing gunshots around the Olaiya area. I saw it was the police so I continued my journey since I had no skeleton in my cupboard.\n\n\u201cTo my greatest surprise, one of the men working with the police, a vigilante officer who was dressed in mufti, covered his face with a mask, approached and hit me with the edge of an axe on my right elbow. I said what is happening. Am I under arrest? If I am under arrest, I don't resist arrest. He slapped me again. I said you can only use minimum force on a person resisting arrest, that I am not resisting arrest, and you are still using maximum force on me,\u201d Tola narrated.\n\nHe said he was pushed inside a minibus meant for seven passengers, with other 11 people.\n\n\u201cThe guy got angry again, slapped me and called me names like 'criminal'. He pushed me into a 7-seater minibus where 11 guys had already been stacked. So, we became 12 people and were driven down to Dugbe police station.\n\n\u201cAt the police station, I was not questioned, no statement, and no interrogation. They disrobed us. They collected our clothes, we were asked to pull off our boxers in the passage of the station in front of a lady officer. It was the lady officer that checked the pockets of our trousers after removing them.\n\n\u201cWhen it was my turn, the lady asked me to raise my hands so she could search my pocket but I was trying to hold my trousers, and she said \u2018what do you have there that I\u2019ve not seen before?\u2019 I was highly embarrassed \u2014 a female officer putting her hands in my pocket when my boxers were off.\n\n\u201cThe lady also started calling me all sorts of names. There was a man there in suit taking sides with the lady that evening, asking why was I so arrogant. He started threatening that he would make sure he dealt with me,\u201d he added.\n\nTola revealed that the policemen asked for a bribe from his people, but they refused. He also said they did not allow him to eat or drink during the 18 hours he spent in detention.\n\n\u201cThey locked us up and when I was thirsty around 10:30 pm, I called out to the lady that she should give me water. I didn\u2019t even know that my comrades had brought food for me. But they didn\u2019t bring the food to me because they didn\u2019t bribe them. They denied me food and water for 18 good hours and I was on medication. They even saw my medication in my pocket.\n\n\u201cThey asked my comrades that came to go and bring N50,000 for my bail. They told them that bail is free and I told them too that we are not going to pay a kobo. The DPO (Divisional Police Officer) now said you are proving you know (your rights) and that they would take us to court. We were in the cell till 2:45 pm the following day and were driven to court.\n\n\u201cOn getting to court, they brought out 8 counts against us. It was there I saw the man in a jacket at the station was our prosecuting counsel. The 8 counts said we were selling Indian hemp, we were brandishing arms that we wanted to use to destroy people.\n\n\u201cThe magistrate granted us bail with a sum of N100,000 and a surety but before we could perfect the bail conditions the court had closed and they took us back to the police station. On getting to the station, the DPO said they should drive us to Ilesha correctional centre. My experience was the part of the Nigerian police brutality,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Tola, who is a house painter and paint manufacturer, said throughout his years as an artisan, he had never duped anybody or engaged in anything that would warrant his arrest.\n\n\u201cI have been an artisan for 34 solid years. Police have been denying police brutality but I am a victim. I have no skeleton in my cupboard. Nobody has ever taken me to a police station before over my job. I\u2019ve delivered jobs for military officers, lawyers, bankers and so on,\u201d Tola said.\n\nWhen SaharaReporters reached out to the police spokesperson in Osun State, Yemisi Opalola, for comments, she neither answered her calls nor replied to messages sent to her mobile phone.",

          "text": "The Ghana Health Service has reviewed its COVID-19 protocol for international travellers owing to the rise in cases of the Omicron variant detected in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement on Thursday, Patrick Kuma-Aboagye, director-general of the service, said the country has witnessed an increase in COVID-19 cases since the Omicron variant was detected.\n\nThe service said infections are expected to rise during the festive season and that the surge in COVID-19 cases is already being reflected at Kotoka International Airport (KIA).\n\nAccording to the new protocol, inbound and outbound travellers are expected to be fully vaccinated before travelling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn November 2020, 168 cases were detected compared to 241 cases in November 2021, an increase of over 40%. We have since been recording an average of 20 positive cases a day at KIA,\u201d the service said.\n\n\u201cFor these positive cases, there is a significant difference in the percentage of COVID-19 infection based on vaccination status recorded at KIA. Available data from KIA, show that a COVID-19 positive person is three times more likely to be unvaccinated.\n\n\u201cThe new variant, Omicron which is said to be more transmissible has been detected at our airport. Of the 34 cases detected, 75% of them were unvaccinated. Over the last two weeks, cases from airports account for about 60% of the total cases recorded in the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cTo avert this, the following directives are to be implemented effective midnight 12th December 2021:\n\n\u201cFor travelers to Ghana: all persons 18 years and above arriving in Ghana will be required to provide evidence of full\n\nvaccination for a COVID-19 vaccine\n\n\u201cAll unvaccinated Ghanaians and residents of Ghana who are currently outside the country and intend to return within 14 days from the midnight of 12th December 2021 are exempted.

          "title": "This may be African languages\u2019 best bet against extinction",
          "text": "The novelist Rita Mae Brown once said, \u201cLanguage is the road map of a culture. It tells you where its people come from and where they are going.\u201d If this is true, what then does an extinct language mean for its people? It means they have no culture, ancestral value, or true identity. As hyperbolic as this may sound, many languages have already gone extinct and more are predicted to join in the coming years.\n\nMore than 573 languages are extinct. The National Geographic Society says a language dies every two weeks, ceasing to be actively spoken. In Africa alone, at least 52 known languages have experienced either linguicide\u2014the death of a language due to natural or political reasons\u2014or glottophagy, which happens when a smaller language is absorbed in or replaced by a major language.\n\nIn another disturbing report, UNESCO data indicates that if no efforts are made to conserve them, half of the languages currently spoken today will be extinct by the end of the 21st century. How can this be avoided, especially for African languages? Some young Africans living and schooling in America are taking the lead in answering this question through their startup called Mandla, an app that helps people learn African languages.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nMandla, a Zulu and Xhosa word that means power, is an innovative e-learning language app created for those who seek to strengthen their connection with their African roots. The app combines education with gamification to create an enjoyable and effective experience. With the help of predictive AI, Mandla is able to personalise language lessons for all of its users.\n\nHow it started\n\nDuring the winter break of last year, Wenitte Apiou, a then freshman student of Electrical Engineering and Mathematics at the Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, shared the idea to build Mandla in a text to Boluwaji Odufuwa, another freshman studying Computer Science at Harvard University.\n\nApiou was born in Burkina Faso but moved to America when he was five. Odufuwa, on the other hand, was born in Nigeria but also moved to America in his early childhood. Because of their shared struggle with speaking and understanding their native language, Apiou\u2019s idea organically resonated with Odufuwa, and the duo launched into action.\n\nGrowing up, Apiou\u2019s family only spoke French\u2014Burkina Faso\u2019s official language\u2014and some English in the household. His parents are from two different ethnic groups: his mother speaks M\u00f2or\u00e9, the most spoken indigenous language in Burkina Faso; and his father speaks Kasem, a minority language spoken only by about 100,000 people in southern Burkina Faso and Northern Ghana.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots of Mandla app\n\n\u201cThe only language I\u2019m fluent in besides English is French, which makes it difficult to communicate with some of my older family members who never went to school and were not able to learn French fluently,\u201d Apiou told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s harder being in the United States as well. The only people that can help would have been my parents, and they did not speak those languages in the house.\u201d\n\nApiou was stuck in-between two foreign languages: French in the house and English everywhere outside the house. This is the reality of many young Africans, especially those who have parents of diverse ethnic backgrounds.\n\nEven though the idea had stuck with him since high school, Apiou couldn\u2019t do much because of school work and time barrier. He had some coding skills and had built two apps in high school, but he didn\u2019t want to start building the app and then drop it. So the winter break and the COVID-19 lockdown availed them the time to solve the problem for themselves and millions of young people in America and across the world.\n\nA diverse team building a diverse product\n\nAs the duo built, they realised they needed more diverse hands. After all, Africa has 54 countries and over 3,000 tribes. Building a diverse solution should involve a diverse team, they thought. So they sought more hands.\n\nEmeka Ezike, a sophomore Computer Science student at Harvard University, who also originally came from Nigeria, joined as the CTO. Kwesi Afrifa, born and raised in Ghana and an International student studying Computer Science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), joined to lead the web platform effort. Delanyo Mensah, a sophomore student of Human and Organisational Development at Vanderbilt University, originally from Ghana, joined to lead Mandla\u2019s growth and marketing team.\n\n\u201cWe brought a number of smart young Africans to join in the effort\u2014a few engineers and Delanyo, who\u2019s passionately pushing our growth, especially on TikTok where a bunch of our audience are,\u201d said Apiou.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots of Madla app\n\nToday, Mandla has grown into a 10-man core team. The startup also accepts volunteers that can help create learning content around the languages currently on its platform and upcoming ones.\n\nGrowth and challenges\n\nMandla currently has more than 15 languages including Nigeria\u2019s Yoruba and Igbo; Ghana\u2019s Twi; Ethiopian\u2019s Amharic; and East Africa\u2019s Swahili on its platform. According to Apiou, the plan is to continue adding more languages until they\u2019ve covered a large extent of African cultures.\n\nAs young founders, the natural thing is to find a way to scale on social media, and that\u2019s what the team has done; they are creating captivating content on social media, especially TikTok, which now houses over a billion users.\n\nThe app is currently growing organically and, according to Apiou, has 5,000 registered users, pegged at about 50 signups per day and about three to 400 daily active users.\n\nThe team thinks it\u2019s time to scale their technology and build a more powerful marketing strategy, from organic to paid. But the problem is funding. Apiou said they\u2019ve reached out to hundreds of investors to no avail.\n\nBut why no funding yet?\n\nApiou stated a number of reasons for this. One is \u201cbeing a black college student. In the United States, there aren\u2019t very many people looking to fund someone who has an unproven track record,\u201d he said, agreeing to his lack of experience as a major barrier. \u201cSecond is the domain, edtech. While there is a lot of VC interest in it, it\u2019s relatively new because many people don\u2019t see a path to profitability, or huge billion-dollar success for edtech companies,\u201d Apiou said.\n\nThis statement may not be completely correct, however, as there are a couple of unicorn edtech companies, like Udemy and Coursera, and even Duolingo, which is one of the startup\u2019s competitors.\n\nThe third Apiou raised is about niche: their product focuses on Africa and African languages and culture. He narrated their experience when they went to college pitch competitions. \u201cWe have not won a single pitch competition, despite the fact that\u2014and I mean no disrespect to the other teams\u2014our product has a more natural need and significant traction than some of the teams that beat us out.\u201d\n\nHowever, they have gotten some support from Angel Onuoha, a graduate of Harvard University, ex-Googler, and a serial entrepreneur who\u2019s somewhat popular for his bullish tweets on African tech.\n\nThe team believes that with more funding, they could build more tech stacks, hire more talent, and go full-frontal on their marketing efforts and then compete on a larger scale.\n\nUnlike other language learning apps that are including African languages just to check a diversity-and-inclusion box, Mandla\u2019s mission is deeper than educational or entertainment purposes; it\u2019s really about cultural preservation.\n\n\u201cAnd what better way to preserve a culture than to preserve its language?\u201d Apiou asked with the signatory laughter he had kept throughout the call.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "This article was contributed to TechCabal by Conrad Onyango, bird\n\nA preference for mobile money, the fast takeup of digital currencies, the growing allure of regulated cryptocurrencies among central banks and now, a call for a continental cryptocurrency. Could this spell the end of paper money in Africa?\n\nThe era of cash could be drawing to an end as central bank-backed digital currencies (CBDC\u201ds) takes root in Africa.\n\nThe cryptocurrency era\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated the use of cashless payments \u2013 mainly through mobile money platforms and online banking \u2013 the period has also ushered in widespread use of cryptocurrencies, with the result that digital currencies are fast becoming mainstream across the continent.\n\nEconomic and financial experts are the latest to rally behind the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies through a call for a common African digital currency to spur trade and economic development post-pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe need to come up with a cryptocurrency that is acceptable to each member state. It\u2019s better to do it at the continental level, and we have the expertise to do it,\u201d Anouar Hassoune, Professor of Finance and CEO of the West Africa Rating Agency, told delegates at the 2021 African Economic Conference last week.\n\nSo far, it\u2019s only Nigeria that has launched an official, state-backed digital currency \u2013 christened the eNaira \u2013 on the continent as more countries continue to express interest.\n\nLast month, Tanzania\u2019s central bank joined a growing list of African countries to express the intention of launching its own, regulated digital currency, taking its cue from the rising adoption of cryptocurrencies and wanting to avoid \u2018being left behind.\u2019\n\nSouth Africa is currently piloting project Dunbar, an international financial settlement system that uses multiple central bank digital currencies, while Mauritius has a digital currency in the development stages.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nOther countries in Africa \u2013 including Kenya, Morocco, Tunisia and Ghana \u2013 are researching the best model to deploy in their jurisdictions, according to US think tank Atlantic Council\u2019s digital currency tracker.\n\nPanellists at last week\u2019s African Economic Conference, organized by the African Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the Economic Commission for Africa, said there would first need to be reform in the financial sector through harmonization of national rules and protocols governing the financial systems of individual countries, to make a pan-African cryptocurrency a reality.\n\n\u201cWe should not forget that there is a lot of work to be done on the digital infrastructure, the development of payment systems, payment system interoperability really needs to be worked on, so there is a lot of work to be done in collaboration with the financial institutions on digitalisation of delivery and payment channels,\u201d said Emmanuelle Riedel Drouin, head of the Economic and Financial Transition Department at Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement.\n\nA common cryptocurrency, Hassoune said, would ease the cost of doing business, give the continent an identity and serve as an alternative means to monetise some of the continent\u2019s endowments, such as gold and other commodities.\n\nNestcoin, a new African venture launched last month and headed by former Binance Labs director, Yele Bademosi, has set out to make cryptocurrencies mainstream across the continent, with a promise to make crypto accessible to anyone.\n\n\u201cThe power of crypto lies in its potential to circumvent poorly designed economic infrastructure and connect anyone to a global economy with access to unlimited financial opportunities,\u201d Bademosi said in a statement.\n\nNelly Chatue-Diop and her West African crypto startup, Ejara, made waves earlier this year with the biggest capital raise by a women-led startup in the sub-region, to date. Chatue-Diop\u2019s company provides users with a non-custodian crypto wallet (described in the industry has having your own \u201cbank\u201d) and the company\u2019s markting focus is on women in French-speaking West Africa.\n\nCurrently, three countries are driving the continent towards a cashless era, with a widespread use of both mobile money, or crypto adoption, or both, driven partly by the pandemic.\n\nThe Baobab Network has traced at least 60 cryptocurrency companies in Africa, with the majority (43 percent) of them headquartered in Nigeria, followed by South Africa (18 percent) and Kenya (11 percent).\n\nSimilarly, global digital payments solution provider Visa in a September report showed a growing preference for mobile wallets, particularly in Kenya (56 percent) followed by Nigeria (14 percent) and South Africa (7 percent).\n\nThis is affirmed by another comparative study by GSMA published in March 2021 showing more than half of 310 live mobile money services in 2020 across the globe were found in Africa.\n\nWith over 55 percent of the world\u2019s mobile money services recorded in Africa and a significant population turning to e-wallets and cryptocurrency, the question now becomes whether the continent might ditch paper money altogether.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "CinetPay, an Ivory Coast-based startup that enables merchants in francophone Africa to accept and make electronic payments online or via mobile Point of Sale (PoS) devices, on Wednesday said it has raised $2.4 million seed funding.\n\n4DX Ventures, a pan-African venture capital fund and Nigeria-based unicorn startup, Flutterwave are co-investors in the round.\n\nOn CinetPay\u2019s mobile and web-based platform, businesses can sign up to process payments from over 130 different payment operators\u2014including MTN mobile money, M-Pesa, Orange Money, Visa, Mastercard, etc\u2014via a single interface.\n\nCinetPay thus simplifies the process of accepting payments, eliminating the need for merchants to integrate with different systems for managing sales and revenues. Its solution, which can be integrated into merchant websites, is used by a wide array of businesses, from e-commerce platforms to digital public services, insurance companies, and schools.\n\nFounded by Idriss Monthe and Daniel Dindji in 2016, CinetPay claims to have processed over 30 million transactions for 350 active merchants in nine countries, including Ivory Coast, Senegal, Cameroon, Mali, Togo, Burkina Faso, Benin, and Guinea.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nThe seed investment is expected to boost CinetPay\u2019s sales and marketing efforts in the countries it operates across West and Central Africa.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve watched firsthand as thousands of merchants waste crucial time, even up to 6 months, getting their payment systems in order,\u201d CinetPay CEO and co-founder, Monthe, said in a statement. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got the resources to market and sell our solution across the region.\u201d\n\nFor Flutterwave, backing CinetPay\u2014a startup it\u2019s partnered with since 2019\u2014marks the unicorn\u2019s first direct investment in the francophone Africa region. According to Olugbenga Agboola, Flutterwave\u2019s founder and CEO, both startups have a \u201cshared vision to simplify payments on the continent.\u201d\n\nAll over Africa, the mobile money market is booming with West Africa being one of the fastest-growing regions in the continent. In Ivory Coast, CinetPay\u2019s first market, up to 75% of the population owns a mobile money account whereas less than 25% have a bank account.\n\nSimilarly, up to 80% of the population in the French-speaking African region have a mobile money account and less than 20% bank accounts.\n\nCinetPay\u2019s gateway aggregates all payment options available in the region, enabling merchants, through digital accounts, to accept online payments and reduce the reliance on cash.\n\nWalter Baddoo, co-founder and General Partner at 4DX Ventures reveals that the VC firm has been \u201ctracking the francophone Africa market\u201d for some time now and is impressed by CinetPay\u2019s ambitious goal to digitise payments across the region.

These include major international technology enterprises, social media companies, global telecom operators, financial service companies, and cloud service providers.\n\nThe company owns and operates an extensive submarine network extending 7,000 kilometers from Portugal to Lagos, Accra, and along the West African coast, with landing stations in Nigeria, Ghana, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. These provide connectivity to and from Europe, West African countries, and the major business communities in Nigeria.\n\nMainOne also owns digital infrastructure assets that include three operational data centers, with an additional facility under construction expected to open in Q1 2022. These are in addition to key internet exchanges enabling low latency to key global networks, including Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Facebook.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the management team, including CEO Opeke, will continue to serve in their respective roles.\n\n\u201cThe MainOne team is excited about the partnership created through the acquisition,\u201d Opeke said in the statement. \u201cWith similar values and culture to what we have built in 12 years, Equinix is the preferred partner for our growth journey and will accelerate our long-term vision to grow digital infrastructure investments across Africa.\u201d\n\nFor Equinix, a global specialist in data centres and internet connectivity, the deal marks the first step in a long-term strategy to become a leading provider of digital infrastructure in Africa.\n\nEquinix believes MainOne to be one of the most exciting technology businesses to emerge from Africa, making the acquisition a pivotal entry point for the US company into the continent.\n\n\u201cExpansion in Africa has long been a strategic priority for us. With MainOne, we have found a company that not only has highly complementary data center and connectivity assets but can further accelerate the expansion of our business model and growth objectives,\u201d said Eugene Bergen, EMEA President at Equinix.\n\nEquinix\u2019s data centres around the world.\n\nGiven the huge supply gap in digital infrastructure in sub-Saharan Africa, Ayobami Omole, a Lagos-based telecom analyst at Tellimer, expects more of such transactions in the coming years. \u201cDeals like the MainOne acquisition will keep drawing foreign investors\u2019 attention to the region,\u201d Omole told TechCabal over the phone.\n\nThe UN International Telecommunication Union (ITU) estimates SSA is home to approximately 700 million of the world\u2019s 3.7 billion people without access to the internet. More so, available infrastructure in the region is barely enough for the current internet users.\n\n\u201cWith increasing internet traffic, smartphone penetration, and digitisation, we can only expect demand for cloud services and digital infrastructure to increase with foreign players looking to plug that gap,\u201d Omole added.\n\nGlobally, Platform Equinix is comprised of 237 data centres across 65 metros and 27 countries, providing data centre and interconnection services for over 10,000 businesses, including more than 50% of Fortune 500 companies. When completed, the acquisition will extend Platform Equinix into West Africa.\n\n\u201cMainOne\u2019s leading interconnection position and experienced management team represent critical assets in our aspirations to be the leading neutral provider of digital infrastructure in Africa,\u201d added Charles Meyers, President and CEO of Equinix.\n\nMainOne\u2019s founding shareholders include Nigerian businessman and founder of Guaranty Trust Bank, Fola Adeola, MainStreet Technologies, the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC), Pan African Infrastructure Development Fund (PAIDF), First Bank, Polaris Bank, and the African Development Bank (AfDB).\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

For me, his name comes to mind whenever I hear or say the words fintech or finance.\n\nFor real? Oh yeah, Olowe has a wealth of experience in finance. He was an early advisor to Wallets Africa, used to be on the TeamApt board, and has spent over a decade in traditional finance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, Olowe did not study anything finance-related. His first and Master\u2019s degrees were in engineering.\n\nBut despite having an academic background devoid of finance, Olowe thrived in the space. From building an intranet platform at Standard Trust Bank to his data analytics system at Access Bank, he quickly became a force.\n\nHowever, the open banking system is arguably one of his most significant achievements. The system helps fintechs integrate with banks seamlessly, reducing a process that should have taken months to a day.\n\nBut what exactly is open banking, and how did one man get the Central Bank of Nigeria and every commercial bank in the country to \u201clike the idea.\u201d\n\nWell, Olowe took the first step and was surprised by the outcome.\n\nOluwanifemi Kolawole had a chat with the finance expert, and he dished about his career, life, and the open banking system.\n\nRead: Adedeji Olowe is building a global reputation as Africa\u2019s open banking leader\n\nAnd the nominees are\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy now, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about the biggest tech event in West Africa \u2014 Techpoint Build 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, we\u2019ve got news for you.\n\nNominees for Techpoint Awards (Nigerian edition) are out!

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNigeria-based mobility giant, GIGM, has launched a payment service for its users. This is the first of many services that the company intends to offer as it moves towards being a one-stop-shop for the needs of its customers.\n\nIn September 2019, the company revealed a slight name change, replacing \u2018Motors\u2019 with \u2018Mobility\u2019 as it looked to expand its offerings. Two years after that, it says it is redefining mobility to mean access rather than just movement.\n\nOver a chat with Techpoint Africa, Okhae Enahoro, the company\u2019s new CEO, said, \u201cWhen you look at the word mobility, it means the ability to move freely. Movement in itself may not necessarily mean physically transporting yourself from one place to another.\n\n\u201cIt just basically means advancement. It can mean growth. So when you look at these definitions, you realise that we\u2019re trying to enable lifestyles, so we want to bring services to people that allow them to do things easily.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now, this service will only be available in Nigeria \u2014 GIGM\u2019s headquarters \u2014 and will allow users to make payments for airtime, electricity bills, cable TV, and Internet data. However, there are plans to launch in other African countries over the next few years.\n\nThe beginnings of a super app?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGozem riders (\u201cChampions\u201d). Source: Supplied\n\nThe super app model has gained popularity in emerging economies following the successes of WeChat and Alipay in China. Several startups have sprung up, especially in Asia, to replicate the model.\n\nIn Africa, Opay, Gozem, Safeboda, and Gokada have positioned themselves as super apps with varying degrees of success, and this latest feature could see GIGM becoming the newest entrant in this space.\n\nTypically, super apps start by offering a core service through which they get a foothold and can provide an array of services to the customer.\n\nThis service could be food delivery, transportation, or payments. For GIGM, this could be building on its tech-enabled transportation platform to offer payment services to its users.\n\nHowever, because its services are mainly for long-distance travel, the company would have to include more services than it currently offers to gain more customers.\n\nA look at its mobile app would provide some insight into how this could work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA screenshot of the GIGM app\n\nOne of the options on the app is called Danfo, named after the famous yellow buses in Lagos State. Tapping on it would redirect you to the app store to download the app.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanfo is the company\u2019s bus-hailing platform that allows users to book intra-city rides. Although the service is not yet live, it provides insights into the company plans and could see it come up against Shuttlers and Treepz.\n\nLite from GIGM is another offering that will enable the company to onboard new users. Nigeria\u2019s fragmented transportation services mean that users cannot travel comfortably over short distances.\n\nWith Lite, the company plans to provide users with the ability to make short journeys outside a city that would ordinarily not be undertaken by ride-hailing services such as Uber and Bolt.\n\nEven with these offerings, ride-hailing could be the fastest way to attract many users and see it come up against Uber and Bolt.\n\nWith the large war chest available to these two startups in the form of venture capital, it would be a considerable challenge for the company. However, if there is any local player capable of pulling this off, it is GIGM.\n\nIn recent years, the company has focused on developing its technology offerings, deploying data across the business. Its understanding of the local business terrain gained over 20 years of operation gives it an advantage that other local companies lack.\n\nFor super apps to thrive, they must have a robust and frequent core use case, a good payment system, and relevant services close to the core use case.\n\nWith its position as a leading transportation service provider and the addition of a payment option, the company looks to be on the right path. However, the new services it offers could play a role in its success or failure.\n\nNigeria\u2019s low smartphone and Internet penetration also mean that more people would be using the Internet or smartphones for the first time every year. Providing these groups with relevant services could hold the key to success.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "title": "\u201cWe like to invest in businesses where the founders are in control.\u201d \u2013 Ian Lessem on HAVA\u00cdC\u2019s investment thesis",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bulk of the funding that goes to African startups comes from outside the continent. In 2020, 71% of the money invested in Nigerian startups came from outside the country. It is a similar story in other countries.\n\nIn recent years, however, the number of investors on the continent has increased, and this could be attributed to early startup founders\u2019 successes. Consequently, seeing African investors either lead or make up the majority of investors on a startup\u2019s cap table is fast becoming the norm.\n\nOne of these investors is HAVA\u00cdC, a South Africa-based investment firm. Techpoint Africa had a chat with Ian Lessem, where he explained the firm\u2019s origins and how they make investment decisions. The interview has been reproduced below.\n\nHow did HAVA\u00cdC get started?\n\nSo we started the business about seven or eight years ago, recognising that there was a lot of tech talent coming out of South Africa and places like Kenya and Nigeria, but very little smart capital supporting these businesses. My partners and I, along with the rest of the team, come from what you would call a very traditional investment background, so we\u2019ve worked in investment banks, M&A\u2019s, etc. We know what it takes to scale businesses. We recognised a gap in the market to number one, find these businesses, and help them grow locally and internationally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is your investment thesis?\n\nWe invest in early-stage technology companies that solve real-world challenges. So early-stage for us is post-revenue seed up to Series A. Revenue could be pretty small, maybe just one customer. Importantly, we only invest in businesses where we feel we can add value, so typically, we take a strategic role on the board, helping the businesses scale.\n\nNumber two, the businesses need to be tech-enabled and use their platforms to scale locally and internationally. Thirdly, we focus on businesses that solve actual challenges, so we don\u2019t invest in what we call \u2018nice to haves\u2019. An example would be Twitter. Those who invested in the early stages have done very well, but it\u2019s not solving any problems. If you look at our portfolio, we have startups providing financial inclusion. We have many fintech, healthtech, and business productivity companies.\n\nWhat\u2019s your average ticket size in these companies?\n\nWe take minority stakes, so we invest from $100,000 to $1,500,000, and we don\u2019t go above 24.9% in the companies. Importantly, we like to invest in businesses where the founders are in control.\n\nBy your standards, what should a startup not be doing?\n\nAt the moment, I\u2019ll say the topical one is a lot of hot money coming in. Some investors don\u2019t have any experience working in Africa and often push the founders to adopt strategies that work elsewhere but not necessarily in Africa.\n\nObviously, different parts of Africa have different nuances so the biggest mistake we\u2019ve seen is founders being caught up in this hot money and taking money from people who don\u2019t have the expertise to give them the help that young businesses need.\n\nAlso, agreeing to chase metrics that may be suitable in other markets but are not ideal in their domestic markets. So you\u2019re doing things because that\u2019s how they are done elsewhere, but it\u2019s not necessarily a smart way to do things locally.\n\nAnother thing is that some entrepreneurs start businesses to solve problems that they or someone they know faced. While that is an excellent place to start because they\u2019re often quite passionate about it, what may be a problem to me may only be my problem; it may not be a problem for other people.\n\nSo what that means is that sometimes entrepreneurs who have not done their research assume that the problems they are solving must be relevant to lots of other people. We often come across businesses that are solving just a small problem, and that\u2019s not a bad thing. But when an entrepreneur says they want to scale into other markets, we may say that problem is not a real problem in those other markets, and doing so would be unrealistic. So I guess it\u2019s essential to understand your market opportunity, and from there, you work out who the right investment partners are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre there investment opportunities that you regret passing on?\n\nTo be honest, we do not regret any. I sometimes think when we\u2019re on the fence, it\u2019s probably at that point where a business is servicing a large customer market in its local base, and they are doing quite well from a revenue point of view. Then, the question is can they replicate this in other markets? If we pass on it, it\u2019s because we feel that they can\u2019t or there isn\u2019t a market opportunity in those markets. This is why I wouldn\u2019t say we regret passing over an opportunity.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nThere are many, but in South Africa, it would be hearX, which provides audiology solutions to the mass market using technology. The product is a smartphone-powered hearing aid. It\u2019s called hearScreen, and they\u2019ve successfully expanded into the US, so they\u2019ve got partnerships with Amazon and many other businesses and are selling thousands of these hearing aids across the US. They\u2019re now entering the UK, so that\u2019s a great example of a local company that has expanded into the US and now Europe.\n\nIn West Africa, we invested in Kuda Bank, which has been quite a success story. When we invested in the company, the revenue was quite low; I think they had about 200,000 active users. It\u2019s only been a year and a bit, but those 200,000 customers have grown to over 2 million customers, and they\u2019ve received support from top global investors, including Valar and Tiger Global.\n\nIn East Africa, we have another fintech called Tanda. They provide basic digital financial services to dukas. In South Africa, we call them spaza shops, but they\u2019re just local shops. They have more than 20,000 shops. Through their services, Tanda provides cash in cashouts and has probably become the most prominent provider in East Africa. They\u2019re expanding into other parts of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, etc., so that\u2019s a great success story as well.\n\nHow do you deal with failed investments?\n\nWe probably have scenarios where things have not gone according to plan. One scenario has to do with my point about things working in one market but not in another. So we invested in a business that was one of our earliest investments in South Africa, where it did very well, but when it looked to expand to other markets, it didn\u2019t do as well.\n\nIn that case, we responded by changing the offering to what the US customers wanted, and we split the company. So we started the US business using some of the technology from the business, but in a very different way, so you\u2019d probably call that a pivot. Fortunately for us, we managed to sell that business to Mailchimp in the US, so I guess what could have been a bad story turned out to be a decent story in the end. I guess that would be a product-market fit problem.\n\nAnother one that is a bit more sensitive and difficult would be when founders have quarrelled, and you as an investor have to try and sort this out. The actual product is still very good, but when two people are not getting along very well, that sets a bad tone for everyone else.\n\nWhat trends would you like to see in the startups coming from Africa?\n\nSo we see a lot of technology coming out of South Africa that could be used in the international markets, so we have 15 companies and three international exits in our portfolio. Those 15 companies are not all South African, but they service over 4 million customers in 180 companies worldwide. So while their main operations are in South Africa, Kenya, or Nigeria, they are very much international businesses. So we want to see African businesses succeed internationally.\n\nThe other one is using technology to service a large part of Africa. I guess that\u2019s why fintech seems to get a lot of airtime because you don\u2019t need a physical bank as long as you have a mobile phone and a decent Internet connection. It\u2019s one example, but there are many others \u2013 eCommerce, education, logistics, etc. You don\u2019t need a classroom to teach people. So we hope that more entrepreneurs start taking up the challenge of serving other sectors with a similar impact as fintech.\n\nIf you\u2019re an early-stage entrepreneur with some revenue, HAVA\u00cdC may be willing to invest in you. Simply send an email to info@havaic.com, and someone will be in touch with you.\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

          "text": "IHS, the largest tower company in Africa, may lose an eight-year-old N380 billion contract after MTN Nigeria required the deal to be denominated in the local currency, the naira.\n\nIHS controls many MTN Group tower assets in different parts of Africa including Nigeria. In 2014, IHS acquired 4,154 towers from MTN Nigeria and a further 4,696 towers in 2015. The transaction value of the deal was $52 billion.\n\nThe contract, which followed the acquisition of over 9,000 towers belonging to MTN in 2014, was denominated in dollars, but the recent depreciation of the naira and the acute dollar shortage in Nigeria are compelling MTN to force a change in the way the contract with IHS is priced. The tower service contract is arguably MTN\u2019s largest single-cost item.\n\nRead also: IHS buys MTN\u2019s towers, becomes largest asset owner in SA\n\nWhen the contract was first agreed almost 10 years ago, N160.37 fetched one US dollar on the official market but today MTN would require nearly three times as much in the local currency to buy one dollar where it is available. In the same way, the dollar value of MTN\u2019s annual revenues has fallen by the margin of naira\u2019s devaluation since 2014.\n\nBusinessDay learnt that MTN has told IHS in unclear terms that it could consider terminating the contract if an agreement on the dispute cannot be reached quickly.\n\nIHS recently went public on the New York Stock Exchange, which saw its valuation hit over $5 billion. The 9,000 towers from MTN Nigeria are more than 50 percent of IHS\u2019 tower assets in Nigeria at 16,522 towers. As of June 30, 2021, IHS operated 30,207 towers across five countries in Africa, three countries in Latin America, and one country in the Middle East.\n\nBusinessDay reached out to IHS for comments but a spokesperson for the company declined to comment on the deal.\n\nOlusola Teniola, former president, Association of Telecommunication Operators of Nigeria (ATCON), says while it is within the rights of parties in an agreement to seek to renegotiate a contract, there are also clauses to respect. In the case of MTN Nigeria and IHS, the contract is long-term and it is one that is often renewed after a duration of 10 years. Teniola says he is confident both parties would resolve the challenge.\n\nMTN holds 85,176,719 ordinary shares of IHS Towers, representing about 20 percent of the tower company, as a result of the IPO.",

          "title": "Rising oil prices, shipping hitches worsen malaria in Nigeria",
          "text": "Rising oil prices are driving up the cost of mosquito nets produced using materials derived from crude oil, and orders are held up on the season account of the global shipping and logistics challenges arising from COVID-19. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and its partners say this is fuelling malaria cases across Nigeria and the African continent.\n\nThis situation has been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted malaria services and driven attention and resources away from malaria and other diseases, leading to increase in cases and deaths.\n\nModelling analysis conducted by WHO and its partners has predicted that the number of deaths due to malaria could double in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) due to disruption in the accessibility of anti-malarial commodities in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to WHO\u2019s latest World Malaria report, there were an estimated 241 million malaria cases and 627,000 malaria deaths worldwide in 2020. This represents about 14 million more cases in 2020 compared with 2019 and 69,000 more deaths.\n\nApproximately, two-thirds of these additional deaths (47,000) were linked to disruptions in the provision of malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment during the pandemic.\n\nIn comparison, there have been at least 8,887,000 reported infections and 224,000 reported deaths caused by the novel coronavirus in Africa so far.\n\nNow, malaria programmes have the potential of taking a strong hit from the delays stemming from global logistics and shipping challenges and from the increasing costs of malaria commodities and shipping, warns Vestergaard, the world\u2019s leading bed net manufacturer, with about 1 billion bed nets produced, of which over 80 million have been shipped to Nigeria.\n\nRead Also: Malaria: Why we\u2019re distributing 3.3m mosquitoes nets to residents \u2013 ODSG\n\nThe delays and increased costs stem from a rapid rebound of the US economy following the COVID-19 induced slow-down of business activities. Specifically, the increasing costs of commodities are related to the increase of oil prices and other key raw materials for the manufacturing of these commodities.\n\nMichael Joos, CEO of Vestergaard, told BusinesDay in an interview that these cost increases have the potential to slow down the uptake of more effective and innovative technologies and chemicals against insecticide resistance and decrease coverage of populations at risk with life-saving bed nets.\n\nOn the other hand, if the adjustment of prices of key health commodities to reflect rising costs is prevented, this could result in supply disruptions, jeopardise the health of the market and investments in innovation, the company said in a recent release, he says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had over a million people die from malaria 15 years ago, at the turn of the century; we are down to about 400,000 people dying every year. Millions of people have been saved because of the overall malaria interventions, but since 2015, there has been a slowdown and it is getting worse,\u201d he notes.\n\nIn the past six years, rising malaria cases were rising due to insecticide resistance, as the mosquitoes are getting more resistant to the insecticides used in the bed nets, and in recent times, COVID-19 related supply chain disruptions, rising oil prices are complicating the problem.\n\nCrude oil is the key material in the production of Polyethylene-Based Long Lasting Treated Bed Net. Polyethylene is a thermoplastic polymer with a variable crystalline structure and a vast range of applications, depending on the type.\n\n\u201cWe have subsequently seen a doubling of the raw material costs of the basic of the key raw materials, and an up to 10-fold increase of the cost of shipping of these bed nets,\u201d he states.\n\nDonor agencies and global funds like UNICEF, President\u2019s Malaria Initiative (PMI), who used to support malaria and other diseases in Africa, are struggling to get funding at the moment, he says. The funding taps have also ceased to flow as they once did also because much attention has been diverted to COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThis is why we are raising the alarm, adding our voice to these other organisations to say, be careful, we can have resurgence in malaria, if we do not adequately fund this cost increase that is there because of materials and shipping,\u201d Joos notes.\n\nThe world has spent billions of dollars in the manufacture of vaccines and testing facilities for COVID-19 and have \u201cliterally forgotten to talk about the other diseases that also killed hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people,\u201d he states.\n\nIn 2019, the US Centres for Disease Control warned that funding for nets and other malaria prevention and control interventions was likely to plateau or even decline in the next few years due to the current economic situation.\n\nAccording to the US CDC, one way to maintain net coverage is to increase the lifespan of long lasting treated bed nets. It cited a study that estimated that up to $3.8 billion could be saved over 10 years by increasing the lifespan of nets from three years to five years.\n\nRising malaria cases on the continent do not bode well as it weakens the immune system making it vulnerable for COVID-19. Malaria alone accounts for up 40 percent of out-of-pocket healthcare costs in Africa according to the WHO, and is most responsible for lost productivity.",

God bless the Nigerian Navy, God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Onward Together,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe president commended the Nigerian Navy for maintaining a steady course in its drive for local content development, which is in tandem with the philosophy of this administration.\n\nHe said the federal government\u2019s commitment to properly equip the Navy with the right mix of platforms has seen the service take delivery of NNS LANA in May this year from France.",

          "text": "THE Federal Government said yesterday that the administration of booster dose to persons fully vaccinated with either two doses of AstraZeneca, Moderna or Pfizer Bio-N-Tech or a single dose of Johnson & Johnson vaccine will begin today.\n\nThe government described the booster dose as another opportunity to be further protected against COVID-19, calling on eligible persons to go for the vaccination.\n\nThe Executive Director, National Primary Health Care Development Agency, NPHCDA, Dr Faisal Shuaib, who disclosed these while flagging off mass vaccination of Internally Displaced Persons, IDPs, in Abuja yesterday, said the country had so far recorded no casualty among vaccinated persons.\n\nHe said: \u201cFollowing the detection of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in Nigeria, the Federal Government reviewed the country\u2019s vaccination programme and resolved to introduce the booster dose, using the Pfizer Bio-N-Tech vaccine across the country.\n\n\u2018\u2019This will take effect as from tomorrow (today), Friday, December 10, 2021. It is pertinent to reiterate the fact that the Nigerian COVID-19 vaccination programme is science-driven.\n\n\u201cEvidence has shown that the booster dose further increases protection against the virus. Eligibility for the booster dose includes being 18 years and above, fully vaccinated with either two doses of AstraZeneca, Moderna or Pfizer Bio-N-Tech or a single dose of the Johnson and Johnson vaccine.\n\n\u201cThe time interval before the booster dose is at least six months for these vaccines, except the Johnson & Johnson which is at least two months.\n\n\u201cThis is another opportunity to be further protected. I, therefore, urge all those who have taken the right decision to be fully vaccinated to walk into the nearest vaccination site for their booster dose as from tomorrow (today).\n\n\u201cI want to reassure everyone that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and efficacious. We have in place the required measures and precautions to ensure vaccine monitoring and accountability.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to ensure that our vaccination teams will be available on site here and in other camps daily until every eligible person has received their vaccines. I, therefore, urge camp leaders to take responsibility and ensure all members are fully vaccinated.\n\n\u201cPlease do not hesitate to demand for the vaccines if the teams stop coming and there are still unvaccinated persons in the camp. It is your right to get vaccinated.\u201d\n\nThe NPHCDA emphasized that taking the COVID-19 vaccine was not just an act of self-protection but a civic duty to curtail the spread of the virus in IDP camps and Nigeria.\n\n\u201c Every one of us has a critical role to play in mobilizing our friends, families, and camp mates to the vaccination site. Remember, no one is safe from COVID-19 until everyone is safe.\n\n\u201cEven after vaccination, let us continue to wear our face masks, wash our hands frequently, observe physical distancing and avoid large gatherings until Nigeria achieves full vaccination of all its eligible population,\u201d he said.\n\nExplaining that the vaccination was being done to fast-track the coverage of all eligible persons, he said: \u201c Our special attention on the IDP camps underscores government\u2019s recognition of the vulnerable conditions of our friends and families who are temporarily here.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday (yesterday), December 9, 2021, 7,361,810 Nigerians have received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and this represents 6.6% of the eligible population.\n\n\u201c3,846,762 eligible Nigerians have received their second doses and are fully vaccinated against the virus representing 3.4% of the eligible population.\n\n\u201cDespite the challenges of large-scale misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines, Nigeria has successfully vaccinated over seven million eligible persons, and I am glad to inform that none of these persons has died as a result of receiving COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\u201cIt is important to mention that the decision of over 7 million Nigerians to take the COVID-19 vaccine has been based on their rightful conviction that the vaccines are safe and effective in protecting them against the disease.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the courage, resilience and patriotism that Nigerians have continued to demonstrate in accepting to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

          "text": "A Nigerian Adedayo Ilori, resident in Queens New York, has been charged with $7.5M fraud against the United States government, an offence that carries a sentence of 10 years in prison.\n\nIlori, 42, was jointly charged with an American Chris Recamier, who is 56 years old.\n\nAn indictment was filed in Manhattan federal court Wednesdaay charging both men with a fraudulent scheme to obtain more than $7 million in Government-guaranteed loans designed to provide relief to small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nDamian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Keith A. Bonanno, Special Agent in Charge of the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General (\u201cDOJ OIG\u201d) Cyber Investigations Office, announced the indictment.\n\nTo benefit fraudulently from the relief available from the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (\u201cEIDL\u201d) Program, Ilori and Recamier falsely represented to the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) and private lenders that they operated a number of companies.\n\nThey used stolen identities and submitted falsified tax documents.\n\nThe case filed at the Manhattan court has been assigned to U.S. District Court Judge Mary Kay Vyskocil.\n\nRecamier and Ilori are both in custody.\n\nU.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: \u201cAs alleged, Adedayo Ilori has made quite a habit of committing loan fraud.\n\n\u201cWhile previously facing similar charges in a separate case involving loan and identity fraud \u2013 to which Ilori pled guilty in April of this year \u2013 he is once again alleged to have committed similar conduct to defraud the SBA and private lenders in an attempt to steal much-needed COVID-19 financial relief.\n\n\u201cIlori and his co-defendant, Chris Recaimer, now face criminal charges for attempting to steal over $7 million in funds specifically designated to assist small businesses struggling with financial hardships from the worldwide COVID pandemic.\u201d\n\nDOJ OIG Special Agent in Charge Keith A. Bonanno said: \u201cIlori and Recamier allegedly stole the identities of individuals and companies and fraudulently obtained over a million dollars intended to help those suffering from hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Pandemic Response Accountability Committee COVID-19 Task Force is dedicated to rooting out these kinds of schemes and bringing the fraudsters to justice.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Indictment unsealed Wednesday in Manhattan federal court, the Complaint filed against Recamier was made on October 8, 2021.\n\nFrom at least in or about August 2020 through at least in or about October 2021, ILORI and Recamier prepared to apply, and applied for numerous PPP and EIDL loans.\n\nIn applying for these loans, Ilori and Recamier claimed stolen identities of third parties.\n\nIn the role of these assumed identities, Ilori and Recamier claimed full control of a number of companies, which they purported, cumulatively, employed more than 200 people and paid more than $3.2 million in monthly wages.\n\nIn reality, they did not operate these companies. In submitting these applications Ilori and Recamier, among other things, submitted falsified tax documents that were never actually filed with the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nILORI and Recamier attempted to obtain over approximately $7.5 million in PPP and EIDL program funds, and successfully obtained more than $1 million as a result of their scheme.\n\nILORI and RECAMIER transferred the majority of these funds toward (1) cryptocurrency investments, the purchase of stocks, cash withdrawals, and personal expenses.\n\nThe investment accounts were also opened by ILORI and RECAMIER in the stolen identities of third parties.\n\nILORI committed these offenses while facing charges in a separate case filed in the Southern District of New York involving fraud, identity theft, and money laundering in United States v. Ilori, 20 Cr 378 (LJL).\n\nAs part of that case, ILORI pled guilty on April 8, 2021, to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, and is currently awaiting sentencing.\n\nAn attorney who represented Adedayo in the bank-loan case said she was not representing him in the COVID-19 relief fraud case and couldn\u2019t comment. She said Adedayo had been arrested several weeks ago for violating the conditions of his bail in the loan-fraud case, but that a new attorney hadn\u2019t yet been assigned for the new indictment which was unsealed on Wednesday.\n\nIn court papers, Adedayo said he had gotten involved in the bank-loan fraud scheme through a friend after his personal-training business, called DFine by Dayo Ilori, suffered due to the coronavirus pandemic and him contracting the virus.",

          "text": "Sultan of Sokoto Muhammadu Sa\u2019ad Abubakar has lamented the incessant killing of innocent Nigerians in the northern part of the country by terrorists.\n\nAlso, the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC) urged adherents of both Islam and Christianity to unite and tackle the menace of insurgency, banditry and other related crimes.\n\nThese positions were expressed Thursday during the 4th Quarter 2021 meeting of the NIREC themed \u2018NIREC, security agencies and peace in Nigeria,\u2019 Thursday in Abuja.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Sultan, who is also NIREC co-chair, said no single day passes by without people being killed in the region.\n\nThe Sultan called on Christians to disregard the recent threat by some unknown persons of being killed if found attending churches in Zamfara state.\n\nThe monarch said Nigeria was facing series of challenges, warning that if leaders didn\u2019t wake up and come together to understand the issues facing the country, the trend would escalate.\n\nHe, however, charged religious leaders to be wary of the kind of things they say to their followers, noting that their followers always believed they speak things from the Holy Bible and Holy Koran.\n\nWhile advocating dialogue to address some of the challenges in the country, Sultan Abubakar said the elite in the country remained the nation\u2019s major challenge.\n\nHe said: \u201cIf I continue talking about the insecurity in the North, we will not leave this room. Some few days ago, we were witnesses to the media report on how people were killed in a bus in Sokoto. Even though the figure is not correct, even one life is important. There is no single day that passes without people being killed in the North, especially in the North-west, but we don\u2019t hear it.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw a note that the bandits are threatening Christians in Zamfara, I asked, what is the work of our security agencies? Why will they come out and make such comment, when you have not verified it, because you are making people to be more frightened?\n\n\u201cI will not stop going to mosque to pray because I saw in a paper that if I go to mosque I will be killed. Let me be killed. I must die. So, Christians should not be afraid of going to church to worship because an anonymous person is threatening them.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not deceive ourselves everything is not alright. I have said this so many times. To know that you have a problem, you have part of the solution. The earlier we rise up to the occasion, come together, the better for us.\n\n\u201cWe have to be careful in the way we handle, say and do things as religious leaders. We are not political leaders. Therefore, we have to be wary of what we say, where and how we say such things, because our followers will definitely believe in what we say. They will believe and feel that it is from the Holy Koran or the Holy Bible.\n\n\u201cWe cannot go on telling things to people without thinking that they will believe. We cannot go on saying things that we know we don\u2019t have full knowledge of.\n\n\u201cI believe in dialogue, and l believe dialogue is the best option. We can sit down and talk to ourselves and come up with possible solutions to the problems of the majority. We are the minority here. We are the elite and the elite are the problems of this country, because we always want things to go our way,\u201d the Sultan further added.\n\nNIREC, CAN\n\nAlso speaking, Executive Secretary NIREC Rev. Fr. Cornelius Omonokhua called on Christians and Muslims to come together to fight terrorism and insecurity.\n\n\u201cNo terrorist can be a religious person and no religious person can be a terrorist. We must come together now to pray and fight those who have waged war against humanity in Nigeria,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, President Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Dr Samson Ayokunle said Nigerian roads had become a den of kidnappers and a no-go-area for travellers, wondering why persons would be kidnapped and security agents cannot trace the kidnappers to their hideout and rescue the victims.\n\nAyokunle, therefore, called for increase in intelligence gathering, urging the public to also volunteer information to the security agencies so that the movement of criminals could be traced and apprehended ahead of time.\n\nHe also tasked security agents to purge themselves of criminals among them \u201cwho aid and abet criminality.\u201d\n\nThe CAN president also called for more funding for security agents to acquire modern equipment that would enhance their performance, saying \u201cthere should also be deliberate efforts by the government to create enabling environment for the employment of youth, making it difficult for criminality to be appealing to them.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cTravelling from one point to another by road in particular have become a very great risk. Kidnappers are everywhere and they don\u2019t only come out to kidnap but also to kill. So, you don\u2019t know who the next victim is going to be.\n\n\u201cWhy should these people be killing and hiding people in our territory, without being challenged? Why should it be easy for them to hide people somewhere within the state and the security agencies in the state, within few days or weeks, will not be able to fish them out?\u201d he further queried.\n\nNEF, CNG summon stakeholders\n\nMeanwhile, the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) would organise a one-day summit for stakeholders to address the current security challenges in the north.\n\nAddressing select journalists Thursday in Abuja, CNG spokesperson, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, said the summit would be chaired by Convener Northern Elders Forum (NEF) Professor Ango Abdullahi.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) is agitated by the recent unchecked escalation of attacks and killings across Northern Nigerian communities, cities, towns and highways that have literally exposed the entire region to the mercy of Boko Haram-ISWAP insurgents to the North East, and ruthless banditry and kidnapping rings to the North West and North Central.\n\n\u201cAt the risk of overstating the case, we can unhesitatingly assert that, already, Nigeria\u2019s vast land borders with its northern neighbours have been completely overrun by assortment of armed criminal gangs, turning them into dangerous conduits for drugs, arms, smugglers, illegal immigrants and foreign fighters from countries in the troubled Sahel region.\n\n\u201cOur forests have become ungoverned spaces inhabited by insurgents, bandits, kidnappers and other criminals while major and vital highways in the region have been taken over by bandits who kill and kidnap with audacity, at will and with ease.\n\n\u201cPervasive insecurity in the region has cost the lives of thousands of people with thousands more displaced from their ancestral homes to IDP camps. People have been displaced from their farms and pushed deeper into poverty; education in the region is endangered due to school abductions. There is hunger, anger, gloom and terror in the region.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201dIn recognition of the enormity of these security and socioeconomic challenges, the CNG has resolved to embark on a massive mobilisation of all men and women of goodwill in the region and beyond, to raise their voices to give voice to our voiceless people.\n\n\u201cConsequently, the CNG has resolved to organise a Mega Pan Northern Nigerian Summit, under the chairmanship of the convener of the Northern Elders Forum (NEF), Professor Ango Abdullahi, to look into and proffer definite solutions to the security challenges in the region.\n\n\u201cThe Summit shall involve such critical stakeholders as traditional rulers, clerics of all faiths, academics, community leaders, security personnel, students, women, youth and all trade organisations, including ASUU, COASU, NUT, NUJ, NULGE, NGE, NURTW, NATO, vigilante groups as well as the business community.\n\n\u201cThe Summit has been scheduled for December 20 -21, 2021 at the Bon Hotel, 2 Monrovia Street, off Aminu Kano Crescent, Wuse.\u201d",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday said a former interim Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Bisi Akande is a \u2018\u2018perfect public officer,\u201d and a person he could go into the jungle with.\n\nSpeaking at the public presentation of \u2018My Participations,\u2019 the autobiography of Akande, Buhari stated that the author has retained inflexible integrity in and out of public office, adding that he never accepted or offered bribes.\n\nThe President also described the former governor of Osun State as a decent, truthful, and friendly person as well as an administrator of the first order, whose leadership qualities made him the unanimous choice as the first Chairman of the APC.\n\n\ufeff\n\nREAD ALSO: A Crushing Fall Awaits APC In 2023 \u2013 Elumelu\n\n\u201cMy first personal contact with Chief Akande was, if I recall correctly, in 2006 when preliminary consultations were coming to fruition for a grand coalition to unseat the PDP Government,\u201d Buhari was quoted as saying in a statement issued by his spokesman, Femi Adesina.\n\n\u201cThose efforts eventually came to nothing. Neither he, nor I, nor many of our friends and associates gave up as, in Chief Akande\u2019s words: \u201cthe country was going down and down under PDP\u201d (p.396 of My Participations).\u201d\n\nWhile noting how Akande rose to prominence from his participation in the Constituent Assembly established by the Military Government of General Olusegun Obasanjo, Buhari said the ex-Osun governor was always in the thick of things through the difficulties and political discontinuities of the 1980s and 90s.\n\nAccording to Buhari, Akande emerged as Governor of Osun State in 1999 when the military handed over to the civilians.\n\n\u201cChief Akande had a horrendous baptism as Governor of Osun State with discord from his own party; his State Assembly (including an attempt to impeach him without any reason whatsoever); from the trade unions and from his own deputy governor!\n\n\u201cOn top of that, he inherited a deeply indebted Treasury, huge arrears of salary, allowances, and pensions. Enough challenges to overwhelm many aspiring leaders.\n\n\u201cBisi Akande stood four square and faced all the challenges head-on and overcame most of them. His first action was to stop payment of \u201ccritical allowances\u201d a euphemism for government money customarily shared by the big boys in Osun State.\n\n\u201cThis set the tone of his Administration. By 2003 Chief Akande had virtually sanitised governance in Osun State having cleared some of the troublemakers from his government and, though reluctant to serve a second term, he was persuaded to run again,\u201d he said.\n\nThe President reflected on the political history of the author, particularly his bid to seek a second term as Osun governor.\n\nBuhari noted that Akande was the victim \u2013 along with other AD Governors \u2013 of a diabolical double-cross which ended his gubernatorial career.\n\nHe added that it was only APC National Leader and ex-Lagos governor, Bola Tinubu, whom the President said escaped the electoral massacre masterminded by President Obasanjo.\n\n\u201cDesperately disappointed though he was, and being a good Muslim, he accepted this setback as part of the trials of life. He looked to the future of service to the country.\n\n\u201cChief Akande was in the thick of further attempts in 2011 and 2014 to fuse together different groups and dislodge PDP from governance.\n\n\u201cThe key to his thinking which coincides with mine is that Nigeria can only be successfully managed by alliances between major groups.\n\n\u201cAlthough we failed in 2011, by persistence and knowledge that PDP was driving the country towards disaster, several major parties were able to finally coalesce into APC in 2014.\n\n\u201cChief Akande was unanimously chosen as the first Chairman of this great coalition. Throughout the difficult negotiations, I found Akande truthful, steady and always with an eye to the ultimate goal.\n\n\u201cIn or out of office, he has retained his inflexible integrity. On p.400 of his book, he wrote: \u2018I never gave to or demanded bribe from anyone all my life.\u2019 A perfect gentleman. A perfect public officer,\u201d Buhari stated further.\n\nQuoting a famous Hausa saying, \u201dLabarin zucciya a tambayi fuska\u201d (loosely translated -if you want to know what is in a man\u2019s heart watch his face), President Buhari affirmed that Akande has a permanent smile on his face, saying \u201dHe is the type I will go into the jungle with.\u201d",

I wish to reiterate that despite these challenges, our administration is very determined to ensure that the Navy is well supported to achieve its statutory responsibilities.\n\n\u201cLet me assure you that the Government will continue to support the ideals of the Nigerian Navy in the performance of its constitutional duties. God bless the Nigerian Navy, God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari Thursday in Lagos described Chief Bisi Akande, a former interim Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) party, as a \u2018\u2018perfect public officer,\u201d and the type of person he could go into the jungle with.Speaking at the public presentation of \u2018\u2018My Participations,\u201d the autobiography of Chief Bisi Akande, the President said the author has retained his \u2018\u2018inflexible integrity,\u201d in and out of public office, never accepting or offering bribes.\n\nThe President, who heaped praises on the former governor of Osun State, further described him as a decent, truthful, and friendly person as well as an administrator of the first order, whose leadership qualities made him the unanimous choice as the first Chairman of the APC.\n\nPresident Buhari used the occasion to narrate his first meeting with Akande, his passion for Nigeria, achievements, and disappointment as governor of Osun State as well as his many battles to wrest power from the then ruling party, the Peoples Democratic Party.\n\n\u201dMy first personal contact with Chief Akande was, if I recall correctly, in 2006 when preliminary consultations were coming to fruition for a grand coalition to unseat the PDP Government.\n\n\u201dThose efforts eventually came to nothing.\n\n\u201dNeither he, nor I, nor many of our friends and associates gave up as, in Chief Akande\u2019s words: \u201cthe country was going down and down under PDP\u201d (p.396 of My Participations), \u201d he said.\n\nThe President also narrated how Akande had risen to prominence from his participation in the Constituent Assembly established by the Military Government of General Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\n\u201dHe was always in the thick of things through the difficulties and political discontinuities of the 1980s and 90s.\n\n\u2018\u2018He emerged as Governor of Osun State in 1999 when the military handed over to the civilians.\n\n\u201dChief Akande had a horrendous baptism as Governor of Osun State with discord from his own party; his State Assembly (including an attempt to impeach him without any reason whatsoever); from the trade unions and from his own deputy Governor!\n\n\u201dOn top of that, he inherited a deeply indebted Treasury, huge arrears of salary, allowances, and pensions. Enough challenges to overwhelm many aspiring leaders.\n\n\u201dBisi Akande stood four square and faced all the challenges head-on and overcame most of them.\n\n\u201dHis first action was to stop payment of \u201ccritical allowances\u201d a euphemism for government money customarily shared by the big boys in Osun State.\n\n\u201dThis set the tone of his Administration,\u201d the President said.\n\nRecounting the achievements of the former Governor of Osun State, President Buhari noted that it is on record that within one year, Akande had paid off all the salary and other arrears, showing his mettle as a competent and serious administrator.\n\n\u201dBy 2003 Chief Akande had virtually sanitised governance in Osun State having cleared some of the troublemakers from his government and, though reluctant to serve a second term, he was persuaded to run again,\u201d he said.\n\nReflecting on the political history of the author, particularly his bid to seek a second term as Governor of Osun, President Buhari declared:\n\n\u201d It is common knowledge that Akande was the victim \u2013 along with other AD Governors \u2013 of a diabolical double-cross which ended his gubernatorial career. Only the steadfast Asiwaju Bola Tinubu escaped the electoral massacre masterminded by President Obasanjo.\n\n\u201dDesperately disappointed though he was, and being a good Muslim, he accepted this setback as part of the trials of life. He looked to the future of service to the country.\u201d\n\nReminiscing on APC\u2019s ascent to governance at the Federal level in 2015, President Buhari said:\n\n\u201dChief Akande was in the thick of further attempts in 2011 and 2014 to fuse together different groups and dislodge PDP from governance.\n\n\u201dThe key to his thinking which coincides with mine is that Nigeria can only be successfully managed by alliances between major groups.\n\n\u201dAlthough we failed in 2011 but by persistence and knowledge that PDP was driving the country towards disaster, several major parties were able to finally coalesce into APC in 2014 .\n\n\u201dChief Akande was unanimously chosen as the first Chairman of this great coalition.\n\n\u201dThroughout the difficult negotiations, I found Akande truthful, steady and always with an eye to the ultimate goal.\n\n\u201dIn or out of office, he has retained his inflexible integrity. On p.400 of his book, he wrote: \u2018I never gave to or demanded bribe from anyone all my life.\u2019 A perfect gentleman. A perfect public officer, he said.\n\nQuoting a famous Hausa saying, \u201dLabarin zucciya a tambayi fuska\u201d (loosely translated -if you want to know what is in a man\u2019s heart watch his face), President Buhari affirmed that Akande has a permanent smile on his face, saying \u201dHe is the type I will go into the jungle with.\u201d\n\nOn the book, President Buhari recommended it to students of Nigeria politics and the general public alike.\n\n\u201dThis book is a historical document. Students will find this an invaluable source of Nigeria\u2019s politics, notably between 1999 and 2020,\u201d he said.",

He eventually pleaded not guilty to six counts of felony disorderly conduct.\n\nThe two brothers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, testified that Smollett paid them to participate in a hoax and instructed them how to attack him. During the trial, the actor took the stand and disputed their accounts.\n\nAn attorney for the Osundairo brothers, Gloria Rodriguez, told reporters after the verdict that for Smollett the verdict meant it was \u201ctime to cut the act, time to come clean.\u201d\n\nLegal experts said Smollett would probably not spend significant time behind bars.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s certainly possible that he could receive a sentence involving prison time, the much more likely scenario is that he would receive probation with some amount of community service,\u201d former Cook County Prosecutor Eryk Wachnik told Reuters.\n\nCook County Judge James Linn did not set a date for sentencing, but scheduled a presentencing hearing for Jan. 27.\n\nSmollett\u2019s acting career declined after the incident.

          "text": "In a move signalling reciprocity of action, Nigeria\u2019s government, on Thursday reduced Emirates flights to the country, both Lagos and Abuja, from daily to once weekly which would be only on Thursdays.\n\nThe action followed the decision of the government of the United Arabs Emirates (UAE) to cut Nigeria\u2019s Air Peace flight operations to Sharjah to once a week.\n\nThe Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) announced the decision of the government in a letter titled: \u201cWithdrawal of Ministerial Approval of Emirates Airlines Winter Schedule, dated December 9, 2021 and addressed to the Country Manager, Emirates Airlines Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe letter signed by the Director General of NCAA, Captain Musa Nuhu read: \u201cI wish to inform you of the withdrawal of the approval granted to Emirates Airlines winter schedule. This approval was conveyed via a letter with reference number FMA/ATMD/501/C.104/XV/536 dated 1st December 2021 at 2300Z.\n\n\u201cPlease, kindly note, henceforth Emirates Airlines is granted approval to operate only one weekly passenger frequency to Abuja on Thursdays. Please be guided accordingly.\u201d\n\nEmirates, last Sunday, operated flights to the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos and the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, to kick off its return to daily flights to the two Nigerian cities.\n\nOn the other hand, a letter seen by THISDAY that was addressed to Air Peace on the matter stated: \u201cGreetings from Sharjah Airport. This has reference to your earlier request that we have received from your side to resume scheduled operations into Sharjah Airport for the winter season W21/22.\n\n\u201cKindly note that the proposed timings were coordinated with the various stakeholders at Sharjah Airport, despite the terminal congestion and various challenges that will be faced, and with the best intentions we kept in mind our long business relationship we enjoy with Air Peace.\n\n\u201cAs such we are pleased to propose the following timings: Once weekly flight every Thursday (day 4) with arrival time at Sharjah to be STA 01:00 UTC, and departure time from Sharjah will be STD 05:00 UTC.\n\n\u201cWe will be looking closely in the near future for any potential opportunities for Air Peace for the upcoming summer season S22.\u201d\n\nBefore its flights were suspended in February this year by the federal government, Emirates was operating two flights to Lagos daily and one flight a day to Abuja, which made it 21 weekly flights to Nigeria.\n\nIn order to enable Emirates Airlines have monopoly of direct flight from Nigeria to Dubai, UAE has refused to allow the Nigerian carrier operate to the Middle East country.\n\nInvestigations carried out by THISDAY revealed that before the federal government banned Emirates from operation to Nigeria then, the UAE wanted to use Rapid Antigen Test to stop Air Peace from operating to Dubai.\n\nUAE in several media statements had insisted that other airlines would not airlift Nigerians to Dubai and gave other stringent measures, including that Nigerian passengers must have to spend 14 days in another country after leaving Nigeria before they would be due to travel to Dubai if lifted by other airlines.\n\nAir Peace then stopped flying to the city when it became clear that its passengers would be made to conduct about three COVID-19 tests on arrival in the UAE at their own expense, thus making the flights very expensive for its passengers.\n\nThe federal government had resisted that and insisted that it did not have infrastructure for the Rapid Antigen Test and also insisted that airlines flying to Nigeria must abide by its own COVID-19 protocols.\n\nAfter UAE removed the Rapid Antigen Test for Nigerian travellers, the federal government lifted the ban on the airline, but informed source from NCAA hinted that UAE might not want Air Peace to operate to Dubai, while Emirates had already scheduled to resume flights to Nigeria on December 5.\n\nNCAA source disclosed that the Director General of NCAA had withdrawn from the first meeting that was to be held between Nigeria and UAE over the resumption of flights to both countries, when he learnt that Air Peace was not invited for that meeting and it was rescheduled and the Nigerian carrier was in attendance.\n\nInformed source also disclosed to THISDAY that in tandem with the policy of reciprocity of the federal government, the NCAA had resisted all attempts to marginalise the Nigerian carrier by denying it slot to operate to UAE, a policy that was lacking in the past, which led to the shortchanging of Nigerian carriers.\n\nMinister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, had explained how the federal government resisted UAE attempt to allow only Emirates to operate to Nigeria, using stringent COVID-19 protocol, which the minister described as discriminatory and ensured that Nigeria resisted it.\n\n\u201cGovernment should be applauded for standing its ground before this absolute impunity by UAE.

          "title": "Buhari Promised to Pick Tinubu as Running Mate in 2015, Ex-Party Chairman Akande Reveals",
          "text": "Former Governor of Osun state and ex-interim Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Bisi Akande, Thursday narrated how Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, as he then was, the presidential candidate of the party at the time, promised to pick Bola Tinubu as his running mate in the 2015 election.\n\nChronicling the events that led to the eventual selection of Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, Akande, in his autobiography, \u201cMy Participations\u201d, published by Gaskia Media Limited, disclosed how Buhari who was then under pressure to drop the former Lagos governor, later reneged on the agreement.\n\nIn the book which was launched in Lagos, the octogenarian also took a swipe at the trio of Ayo Adebanjo, Olu Falae and Sir Olaniwun Ajayi, coming short of accusing them of selecting themselves to represent the Yoruba people during Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s National Conference because of what he termed \u201cgenerous allowances.\u201d\n\nAkande stressed that despite the pledge to make Tinubu his vice presidential candidate, Buhari later faltered, saying that he only said that he wanted the former Lagos governor to \u201cpartner with him.\u201d\n\nBut the politician admitted that at the time Buhari was under enormous pressure, especially from some northern governors who insisted that a Muslim-Muslim ticket arrangement was a no-go area.\n\nHe revealed that it would be the second time that Tinubu would be getting very close to becoming a vice presidential candidate, noting that the first time was when Atiku Abubakar, who was then contesting as president later chose Ben Obi.\n\nAkande confirmed that Tinubu was instrumental to the emergence of Osinbajo as running mate to Buhari after he was formally dropped and asked to submit three names from the South-west from which Buhari would pick one.\n\nAccording to the book, Buhari at a point during the formation of the APC started to admire Tinubu for his business acumen and his ability to organise people, key features that got then candidate Buhari close to the APC national leader.\n\n\u201cIn April 2014, I was in Abuja when Buhari called me and asked me to persuade Bola to run with him. Governor Masari was the one who came to call me. When I followed him into Buhari\u2019s private lobby, Bola Tinubu was already seated there.\n\n\u201cSo, when Buhari tabled the matter, I cautioned them that this must not get out beyond the four of us. \u2018How could he be talking of a running mate when he had not secured the ticket?\u201d I mused.\n\n\u201cI thought such information, if leaked to the general public, might affect the conduct of the party\u2019s congress at the presidential primaries, if not its choice of candidate. I thanked Buhari for thinking so highly of our friend.\n\n\u201cBola later told me that Buhari\u2019s emissaries had been coming to him, but he tried to dodge the gesture and not to show interest. We agreed that we would reopen the matter when Buhari had secured the ticket,\u201d he explained.\n\nHowever, he expressed surprise that thereafter, when Buhari became the party\u2019s candidate, things changed, with former APC chair, Odigie Oyegun, who was supported by Tinubu to become chairman of the party, asking for names from the geopolitical zones from where Buhari will pick his running mate.\n\n\u201cHe said it was from this list that Buhari would choose a running mate. I objected. I turned to Buhari. \u2018General, where are you choosing your running mate from?\u2019 He answered, \u2018The South-west.\u2019 \u2018Oh! I didn\u2019t know,\u2019Oyegun said. He apologised.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know why Oyegun made that proposition and at whose behest. As the chairman of the party, maybe some people pushed him to do that,\u201d he noted.\n\nAkande continued: \u201cThen, I called Buhari aside. \u2018Is our arrangement still standing?\u2019 I referred him to our discussion in April. He said yes! \u201c\n\nAccording to him some members of the party eventually agreed that a committee should be set up to search for Buhari\u2019s running mate , a move himself and former Governor of Edo state, Adams Oshiohmhole, opposed.\n\n\u201cAdams Oshiohmhole , then Governor of Edo State, stood up and said we were being dishonest. He said he was a serving governor and many of those in the Elders Committee had been governors.\n\n\u2018\u2019Did we set up a committee to give us our running mates?\u2019 He asked. \u2018It is not fair!\u2019 He further said what we were pushing was a dangerous act and that we should allow Buhari to choose his running mate. So, we left,\u201d he narrated.\n\nAkande stated that he later came to know that some people constituted themselves into a group, called the Northern Interest Group, and they prevailed on Buhari not to allow a Muslim-Muslim ticket.\n\nAccording to him, it was the following day after the Elders\u2019 Committee meeting which was deadlocked, that Buhari phoned Tinubu to give him three names from which he would pick a running mate.\n\n\u201cWe were all in Abuja and Tinubu rushed to me with this information. He wanted to know whether the understanding we reached with Buhari had changed. I called Buhari and he told me he now needed three names from us. I was angry with him.\n\n\u2018\u2018General, this was not what we agreed upon,\u2019 I said in annoyance. \u2018You are changing our agreement?\u2019 He knew I was getting angry. He said he was under pressure from some governors from the north, including those who were Muslims. I told him the slot belonged to the South-West and among the Yoruba, religion is not a factor in leadership,\u201d he said.\n\nAkande added: \u201cOshiomhole was surprised about the narration. \u2018If indeed you promised to make Asiwaju your running mate, it would not be fair to renege,\u2019 he said. Buhari now said he never meant it that way. What he meant originally was that Tinubu should partner with him.\u201d\n\nThe former Osun governor explained that he didn\u2019t know what that meant because before they discussed the issue of Tinubu as the partner or vice-president\u2019s ticket, a merger had been accomplished and they had already partnered.\n\n\u201cWe were registered in July 2013, and he called me to prevail on Tinubu to be his running mate in April 2014. Buhari knew I was upset but we tried to manage the situation. Perhaps he was overwhelmed by all those pressures. We decided to let him go,\u201d Akande said.\n\nHe insisted that once it became apparent that Buhari would be the presidential candidate, he was interested in making Tinubu his running mate.\n\n\u201cIn our years of interactions and engagements, he seemed to have come to know and admire Tinubu.\n\n\u201cHe constantly seemed to admire Tinubu\u2019s business acumen; his courage in politics, his large heart, his native intelligence, his readiness to forgive those who have betrayed him but who now show remorse, his empathy for the under-privileged, his capacity as a tactician, and a strategist of the highest hue, his loyalty to the ideas of Nigerian unity and good governance, and his steadfastness to his friends,\u201d he added.\n\nAccording to him, without Tinubu, the \u201cAPC miracle\u201d would have been more difficult if not impossible. \u201cAll these made Buhari to admire and respect him,\u201d he said.\n\nHe narrated that what prompted the push for a Tinubu as vice president for the first time under Atiku was that anytime they said they needed money, Atiku would say \u201cBola please help us\u201d.\n\n\u201cBola (Tinubu) was the only one spending the money among us. The rest of us were poor. Tinubu also put all his energy and resources into the formation of the AC and we felt he deserved a spot on the ticket,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHe also wrote about Tinubu\u2019s frustration with the entire rigmarole, eventually opting to leave Abuja for Lagos.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be part of whatever you are discussing now, \u2018he said. \u2018I don\u2019t trust Buhari anymore! Even if we give him names, he may decide to go outside the list. So, let him choose on his own. He was unhappy with Buhari.\n\n\u201cI told him that was not the attitude to adopt. We were trying to toy with some names and I wanted him to participate in the discussion. After some time, Amosun, Aregbesola and I were considering some names. Then I decided to call Tinubu again.\n\n\u2018We negotiated with Buhari in 2011 and gave him a name to choose instead of Pastor Bakare,\u2019 I spoke to Tinubu on phone. \u2018Who was that person?\u2019 l asked.\n\n\u2018It was Yemi Osinbajo,\u2019 Tinubu declared. I asked Aregbesola to find out where Osinbajo was. He called him on the phone. \u2018Yemi, where are you?\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t you know your case is coming up tomorrow?\u2019 \u2018l am in Abuja to argue your case.\u2019 Osinbajo answered at the other end. \u2018Which hotel are you staying?\u201d Osinbajo told him.\n\n\u201cI got a blank sheet of paper and wrote Yemi Osinbajo on it. I instructed Amosun and Aregbesola to deliver that note to Buhari immediately. It was almost midnight. Then the two of them left.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI was waiting for Buhari to call me after he must have received my message. He did not. It was Tinubu who came to me at the wee hours of the morning. He was not in a good mood and was worried that Buhari might visit our efforts with bad faith.\n\n\u201cLet us go back to Lagos\u201d, he said. Why? I asked. \u201cMaybe Buhari has his own agenda,\u201d he said. Even if we give him a name , he might not use the person. Maybe he just wants to use us for whatever his agenda might be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI reassured him that Buhari will not disappoint us and that he would agree with our choice as the vice presidential candidate of our party,\u201d Akande said.\n\nTaking a swipe at the trio of Adebanjo, Ajayi and Falae, Akande said it was surprising that the elders could not find any younger Yoruba to send to the conference to represent the interest of the ethnic group.\n\n\u201c They believed, even in their old age, that they were the only people who could have gone there. Sir Ajayi, who was close to 90 at the time of the conference, has since joined his ancestors. Chief Adebanjo celebrated his 90th birthday in 2018. Chief Falae is in his 80s. Note that Jonathan paid the conference delegates generous allowances.\n\n\u201cChief Olu Falae, a trained civil servant, who after retirement became decorated into leadership by his former military bosses, has since been trying to blindly straddle Nigeria\u2019s complicated politics,\u201d he opined.\n\nHe characterised Adebanjo as a blank politically-minded leader who recognises readily and always that he never has what it takes to aspire for high political positions.\n\n\u201cHe constantly harbours lumps of yellow hate-bile in his heart for any co-political leader with brighter chances for any major public office within or outside his political party,\u201d he posited.\n\nAkande further noted in the autobiography that the APC did not have \u2018restructuring\u2019 in its manifesto for the 2015 elections but promised to support devolution of powers from the centre to the States.\n\n\u201cIt is therefore mischievous to place the responsibility for effecting restructuring on the APC or its presidency and not to appreciate that it would require deft negotiations among such members from different ethnic nationalities and constituencies or zonal and religious background before any political party or any ethnic nationality could successfully issue any fiat on the National Assembly to make laws on power devolution or on restructuring, whatever it might connote,\u201d he argued.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",
