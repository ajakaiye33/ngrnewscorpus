          "title": "354 days after defeating polio, Nigeria records 12 vaccine-derived cases \u2013UNICEF",
          "text": "Just 354 days after being declared polio-free, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, on Saturday, confirmed that cases of vaccine-derived poliovirus were recorded in 12 Nigerian states, saying it was supporting the country by procuring vaccines.\n\nThe World Health Organisation Independent Africa Regional Certification Commission for Polio Eradication, on August 25, 2020, officially declared Nigeria and the African region free of wild poliovirus.\n\nBut UNICEF\u2019s Health Manager for Maiduguri Field Office, Dr Clement Adams, in an email exchange with Sunday PUNCH, stated that countries across the world, including Nigeria, were experiencing an outbreak of vaccine-derived poliovirus.\n\nAdams said, \u201cThe current circulating poliovirus is the type 2 virus and a vaccine-derived outbreak. Currently, it is spreading and we have cases in 12 states. Please, note (that) every year, we have a number of vaccine-derived cases of polio and this is not the first time.\n\n\u201cThis has been happening over the years and in different countries as well. It is a threat and we are conducting campaigns to contain it.\u201d\n\nHe added that UNICEF was doing everything possible to work alongside the federal and state governments to ensure that it was effectively contained.\n\n\u201cIt is important we ensure an integrated response to all challenges so that we will continue the response of coronavirus, cholera and polio together. It can be managed by making sure we quickly immunise all children under five years.\n\n\u201cCurrently, we have done two rounds of campaign in Borno and one in Yobe. We have lined up campaigns till the end of year to ensure all children under five years are protected. We are encouraging all to help educate the general public about the importance of getting immunised.\n\n\u201cUNICEF is supporting in procuring all the vaccines, ensuring all cold chain is maintained, providing technical guidance, providing guidance on C4D and providing funds to support the campaigns.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, UNICEF has continued to ensure the availability of vaccines globally and will continue to do so in Nigeria, while strategising with GAVI and the government on ways to improve routine immunisation to effectively improve on child survival.\n\nA professor of Medical Virology, University of Maiduguri, Marycelin Baba, told one of our correspondents that the vaccine-derived poliovirus case recorded in Adamawa State on Saturday was capable of causing paralysis like the wild poliovirus.\n\nBaba said, \u201cThe vaccine-derived poliovirus has mutated so much and has the capacity of causing paralysis just like the wild polio because among the three stereotypes of polio, Type 2 is genetically so unstable and mutates very fast.\n\n\u201cIt is under control right now because the Centre for Disease Control (and Prevention) has produced NOPV2 vaccine for emergency use, so with the response, vaccination of children with the NOPV2 will fill that gap.\u201d\n\nShe noted that the case was recorded because of a vaccination gap, which had caused low immunity.\n\nSimilarly, a professor of Public Health, Tanimola Akande, stated that Nigeria remained free from wild polio, but not yet from vaccine-derived polio, saying, \u201cThe appropriate agency, the National Primary Health Care Development Agency, and its international partners should timely respond as this kind of virus is reported.\u201d\n\nAnother professor of Public Health, Clara Ejembi, warned that the vaccine-derived polio could degenerate if not quickly addressed as \u201cviruses change.\u201d\n\nEjembi said, \u201cThe first strategy for polio eradication is to have a strong immunisation programme such that 80 per cent of children are immunised as and when due. Viruses change, this is called mutation.\n\n\u201cThis is why we need to ramp up our immunisation. The NPHCDA should mount an outbreak response and go on immunisation campaigns, in addition give the inactivated polio vaccine. This is used in outbreak response.\u201d\n\nIn the same vein, the Chairman of the Nigeria National PolioPlus Committee of Rotary International, Dr Tunji Funsho, told one of our correspondents that there was no cause for alarm regarding the country\u2019s polio-free status.\n\nHe said, \u201cNo, there is no new case of polio. Nigeria remains polio-free. We have had a few cases in a few other (polio-free) countries, such as Cote d\u2019Ivoire, but after about six months, we don\u2019t have it there anymore.\n\n\u201cWe had it in the Philippines, which had been polio-free for 28 years. We put a lid on that as well, so it is not a threat. In the last nine months, we\u2019ve had it in Abia, Bayelsa, and Jigawa states.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, cases of vaccine-derived polio are the result of unsanitary environments where children are unimmunised.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "By Sola Ogundipe\n\nThe World Health Organisation, WHO, has expressed concern over the outbreak of Ebola in Cote d\u2019Ivoire more than 25 years after the last outbreak.\n\nThe outbreak which was confirmed by the Ministry of Health of Cote d\u2019Ivoire as the country\u2019s first case in 25 years was earlier confirmed by the Institut Pasteur in Cote d\u2019Ivoire of the Ebola Virus Disease in samples collected from a patient, who was hospitalised in Abidjan, after arriving from Guinea.\n\nLamenting the development in a statement, the WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, said: \u201cIt is of immense concern that this outbreak has been declared in Abidjan, a metropolis of more than four million people. However, much of the world\u2019s expertise in tackling Ebola is here on the continent and Cote d\u2019Ivoire can tap into this experience and bring the response to full speed.\n\n\u201cThe country is one of the six that WHO has supported recently to beef up their Ebola readiness and this quick diagnosis shows preparedness is paying off, \u201d Moeti remarked.\n\nAccording to initial investigations, the patient that travelled to Cote d\u2019Ivoire by road and arrived in Abidjan on Thursday 12 August before being admitted to a hospital after experiencing fever is currently receiving treatment.\n\nGuinea experienced a four-month long Ebola outbreak, which was declared over on 19 June 2021 even as there is no indication that the current case in Cote d\u2019Ivoire is linked to the earlier outbreak in Guinea.\n\nFurther investigation and genomic sequencing will identify the strain and determine if there is a connection between the two outbreaks.\n\nALSO READ: Health authorities declare Ebola outbreak in Guinea over\n\nIn 2021, Ebola outbreaks have been declared in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Guinea, but it is the first time an outbreak has occurred in a large capital city such as Abidjan since the 2014\u20132016 West Ebola outbreak.\n\nAlready, WHO is helping to coordinate cross-border Ebola response activities and 5000 Ebola vaccines doses which the organization helped secure to fight the outbreak in Guinea are now being transferred to Cote d\u2019Ivoire, following an agreement between the ministries of health of Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Guinea.\n\nAn aircraft is departing Abidjan soon to collect the vaccines which will be used to vaccinate people at high risk, including health workers, first responders and contacts of confirmed cases.\n\nWHO staff based in Cote d\u2019Ivoire are supporting the investigation into the case. In addition, a multidisciplinary team of WHO experts covering all key response areas will be deployed rapidly to the field.\n\nThey will help with ramping up infection prevention and control of health facilities, diagnostics, contact tracing, treatment and reaching out to communities to ensure they take a key role in the response.\n\nCote d\u2019Ivoire declared the outbreak in line with International Health Regulations and WHO does not advise any travel restrictions to and from the country. While countries are focused on the COVID-19 response, they should strengthen their preparedness for potential Ebola cases.\n\nAccording to the WHO, while Cote d\u2019Ivoire borders Guinea and Liberia which were struck hard by the 2014\u20132016 West Africa Ebola outbreak, the country has had no confirmed cases reported since 1994, when an outbreak among chimpanzees infected a scientist.\n\nEbola is a severe, often fatal illness affecting humans and other primates. Case fatality rates have varied from 25 percent to 90 percent in past outbreaks. There is now effective treatment available and if patients receive treatment early, as well as supportive care, their chances of survival improve significantly.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "*Tells Buhari: \u2018Don\u2019t assent to new Electoral Act without e-transmission of poll results\u2019\n\n*2023 will be turning point in Nigeria\u2019s history\n\n*Nigeria\u2019s unity not by force\n\n*Hunger, starvation staring Nigerians in the face\n\nBy Luminous Jannamike, Abuja\n\nThe Presbyterian Church of Nigeria has criticised the Federal Government for the decline in Nigeria\u2019s internal security, saying the 2023 general elections will be a mirage unless the government became more aggressive in the fight against terror.\n\nThe Presbyterian Prelate, His Eminence Nzie Nsi Eke, who spoke on Friday at a world press conference to mark the Church\u2019s 175th anniversary in the country, stated that insecurity was driving the Nigeria steadily into a failed State.\n\nHe also said that it would be insensitive to take for granted the agitation for the country\u2019s break-up, or approach the issue of Nigeria\u2019s unity with force.\n\nAccording to him, without equity, justice, inclusiveness and fair play, unity is difficult.\n\nOther issues of national interest the Presbyterian Prelate urged the Federal Government to address for the country to move forward include; hunger and starvation, electronic transmission of election results, and youth empowerment.\n\nHe said, \u201cAs a church that had existed long before Nigeria existed as a nation and who played a lot of significant positive roles for the emergence of the nation and still playing, we are deeply concerned about the State of the Nation with particular reference to the following issues:\n\nInsecurity\n\n\u201cThe fact that we can no longer sleep with our two eyes closed in most parts of Nigeria is no more news. The level of banditry, kidnappings and herdsmen attacks, robbery, cult crises and the likes has been driving Nigeria steadily into a failed State.\n\n\u201cWhile we appreciate the sacrifices our security agencies are making to keep us safe and some recent gains they have made in the battle to keep Nigeria safe, we want to encourage government to get more aggressive in the fight otherwise 2023 elections will be a mirage.\n\n\u201cOur prayers continue to go with all those who are being held captive by bandits and kidnappers. We hereby declare 30 days of special prayers from Sunday, August 15, 2021 for the release of those who are in captivity across the country. This should be communicated to all our members nationwide.\n\nHunger\n\n\u201cArising from the combined impact of COVID \u2013 19 pandemic, insecurity and our weak currency, hunger and starvation is staring Nigerians in the face.\n\n\u201cThe way food prices have skyrocketed, an emergency program should be declared to increase food supply in the country because a lot of people are finding it very difficult to feed.\n\n2023 Elections\n\n\u201cProphetically, we believe 2023 elections will be a turning point in the history of our nation. As a church, we are going to labour in prayers and mobilization towards that election.\n\nE-Transmission of election Results\n\n\u201cWe support e-transmission of election results because it will go a long way to mitigate electoral malpractices. We are living witnesses to what happened in the last Edo elections. It gave us hope for the possibility of freer and fairer elections in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cWe believe it is not too late for the National Assembly to amend their decisions on this otherwise, the President should not sign the new electoral bill until the e-transmission included.\n\n\u201cWe pray our President will write his name in the sands of time, as one of those leaders in our nation\u2019s history who significantly improved our electoral process.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Unity\n\n\u201cBecause of our firm believe in the unity of Nigeria, we encourage government to take seriously the current the spate of separatist agitations that has been rocking our nation in recent times. The situation should not be taken for granted or approached with force.\n\n\u201cWe suggest a constructive engagement of all agitators. Without equity, justice, inclusiveness and fair play, unity is difficult. We must not pretend to be united country, we must truly unite or agree to go our separate ways to avoid an implosion.\n\nYouth Empowerment\n\n\u201d Our young people remain the greatest asset of our nation. I congratulate them on the recent celebrations of the International Youth Day. I encourage our young people to see themselves as drivers of change.\n\n\u201cGovernment at all levels, religious organizations and the entire society must work together to create an enabling environment for our youths to be innovative and excel. This is the key to a sustainable future for our country.\n\n\u201cWith God on our side, we shall continue to move from Glory to Glory and our nation Nigeria will also experience a greater glory. We must continue to put our trust in God and acknowledge Him in all our ways.\n\n\u201cWe must also continue to be good and law abiding citizens of our nation. The God who has been our help in ages past, will be our help in the years to come.\u201d",

          "text": "By Bisi Oladele and Segun Showunmi, Ibadan\n\nNational Vice Chairman (Southwest) of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Taofeek Arapaja on Saturday explained he joined others to call for the resignation of the National Chairman Uche Secondus because the party is crumbling under his leadership while he is undisturbed.\n\nArapaja stated this while featuring on Southwest Political Circuit, an interview programme on Ibadan-based Fresh FM 105.9.\n\nThe PDP leader was among those calling for Secondus\u2019 resignation in the last two weeks, which led to the meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC), governors and members of Board of Trustees (BoT) last week.\n\nThe meeting prevailed on members to stop the move to force out Secondus and fixed national convention of the party for October.\n\nArapaja, who was recently elected, said he added his voice because the national chairman was not showing signs he wants PDP to win future elections.\n\nHe also alleged he was also not running the party in a way that it will provide virile opposition to the governing All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nArapaja, who was the deputy governor of Oyo State from 2007 to 2011, explained that Secondus did not give a damn that three governors defected to the APC within three months.\n\nRather than agonize over such defections, he alleged the PDP boss retorted on occasions that each of them has only one vote to contribute.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe described such attitude as selfish, stressing that he could not be comfortable with such a leader that does not seek the progress of the party.\n\nRather than make genuine moves to resolve crises rocking the party in states and regions, Arapaja said Secondus was completely nonchalant.\n\nAccording to him: \u201cYou will not like to change a winning team. But if a team is not winning, and your objective is to win, because I\u2019m committed to winning and I don\u2019t understand any other language apart from winning, then I will be spared for calling for his resignation.\n\n\u2018\u2019Somebody is in a place and he is not doing well. The party is shrinking, everything is going haywire and he is not mobilizing for the party. The man is not doing well. There is defection everywhere. Three governors left within three months. And the chairman is coming out to tell everybody that every governor has only one vote. He is not perturbed, he is not worried at all. National Assembly members are defecting and he is not harmonizing the party. He is not reaching out to anybody.\n\n\u201cHe is just sitting down in Abuja. So, the party is not doing well. We are not playing the role of a very strategic opposition party.\n\n\u201cSo, for those of us who believe in winning, repositioning the party, we had to stand up before the party collapses.\n\n\u201cIf you are committed to the party, if you are not PDP in the morning but APC in the night, you will be worried.\u201d",

They had set out in a convoy for the burial on Saturday morning when violence broke out along the way at Rukuba road.\n\nAs they went with the corpses, they met some vans conveying some Fulani along their way. The Fulani reportedly claimed they were commuters from Bauchi, but the angry youths challenged them seeing that Rukuba road does not connect Bauchi highway. They suspected that they may have come to attack them at the burial ground.\n\nThe youths allegedly pounced on the Fulani, injured some and killed others before the security agents could reach the spot. The violence began to escalate before the security agents arrested it.\n\nReacting to the fresh violence, the Governor of the state, Simon Lalong condemned the killings, especially as it involved innocent commuters, and immediately directed security agencies to swiftly identify and arrest the perpetrators while dominating the area to restore calm.\n\nIn a statement signed by his Director of Press, Simon Macham reads in part: \u201cGovernor Simon Bako Lalong has warned trouble makers bent on fomenting trouble in Plateau State to desist as the government will not allow any form of lawlessness to disrupt the peace of the State.\n\n\u201cLalong said the attacks on innocent citizens no matter their backgrounds will never be tolerated in Plateau State and those who are found to be behind such attacks will be dealt with decisively to serve as deterrence and restore public order.\n\n\u201cThe Governor however commends security agencies for their immediate response leading to the arrest of some suspects and the restoration of calm to the area.\u201d\n\nThe Governor also commiserated with the families of those affected, and assured all law abiding citizens that security had been beefed up around the area as well as the entire metropolis to forestall further breach of the peace.\n\nHe reminded the citizens to remain vigilant and be security conscious in reporting suspicious persons and behaviour within their domains to enable law enforcement agencies to respond appropriately.\n\nLalong also directed the Secretary to the Government of the State, Prof. Danladi Atu to visit the areas and ascertain the situation as well as ensure that those injured received adequate medical attention.\n\nThe peace of the state has been troubled by series of skirmishes in recent times, leading to several deaths and destruction of properties, especially in Bassa and Riyom Local Government Areas.

          "text": "*Buhari: He was a hero; his lofty ideals will continue to motivate all\n\n*Obasanjo: Nigeria would have broken into pieces but for Joda\n\n*An Iroko has fallen, says Atiku\n\nCharles Ajunwa in Lagos, Deji Elumoye and Chuks Okocha in Abuja and Daji Sani in Yola\n\nElder statesman and former federal \u201cSuper Permanent Secretary\u201d, Ahmed Joda, died yesterday at the age of 91.\n\nIn a swift tribute, President Muhammadu Buhari highlighted Joda\u2019s \u201cmonumental contributions to Nigeria\u2019s unity and progress,\u201d from birth of the nation until his death, saying \u201chis lofty ideals will continue to motivate millions across the nation.\u201d\n\nOne of Joda\u2019s associates, Mohamed Baba told THISDAY that he died in the afternoon at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Yola, after a prolonged illness.\n\nAnother source said Joda had been buried according to Islamic rites.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019m talking to you, the elder statesman has already been taken to the family cemetery for burial,\u201d the source said.\n\nJoda will always be remembered as the chairman of the 18-member transition committee nominated by the President Muhammadu Buhari to receive the handover notes from the Goodluck Jonathan-led administration in 2015.\n\nHe rose through the administrative cadre of the Northern regional government, and then the federal civil service, to retire as Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Industries. During the administration of the youthful General Yakubu Gowon, he was considered to be among a group known as Super Permanent Secretaries.\n\nJoda was born in Girei Local Government Area of Adamawa State in 1930. His great-great-grandfather was Modibbo Raji, a 19th-century Islamic scholar and contemporary of Sheikh Usman Dan Fodio.\n\nHe attended Yola Elementary and Middle schools before proceeding to Barewa College. After completing his secondary education in 1948, he was admitted to Moor Plantation, Ibadan.\n\nHe worked briefly at an agricultural centre in Yola. Then, in the 1950s, he attended Pitman College, London and gained practical experience in journalism while staying in Britain. On his return to Nigeria, he practiced journalism at Gaskiya Corporation, Zaria.\n\nHe later worked with the then Northern Broadcasting Corporation in Kaduna before joining the Northern Nigeria civil service as Chief Information Officer.\n\nJoda became a federal permanent secretary in 1967 in the Ministry of Information and subsequently moved to Lagos.\n\nHe retired into private business during the second Republic, where he served as chairman and board member of various companies, including the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation; Nigerian Communications Commission; SCOA Nigeria; Chagoury Group; Flour Mills of Nigeria, and the Nigerian LNG.\n\nHe was also a member of the 1988 Constituent Assembly which planned the constitutional transition of the Third Republic. In 1999, he was appointed as a member of the Committee to Advise the Presidency on Poverty Alleviation and in 2015, headed the Buhari presidential transition.\n\nBuhari: He was a Hero for all Nigerians\n\nIn his tribute to Joda, who is the last surviving member of Governor Hassan Usman\u2019s Northern Nigeria cabinet, President Buhari highlighted his \u201cmonumental contributions to Nigeria\u2019s unity and progress\u201d, saying \u201chis lofty ideals will continue to motivate millions across the nation.\u201d\n\nThe President, in a release issued by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, noted that the late \u201cSuper Permanent Secretary\u201d, as Joda and some of his colleagues were referred to in the 1970s, \u201cdistinguished himself as a remarkable scholar, journalist, intellectual, public servant and farmer.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari called Joda \u201ca hero for all Nigerians\u201d who, even in death, \u201cwill continue to inspire every generation to move forward with love, brotherhood and harmony.\u201d\n\nHe prayed to Allah to accept his good deeds and grant fortitude to those he left behind in his family, Adamawa Emirate Council and the entire people of the state, to bear the loss, adding, \u201cWe will not forget his sacrifices.\u201d\n\nObasanjo: He was not Just a Nigerian, But, a True and Great Nigerian\n\nEx-President Olusegun Obasanjo described Joda\u2019s death as \u201cheartbreaking\u201d.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, signed by his media aide, Kehinde Akinyemi, Obasanjo said the late Joda was his friend for about 60 years.\n\nThe ex-President explained that the late former Federal Permanent Secretary saved the unity of Nigeria shortly after the 1966 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat when others insisted that Nigeria should collapse.\n\nObasanjo described Joda \u201cas not just a Nigerian, but, a true and great Nigerian, committed to unity, development and progress of the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cOh! What a heartbreaking news, that my friend for well over 60 years has passed to the great beyond. If every Nigerian have the attributes of Joda, Nigeria will have been better than what it is now.\n\n\u201cAhmed Joda by his feature did not need to tell you he is a Fulani man, but, in everything I know he did, he lived not just as a Fulani man, he lived, he worked and he laboured as a true Nigerian. They are not many like him, and that was what strengthens our relationship since 1959,\u201d Obasanjo was quoted to have said.\n\nHe said they met when he was a Second Lieutenant in the Nigeria Army and Joda was a Deputy Chief Information Officer in the Federal Civil service.\n\nObasanjo recalled that the effort of Joda and his other Super Permanent Secretaries as they were fondly called in the then civil service saved Nigeria in 1966.\n\nAccording to the former President, \u201cI know that if not for people like Joda and other Senior Permanent Secretaries, as they were called Super Permanent Secretary as at that time, after the second upheaval of 1966, we would have had Nigeria broken into pieces.\n\n\u201cBut, it was Ahmed Joda and other Super Permanent Secretaries (senior civil servants) like Philip Asiodu, Liman Ciroma, Alison Ayida who prevailed not to have Nigeria broken up.\n\n\u201cWell, Dear Ahmed, you have served your family, your community. You have served your country and indeed humanity, you have done your best, including working for the transition between the Buhari administration and Jonathan administration.\n\n\u201cYou have done your best working with me on the progress and programme of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library. You have done your best on becoming the Chancellor of Bells University. We love you, but God loves you best. Rest permanently in the bosom of Allah,\u201d Obasanjo added.\n\nAn Iroko Has Fallen, Says Atiku\n\nThe former vice president, Atiku Abubakar expressed shock about the death of Joda, saying \u201can iroko tree has fallen.\u201d\n\nIn statement he signed, Atiku said: \u201cToday, our beautiful Adamawa State has lost a colossus. Indeed, an iroko tree has fallen in Nigeria particularly Northern Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe said that the news of the death of Joda, came with some kind of a jolt even though he lived to a prime old age.\n\nThe former vice president said Jorda belonged to the first generation of Adamawa indigenes that put the state and the North in the map of modern Nigeria.\n\nAtiku said: \u201cHis stature as an accomplished administrator was towering and colourful. He was a shining star in the galaxy of Nigeria\u2019s public servants.\n\n\u201cAhmed Joda, with a few of his peers, wrote the rule book of Nigeria\u2019s civil service and his footprints will remain indelible.\n\n\u201cNigeria mourns this great Nigerian with immense contribution to growth of our country, we pray that the Almighty Allah accepts his soul and provide his family with fortitude to bear the loss of a forthright and iconic patriarch.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",
          "summary": "He rose through the administrative cadre of the Northern regional government, and then the federal civil service, to retire as Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Industries.\nDuring the administration of the youthful General Yakubu Gowon, he was considered to be among a group known as Super Permanent Secretaries.\nHe later worked with the then Northern Broadcasting Corporation in Kaduna before joining the Northern Nigeria civil service as Chief Information Officer.\nJoda became a federal permanent secretary in 1967 in the Ministry of Information and subsequently moved to Lagos.\nIf every Nigerian have the attributes of Joda, Nigeria will have been better than what it is now.",

          "text": "Kingsley Nwezeh in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday admitted the challenges of insecurity bedeviling the country, even as he hailed his government and security agencies\u2019 response to the situation as \u201crobust.\u201d\n\nIn his message at the graduation of Course 29 of the National Defence College (NDC), Abuja, delivered by the Minister of Defence, Maj. Gen. Bashir Magashi (rtd), President Buhari said despite the rising insecurity, his government and the security agencies\u2019 responses had been strong, determined and robust.\n\nHe added that in spite of the challenges, his regime had consolidated the peace in the Niger Delta and recovered vast territories formerly taken over by terrorists in the North East.\n\nThe President said his government was focused on taking the country out of the security challenges.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe are making continuous efforts at consolidating the progress made in improving the enabling security environment for peace and development. I commend personnel of the Nigeria Police Force, intelligence and security agencies, as well as local vigilante and community groups for their efforts at securing the nation.\u201d\n\nHe said the government had also focused on non-kinetic actions centred on humanitarian efforts to reduce the distress of the people and improve human conditions.\n\nAccording to him, some of the measures include disarmament, demobilisation and rehabilitation, deradicalisation programmes, political reconciliation measures and instruments of development intervention.\n\nBuhari charged the 96 graduands to \u201cdeploy the eleven months values of knowledge, skills and aptitudes acquired in the college to improving the overall service delivery in the defence of the national security to make the country safer and secured.\u201d\n\nThe president, therefore, renewed his faith in the nation and expressed the determination of his administration to take the country to greater heights by leveraging technological innovations which he said were evident in the profound changes in the national democratic space and policy environment.\n\nIn his remarks, the Commandant of the National Defence College, Rear Admiral Oladele Daji, who had earlier confered the prestigious award of fellow of the NDC on the graduands, appealed for presidential intervention for the speedy completion of projects at the permanent site of the college at Piwoyi, Abuja.\n\nRear Admiral Daji said the completion and relocation of the college to its permanent site would be the icing on the cake of the 30 years anniversary next year since the establishment of the institution.\n\nThe climax of the ceremony was the presentations of certificates and awards to the graduands by the representative of the special guest of honour, who was also led by the commandant to undertake a tour of the college museum.\n\nThe course, which commenced in September 2020, had 22 participants from the Nigerian Army, 25, from Nigerian Navy and 11 from Nigerian Air Force.\n\nThere were 24 participants from Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs), comprising six from Nigeria Police, three each from Department of State Service (DSS), National intelligence Agency (NIA) and Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), among others.\n\nThere were also 14 international participants from 10 African countries, Niger, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Mali, Ghana, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Republic of Congo and Chad, as well as from allied counties of Bangladesh, Nepal and Germany.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "*Shell N13.77bn, Total E&P Nigeria N4.59bn, Eni N2.29\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nThe federal government, through the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), may be liable for roughly N25.24 billion, that is 55 per cent of the total N45.9 billion court-ordered compensation against Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), for oil spillages in Ejama Ebubu community in Ogoni, Rivers State, THISDAY learnt yesterday.\n\nThough, Shell is the operator of the affected oil field, some analysts said last night the Joint Venture (JV) arrangement implied that all the partners would be responsible for the judgment award to the Ogoni community, \u201csince they must all absorb all liabilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe judgment is against one of SPDC\u2019s joint ventures and the partners would have to contribute in the proportion of their interests,\u201d remarked one analyst.\n\nHowever, another analyst said it might not be that straight forward, arguing that all the joint venture partners would only be liable, \u201cdepending on the JV agreement and the operator agreement signed.\n\nShell only runs the operations of joint ventures (JVs) in Nigeria where the federal government is the holder of 55 per cent of the assets.\n\nIf it turns out that all the JV partners are liable for the Ogoni compensation, based on the JV/operator agreement, Shell is expected to pay its share of 30 per cent of the recompense, estimated to be N13.77 billion; Total E&P Nigeria Limited will pay its 10 per cent, about N4.59 billion; while Eni which holds five per cent will pay the least amount of N2.29 billion.\n\nThe affected oil field has the government-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation \u2013 NNPC owning (55 per cent share), SPDC (30 per cent), Total E&P Nigeria Ltd (10 per cent) and the Eni subsidiary Agip Oil Company Limited (five per cent), according to details on Shell\u2019s website.\n\nLast Wednesday, Shell finally agreed to pay an agreed compensation after a long legal battle, which commenced in 1991 over the spill that occurred 31 years ago, but was silent on the liabilities of the JV partners.\n\nJudgment first came in favour of the Ogoni community in 2010, courtesy of Justice Ibrahim Buba of the Lagos division of the Federal High Court.\n\nThe oil giant had initially declined payment and proceeded up to the Supreme Court twice; first in 2017 to appeal the judgment of the Court of Appeal, which had upheld the judgment of the trial court and in 2019, to seek a review of the apex court judgment dismissing its appeal.\n\nAham Ejelamo, a lawyer to Shell, the local arm of the Royal Dutch Company, said the company resolved to pay the monetary compensation awarded in 2010 after several attempts to amend earlier judgement failed.\n\nHe informed the court of the decision to pay up the money and sought permission of the trial judge, Justice Ahmed Mohammed, to make payment through the Chief Registrar of the court in a bank account to be opened for the purpose.\n\nHowever, Mohammed ruled that the money should be paid through the counsel to the Ogoni community, Chief Lucius Nwosu (SAN).\n\nThe development will put further strain on the finances of NNPC, which is currently struggling to meet its obligations to its stakeholders, including the federal and state governments, having been consistently unable to remit up to 30 per cent of its statutory contribution to the federation account for several months.\n\nThose to benefit from the judgment include the people of Ejama Ebubu, a community in Tai Eleme local government area of Rivers State, one of the six kingdoms in Ogoni land, while other kingdoms are Babbe, Eleme, Gokana, Ken-Khana, and Nyo-Khan.\n\nThe Shell\u2019s nod ended the legal tussle that entangled the oil giant and the community for decades.\n\nThe case was instituted in 2001 by 10 representatives of the Ejama Ebubu community against the oil company for the losses caused by the oil spills.\n\nA source at Shell said: \u201cThe spills occurred during civil war\u2026 it was caused by the soldiers. And immediately after the war, we mobilised, cleaned, and remediated the site. We got a certificate from National Oil Spill Detection & Response Agency (NOSDRA) to that effect. The case is one-sided and judgement without justice.\u201d\n\nShell had argued in court: \u201cThis spill was caused by third parties during the Nigerian Civil War, a challenging period, which resulted in significant damage to oil and gas infrastructure in the region. While SPDC does not accept responsibility for these spills, the affected sites in the Ebubu community were fully remediated.\n\n\u201cThe claimants have, at their own admission in court, materially miscalculated and overstated the value of the award previously sought in this case. The ruling of the Supreme Court did not decide liability or the size of the award, which remains in dispute in other ongoing court proceedings.\n\n\u201cIt is our position that any attempt to enforce payment should not be permitted. It is regrettable that the legal process in this case had focused for so long on procedural issues and not the merits of the case. We have always maintained that we are ready to defend this case based on the available facts.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s currently an ongoing negotiation between the federal government and the oil giant as to its future operation in the country, with the company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Ben van Beurden, insisting in May that the company could no longer bear its exposure to the risk of theft and sabotage in the Niger Delta.\n\nWith 19 Oil Mining Leases (OMLs) in its SPDC subsidiary, a THISDAY report quoted Wood Mackenzie , a global research firm, yesterday as valuing Shell\u2019s JV assets in Nigeria, excluding export pipelines and terminals, at $2.3 billion.\n\nShell is planning to sell off all its assets in the shallow waters and onshore, leaving only its offshore operations intact in Nigeria.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Nigerians in the United Arab Emirates have complained of their inability to renew their labour visas in the country.\n\nOne of the affected Nigerians, who reached out to SaharaReporters, explained that the ban by the UAE government on Nigerian work permits resulted in the loss of jobs of many Nigerians in the country while others had been forced to return to Nigeria.\n\nHe stated further that it was now a difficult task for him and other Nigerian nationals to secure jobs in the country as he lamented that the non-renewal of labour visa was about to earn him a dismissal from his company.\n\nHe urged the Chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, to come to the rescue of Nigerians in UAE as the Nigerian Embassy was yet to make serious intervention ino the matter.\n\nHe explained that the majority of the companies in the country operated under labour visas for immigrants while a few others operated in a \u201cfree zone.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, those in the free zone were currently renewing their visa while those under labour were currently having a challenge.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe (Nigerians) have been denied work permits here in Dubai since last month. And this is affecting many Nigerians here in UAE. We are not able to renew our work permits once the ones we hold expire.\n\n\u201cThe company I have been working for since 2015, that has been compensating me well, has sent me a letter that due to the inability to renew my visa, my appointment will be terminated on August 21, 2021, so that they won't be implicated in legal matters. I have been working for this company since 2015.\n\n\u201cI am not the only one facing this problem. Many Nigerians at the company I work for and in other places are experiencing this; we are about 20 Nigerians at this company. Some have been out of jobs and considering this is not their country, they have returned to Nigeria. More Nigerians will still be sent back to Nigeria as long as this issue persists.\n\n\u201cMost companies here are under labour and it is not possible to renew the Nigerians labour visas for now. It is only free zone visas that are being renewed and this free zone visa is only issued to a few persons.\n\n\u201cAnother thing is, it is difficult to secure jobs here in Dubai because of the high level of crimes our guys have committed here.\n\n\u201dBut those of us who are working legally have had issues with renewing our passport. Please help us call on the NIDCOM Chairman, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, to come to our aid.\u201d\n\nA group representing the interest of Nigerians in the country, Nigerians in Diaspora Organisation, UAE, also revealed plans to start an online protest to register the displeasure of those affected by this.\n\nA post on the Facebook page read, \u201cThe Nigeria government should rescue her citizens languishing and frustrated in UAE due to long impasse between the two countries. #RescueNigeriansInUAE #EndTheLongImpasse #StrengthenLaborTies\n\n\u201cWe have made submissions and forwarded to the respective Authorities for their perusal.

          "title": "Dear God, let oil price fall to $44",
          "text": "If you think this is a satire, then you are taking life too seriously. It is time to start thinking about unusual solutions to Nigeria\u2019s unusual problems. There is no use following the regular route to address our irregular situation. For instance, conventional wisdom says Nigeria needs higher oil prices to address its cyclical budgetary woes caused by its over-reliance on the black gold. We are locked in a situation where high oil prices get us high and lower oil prices take us low. In the past, we were able to build fairly robust reserves and stabilise the naira whenever oil prices went high. Not anymore. A three-year high of $76 in July has not improved our fortune, all things considered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSomething unusual has been happening in recent times that many Nigerians are obviously unaware of or are not paying much attention to. As crude oil prices started going up, the naira started going down. Why? Higher oil prices did not amount to higher inflow of FX into the economy as you would expect. Instead, we have seen the exchange rate in both the official and unofficial markets go against the naira. Along the line, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) announced that it would no longer fund bureaux de change (BDCs). Although funding BDCs has always been an anomaly on Nigeria\u2019s long list of anomalies, not funding them tells us a bigger story of distress, so to say.\n\nThe trouble, as I see it, is that higher oil prices have hurt more than helped Nigeria in recent times. Gone are the days when we enjoyed more comfort when the prices headed for the skies. These days, the higher the price, the bigger the pain for the government and the citizens. Higher oil prices led to higher petrol prices and higher cost of living for Nigerians, with the impact manifesting in growing poverty. Outside the direct impact on Nigerians, we are also unable to produce the quantity of oil we used to because of the cut in quotas by OPEC+ in an attempt to shore up the prices. From the height of two million barrels per day, we are now constrained to 1.4mbpd or so. Do the math.\n\nBut here is the peculiarly Nigerian problem: as crude oil prices rise and the cost of petrol goes up and we continue to subsidise the product in order to, as we claim, \u201cprotect the poor\u201d, even the little benefit we are earning from higher oil prices largely goes back into paying for the subsidy, according to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), which is now the sole importer of petrol. This administration came to power accusing previous governments of lying about subsidy, so it had to come up with its own terminology, \u201cunder-recovery\u201d, in place of \u201csubsidy\u201d. But it is the same. It doesn\u2019t matter if you say Saul or Paul: it is the same name. \u201cPaul\u201d in Greek is \u201cSaul\u201d in Hebrew.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNNPC, according to recent reports, has not remitted one dollar to the CBN since mid-April. Why? The corporation says most of the revenue from oil exports \u2014 from where Nigeria gets over 90 percent of its forex inflow \u2014 has been ploughed back into financing \u201cunder-recovery\u201d. Let me put it this way: with crude oil going as high as $76, Nigeria did not benefit much because we had to spend the bulk of the gains to finance subsidy and keep petrol price at N162 per litre. NNPC says we are now consuming over 100 million litres per day. Last year, the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) put the figure at 38.2 million litres. Don\u2019t ask how consumption tripled within one year. Please don\u2019t.\n\nThere is a template answer to the question if you insist on asking: smuggling. Because of the price difference with our neighbours (they adjust their pump prices as crude prices change), our default assertion is that most of our imported petrol is smuggled out of the country via land borders. Petrol is about N373/litre in Republic of Benin and N630 in Cameroon. I do not dispute the role of smuggling in the burgeoning consumption figures, but I must allow myself to speculate that we can\u2019t be rustling the difference between 38.2 million litres and 100 million litres out of the country every day. That is about 60 million daily. That comes to about 2,000 tankers crossing the borders daily.\n\nI do not want to go into insinuations this early morning, so let us take the NNPC figures exactly as we have been served. But Alhaji Yusuf Lawal Othman, national president of the Nigerian Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO), recently raised questions about the daily consumption figures. \u201cThe system needs to be reorganised,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why you have 200 filling stations in a local government that does not consume more than 45,000 litres. I also don\u2019t see how the depot which normally does programming per day will programme quite a number of trucks to a local government which does not consume more 45,000 litres per day.\u201d Not my words. Othman\u2019s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMallam Mele Kyari, the group managing director of NNPC, gave us a pack of interesting data recently. Hear him out: \u201cIf we are to sell at the market today at current exchange rate, we will be selling the product at about N256 to a litre. What we sell today is N162, so the difference is at a cost to the nation\u2026 The difference comes back to as much as N140 billion to N150 billion cost to the country monthly. As long as the volume goes up, that money continues to increase and we have two sets of stress to face: stress of supply and stress of foreign exchange for the NNPC\u2026 There was a day we loaded out about 103 million litres of PMS across the depots.\u201d He too is at a loss as I am.\n\nI have, therefore, come up with what I think is a peaceful solution to the problem: by praying fervently that crude oil price should drop to $44 per barrel. Since Nigerians are not benefitting from rising oil prices, I now think we should start benefiting from low prices. Crazy? Maybe. But I will advance three reasons to support my prayers that the time has come for crude prices to plummet again. Someone will be tempted to ask: how did I arrive at $44? That was the price of crude oil as of September 2020 when petrol price was increased to N162 per litre. I will also be working with the exchange rate in the parallel market which was N450/$ at the time and N500/$ today.\n\nHere we go. One, if oil goes back to $44, there would be no need for \u201cunder-recovery\u201d again. In plain English, we would not be discussing subsidy. NNPC would not be giving us a subsidy bill of between N140 billion and N150 billion monthly. The recent meetings of the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) ended in tears as there was no enough money to share. The steady rise in oil prices did not come with a steady amount in the distributable pool because, as we have said already, NNPC said it had to first recover the cost of bringing the product into the country before sending the balance to the CBN for onward journey to the federation account. At $44, subsidy will be gone.\n\nAnd this leads to my second prayer point, which may be contradictory and controversial \u2014 but I know what I am doing. With oil back at $44, you would expect me to say petrol should also go back to N145 as it was in September 2020. I wouldn\u2019t say that for many reasons. One, transport operators are unlikely to pass the benefit to commuters, so it would be a waste of effort. Two, if we insist on using pricing to curb smuggling (since the thousands of security officials at the land borders cannot see the smugglers\u2019 2,000 trucks driving past them every day), our petrol will become more expensive than in neighbouring countries who use crude oil prices to determine their own pump prices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to curbing smuggling through pricing \u2014 an admission that our security agencies are too corrupt to tackle the smugglers \u2014 we can even start making money from the sale of petrol. How? At N162/litre with oil at $44, we have already moved from subsidy to tax. That means we are now taxing the consumption of petrol. That also means we would be making money from selling petrol rather than spending money to sell it! That is nothing new: that obtains in advanced countries. A litre of petrol is \u00a31.3 (N735.8) in the UK, out of which 57.95 pence (or N323) is tax. The UK government levies 20 per cent VAT on every litre of petrol as well as on the duty. Just saying.\n\nThe third point on my prayer list is that if crude oil falls to $44, NNPC will have to start remitting more forex inflow from crude oil sale to the federation. There will be nothing like \u201cunder-recovery\u201d again. There will be no talk about smuggling. There will be no subsidy bill of N150 billion per month. That can solve a lot of problems, the least being the ability of states to pay salaries again. The CBN will have to stop \u201cprinting money\u201d (by creating loans) to intervene in the fiscal crisis ravaging the three tiers of government. That alone should allow the naira to breathe a little \u2014 with reduced pressure from inflation along with some oxygen support from more forex inflow from oil sale.\n\nIs this a satire? I don\u2019t even know again. My original intention was to point out the peculiar mess in our economic management and how a bad fortune in the oil markets may be a good thing for us, but I am now taking it more seriously than I intended. When an oil-rich country has to hope that crude prices will drop so that public finances and citizens\u2019 welfare can improve, it tells us a lot. It tells us about the warped structure of the economy, about our warped management of the petroleum resources, and about how we are locked inside what looks like a vicious cycle that must be broken. So, seriously speaking, oil dropping to $44/barrel may be a good prayer point \u2014 at least for now.\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nCONTAINING COVID\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHajia Hadiza, the 80-year-old widow of former President Shehu Shagari, died on Thursday from COVID complications, according to the family. I want to make two points here. One, I want to implore families who have lost loved ones to the pandemic to make the information public. Hopefully, a few sceptics would repent and join the efforts to fight the disinformation. Two, COVID is still very much around. It is better not to have COVID at all than assume you would survive it. COVID can cause long-lasting damage to internal organs such that even after you have tested negative, the side effects can make other ailments bring you down. Please wear a face mask properly to save lives. Caution.\n\nAMERICAN MISADVENTURE\n\nIn 2001, the US invaded Afghanistan to dislodge the Taliban government and enthrone democracy by any means necessary, foul or fair. After spending nearly $1 trillion on military operations, losing over 2,000 military personnel, with more than 20,000 injured and close to 40,000 civilians killed \u2014 not to talk of the spin-off wars which must include, at least tangentially, the Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria that has killed over 30,000 and displaced as many as two million \u2014 the US has finally pulled out of Afghanistan, paving the way for the Taliban to fight their way back to power. We are back to square one, plus the irreparable damage and the irreversible waste of lives. Hindsight?\n\nLIONEL MESSY\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLionel Messi broke down in tears last week while announcing that he was parting ways with FC Barcelona of Spain, where he had spent 21 years of his life and won everything winnable. The 34-year-old genius said: \u201cThis is really difficult for me after so many years, being here my entire life, I\u2019m not ready for this\u2026\u201d Last year, he announced, without tears, that he wanted to leave Barcelona. He changed his mind after a stand-off. This year, strict financial rules mean Barcelona can\u2019t afford his renegotiated salary. So after those sad tears on Sunday, he moved over to join PSG in France for a salary of $1 million a week. He\u2019s having a laugh. The Bible says \u201cmoney answereth all things\u201d. Goal!\n\nADIEU, MOHAMMED\n\nMohammed Fawehinmi died on Wednesday after reportedly complaining of respiratory difficulties. He was 52. The first son of late Chief Gani Fawehinmi lived with a disability: an expectation to be like his activist father who gave military dictators a good run for their money. Gani was detained in horrible conditions countless times as he campaigned for rule of law and democracy all his adult life. The younger Fawehinmi, who also trained as a lawyer like his father, suffered a life-changing injury in a car crash in 2003 but he still managed to contribute a decent quota to the campaign for good governance in Nigeria from the wheelchair. His death is so painful but what can we do? Adieu.",

With oil back at $44, you would expect me to say petrol should also go back to N145 as it was in September 2020. I wouldn\u2019t say that for many reasons. One, transport operators are unlikely to pass the benefit to commuters, so it would be a waste of effort. Two, if we insist on using pricing to curb smuggling (since the thousands of security officials at the land borders cannot see the smugglers\u2019 2,000 trucks driving past them every day), our petrol will become more expensive than in neighbouring countries who use crude oil prices to determine their own pump prices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to curbing smuggling through pricing \u2014 an admission that our security agencies are too corrupt to tackle the smugglers \u2014 we can even start making money from the sale of petrol. How? At N162/litre with oil at $44, we have already moved from subsidy to tax. That means we are now taxing the consumption of petrol. That also means we would be making money from selling petrol rather than spending money to sell it! That is nothing new: that obtains in advanced countries. A litre of petrol is \u00a31.3 (N735.8) in the UK, out of which 57.95 pence (or N323) is tax. The UK government levies 20 per cent VAT on every litre of petrol as well as on the duty. Just saying.\n\nThe third point on my prayer list is that if crude oil falls to $44, NNPC will have to start remitting more forex inflow from crude oil sale to the federation. There will be nothing like \u201cunder-recovery\u201d again. There will be no talk about smuggling. There will be no subsidy bill of N150 billion per month. That can solve a lot of problems, the least being the ability of states to pay salaries again. The CBN will have to stop \u201cprinting money\u201d (by creating loans) to intervene in the fiscal crisis ravaging the three tiers of government. That alone should allow the naira to breathe a little \u2014 with reduced pressure from inflation along with some oxygen support from more forex inflow from oil sale.\n\nIs this a satire? I don\u2019t even know again. My original intention was to point out the peculiar mess in our economic management and how a bad fortune in the oil markets may be a good thing for us, but I am now taking it more seriously than I intended. When an oil-rich country has to hope that crude prices will drop so that public finances and citizens\u2019 welfare can improve, it tells us a lot. It tells us about the warped structure of the economy, about our warped management of the petroleum resources, and about how we are locked inside what looks like a vicious cycle that must be broken. So, seriously speaking, oil dropping to $44/barrel may be a good prayer point \u2014 at least for now.\n\nAND FOUR OTHER THINGS\u2026\n\nCONTAINING COVID\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHajia Hadiza, the 80-year-old widow of former President Shehu Shagari, died on Thursday from COVID complications, according to the family. I want to make two points here. One, I want to implore families who have lost loved ones to the pandemic to make the information public. Hopefully, a few sceptics would repent and join the efforts to fight the disinformation. Two, COVID is still very much around. It is better not to have COVID at all than assume you would survive it. COVID can cause long-lasting damage to internal organs such that even after you have tested negative, the side effects can make other ailments bring you down. Please wear a face mask properly to save lives. Caution.\n\nAMERICAN MISADVENTURE\n\nIn 2001, the US invaded Afghanistan to dislodge the Taliban government and enthrone democracy by any means necessary, foul or fair. After spending nearly $1 trillion on military operations, losing over 2,000 military personnel, with more than 20,000 injured and close to 40,000 civilians killed \u2014 not to talk of the spin-off wars which must include, at least tangentially, the Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria that has killed over 30,000 and displaced as many as two million \u2014 the US has finally pulled out of Afghanistan, paving the way for the Taliban to fight their way back to power. We are back to square one, plus the irreparable damage and the irreversible waste of lives. Hindsight?\n\nLIONEL MESSY\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLionel Messi broke down in tears last week while announcing that he was parting ways with FC Barcelona of Spain, where he had spent 21 years of his life and won everything winnable. The 34-year-old genius said: \u201cThis is really difficult for me after so many years, being here my entire life, I\u2019m not ready for this\u2026\u201d Last year, he announced, without tears, that he wanted to leave Barcelona. He changed his mind after a stand-off. This year, strict financial rules mean Barcelona can\u2019t afford his renegotiated salary. So after those sad tears on Sunday, he moved over to join PSG in France for a salary of $1 million a week. He\u2019s having a laugh. The Bible says \u201cmoney answereth all things\u201d. Goal!\n\nADIEU, MOHAMMED\n\nMohammed Fawehinmi died on Wednesday after reportedly complaining of respiratory difficulties. He was 52. The first son of late Chief Gani Fawehinmi lived with a disability: an expectation to be like his activist father who gave military dictators a good run for their money. Gani was detained in horrible conditions countless times as he campaigned for rule of law and democracy all his adult life. The younger Fawehinmi, who also trained as a lawyer like his father, suffered a life-changing injury in a car crash in 2003 but he still managed to contribute a decent quota to the campaign for good governance in Nigeria from the wheelchair. His death is so painful but what can we do? Adieu.",

          "title": "Beyond funding, MAGIC Fund\u2019s value-add helps early-stage founders scale",
          "text": "For a founder, the startup world is an exciting yet very challenging one.\n\nWhile there have been many startup success stories over the past two decades, globally, the majority fail to make it past early-stage due to a number of reasons; inadequate funding, business model/strategy failure, or product/market challenges.\n\nThe odds are even greater for startups based in emerging regions like Africa, where there is a dearth of funding, an economy-crippling infrastructure gap, a massive consumer base with low purchasing power, political hostility and uncertainty as well as fragmented markets.\n\nA lack of access to capital is often cited as the biggest reason businesses fail in Africa and other emerging markets. But apart from funding, it can be helpful for founders in such markets to also get mentoring \u2013 preferably from people who have first-hand experience \u2013 as they embark on their startup journey with unknowns and untread paths.\n\nWith this in mind, a global collective of startup founders with expertise in several industries and geographies has been providing both access to capital and mentorship to early-stage startups and founders for more than three years.\n\nA fund by founders for founders\n\nMAGIC Fund, launched in 2017, is an early-stage venture capital fund built by founders turned investors. It has 12 founders from across the world who act as general partners with the Co-founder and CEO of Helium Health, Adegoke Olubusi, serving as managing partner, and Matt Greenleaf as operating partner.\n\nThe fund is built on two theses. One, that pooling funds and resources of individual founder-investors together open the group to more opportunities for investments, which they could then evaluate better using their diverse skill sets.\n\nMost founders-turned-investors go the angel investing or venture capital way alone, a practice that often comes with geographical and expertise limitations.\n\nRealising this, Greenleaf and MAGIC\u2019s other partners \u2013 who met Olubusi when Helium Health was going through the Y Combinator accelerator programme in 2017 \u2013 co-invest together.\n\n\u201cMAGIC is like a fund of micro funds built by founders,\u201d Greenleaf told TechCabal in an interview. \u201cBefore we started, we were all into some kind of investing as founders but realised that with our expertise in particular industries, it would make more sense to consolidate our collective intelligence and streamline our angel investment practice through a fund,\u201d he explained.\n\nMAGIC Fund 1 was $1.5 million, comprising the founders\u2019 personal monies according to Greenleaf.\n\nWith its first fund, MAGIC invested in over 70 companies at pre-seed and seed stages across Africa, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Southeast Asia.\n\nHelping founders on their journey\n\nTwo, MAGIC believes that smaller funds run by founders perform best in early-stage investing. Thus, the fund backs startups solving challenges across the world at their earliest stages.\n\nMAGIC has provided founders with more than just money, Greenleaf notes.\n\nUnlike traditional investors whose main focus is getting sweet returns on investments, the founders-investors at MAGIC with startup experience also look out for how much value they can drive for startups invested in.\n\nMAGIC\u2019s investment comes with support for founders through knowledge sharing and sessions with experts in relevant fields. This way, they help early-stage founders find product-market fit, fine-tune business models, and fundraising strategies for successful seed rounds.\n\nAccording to Greenleaf, the Fund\u2019s partners offer mentoring, advice, and network connectivity to support investee-founders as they scale their businesses.\n\n\u201cWe bring that general knowledge and know-how to help other founders run a company from zero to 100,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have people in the team who have started multiple companies and have access to people who have helped build unicorns. With that collective knowledge of the team, we provide mentorship.\u201d\n\nMAGIC Fund\u2019s expanded team.\n\nSome of the startups MAGIC has invested in and supported so far include Bankly, Mono, Eden Life, Evolve Credit, Indicina, Bamboo, Chronus Health, Oxygen, Kiwibot, etc.\n\nBy investing in startups and mentoring early-stage founders, Olubusi believes the way MAGIC Fund operates provides the general partners an opportunity to give back to their ecosystems.\n\n\u201cLater-stage founders whose companies have gone beyond the initial pre-seed, seed, or product-market fit stage have a very critical role to play in facilitating and helping grow their ecosystem,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the things we get to do at the fund.\u201d\n\nWhat next?\n\nAfter seeing success from its investments \u2013 MAGIC Fund 1 performed 5x over the period of three years, according to Olubusi \u2013 the company has raised a second fund of $30 million announced recently.\n\n\u201cWe had fully deployed the first fund so we thought: why not scale up the strategy since it worked so well and bring a few more people on board?\u201d Greenleaf said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a full-time dedicated team for fund 1 but now have that and 15 general partners who help with different industries. Obviously, $30 million is a lot of money to deploy and manage.\u201d\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nSome of the new partners joining the MAGIC team are the founders of startups invested in under Fund 1 but have exited. According to MAGIC, one-third of the new fund was contributed by the founder-general partners.\n\nMAGIC\u2019s limited partner base is diverse, with 50% of them black and 33% women. Some of the LPs are Paystack\u2019s Shola Akinlade, Olugbenga Agboola, the CEO of Nigeria\u2019s Flutterwave, and Hendra Kwik of Payfazz in Southeast Asia, Katie Lewis, Michael Seibel, Kirsten Connell of Octopus Ventures, Tim Draper, etc.\n\nJoining as partners are Evercare\u2019s Temi Awogboro, Troy Osinoff, Tom Chen of Stitchroom, Elvis Zhang of Oxy2, Medumo\u2019s Adeel Yang, and Juice\u2019s Michael Lisovetsky.\n\nMagic Fund 2 will be writing $100,000 to 300,000 checks at pre-seed and seed stages, Greenleaf revealed. The global fund is sector agnostic and plans to focus on fintech, healthcare, SaaS and enterprise, women\u2019s health, developer tools, etc.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article\n\nMichael Ajifowoke | Author",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.",

At the event, I learnt practical strategies on how to navigate through Nigeria\u2019s unique market. With the grant my business won, I was able to get a refrigerator for my business, which was a pressing need at the time.

          "title": "I want more women to become angel investors \u2014 Yemi Keri on angel investing and building Rising Tide",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in the workplace, and this also plays out in the venture capital space. According to Crunchbase, global VC funding to female founders dropped in 2020. Their figures show that 800 female-founded startups received $4.9bn from investors \u2014 a 27% decrease from the same period in 2019.\n\nOne reason for this is low representation in VC firms. Axios reports that 12.4% of decision-makers in US venture capital firms are women. And only 10% of West African startups that cumulatively raised $1m between 2010 and 2020 had at least one female co-founder.\n\nThis is a problem Yemi Keri, one of a handful of women investing in African startups, is passionate about solving. After getting a taste of angel investing with the Lagos Angel Network and seeing how hard it was for women to get funded, she co-founded Rising Tide Africa to get more women involved in angel investing.\n\nTechpoint Africa caught up with her for a chat, and she held nothing back as she shared her experience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did you get started with angel investing?\n\nI got into angel investing by referral with the Lagos Angel Network. Now I\u2019m on the board, but I got started there. I think this was 2014/2015, and Tomi Davies had started off Lagos Angel Network and wanted a group of us to come in and understand what it was all about. If I recall correctly, he brought about 50 of us together, and every so often, we would meet and listen to pitches.\n\nI used to watch and listen to the kind of questions that were asked. My background is in information technology, so this was new to me at the time. I made two investments \u2014 in Cafe Neo and Big Cabal \u2014 with Lagos Angel Network, and that\u2019s how I came into angel investment.\n\nWhat was the attraction to these companies?\n\nFor Cafe Neo, it was the revenue and expansion model and the target audience (youthful demography). In the case of Big Cabal, the passionate team, the possibility of catering for multiple audiences, and the various products that were in the pipeline when we invested won me over.\n\nWhat influenced the founding of Rising Tide?\n\nAround 2016, I began to toy with the idea of having a female-focused angel network because many of the people who came to pitch were men who got more attention and interest than the few women who showed up. And this made me wonder. It wasn\u2019t by design, but I began to notice that, first of all, the questions they asked women were kind of different.\n\nSecondly, the women were not communicating effectively to the investor team, and the kinds of businesses they pitched were slightly different. Women often do their businesses with a sense of passion. As we approached 2017, a lady came to pitch one of the best products in the healthcare sector \u2014 it still is today \u2014 but she couldn\u2019t convey it very well.\n\nI think it was her first few months of fundraising, so Ndidi Nnoli-Edozien and I took her aside and began to mentor her. We took her to pitches; we would put a group of women together and tell her to pitch. We would then question her thoroughly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nAfter a while, we brought her back to the team, and everybody was impressed and wanted to invest. They got to the point of negotiations, and the rest is history. Though we did not invest then, she\u2019s doing well. I knew that there was a gap and that we had hit on something we could develop.\n\nSo Ndidi and I got together and started Rising Tide Africa, which has been my major focus. We founded Rising Tide to increase women\u2019s participation in angel investing so that they can see it as an asset class; the end goal is to invest in more female founders. We believe that with more female angel investors, we can reduce the gender funding gap for female entrepreneurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat was the genesis of Rising Tide, and it is a vehicle in which we are now investing. Lagos Angel Network has metamorphosed into a network of networks. Now we have different networks within Lagos Angel Network.\n\nHow many startups has Rising Tide invested in?\n\nBy 2019, we had done six. By the end of 2020, we had 15 investments. In 2021 we have made six investments. That would mean 21 investments in all, and we have completed the due diligence for two others, for which we are about to call for funds.\n\nHow many investments have you made?\n\nRight now, I\u2019m on my 19th investment.\n\nWhat is Rising Tide\u2019s average ticket size?\n\nWe initially said we would start with $25,000, but so far, our largest ticket size is $289,000. We intend to do between $50,000 and $200,000.\n\nYou mentioned wanting to increase female participation in both startups and angel investing. What else drives your investment mission?\n\nRising Tide is set up on four major pillars, one of which is investments.\n\nThe other thing that we do is education. We now have about 64 members at Rising Tide, and some of them are new to angel investing, so we have to do a lot of educating.\n\nWe try to teach them about things going on in the ecosystem so they can be better investors. We also educate the entrepreneurs. Over the years, we\u2019ve organised training and masterclasses for our founders and others in the ecosystem. We are now developing Entrepreneurship 101, which contains several courses to help entrepreneurs become investment-ready. We plan to develop other curricula that will be required for the ecosystem.\n\nThe other arm is networking. Just like what you\u2019re doing, having us talk about investments and enabling entrepreneurs to have access to investors, we also do our bit in terms of networking. We attend events where we meet many entrepreneurs.\n\nWe organise events where entrepreneurs can meet many investors not only within Rising Tide but also outside. We do a lot of coaching and panel roles for other networks or groups of networks. So we try to develop not only Rising Tide but also the ecosystem.\n\nThe fourth arm is mentoring, which is very crucial. We act as individual mentors for our portfolio. We don\u2019t believe that investments alone are what we need to provide for our businesses. We believe in growing with them and holding their hands.\n\nYou get a pool of people who can mentor you for a period. So we have one-offs like that. We also have mentoring sessions where we spend three to six months mentoring a business. Our goal is to mentor them until they are investment-ready, either for Rising Tide or any other network willing to invest in them.\n\nWhat we\u2019re doing is giving back to the ecosystem and ensuring that it develops so that our businesses do not die within the first three years. Those are the four pillars that Rising Tide operates by.\n\nAre there specific markets or industries that you focus on?\n\nWe are sector-agnostic; however, we try to invest in certain sectors. We look at sectors that have volume and the most impact on our economy \u2014 like education, for instance. Apart from education, we\u2019re looking at something related to healthcare. So education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, essential goods, and services are our areas of interest.\n\nHow do you determine what startups to invest in?\n\nWe have an investment process that guides us. First of all, tech and tech-enabled startups get our attention. We prioritise female-owned, female-led, and gender diverse companies. We look at their business model critically. We look at the market. Of course, we look at their financials and their corporate documents.\n\nSo we filter based on our investment philosophy. After we do that, if they qualify, we look at factors like their team. We look at their qualification and prior experience, their commitment to the business itself; we don\u2019t want people doing part-time coming to us for investment.\n\nWe look at diversity. We go as far as looking at who sits on your board of directors and talking to some of your references. We also look at your business model. Don\u2019t forget that these are early-stage startups, and there\u2019s only so far we can go in terms of due diligence, but we look at these basic things.\n\nWhat are their revenue sources? Who are their potential customers and suppliers? What kind of pipeline do they have? What\u2019s their value proposition? We look at the size of the market and the key drivers within that landscape. These are external things that we look at in terms of whether there\u2019s a unique selling point, the barriers to entry, and the competitive landscape.\n\nSome don\u2019t have historical financials, but we look at how objective their revenue projections are? What will their gross margins be? Their burn rate of cash \u2014 how long our investment can carry them. Also, because we are angel investors, we want to exit between a three to five year holding period, so we look at the exit potential.\n\nThis is how we filter and look at the kind of businesses that we invest in. If we are not investing in Nigeria, we would require a local investment network in that country to co-invest with us because those are the people who understand the business environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYemi Keri. Source: Supplied.\n\nWhat shouldn\u2019t a startup be doing?\n\nI will talk about the team first. If a founder says, \u201cI am still keeping my day job until we get funding,\u201d that\u2019s a red flag because it means that the founder is not confident about their business. You will quickly lose the interest of an investor. So, when you are pitching, make sure you are fully committed to your startup.\n\nThe other thing is that while you are putting your team together, try and understand the kind of skill sets that you require based on what you are doing and ensure that you have those requisite skills. Ensure that you are not relying on one person to the point that if your technology person or CTO leaves, your startup shuts down.\n\nSome founders tend to make the CTO a co-founder, but you have to be sure about the interest of your CTO. Even though you make them your co-founder, that might not be enough to hold them down.\n\nDon\u2019t rely solely on raising capital from investors, solely being the keyword. Fundraising is a different ball game in itself, and sometimes, it makes you shift focus from your business. A founder needs to determine how much they need over a fixed period so that they\u2019re not continuously raising.\n\nWhen you\u2019re raising funds, remember that an investor does not want to fund your overhead. Do not raise $100,000 and then use it to rent a place or pay salaries. That is not what we\u2019re interested in investing in.\n\nEven if you use some of it for your overheads, let most of it be for improving or scaling your product or whatever it is that will make the business grow. We also advise founders not to give out majority equity of their business. As angel investors, we also say, \u201ctry not to take more than 15% of the business, so you do not kill it.\u201d\n\nThey will always need to have that kind of authority because if other investors are coming in down the line and you have given away 30% already without even getting to Series A, then it starts to become a major challenge.\n\nAnother issue that investors are beginning to see is the level of valuation. It\u2019s incredible how a company that started business 5 or 12 months ago and is still in product development is valuing itself at $1 million. That is ticking off a lot of investors. Be realistic in your valuation.\n\nWe are not in the mature European and American markets, so stop equating your business to startups in those regions; it is bad for the ecosystem. You have to be able to justify your valuation to angel investors. If we see that something is overvalued, we walk away.\n\nWhat is your biggest success story?\n\nAmayi Foods and Migo in terms of expansion into other environments. Amayi is on Amazon Prime and sells globally, and Migo \u2014 formally Mine.io \u2014 has expanded its services to Brazil.\n\nHave you had bad investments, and how did you deal with them?\n\nIn your portfolio as an investor, you should be ready to lose some funds. Before we onboard our investors, we always tell them only to invest what will not affect their lifestyles because statistically, only one or two of your investments will become a unicorn. However, they will make up for your other investments.\n\nWe started off investing really critically in 2019. We have two that are not looking promising so far. As for the others, it\u2019s still too early for us to say they have failed. What we do when we are investing is to position the team lead of that investment as a board observer or a board member in that startup, so they act as a liaison between Rising Tide and the startup.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried everything from mentoring to handholding to board observing, and we\u2019ve made recommendations, but we\u2019re still watching. It\u2019s still early to say that they are really bad. We hope that the recommendations we\u2019ve made can take them out of the hole that they\u2019re in.\n\nWhat startups are in your portfolio?\n\nSo we have Migo, Amayi foods, Big Cabal, Cafe Neo, Aruwa Capital, OZ\u00c9, Kwik, Nature\u2019s Bounty, Eden, Blackbet \u2014 which we co-invested in with Lagos Angel Network.\n\nInkblot is an interesting one because we decided to try entertainment. We have Seso Global, Emergency Response Africa \u2014 very early stage but gaining a lot of traction. We have Bankly, Chekkit, and Gradely.\n\nAre there any deals that you passed on that you regret?\n\n(Laughs) There will always be deals that you pass on. I think in the early stages of Lagos Angel Network, we let Flutterwave go. We also let Paystack go. That\u2019s for Lagos Angel Network. Now, I don\u2019t know if any we let go has done well, but you will always have those companies.\n\nThere\u2019s a company called Termii. We didn\u2019t want to pass up on them, but before we could conclude, they had gotten other investors. At that time, our investment process took so long because we were at the teething stages ourselves. This was 2018/2019. As an investor, you win some and lose some.\n\nHow do you deal with the fear of missing out as an angel investor?\n\nThere will always be deals. If you miss one bus, there will always be others. If you miss out in the early stages, you might get another opportunity later. There will always be a chance for you to get on board, and if there is none, it wasn\u2019t yours.\n\nHow can founders reach you?\n\nFor Rising Tide Africa, you can send an email to info@risingtideafrica.com. You can also visit the website at www.risingtideafrica.com if you want to join us as an angel investor. Finally, you can send your pitches to pitches@risingtideafrica.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Website Accidental writer, covering Africa's startup landscape and its heroes.",

          "text": "The financial inclusion drive of First Bank of Nigeria Limited has recorded a major boost, with the lender strengthening over 120,000 Firstmonie Agents, spread across 772 local government areas in the country with huge loan facilities.\n\nBarely a year after the launch of the Firstmonie Agents Credit scheme, First Bank, announced last week that it has economically empowered its Firstmonie Agents with the sum of N100 billion.\n\nFor a bank which prides itself as the nation\u2019s financial inclusion services provider and has pursued the financial inclusion drive of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the federal government with vigour, this may be another exciting way of matching words with action.\n\nAccording to World Bank, financial inclusion means that individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs \u2013 transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance \u2013 delivered in a responsible and sustainable way. World Bank also notes that access to a transaction account is a first step toward broader financial inclusion since it allows people to store, send and receive money.\n\nA few years ago, the CBN set a target of 80 percent financial inclusion by 2020. The objective was to get Nigerians who do not bank or do online transactions to get onboard as a way of reducing poverty in Nigeria.\n\nThe apex bank was concerned that while Nigeria has about 96.4 million adult population, it is sad that 40.1 million (almost half of the population) are financially excluded in a digital age where e-payment, e-commerce among other financial services products and banking innovations are trending.\n\nCBN also found it shocking that women, youths under 35 years, rural dwellers and those in Northern Nigerian, particularly North West and North East, are the most financially excluded. First Bank is clearly leaving no one in doubt that it is not any less concerned in this regard.\n\nThe Agent Credit scheme was created by the banking giant to promote and expand the business activities of its foremost agent banking platform \u2013 Firstmonie Agents \u2013 whilst putting them at an advantage to positively impact their immediate environment.\n\nReiterating the bank\u2019s role in deepening financial inclusion in the country, Chuma Ezirim, Group Executive, e-Business & Retail Products, said ,\u201cWe are truly excited about the tremendous impact of the Agent Credit on the performance of our Firstmonie Agents nationwide.\n\n\u201cSince the introduction of the Agent Credit to support our \u2018Human ATMs\u2019 as we fondly call our Firstmonie Agents, they have recorded immense growth in their businesses at levels they never envisaged in such a short period.\n\n\u201cOur key goal is to continue to deliver financial services to the underserved and unbanked populations, employing modern technology for processing real-time transactions and in doing so, contribute to building capacities and learning new skills in information technology, cash management and relationship management for our agents.\n\n\u201cWe encourage our Agents to keep being exemplary in setting the pace to promote financial inclusion as we collectively work towards the continuous growth and development of the national economy.\u201d\n\nFirstmonie Agents have been integral to bridging the financial inclusion gap, providing convenient banking services that are easily accessible, thereby saving time and travel costs for individuals in the suburbs and remote environments that have no access to financial services.\n\nThe bank\u2019s financial inclusion activities are in line with the mandate of the CBN to ensure the availability of affordable financial products and services to all individuals and groups of people in the country, irrespective of location, literacy levels, familiarity with technology and accessibility to modern infrastructural facilities.\n\nThe Firstmonie Agent channel is amongst the bank\u2019s many initiatives to expand financial access in the country. Not long ago, the lender announced that it had disbursed over N17bn loans to individuals across the country through FirstAdvance, its digital lending solution.\n\nIn a statement titled, \u2018First Bank reinforces its financial inclusion drive; disburses over 17bn naira loans through FirstAdvance.,\u2019 the lender explained, \u201cFirstAdvance is designed to offer a convenient and easy access to cash for salary earners whose accounts are domiciled with FirstBank and have received regular salaries for two months, prior to the loan request.\n\n\u201cIn barely a year since the launch of FirstAdvance, over 128,000 unique customers in over 782,996 successful transactions have so far benefitted from loans.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, FirstBank launched its agent banking network; \u2018Firstmonie Agent\u2019, described as its \u2018Human ATM\u2019. The Firstmonie Agents are empowered to extend access to finance to all Nigerians, regardless of where they may be across the country.\n\nThe agent banking network complements the bank\u2019s effort at reducing the size of the unbanked in the country, while providing a handful of the bank\u2019s bespoke financial services, including account opening; cash deposit; airtime purchase; bills payment; withdrawals and money transfer.",

          "text": "A Nigerian, Adeyemi Opebiyi, has sued the United Kingdom for allegedly turning him back from entering the country after he had been granted a visa and had flown from Nigeria to the Manchester Airport.\n\nOpebiyi, who described himself as the Head of Operations, Sabi Micro Finance Bank Ltd, said on arriving at Manchester Airport on March 14, 2021, he was stopped by the UK Immigration official, who insisted that he must be interviewed before he could be allowed into the UK.\n\nHe claimed that he was made to wait for eight hours at the immigration desk before he was eventually interviewed by an Immigration officer, who asked him to draw the logo of Sabi Micro Finance Bank Ltd, among other things, as a way of verifying his claim that he works with the financial institution.\n\nOpebiyi alleged that after drawing the logo as best as he could, the Immigration officer told him that the drawing was not good enough and he would be denied entry into the UK on that basis and related reasons.\n\nHe claimed that he was subsequently detained for 10 days before he was finally deported to Nigeria on March 24.\n\nHe said in response to his request for the review of the decision, he got a letter from the UK Home Office, reading: \u201cYou were asked to draw Sabi Micro Finance Bank LTD\u2019s logo: What you drew bore little resemblance to the logos found on all the official paperwork you submitted for your visa application.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, you were initially unable to state the correct names of the current Chairperson and Managing Director of Sabi Micro Finance Bank Ltd. This is something a Head of Operations would know. You were also unable to describe the core values and mission of Sabi Micro Finance Bank Ltd as described on its website.\u201d\n\nIn the suit filed on his behalf by UK-based Nigerian lawyer, Mr Femi Aina, a Senior Consultant Solicitor with Martynsrose Solicitors, UK, Opebiyi is demanding damages for what he termed the unlawful and humiliating treatment meted out to him by the UK Immigration officers.\n\nThe suit was filed upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum chamber) UK, with the Secretary of State for Home Department (UK) named as the sole respondent to the suit.\n\nIn the court papers, copies of which were made available to our correspondent, Opebiyi\u2019s lawyer said, \u201cThe applicant spent 16 hours on his flight to London (Lagos-Doha-Manchester). He was held for about eight hours by the respondent for further examination. He was interviewed after eight hours\u2019 waiting and was asked to draw the company logo. Despite the fatigue and the flight stress, he tried his best possible to draw the company\u2019s logo. The respondent\u2019s action is oppressive as it does not have regard for his well-being.\n\n\u201cThe applicant showed his ID card, his MD confirmed his employment. The letter dated 9th April, 2018 and the one dated 12 August, 2020 from the CBN relates to his employment. His bank statement shows regular salary payment. All the above are relevant evidence regarding his employment. The respondent\u2019s decision that he was not employed, or that false information was used in obtaining his visa, is wrong.\n\n\u201cBy reason of the matters aforesaid, the applicant was unlawfully detained and deprived of his liberty for 10 days at Immigration Detention Centre (Colynbrook) from the date of his arrival, 14th March 2021 up to the date of his removal i.e. 24 March, 2021.\n\n\u201cThe respondent has acted in a way that is incompatible with the applicant\u2019s rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, contrary to Section 6(1) as a public authority carrying out Immigration Control.\u201d\n\nDescribing the experience as the worst in his life, Opebiyi, in the court papers, said, \u201cI was humiliated and distressed about the whole matter. A week after returning to Nigeria I could not go to work as I was mentally unstable. I have never stayed in detention in my life. The whole experience is affecting me psychologically till now. Anytime I hear detention or see anything about the UK, I cringe. I lost my savings on a fruitless journey to the UK. I am a victim of injustice.\u201d\n\nThe applicant, through his lawyer, said he was entitled to a claim of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a320,000, with interest.\n\nHe explained that he lost a total of \u00a31,593.00 from the cost of flight ticket, taxi fare to the airport in Nigeria, Administrative Review fees that he paid in the UK and the legal fees he paid to the lawyer who processed the Administrative Review for him.\n\n\u201cThe claimant is entitled to interest pursuant to Section 69 County Courts Act 1984 on any sums due to him at such rate as the court shall think fit,\u201d the lawyer said.

          "text": "Agency Reports\n\nNo fewer than 304 people died and hundreds were injured or missing after a 7.2 Magnitude earthquake struck southwestern Haiti on Saturday.\n\nThousands of fatalities are expected, like the quake that devastated the country 11 years ago.\n\nSaturday\u2019s measured between 7.2 to 7.6 magnitude was stronger and closer to the surface than the magnitude 7.1 quake that damaged much of the capital in 2010 and killed an estimated 300,000 people.\n\nWithin hours the US Geological Survey (USGS) estimated \u2018thousands of fatalities\u2019 and \u2018tens of thousands of injuries in poor mountainous communities\u2019.\n\nJerry Chandler, Haiti\u2019s director of civil protection, told the Associated Press that the official death toll by 7pm (ET) stood at 304.\n\nHe said teams will be sent to the area for search and rescue missions.\n\nAccording to the update provided by the authorities, the earthquake reduced churches, hotels and homes to rubble.\n\nIt was the latest tragedy to hit the poor Caribbean nation.\n\nThe quake, which was followed by a series of aftershocks, struck 8 km (5 miles) from the town of Petit Trou de Nippes, about 150 km west of the capital Port-au-Prince, at a depth of 10 km, the United States Geological Survey said.\n\nThat made the temblor which was felt as far away as Cuba and Jamaica potentially bigger and shallower than the magnitude 7 earthquake 11 years ago that killed tens of thousands in the poorest nation in the Americas.\n\nThis one \u2013 which occurred around 8:30 a.m. local time \u2013 hit farther away from the capital, however.\n\nIn Port-au-Prince, it was strongly felt but did not appear to have caused major damage, according to Reuters witnesses.\n\nStill, Haiti\u2019s Civil Protection service said the preliminary death toll already stood at 227 and Prime Minister Ariel Henry declared a month-long state of emergency.\n\nThe nearest big town was Les Cayes, where many buildings collapsed or suffered major damage, according to authorities, who said they were searching for survivors.\n\n\u201cI saw bodies being pulled out of the rubble, injured and perhaps dead people,\u201d said Les Cayes resident Jean Marie Simon, 38, who was at the market when the earthquake struck and ran home to see if his family was safe.\n\n\u201cI heard cries of pain everywhere I passed through.\u201d\n\nHis wife and two-year-old child had been bathing and rushed out to the street, naked, just before the front of the house crumbled. Simon gave his wife his shirt and they took refuge in the courtyard of a church with other locals.\n\nHis mother\u2019s house had also collapsed.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of aftershocks and every time there\u2019s one, people run and shout,\u201d he said. \u201cMy legs are still trembling.\u201d\n\nIn Les Cayes, locals said water had briefly flooded the coastal town of 126,000, causing panic amid fear of a tsunami, but then appeared to retreat.\n\nHaitian media outlets reported some people along the coast had already fled to the mountains.\n\nThe U.S. Tsunami Warning System issued a tsunami warning after the quake, lifting it shortly thereafter.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden authorized an immediate U.S. response to the earthquake and named Samantha Power, administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, coordinator of the effort.\n\n\u2018NEVER A BREAK\u2019\n\nThe earthquake comes just over a month after the assassination of President Jovenel Moise, who had been ruling by decree, which deepened the country\u2019s political turmoil.\n\nMeanwhile, swaths of Haiti are facing growing hunger and healthcare services are overwhelmed by COVID-19.\n\nAccess by road to the southern region, where the quake struck, has been restricted by gang control of key areas, raising questions over how aid will be delivered read more\n\nThat region had only recently recovered from Hurricane Matthew, which struck in 2016, killing hundreds and causing widespread devastation.\n\nHaiti is now in the probable track of Tropical Storm Grace which could bring heavy rains early next week.\n\n\u201cThis country just never finds a break! Each year of mismanagement did not hurt but the cumulative effects made us vulnerable to everything,\u201d said Haitian entrepreneur Marc Alain Boucicault on Twitter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take years to fix things and we have not even started!\u201d",

The leadership sincerely appreciate the innate desire of Biafrans to sacrifice their time, resources and energy in ensuring that our leader, Nnamdi Kanu, is released unconditionally from the illegal custody of the Nigerian State who criminally gave him away from Kenya to Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThe suspension of the sit-at-home by the IPOB Head of Directorate was as a result of a direct order from the leader of this great movement, Nnamdi Kanu.\n\n\u201cThere is no gainsaying the fact that one of the major fundamental guiding principles of IPOB is command and control. This simply means that all commands from the supreme leader of IPOB will be obeyed and implemented to the latter by the Directorate of State of the Indigenous People of Biafra.\n\n\u201cBearing in mind therefore that this principle has enabled this movement to surpass even the expectations of both Biafrans and non-Biafrans alike, the leadership wishes to encourage Biafran to focus on the most pressing issue confronting this great family presently which is ensuring the safety of our leader while still in the illegal custody of the DSS and to secure his unconditional release from detention.\n\n\u201cIn accordance with the directive from our leader, our sit-at-home will in the meantime be observed on the date of our leader\u2019s court appearances.\n\n\u201cThe lPOB leadership urges Biafrans worldwide to take note of the next court appearance of our leader which is the 21st of October 2021.\n\n\u201cAny other information regarding Sit-At-Home in Biafraland not emanating from IPOB through our main channels of information dissemination should be disregarded. The Nigeria government should heed now to the voice of reason coming from within Nigeria and from outside the shores of Nigeria to unconditionally free our leader, Nnamdi Kanu, and announce a date for Biafra referendum or plebiscite where our people will choose where they wish to be long before it is too late.\u201d",

These men and women died serving our nation, fighting to restore peace and stability in the North East. This is in tandem with the constitutional mandate of the Armed Forces of Nigeria\u201d.\n\nGeneral Nwachukwu noted that it will be totally a mischief and an assault on the psyche of the troops, who are relentlessly fighting, to begin to insinuate any plot against one of its own.\n\n\u201cAnd what is the plot here? That troops were led by their commander for an operational engagement is not a plot, as anyone may want to insinuate. Rather, it was a clear military mission with a clear objective. It is however disheartening that this gallant officer and some of his men paid the supreme price in the operation, and we pray fervently for the repose of their souls. Col Sakaba was a respected senior officer who gave his all in the defense of the freedom we all enjoy today. His demise is a great loss to all of us. Insinuating anything contrary is a deservice to our nation and the sacrifices of our troops.\n\n\u201cConcerning the issue of entitlements. Available records reveal the following incontrovertible facts:\n\n\u201cThat Master Samuel Ibrahim Sakaba, the son of Mrs. Seun Sakaba is the Next of Kin (NOK) to the late Senior Officer and the only child.\n\n\u201cAll entitlements meant to be paid by the NA have been paid to the NOK through Mrs. Oluwaseun Sakaba.\n\n\u201cAs at the time his entitlements were processed, Samuel was less than 6years as such, he was not benefiting from NA school sponsorship. However, now that he has reached the required age, he has been captured for payment of school sponsorship which will commence any moment from now. The NA will continue to sponsor the child\u2019s education up to graduation from university, as long as he fulfills the requirements outlined in the rules guiding the scheme.\n\n\u201cThe only entitlement owed Mrs. Oluwaseun Sakaba is the Group Life Assurance which is normally paid by the Insurance Company and which would soon be received along with that of other deceased personnel,\u201d the statement further explained.\n\nThe Nigerian Army also noted that it takes the welfare of its troops very seriously, as evident in the various welfare programs put in place for troops and their families.\n\nGeneral Nwachukwu added that the leadership has made the welfare of troops, one of the cardinal pillars of the COAS\u2019 vision for the NA.\n\n\u201cThis is visible in the various welfare programs embarked upon in addition to those that are statutorily emplaced. There are also well-established communication channels with families of deceased personnel.\n\n\u2018The NA under the leadership of the COAS, will continue to pursue the welfare of troops who are working round the clock to ensure the safety and security of all Nigerians. The NA will not be deterred, but remain focused in its pursuit of excellence and in ensuring that all Nigerians enjoy their God-given right to live freely anywhere in Nigeria,\u201d he conclueded.",
          "summary": "The Nigerian Army said that the uncomplimentary comments credited to Mrs. Oluwaseun Sakaba, the widow of late Col Ibrahim Sakaba that whose late husband was assassinated to cover up corruption are unfounded and baseless claims devoid of any fact.\nMrs. Oluwaseun Sakaba, alleged that the late senior officer was assassinated for refusing to loot funds meant for fighting the Boko Haram Insurgency.\nThe late senior officer\u2019s widow was quoted to have made several uncomplimentary comments about the institution of the Nigerian Army (NA), making reference to unfounded and baseless claims devoid of any fact.\nCol Sakaba was a respected senior officer who gave his all in the defense of the freedom we all enjoy today.\n\u201cAll entitlements meant to be paid by the NA have been paid to the NOK through Mrs. Oluwaseun Sakaba.",

It looked like Ayling had cleared the ball off the line but referee Paul Tierney got the signal on his wrist watch that the ball had crossed the line.\n\nThe Portugal international completed his hat trick \u2014 his first since joining United \u2014 on the hour mark with a powerful strike past Meslier.\n\n\u201cMy objective every season is being better than the last one. Every performance I do, I want to do better and better. I\u2019ve started with three goals but it\u2019s a long way [to go],\u201d Fernandes said.\n\nPogba secured his fourth assist on 68 minutes when he squared a ball for Fred who hit it into the net from 10 yards out.\n\n\u201cPeople talk about the quality of Paul, but his quality is not in discussion. We know what he can do and today he showed that,\u201d Fernandes said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an important player for us.
