          "text": "Angela Onwuzoo\n\nWomen taking antibiotics after having unprotected sexual intercourse to prevent pregnancy are wasting their time and money, maternal health experts have said.\n\nThe experts said antibiotics can\u2019t be used as contraceptives, adding that there is no scientific evidence to back their effectiveness in preventing pregnancy, even when used immediately after sexual intercourse\n\nThey stated further that women who are in the habit of regular intake of antibiotics are at risk of destroying important vaginal flora (good bacteria).\n\nThe women, the experts warn, may also develop infections that are resistant to antibiotics.\n\nAccording to News Medical, an online open-access medical and life science portal, a healthy vaginal flora protects the body against urogenital infections.\n\n\u201cIt is made up of many different types of bacteria, the predominant bacteria being lactobacilli.\n\n\u201cThese beneficial or \u201cgood\u201d bacteria play a key role in defending against infection. Lactobacilli provide protection against microbes from the external environment, as well as microbes that reside in the vagina\u201d, says News Medical.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with PUNCH HealthWise, a Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Teaching Hospital, Akwa, Anambra State, Dr. Stanley Egbogu, said no known antibiotics can prevent pregnancy.\n\nEgbogu said, \u201cUsing antibiotics as contraceptives is not science-based.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of women are doing it. Some even take antibiotics with quinine tablets. High doses of quinine can kill the embryo- a formed baby though quinine is antimalarial and not antibiotic. Quinine is used in treating malaria in pregnant women.\n\n\u201cBut when a person takes an excessive dose, it can lead to abortion. Hence, some people say it is an abortifacient.\n\n\u201cThat is why when you prescribe it for some women, they become afraid because they know it can cause abortion. But antibiotics can\u2019t be used to prevent pregnancy.\n\n\u201cIt is totally wrong for women to take antibiotics after sex. It is a waste of money and resources. It can cause antibiotic resistance.\u201d\n\nThe gynaecologist also noted that excessive antibiotic intake by women could affect their normal vaginal flora.\n\n\u201cIn a woman\u2019s private area, there are some anti-bacteria that normally inhabit there.\n\n\u201cThose bacteria are not harmful to the woman; instead they prevent harmful bacteria from coming to live there. Now, when you take excessive antibiotics, they can kill those normal bacteria that are protective and cause the pathogenic ones to come and live in the vagina. This can also lead to candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe urged women still in the habit to desist from it, warning that antibiotics abuse comes with severe health consequences.\n\nAccording to an online news portal, WebMD, bacterial infections are one of the most common causes of infertility in both men and women. Sexually transmitted infections like chlamydia and gonorrhoea, the online portal says, can damage the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes in women, and the tubes that sperm travel through in men.\n\n\u201cSometimes these infections don\u2019t cause symptoms. You may not even know you have an STI. Without treatment, bacteria can spread to the uterus, ovaries, or fallopian tubes and cause pelvic inflammatory disease.\n\n\u201cPID can leave scars in the fallopian tubes. Those scars might block the tubes and prevent an egg from travelling down them to be fertilised\u201d, WebMD said.\n\nIt further noted, \u201cOnly bacterial infections can be killed with antibiotics. The common cold, flu, most coughs, some bronchitis infections, most sore throats, and the stomach flu are all caused by viruses. Antibiotics won\u2019t work to treat them.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, antibiotics are becoming increasingly ineffective, as drug resistance spreads globally leading to more difficulty to treat infections and death.\n\n\u201cNew antibacterials are urgently needed \u2013 for example, to treat carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections as identified in the WHO priority pathogen list. However, if people do not change the way antibiotics are used now, these new antibiotics will suffer the same fate as the current ones and become ineffective,\u201d says WHO.\n\nAlso, a resident doctor at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Eko Hospital, Lagos, Dr. Amara Nwabulue, told PUNCH HealthWise that some women engage in many unscientific practices, like taking antibiotics in a bid to prevent pregnancy, warning that such practices could affect their reproductive organs.\n\n\u201cI have actually heard about women doing a whole lot of things to prevent pregnancy after having sex, including consuming high doses of vitamin C. They will tell you to take a particular carbonated drink. Sometimes, they will tell you to wash your vagina after sex or use antibiotics.\n\n\u201cBut the truth is that those things do not work. It is just their thought. When you take antibiotics, it gets to the stomach and the body absorbs it; it gets to the blood. There is no business between the blood and the womb. Even if you take antibiotics in excess, it has no business in preventing pregnancy,\u201d Nwabulue said.\n\nCopyright PUNCH\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Osinbajo @ 4th MSMES Awards: we are encouraged by innovation, resilience of young Nigerians",
          "text": "The Federal Government is encouraged by the resilience and innovation of young Nigerians across different sectors and is committed to doing more to support their growth and prosperity, according to Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, SAN.\n\nProf. Osinbajo stated this last night at the 4th National MSME Awards held at the State House Banquet Hall, Abuja. Twelve (12) MSMEs across the country won awards in different categories, while Gombe State was recognized as the best State in the ease of doing business rankings.\n\nThe Awards ceremony was the climax of a week-long celebration of excellence, hard work and innovation in the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) sector in Nigeria.\n\nReiterating the commitment of President Muhammadu Buhari to small businesses, the VP said, \u201cwe are encouraged by the innovation of young Nigerians and your resilience. We are on the right path.\n\n\u201cLet me leave you with President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s words of commitment to MSMEs in Nigeria: he said, \u201cwe will continue to stand by you, to support you and create opportunities for you to grow and prosper.\u201d\n\nThe VP commended the creativity of the 2021 winners of the awards, noting that \u201cthe awards have inspired many young entrepreneurs to greatness and some of the stories are simply incredible.\u201d\n\nHis words; \u201cthis year we also have a selection of outstanding winners. Our MSME of the Year, \u201cBold Artistry\u201d, is a company with a team of young and creative artists working on improving the arts industry by introducing Polystyrene to their works. With this, they have created impressive artworks and are providing jobs for many budding artists.\u201d\n\nTalking about another outstanding MSME, Prof. Osinbajo noted that, \u201cOsky Integrated has created its niche in the business of catfish farming. The founders are adding value to fish farming through processing for the local and export market.\n\n\u201cOther winners such as Vegas Gold and the Footwear Academy are promoting made in Nigeria products in the fashion and footwear industries respectively.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on progress made in interventions targeted at supporting growth in the MSME sector, Prof. Osinbajo said the Federal Government was on the right path, having completed and inaugurated two Shared Facility projects for MSMEs in Benue and Lagos States, with the third located at the Ogbunike Leather Cluster in Anambra State ready for commissioning.\n\nHe disclosed that many others are in the works. According to him, \u201cother Shared Facility projects ready for commissioning before the end of the year include Kaduna State Tomato Paste Production line and a Carpentry cluster in Edo State. Others are in Katsina, Kebbi, Ebonyi, Ogun and Kano States.\u201d\n\nThe VP said government interventions in the MSMEs space over the years have been geared towards creating jobs, ensuring growth and making them more viable.\n\nHe expressed satisfaction with the interest shown in the Awards since its inauguration in 2018, noting that, \u201cthe National MSME Awards has grown in leaps and bounds. It has become a prominent feature in the annual event calendar of the MSMEs community in Nigeria, attracting thousands of prospective business owners, established entrepreneurs, regulators and financiers.\u201d\n\nHis words: \u201cIn the first edition of the awards in 2018, 500 applications were received.

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari\n\nThe Presidency has frowned at threats by a group, Niger Delta Avengers, to bomb nation\u2019s oil installations unless their demands including restructuring of the federation were met by the Federal Government within 90 days.\n\nMr Femi Adesina, the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, condemned the threats in a statement in Abuja on Sunday.\n\nHe noted that the media was on Sunday awash with reports on the threats and demands by the group to embark on economic sabotage through bombing of critical oil and gas installations unless certain demands, including development of the Niger Delta, and restructuring of the Federation, were met.\n\nThe presidential aide stated that such threats were unnecessary and uncalled for as President Muhammadu Buhari had since engaged the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress (INC), on how best to address the demands of the group.\n\nAdesina, therefore, expressed shock and surprise over the threats as President Buhari had only met with the concerned stakeholders of the Niger Delta in the Presidential Villa less than 48 hours ago where they deliberated over many issues including their demsands.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is, however, curious that the threat was coming less than 48 hours after President Muhammadu Buhari met with the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress (INC), at the Presidential Villa, and the germane issues had been responded to, especially call for restructuring of the Federation, and the inauguration of a Board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\u201d\n\nAdesina, who reproduced the president\u2019s speech during the meeting with the leaders of the Niger Delta and the INC, said the outcome of the meeting had rendered the threats by the group unnecessary.\n\nREAD ALSO: Forensic auditor begins physical verification of NDDC projects in Abia\n\n\u201cFor clarity and record purposes, below is full text of the speech by President Buhari on June 25, 2021, which renders any sabre-rattling rather unnecessary:\n\n\u201cI warmly welcome all the Elders of the Niger Delta and particularly the National Executive of the Ijaw National Congress, under the leadership of Professor Benjamin Okaba. I thank you for paying this courtesy visit not too long after your election in April, and swearing-in last May.\n\n\u201cI also want to congratulate you all for your election and to add that a lot of responsibility is placed on your shoulders, especially coming from the fact that the Ijaw National Congress was almost without leadership for some time.\n\n\u201cAs the symbol of the collective voice of the Ijaw people, which is one of Nigeria\u2019s main ethnic groups, the existence of a focused and people oriented leadership would go a long way in articulating the demands of the Ijaw people and making sure these demands are made part of the national discourse.\n\n\u201cI particularly note your ten point demand to the Federal Government in your inaugural speech and assure you that this administration is frontally addressing them.\n\n\u201cI am equally concerned about the rate of environmental degradation in the Niger Delta and as you are aware the HydroCarbon Pollution Remediation Project has started work with remediation efforts in Ogoni land and I have directed the Minister of Environment to ensure that the projects are implemented with a high percentage of local content and inclusion of the surrounding communities.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency, under the same ministry of Environment is working to make sure that oil spills are reduced and new ones prevented.\n\n\u201dAs you are also aware, all the responsible agencies of government have been directed to ensure that they enforce compliance by the International Oil Companies to international best practices.\n\n\u201cIn addressing your call for immediate restructuring, the National Assembly whose responsibility it is to ensure that our constitution responds to the call for a restructured Nigeria, has already concluded regional consultations and as soon as they finalise the process, necessary action would not be delayed on my part.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, your call for creation of two additional states and more local government areas for the Ijaw people is a legislative matter, which should naturally be handled by the National Assembly and seeking concurrence at the state levels.\n\n\u201cI completely agree with your call to allocate operational licenses for marginal fields to Ijaw people.\n\n\u201dHowever, like you know, the process of granting licenses is guided by laid down rules and regulations, most of which even favour local content and local contractors. I see no reason why they should not be granted such licenses if they qualify.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of fair and balanced appointments to reflect federal character principles, I re-affirm that this has always been my focus and would continue to be because I have always seen Nigeria as a country where everyone should be given equal opportunities.\n\n\u201cA contentious issue that has been a subject of discourse amongst the Ijaw people of recent has been the need for the Niger Delta Development Commission to live up to its billing by delivering the required succour to the people of the region.\n\n\u201dBased on the mismanagement that had previously be-devilled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July, 2021.\u201d\n\nAccording to the president, as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board will be inaugurated.\n\nHe, however, challenged the Ijaw National Congress to play a more active role in making sure that the \u201dmismanagement that occurred in the past is not repeated\u201d.\n\nBuhari noted with delight the call for promoting ownership of modular refineries by the Ijaw people.\n\n\u201dI will urge you to interphase with your sons who are involved in the processes of establishing these refineries, especially the Honourable Minister of State Petroleum Resources to actualize this quest.\n\n\u201cLike you well know, completion of the East-West Road is top on my infrastructure agenda and I will look to its speedy conclusion.\n\n\u201dAgain, the occasional disturbance by youths in some communities along the route to construction work would require your close attention and guidance.\u201d\n\nThe president also, during the meeting with the INC leaders, observed that his administration had made considerable progress with the construction of the Bonny to Port Harcourt Bridge.\n\n\u201cI am very happy with the recent affirmation of your belief in a United Nigeria and while I thank you for standing with me, I will also implore you to use your leverage in making sure that we keep working together to keep this country a united, indivisible entity, so that we can tackle our problems together and overcome our challenges together.\n\n\u201cI would like now to commend Professor Okaba for your emphasis on supporting the fight against insecurity by developing internal control mechanisms as well as working with other institutions in the country to address our current security challenges.\n\n\u201cWhile I thank you once more for this visit and I will continue to count on your support as we work towards resolving our current challenges.\u201d\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

Chris Ngige, has proposed Tuesday, June 29, 2021 for the repeat primaries and we recommend that it should be considered.\n\n\u201cIn the time being, the figures should be discarded and discountenanced as they are figments of fertile imagination, with potential of being fatal\u201d, the statement read.\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari has replied the Niger Delta Avengers, a militant group in the oil-producing Delta region threatening to resume attacks amid rising insecurity and disagreements over the share of oil wealth communities should get.\n\nThe president said it was curious that the threat was coming less than 48 hours after he met with the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress (INC), at the Presidential Villa, where he responded to the germane issues raised, especially call for restructuring of the Federation, and the inauguration of a Board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\n\nThe group had in 2016 attacked oil installations that affected the country\u2019s oil production.\n\nAccording to a statement by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, he said threat was unnecessary.\n\nHe reproduced the full text he read when he received the elders of the region on Friday, June 25, 2021, which answers to all the issues raised.\n\nThe full text read in part: \u201cAs the symbol of the collective voice of the Ijaw people, which is one of Nigeria\u2019s main ethnic groups, the existence of a focused and people oriented leadership would go a long way in articulating the demands of the Ijaw people and making sure these demands are made part of the national discourse.\n\n\u201cI particularly note your ten-point demand to the Federal Government in your inaugural speech and assure you that this administration is frontally addressing them.\n\n\u201cI am equally concerned about the rate of environmental degradation in the Niger Delta and as you are aware the HydroCarbon Pollution Remediation Project has started work with remediation efforts in Ogoni land and I have directed the Minister of Environment to ensure that the projects are implemented with a high percentage of local content and inclusion of the surrounding communities.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency, under the same ministry of Environment is working to make sure that oil spills are reduced and new ones prevented. As you are also aware, all the responsible agencies of government have been directed to ensure that they enforce compliance by the International Oil Companies to international best practices.\n\n\u201cIn addressing your call for immediate restructuring, the National Assembly whose responsibility it is to ensure that our constitution responds to the call for a restructured Nigeria, has already concluded regional consultations and as soon as they finalise the process, necessary action would not be delayed on my part.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, your call for creation of two additional states and more local government areas for the Ijaw people is a legislative matter, which should naturally be handled by the National Assembly and seeking concurrence at the state levels.\n\n\u201cI completely agree with your call to allocate operational licenses for marginal fields to Ijaw people. However, like you know, the process of granting licenses is guided by laid down rules and regulations, most of which even favour local content and local contractors. I see no reason why they should not be granted such licenses if they qualify.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of fair and balanced appointments to reflect federal character principles, I re-affirm that this has always been my focus and would continue to be because I have always seen Nigeria as a country where everyone should be given equal opportunities.\n\n\u201cA contentious issue that has been a subject of discourse amongst the Ijaw people of recent has been the need for the Niger Delta Development Commission to live up to its billing by delivering the required succour to the people of the region. Based on the mismanagement that had previously be-devilled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July, 2021.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board would be inaugurated. However, I would like to implore you that the Ijaw National Congress should play a more active role in making sure that the mismanagement that occurred in the past is not repeated.\n\n\u201cI am particularly happy to note your call for promoting ownership of modular refineries by the Ijaw people and I will urge you to interphase with your sons who are involved in the processes of establishing these refineries, especially the Honourable Minister of State Petroleum Resources to actualize this quest.\n\n\u201cLike you well know, completion of the East-West Road is top on my infrastructure agenda and I will look to its speedy conclusion. Again, the occasional disturbance by youths in some communities along the route to construction work would require your close attention and guidance.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we have made considerable progress with the construction of the Bonny to Port Harcourt Bridge.\n\n\u201cI am very happy with the recent affirmation of your belief in a United Nigeria and while I thank you for standing with me, I will also implore you to use your leverage in making sure that we keep working together to keep this country a united, indivisible entity, so that we can tackle our problems together and overcome our challenges together.\n\n\u201cI would like now to commend Professor Okaba for your emphasis on supporting the fight against insecurity by developing internal control mechanisms as well as working with other institutions in the country to address our current security challenges.\n\n\u201cWhile I thank you once more for this visit and I will continue to count on your support as we work towards resolving our current challenges.\n\n\u201cGod Bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano, Laleye Dipo in Minna, Daji Sani in Yola and Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia\n\nThe efforts by President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration to reclaim old grazing routes for herdsmen may be hampered by the building of roads, hospitals, schools and other public utilities on the ways carved out for feeding cattle in the 1950s, THISDAY investigation has revealed.\n\nContrary to the clamour for an end to open grazing and the need to adopt modern ranching techniques to curb incessant clashes with farmers, Buhari has insisted that the federal government will reclaim the old grazing routes for free movement of herders.\n\nHowever, THISDAY\u2019s investigation has revealed that the grazing routes have been taken over, over the years, by modern facilities built for the public good.\n\nIn Kano State, the state government has acknowledged that the grazing routes have been taken over by public infrastructure, including schools.\n\nFollowing this development, the state Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Ganduje, has set up a Rural Grazing Area that is popularly known as (RUGA), as part of his government\u2019s efforts to secure alternative grazing areas and accommodation for herdsmen.\n\nGanduje\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Abba Anwar, told THISDAY at the weekend that the RUGA in Kano has become the first cattle herders\u2019 settlement in the country, where the nomads are to be accommodated for expansive grazing of their flock.\n\nHe stated that the first phase of 25 housing units out of the projected 200, situated on 4,413 hectares of land at Dansoshiya Forest in Kiru Council Area of the state has been delivered by the state government.\n\nAnwar added that work is in progress on phase two and phase three of the project.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that at Falgore forest in Tudun Wada Local Government Area, the remnants of the cattle routes have been lost due to the infiltration of bandits and their attendant negative activities.\n\nGanduje, however, has urged herders to stop open grazing and return to the state, saying there is now modern grazing of animals going on at Dansoshiya Forest.\n\nHe said the investments made by his administration in grazing areas would curb the recurring clashes between herders and farmers.\n\nThe governor added that fodder seeds, which will be cultivated at Dudduru in Ajingi Local Government Area will be planted at Dansoshiya Forest to provide feeds for cattle and other small ruminants.\n\nAlthough Niger State has 11 grazing routes, covering about 1,865 kilometres, 1,368 kilometres of these routes are primary routes while the remaining 496 kilometres are secondary routes.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the Magama to Rijau route is an international route linking the country with the Benin Republic from Borgu Local Government Area of the state.\n\nBut the Permanent Secretary in the state Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development, Dr. Jonathan Wasa, told THISDAY in an interview that all the routes have been encroached upon by major highways, private developers, including small-scale industries.\n\nAccording to him, with the advent of development, cattle now share the major highways with motorists.\n\nHe stated that the state does not have the resources to reclaim the routes taken over by highways and other infrastructure.\n\nWasa said due to the encroachment on the grazing routes, the major focus of the state government is to organise nomads and others into groups and settle them in grazing reserves as being done in other parts of the world.\n\nHe stated that there are the Bobi grazing reserves, which span over 36,000 hectares located in Mariga and Magama local government areas.\n\nIn addition, the state government has also designated seven other reserves. These include: Audi Kanchi in Lavun LGA, Sheyi in Shiroro LGA, Garin- Gabas in Rafi LGA, Gabi in Lapai Ndadokun and Kpotun Woro in Agaie LGA and Iri in Rijau LGA.\n\n\u201cWe are advocates of ranching but it has to be done gradually; it cannot be done abruptly,\u201d Wasa added.\n\nIn Adamawa State, the Permanent Secretary of the State Ministry for Livestock Production, Alhaji Abdulrahman Tukur, told THISDAY that the state government had set up a committee to address the frequent clashes between farmers and herders.\n\nHe said the committee had submitted its report to the state government in which is recommended, among others, that the state government should reclaim the grazing reserves for the settlement of herdsmen and stop their movements.\n\nTukur said the old grazing routes had been taken over by schools, primary healthcare centres, roads, petrol stations and other facilities, which will not allow for movement of cattle.\n\nHe said the ministry had earlier before the wet season set up a committee for each of the 30 grazing reserves gazetted and identified in the map of the state to sensitise stakeholders on the plan to reclaim the grazing reserves to settle the herders.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThe committees are working with already list of encroachers on the grazing reserves and discussions are in top gear to reclaim these grazing reserves.\n\n\u201cThose farmers that are farming on the grazing reserves; we allow them to continue farming temporarily but when they do their harvest, they would allow the herders\u2019 cattle to feed on the residues of their crops until we make the condition better for herders and stop them from movement.\u201d\n\nIn Nasarawa State, THISDAY gathered that the state government has donated all the seven grazing reserves located at Awe, Keana, Doma, Assakio, Konva, Gitata and Kurudu to the federal government for the National Livestock Transformation Programme (NLTP), as part of the efforts to stop the free movement of cattle.\n\nThe Commissioner for Agriculture and Water Resources, Prof. Alanana Otaki, told THISDAY that the state government has succeeded in claiming all gazetted cattle grazing reserves in the state without hitches.\n\nThe Sokoto State Government has also reclaimed the grazing reserves to settle herdsmen.\n\nIn a telephone interview with THISDAY, the Commissioner for Careers and Security matters, Col. Garba Moyi (rtd), said the reserves were inside the forests.\n\n\u201cFor us in Sokoto, the policy is not new to us. I could recall when I was a local government chairman some years ago, I introduced the policy which was also adopted by other local governments in the state,\u201d he said.\n\nMoyi added:\u201d \u201cMost of these grazing reserves are in the bush and we directed the Fulani to graze on any crop planted on them.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Zamfara State Government stated that it would use the grazing reserves to resettle the herders, being the worst hit by the clashes between herders and farmers.\n\nThe Special Adviser on Media and Public Enlightenment to the Governor, Mr. Zalaini Bappa, said even some former governors who trespassed on the grazing reserves returned the land.\n\nAccording to him, the state government has also started building Ruga for the Fulani in order to prevent clashes between herders and farmers.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Petrol Subsidy Bites Harder, NNPC Proposes N114.3bn Deduction in June",
          "text": "\u2022Under-recovery quadrupled in four months\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nNigeria\u2019s three tiers of government may have to look elsewhere to augment revenues accruing monthly from the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is set to make another N114.2 billion deduction from oil revenues in June to pay for petrol subsidy.\n\nA document obtained by THISDAY from the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, detailing the NNPC\u2019s presentation to the committee, which took place between June 22 and 23, indicated that as earlier reported, the corporation, which has continued to shoulder the payment of what it calls under-recovery, deducted N126.2 billion from FAAC for May.\n\nWhat the NNPC has termed under-recovery is the difference between the actual market rate of petrol and the price at which the commodity is sold at the pump, which the federation bears in order to keep the pump price stable at N162 per litre.\n\nHowever, whereas it made zero contribution to the Federation Account in April, which was shared in May, the national oil company managed to remit about N29 billion from its finances to the joint account in May cycle, which was distributed among the three tiers last week.\n\nFor January to May\u2019s funding performance, the data showed that under-recovery or subsidy claims deducted from oil revenues by the NNPC amounted to N25.374 billion in February, N60.396 billion in March and N61.966 billion in April. But it rose astronomically to N126.298 billion in May before falling to N114 billion in June.\n\nThese implied that the deduction by the NNPC more than quadrupled from the N25.374 billion in February to N114 billion in June.\n\nThis development has justified the clamour for the full deregulation of the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry to allow market forces to determine the price of petrol.\n\nHowever, the NNPC remitted a marginal net sum of N29.647 to FAAC in May, which was shared in June, as opposed to its zero contribution in April, its N90.860 billion in January, N64.161 billion in February and N41.184 billion in March.\n\nTo date, according to the document, the NNPC has been able to contribute a net sum of N225.852 billion to the federation for the year, out of its yearly projected remittance of N1.473 trillion and monthly value addition of N122.7 billion, leaving a variance of N820.684 billion.\n\nThe presentation, signed by Mr. Bello Abdullahi, on behalf of the NNPC\u2019s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Mr. Umar Ajiya, showed that the N50 billion, which is part of the corporation\u2019s financial obligations to its Joint Venture (JV) partners, meant to have been subtracted from the latest round of deductions remains pending.\n\nGross revenue from JV crude, gas and other receipts for May was N320.314 billion, less royalty of N58.3 billion, JV cost recovery of N124 billion, Profit Before Tax (PBT) of N104.4 billion, to yield a profit after-tax value of N33.26 billion.\n\nThe document showed that for April, crude oil and gas sales and receipts, available in May and shared in June, the volume of export crude oil stood at 2.78 million barrels with a monetary value of $181.191 million and equivalent of N69.360 billion, while domestic crude oil due in July was 6.63 million barrels and sold at $434.8 million. Added to export crude oil, the revenue generated was $616.037 million.\n\nNLNG feedstock gas was 27.605 MBTU valued at $38.5 million or about N16.011 billion while the total oil and gas sales stood at $654.601 million or roughly N85.3 billion, according to the corporation.\n\nIn May, export crude oil receipt was $167.7 million, about N64.2 billion, NLNG feedstock gas amounted to $34.31 million, the equivalent of N13.17 billion, while the gas company\u2019s paid arrears stood at N623.4 million, to hit a total of N77.96 billion for the receipt from oil and gas for the month.\n\nAll the transactions were hinged on N382.80 to one dollar exchange rate as advised by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), according to the national oil company.\n\nThe report said: \u201cThe sum of N126,298,457,944.36 was deducted as value shortfall resulting from the difference between the landing cost and ex-coastal price of PMS (petrol) recorded in April 2021.\n\n\u201cIn addition, May value shortfall of N114,337,097,352.49 is to be deducted from June federation proceeds in July 2021 FAAC meeting. Also, the balance of March 2021 value shortfall of N50,000,000,000.00 remains outstanding.\u201d\n\nIt stated that the overall NNPC crude oil lifting of 9.42Mbbls (export and domestic crude) in April 2021 recorded 23.59 per cent increase relative to the 7.62MbbIs lifted in March, while Nigeria maintained 1.4 million bpd Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production cut in April 2021.\n\n\u201cCrude oil export revenue received in May 2021 amounted to $167.72 million, equivalent to N64.2 billion. Domestic gas receipts in the month were N2.9 billion. Feedstock valued at $38.56 million was sold to Nigeria LNG during the period, out of which $34.32 million was received during the month, the difference being Modified Carry Agreement (MCA) obligations, gas reconciliation and credit notes.\n\n\u201cThe sum of $16.53 million, being miscellaneous receipts, gas and ullage fees and interest income was received in May 2021,\u201d it stated.\n\nA total loss of 4.527 million barrels of crude was recorded during the month due to shut-ins, repairs, leaks, power outages as well as shutdowns due to protests as a result of non-payment of community workers\u2019 salaries in Batan station and Olomoro, Uzere and Kokori.\n\nOther issues resulting in shutdowns included seawater pump trips, technical issues like high gas to oil ratio or production deferment due to vessel swap.\n\nOf the government \u2018calendarised\u2019 priority projects worth $2.680 billion, given a $536 million monthly budget, the NNPC stated that it had so far funded the projects by $636.472 million from January to May.\n\nThe document showed an outstanding balance of $1.464 billion in JV cash call arrears to International Oil Companies (IOCs) as of May 31, with the NNPC having offset $3.22 billion from a total negotiated debt of $4.689 billion.\n\nThe national oil company told FAAC that it spent N2.263 billion on security and maintenance, N1.580 billion on pipeline and other facilities repairs as well as the payment of a \u201cstrategic holding\u201d of N304.183 million, totalling N4.148 billion in May.\n\nIn addition, it spent N4.412 billion on national domestic gas development, N3.91 billion on gas infrastructure development, N659 million on crude oil pre-export inspection agency expenses, N3.2 billion on frontier exploration services and N196 million on renewable energy development.\n\nBesides, the corporation said it expended N5 billion on export financing, N8.3 billion on the non-functional refineries and N83.3 billion on the ongoing Nigeria/Morocco pipeline.\n\nDepot price of fuel remained at N128, while 1.885 billion litres were imported and landing cost for the 35 import vessels that brought in fuel ranged from N185.17 to N199.90.\n\nLast week, NNPC told the nation that Nigeria now loses about 42 million litres of petrol to smuggling through the country\u2019s borders, increasing Nigeria\u2019s estimated daily consumption of 60 million litres to 103 million litres.\n\nWith the menace now gaining more momentum and illegal dealers more daring, the national oil company stated that the under-recovery or the subsidy that the government pays on the product every month has begun to hover between N140 billion to N150 billion.\n\nThe development has made the corporation unable to contribute to the national coffers, as the subsidy it pays has kept wiping out the little gains made from rising international oil prices, which has now exceeded $75 per barrel.\n\nSpeaking when he met with stakeholders, including the leadership of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Department of State Service (DSS), Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and chief executives of agencies in the petroleum ministry, Group Managing Director of the corporation, Mallam Mele Kyari, said smuggling had gone beyond what the NNPC could handle.\n\nHe stated that with the current exchange rate, the pump price of petrol should be N256 per litre, adding that if the NNPC was to sell at the going rate, and incorporating the current exchange rate, fuel would be selling for about N256 a litre.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Buhari: Drug Trafficking, Abuse Pose More Threat than Insurgency, Banditry",
          "text": "\u2022Says drug abuse already stretches across three generations\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Laleye Dipo in Minna\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, identified drug trafficking and abuse as more threatening to the stability of the nation than banditry and insurgency that are prevalent in some parts of Nigeria.\n\nThe president, declared that drug abuse has become so endemic in the country now that it already stretches across three generations of grandparents, parents and their wards.\n\nThis is just as the the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), has disclosed that within the last five months, no fewer than 2,180 suspected traffickers including five drug barons had been nabbed across the country.\n\nPresident Buhari, who was represented by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustaph, spoke at the launch of the War Against Drug Abuse (WADA), an initiative of the NDLEA to mark the United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking themed: \u201cShare Facts on Drugs. Save Lives.\u201d\n\nThe President emphasised that the anti-drug war was more deadly than the insurgency in the Northeastern part of the country or the acts of banditry in the Northwest or the acts of kidnapping that transcends all the geopolitical zones of this country.\n\nAccording to him, it is a war that is destroying three generations, because there were clips of some grandparents on drugs, parents on drugs, and by extension, their wards and children had also taken to drugs.\n\n\u201cSo, this is a war that is targeting three generations in a stretch. So, it is more deadly than even the security challenges that we are having in this country and I believe strongly that every effort must be put in place to ensure that we deal with the issues of substance abuse and trafficking and manufacture so that we can get to the root cause of the mirage of insecurity problems that are confronting this nation and I believe strongly, with every bit of conviction, that if we are able to deal with the issues of drug abuse, substantially, our security challenges will drastically reduce as we walk towards a drug free, Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe President also charged the NDLEA to intensify efforts at ridding the vast forests of the Southwest and South-South regions of the country of criminal elements, who had made the places their hideouts, from where they launch criminal onslaughts as well as for farming marijuana.\n\nPresident Buhari said: \u201cI am directing the NDLEA to develop a robust risk-communication and community engagement strategy that will not only disseminate the four pillars of the plan to responsible entities, but also deal with destroying production sites and laboratories, break the supply chain, discourage drug use and prosecute offenders as well as traffickers, rehabilitate addicts and enforcement of relevant laws.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly draw the attention of the agency to the fact that the use of many of our forests as criminal hideouts is because large swathes of cannabis plantations are hidden deep within those forests, especially, in the Southwest and the South-South.\n\n\u201cYou may, therefore, need to drive these criminal elements from such hideouts, because they use it for the growth of these plants and also as a repository for criminal elements to conclude and plan their adventures on our people\u201d.\n\nHe, however, called on all families, schools, civil society organisations, professional associations, religious organisations, the academia, community leaders and individuals to work for the common good in order to rid their communities of drug use and trafficking.\n\n\u201cAs your President, I will continue to address underlying causes of drug abuse, including poverty reduction, for which my pledge for lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in the next 10 years and strengthened by the recently developed National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy signposts my unwavering commitment.\n\n\u201cI would like to appreciate our stakeholders and international collaborators, especially, the European Union, and the United Nations Office for Drugs and Control, for their unwavering support to our drug control efforts, including the development of our roadmap. Also appreciated are the members of the inter-ministerial committee on drug control, civil society organisations, the academia, for their contributions and efforts to our National Drug Control initiatives.\n\n\u201cThe war against drugs is a war that must be fought by all, it is therefore my pleasure, to declare on behalf of the good people of Nigeria, a War Against Drug Abuse (WADA), not just as a slogan, but a call for civil action for all Nigerians to take active part in this war\u201d.\n\nShedding more light on their current efforts, Chairman of the NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (rtd) put the cash value and drugs seized in the past five months since he assumed office at over N90 billion adding that over 2,180 traffickers had been arrested, including five drug barons controlling different cartels across Nigeria.\n\nHe also revealed that a record 2.05 million kilograms of drugs were intercepted and seized across the country; and 2,100 drug offenders prosecuted with 500 already jailed by courts.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhile the statistics are impressive, we wouldn\u2019t deceive ourselves that we have succeeded in cleaning the Augean Stable in five months. We have only made a head start. We need to sustain the momentum. We need to win the drug war. We cannot afford to be complacent.\u201d\n\nMarwa said going by the available statistics, Nigeria ranked the highest users of cannabis worldwide, adding that revelations from kidnapped victims have collaborated the facts that illicit substances were enablers of insecurity currently plaguing the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is not difficult to conclude that drugs have been catalysts of terrorism, kidnapping, banditry, armed robbery and various violent conflicts that are currently Nigeria\u2019s albatross. The enormity of the danger of drug abuse calls for an urgent need to nip the problem in the bud. This is the reason we have redoubled our efforts in the past five months with the Maxim of Offensive Action.\n\n\u201cToday, it is a glaring fact that Nigerian youths are involved in drug abuse. Over the years, an undesirable subculture had flourished whereby adolescents and young adults wantonly indulged in the abuse of illicit substances. They not only became addicted to conventional substances such as cannabis and prescription opioids, such as tramadol and codeine, they also experimented with dangerous mixtures leading to novel psychotropic substances such as \u2018monkey tail\u2019 and \u2018skoochies\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn the context of that warped reality, they also normalised the smoking of cannabis as we have seen in some popular music videos and on social media. \u2018High\u2019 became part of their social media. So, it wasn\u2019t surprising, when research began to give us bleak statistics. The National Drug Survey 2019, for example, indicated that cannabis is the most commonly abused substance by an estimated 10.6 million Nigerians, some of whom started smoking as early as 19 years of age.\n\n\u201cThe Global Drug Survey 2019, also, cited cannabis as the most abused substance with West Africa having the highest abuse prevalence. The World Health Organisation on substance abuse also stated unequivocally that cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance in Africa, with the highest prevalence, between 5.2% and 13.5%, found in West Africa. Ladies and Gentlemen, West Africa, by implication, means Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe NDLEA boss linked the successes recorded by the agency so far to the resolution of officers and men of the NDLEA to clean up Nigeria and make the country drug free.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd in this campaign, we are tackling the scourge of drug abuse and trafficking on all fronts. In addition to the arrest and prosecution of drug offenders, we have worked out intensive drug abuse awareness and sensitisation programmes targeting different groups, with an emphasis on youths. In this regard, my administration has thrown the door open to all for partnership in the fight against abuse of illicit substances. It is to this end that we have set up a Special Purpose Committee to involve stakeholders in the cause.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Femi Gbajabiamila, called on the President to approve the appointment of 10,000 additional workers for NDLEA, which he said was currently \u201cunderstaffed\u201d, \u201cunderfunded\u201d, and \u201cill-equipped\u201d.\n\nGbajabiamila, who was represented by Chairman, House Committee on Drugs and Narcotics, Hon Francis Agwu, said the NDLEA was using weapons used during the civil war, stressing the need to fight the menace of drugs abuse in the country as all crimes were enabled by narcotics drugs addiction.\n\nAccording to him, the National Assembly was working to amend the Police Trust Fund Act to ensure that other policing agencies like NDLEA benefitted from the pool, adding that efforts would be made to guarantee accelerated endorsement of the president after its amendment.\n\n\u201cIf the surge in crimes must be minimised, then, we must fight narcotics drugs addiction,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a goodwill message, the United Nations General Secretary, Antonio Guterres, lamented that the world drug problem remains an urgent challenge that threatens to exacerbate damage impact and hinder a healthy recovery.\n\nRepresented by Oliver Stolpe, the Country Representative, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the UN Scribe urged law enforcement agents to go after the criminals at the upper level of the drug trafficking chain, who reap the highest profit and wreak the greatest havoc.\n\nGuterres said, the 2021 world drug report of UN, showed that death and crime attributed to disorders have nearly doubled over the past decade, adding that while new HIV/AIDS infections among adults have declined worldwide but not among people, who injected drugs, which accounted for 10 per cent of new infections in 2019.\n\nHe, however, claimed that international cooperation had helped to limit the proliferation of new psycho active substances but the problem was shifting to poorer regions, where control systems were weaker, drug sales continued to rise and non-medical use of pharmaceutical such as Tramadol and Codeine was expanding.\n\nHe too agreed that drug trafficking and organised crime fuel and perpetuate circles of violence and conflicts, adding that armed groups and terrorists profited from the illicit drugs trade, even as the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic has left millions of people more vulnerable to drug crime and illicit drug cultivation.\n\nIn a related development, the Niger State Commander of the NDLEA, Mr. Haruna Kwatiche, has said bandits, kidnappers and terrorists operated after consuming hard drugs, which usually gave them fake confidence and strength.\n\nKwatiche, who disclosed this in Minna, Saturday, said these categories of people often claimed they did not know how and why they embarked on such acts after being arrested and when the effect of the drugs had worn out.\n\nSpeaking at an event to mark this years United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and illicit Trafficking, Kwatiche said the country should rise up to stop the circulation of hard drugs by bringing all peddlers under the law if the activities of bandits kidnapers and terrorists were to be reduced to the barest minimum in the country.\n\nHe admitted that 90 per cent of other crimes and criminalities were committed under the influence of drugs and warned that, \u201cUntil all stakeholders join hands together to fight this menace, crimes and criminalities will continue to increase\n\n\u201cThe NDLEA is committed to confronting circulation and consumption of hard drugs frontally\u201d the Niger commander declared, adding that to achieve this the Agency required the support of all the major stakeholders in the states of the federation.\n\nThe Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Matane, commended the NDLEA for its renewed war against drug abuse and illicit trafficking in the state and assured the agency of government\u2019s support in order to reduce the menace of drug abuse in the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nIn monetary terms, changes in marginal fields\u2019 ownership in the oil and gas industry were worth about $584 million in 2019, the latest report on the sector by the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) has indicated. The report showed that the changes were mainly due to internal reorganisation by asset owners, inability to pay outstanding debts owed to government, and non-development of oil assets, leading to revocation of licences.\n\nIn all, eight of the deals yielded the $584 million, the sum generated by three of the changes were not available in the report, while four changes were due to revocation of operating licences of the original owners by the federal government.\n\nThe licences cancelled were those belonging to Allied Energy Resources, Cavendish Petroleum, Express Petroleum and Gas, Pan Ocean Corporation Asset, and Summit Oil International Limited, which operated OML 120, 110, 108, 98, and OPL 206, respectively.\n\nWhile 7 Energy transferred 62.5 per cent shares of 51 per cent equity in Stub Creek Universal Energy Resources in a transaction worth $3.682 million, it also moved 100 per cent ownership of its shares in Uquo marginal field to Savannah Petroleum Plc in a $10.586 million deal.\n\nIn the same vein, FHN transferred its 100 per cent interest to Cape Energy Limited, Vertex Energy, and Earl Act Global in a $1.99 million deal while PanOcean allocated OML 98 to the NNPC JV worth $99.836 million in a deal that was expected to be fully paid for by January 2021.\n\nForty per cent equity of Ubima field, according to the document, was assigned to Wester Ord Oil and Gas Limited for $700,000, while there was a reassignment of 38.67 per cent interest from OML 141 to Emerald Energy, Amni, and Blue Water Group.\n\nEroton E&P also assigned 16.2 per cent and 1.8 per cent of Sahara field and Bolton in a deal worth $6.901 million.\n\nBesides, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) acquired OML 11, formerly operated by Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), in a contract totalling $456.03 million. Full payment is due in Q4 2021.\n\nSimilarly, New Age Exploration Nigeria Limited acquired OML 113, while Vitol transferred 12.83 participating interest in the field in a $4 million sale.\n\nDuring the year under review, seismic data acquisition was up by 348 per cent, field development plans 65 per cent, well activities 45 per cent, while gas development plan was down by 75 per cent, with six approved for 2019, as opposed to 24 in 2018.\n\nIn terms of deferred production due to shutdowns, scheduled repairs and maintenance, pipeline breaks/leaks, and general force majeure, SPDC was the biggest casualty, with deferred production of 30.9 million barrels, comprising 56.10 per cent of the entire quantity during the year.\n\nSeplat was next with 7 million barrels, followed by SNEPCo, with 3.8 million barrels.\n\nIn addition, NPDC and Neconde suffered losses and subsequent deferment of 3.7 million barrels, Newcross\u2019 was 3.2 million barrels, Aiteo deferred 2.84 million barrels, Energia\u2019s share of deferment was 1.7 million barrels, while APDNL\u2019s loss was 733,000 barrels during the year.\n\nAll deferred production amounted to 55.2 million barrels while there were 1,387 pipeline breaks, with Mosimi recording the highest with 637 breaks, followed by Port Harcourt, 536, and Warri with 96 breaks.\n\nAccording to the report, in 2019, 43 companies emerged buyers of Nigeria\u2019s federation export crude oil, compared to 41 in 2018, with 20 of the entities accounting for 73 per cent of total sales while the rest 23 accounted for 27 per cent.\n\nIn 2019, companies operating in the Nigeria oil and gas space expended $896 million on social expenditure, including a mandatory sum of $815.59 that is paid to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), while the non-mandatory expenditure stood at $81.2 million. Of that amount, NDDC got $721.275 million from its three per cent statutory allocation, while NCDMB received $94.3 million.\n\nOf the 34 companies, three entities, including Agip, Total Upstream, and Sterling Global Resources, topped the list of the non-mandatory social expenditure companies, with $12 million, $11 million, and $10.2 million, respectively.\n\nNon-mandatory social expenditure is voluntary payment for or to the host communities and other commitments across the country. They include provision of social amenities, like roads, boreholes, health centres, etc.\n\nNEITI further observed that the requirement for all companies, including government-owned enterprises, in Nigeria to submit Audited Financial Statement (AFS) to the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and Auditor General of the Federation in six months after the preceding year was not strictly adhered to by all covered entities.\n\n\u201cThis has the potential of creating an assurance uniformity gap for the data used in the exercise,\u201d NEITI stated.\n\nHowever, the Dr Ogbonnaya Orji-led agency said despite that limitation, the additional steps taken by the independent administrator using other elements of the accounts covered the gap caused by the development.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Nigerian businesses face an avalanche of losses as the Twitter ban continues",
          "text": "On Saturday the 5th of June, Wunmi*, a digital marketer lost a gig worth \u20a6600,000 ($1,200). The marketing campaign was to start the next day but she got a call from the client telling her they couldn\u2019t proceed anymore due to \u2018orders from above.\u2019 She was dumbfounded.\n\nThat same day, about 39 million Nigerians woke up to realize that they couldn\u2019t access Twitter except via VPNs. Internet Service Providers (ISP) in Nigeria like MTN and Airtel had blocked all access to Twitter.\n\nWhen Peju, owner of Abebi Organics, describes the day the ban was enforced, she recounts how the jokes kept coming until one by one people found that they could not tweet anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than two weeks since and the effects of the ban have been anything but humorous for businesses like hers who built their customer base on Twitter.\n\nThe ban happened a day after the Nigerian government announced an indefinite Twitter suspension. The minister of information had stated that the reason for banning Twitter was because the social media platform has \u201cconsistently made its platform available to those who are threatening Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nWhile still mourning the loss of the first job, Wunmi lost another one for the same reason.\n\n\u201cEverything felt like a waste. What was worse was another \u20a6700,000 ($1,400) deal ended up in the mud. The client paid \u20a6150,000 ($333) at least for the little job I had done,\u201d she said.\n\nThe effect on businesses\n\nFor many Nigerians, this ban has affected how they stay informed, build relationships and get opportunities. Businesses on the other hand have experienced a decline in engagements and sales.\n\nIn the case of Nifries, an online food delivery service that relies on Twitter to reach its audience, its customers aren\u2019t responding as they used to.\n\nFeranmi Ajetomobi, the founder of Nifries, explained that the Twitter ban has affected anon (short for anonymous) sales which drive about 20% of sales at Nifries. Anon sales happen when people surprise strangers or friends by buying goods for them without revealing their identity.\n\nHi @TereSagay_, Anon just opened a tab of N15,000 for you to pick whatever you want from our Menu! \ud83d\ude0d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nKindly visit https://t.co/rmQIkQXPkD and send a DM of what you want \ud83d\udc9b \u2014 Sexy Suya Burgers \ud83c\udf54 (@ni_fries) June 15, 2021\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve realised that when we reach out to a few people and there\u2019s no response, It\u2019s either because they\u2019ve taken a break or the Twitter ban has affected them. How we know it\u2019s the ban is because when these people we reach out to come online, they attribute their absence to the fact that using VPN is confusing,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Habib who runs Smiley Socks, a clothing company that also thrives on the \u2018anon sales\u2019 phenomenon, sales via Twitter have been affected. He\u2019s also noticed that engagements with tweets have reduced.\n\nThis has made him turn to other channels. He\u2019s had to pay more attention to his Instagram page and work on his SEO for his e-commerce website to maximise conversations.\n\nHe\u2019s also started experimenting with TikTok and so far, the results have been astounding. One day after he opened a new TikTok page, it already had 100 followers. The few videos he\u2019s posted already have at least 500 views, with the highest being one with over 4,000 views.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy when you think about the fact that it\u2019s a new page and we are not following anyone. Despite the engagement, there\u2019s a bigger question of how we\u2019ll convert these numbers into sales. For now, we\u2019ll just do more influencer marketing and affiliate marketing as we figure out what works,\u201d said Habib.\n\nWunmi* who has lost two deals worth over $2,500 is now considering focusing on unexplored channels like IG Reels and TikTok.\n\n\u201cFor clients that do not mind me using VPN, I go ahead and use Twitter. Unfortunately, those clients are very few. No one wants to offend President Buhari at this time for fear of being blacklisted by the government or worse, getting forcefully shut down. Clients think of many negative scenarios of how the government can strike back, they sometimes seem hilarious, but can you blame them?\u201d she said.\n\nComparing Twitter to other platforms\n\nCharles Isidi, a growth marketer and digital consultant, agrees with the need to pivot to other digital marketing channels but has a word of caution. He has experienced the effect of the decline first-hand on his personal account. With followership of about 17,000, his monthly impressions have gone from as high as 3.8 million, to under 500,000.\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for April\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for May\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for June\n\nHe says the ban will affect advertising spend and results across other digital marketing channels because Nigerian Twitter users who are using VPNs will also have their locations skewed across every other app.\n\n\u201cIf your most valuable audience is in another country that you do not know, then how can you reach them?\u201d he said.\n\nHe also raised the question of whether people know how to use VPNs safely.\n\n\u201cQuite a lot of people use free VPNs. In the next six months, we might start experiencing a lot of theft. We\u2019ll have to be looking at how much we\u2019ve lost due to cybercrimes.\u201d\n\nBusinesses might need to move to other social media platforms but Twitter offers more favourable returns in terms of marketing efforts.\n\nCompared to other advertising channels, Twitter is a cheaper and less stressful channel.\n\nHe\u2019s been trying to run a billboard campaign for the past 3 months and has been stuck waiting for Lagos\u2019 paid advertising approval. For digital adverts, in less than an hour, the advert is approved and has started delivering value for the business.\n\n\u201cUnlike other social media platforms, take Facebook as an example. A typical page with 10,000 followers reaches 3% of your audience with a post. Meanwhile, on Twitter, an organic post can be retweeted. In terms of shareability and virality, there\u2019s a reason why people love Twitter. I can say something and even if I have just 100 followers, 3 million people can see that tweet.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s difficult on Instagram where you have to make the explore page or use a hashtag that people love to get a similar kind of result.\n\nHow much is being lost\n\nCiting a scenario, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re currently managing a brand that has 20,000 followers, it\u2019ll get 1-3 million impressions on average. To be conservative, at a 0.1% conversation rate, the brand will have an average of 1,000 \u2013 3,000 new customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we put the average transaction value per customer at $3 dollars per month, that\u2019s an average of $3,000 \u2013 $9,000 dollars lost due to the ban. Let\u2019s put it across all the businesses in that range and you see that the number is massive.\u201d\n\nWith the Twitter ban, Nigerian businesses that have previously relied on the massive reach of the platform now face an avalanche of losses if the decision is not reversed soon.\n\nAnd if we were to be a little hopeful and imagine a world where the ban is lifted, how much irreversible damage has been done to the potential audience reach these businesses used to have? We\u2019ll find out soon enough.\n\n*Name changed to protect their identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Google, this week, announced the launch of two new initiatives to support African-founded startups and women-led businesses in underserved communities on the continent.\n\nThe programs include a $3 million Black Founders Fund for African startups and a $3 million Google.org grant to help women in low-income communities develop entrepreneurial skills and access funding.\n\nThrough the latter, Google is looking to support access to economic opportunity for women in sub-Saharan Africa with a $3 million grant to the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). The foundation will then provide entrepreneurship training, mentorship, coaching, and access to networks and key markets for at least 5,000 women via its annual entrepreneurship program.\n\nIn addition, seed capital in the form of one-time cash grants will be given to 500 African female informal business-owners in rural and low-income communities across Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and select francophone countries.\n\n\u201cWe believe this will enable and prepare these women who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to navigate their independent business journey through the critical start-up and early growth phase,\u201d Google said in a statement on its website.\n\nBlack Founders Fund debuts in Africa\n\nThe Google for Startups Black Founders Fund provides grants and technical assistance to early-stage startups led by black and diverse teams, with a goal of advancing the black community.\n\nLaunched in 2020 as part of a series of racial equity commitments to close a funding gap experienced by black entrepreneurs, the program has seen proven success in the United States, Brazil, and Europe, according to Google.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant has now expanded the initiative to Africa, a continent where indigenous startups are faced with insufficient starting capital and a lack of angel investors, and also find it difficult to secure financial support.\n\nAccording to Bosun Tijani, CEO of Co-Creation Hub (CcHub), which is partnering with Google on the Black Founders Fund Africa, the shortage of funding for African startups is driven by several factors.\n\n\u201cOn the demand side, there is an increase in the number of ventures emerging to solve the pervasive challenges that exist. As the number of ventures increases, the requirement for funding increases,\u201d Tijani told TechCabal.\n\nHe adds that while there has been improved investor confidence as a result of the success stories that have come out of the ecosystem, investors remain sceptical about the potential for huge exit opportunities. \u201cThis highlighted risk often dampens the quantum of funding commitment the ecosystem gets.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the number of African venture capital firms closing their funding rounds is not growing as quickly as the number of emerging ventures; institutions with long-term liabilities (such as insurance companies, pension funds, endowments) that match the VC asset class are not willing to support the development of the ecosystem because it\u2019s still nascent; and there are not enough government incentives required to encourage investments into the tech ecosystem.\n\nIn light of these challenges, Google plans to allocate the $3 million non-dilutive fund across a pipeline of 50 investable startups in Africa, with each firm receiving up to $100,000 in equity-free cash awards. Each selected company will also receive $220,000 in Google Cloud Credits and Ad Grants, as well as mentoring, technical, and scaling assistance.\n\nThe company is working with the CcHub, a leading tech community hub with a presence in Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda, to distribute the funding to the 50 selected companies across Africa.\n\nThe CcHUB team will be actively involved in the process providing insight and technical support from the selection process through to the final deployment of the capital, according to Tijani. \u201cWe will monitor and evaluate the performance of the companies that benefit from this catalytic funding,\u201d he said.\n\nWhich startups can apply?\n\nApart from having a black founder, the Black Founders Fund Africa (BFFAfrica) is looking for a startup that is headquartered in Africa or has a legal presence on the continent; building for Africa and a global market; creating jobs, has growth potential to raise more funding, and making an impact; has proven early traction (product in the market / pilots / MVP live / early revenue).\n\nThe founding team should be diverse, with at least one black C-level founding member; directly supporting the black community, and has the relevant expertise on board to be successful (either through their background or an assembled team).\n\nIn addition, Google is looking for technology startups with a live product in the market or businesses where technology is core to their ability to scale (not for consultancies or not-for-profits) as well as compatibility with Google products.\n\nThe inaugural funding for Africa is open to startups in 13 countries \u2013 including Botswana, Cameroon, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cWe welcome all startups in these countries that meet the criteria to apply. Female-led startups that meet the criteria are also strongly encouraged to apply,\u201d Tijani said.\n\nApplications for the Fund are currently open until July 7th and eligible startups can visit goo.gle/BFFAfrica now to apply.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Jesse Forrester started an e-mobility company in Kenya after deciding against going to university",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were to look at three different pictures of Jesse Forrester today, you will notice the same unmistakable red cap.\n\n\u201cIt was given to me by a dear friend and for me, it has just come to represent the people that have supported me and I carry them with me wherever I\u2019m going,\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nJesse Forrester and the Mazi Mobility team. Spot his red cap.\n\nHe pointed out how the hat contributes to his very pan-African life.\n\nJesse grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. After high school, he travelled to South Africa where he finished his A-levels at the African Leadership Academy (ALA).\n\nHis journey at ALA exposed him to several things including a wide network of pan-African thinkers.\n\nHis red cap has often gotten him mistaken as Nigerian, something he does not shy away from. But he never fails to remind people that the cap is actually from Tunisia in North Africa.\n\nAfter ALA, Jesse took up a fellowship. It was his first stab at being employed and he quickly found that it was not something that he fancied.\n\nThe idea of going to university didn\u2019t thrill him either. So he did something he\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 he started his own business.\n\nToday, his company Mazi Mobility is backed by global venture builder, Satgana, and is aiming at implementing an electric vehicle ecosystem in Africa. To this end, they recently launched a new fleet of electric bodas or motorcycles.\n\nWhen he speaks of Africa and the possibilities that exist in the space of e-mobility, his excitement is almost palpable.\n\nHe started his company without a university degree and he is now preparing himself to dominate the African e-mobility space.\n\nHis name is Jesse Forrester and this is his life in tech.\n\nIf you look back, you see it\n\nJesse grew up in Huruma flats in the Eastlands. He lived with both his parents but more time was spent with his mother.\n\nAs a child, he wanted to be a pilot but his interests varied. On some days he wanted to just sit by the television and watch a NatGeo documentary on exotic animals in the thick Amazon and on other days his PlayStation 2 was all the entertainment he needed.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t an exact time when he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a pilot anymore. It was just one of those things that\u2019s there one day but slowly faded away with time \u2013 like a puddle drying in the sun.\n\nHis varying interests expanded to include his small businesses in school \u2013 selling lemonade and sweets. He also enjoyed tinkering with things \u2013 pulling them apart and putting them together.\n\nMazi Mobility, Jesse\u2019s startup, is making it easier for boda riders to own and use electric vehicles that help save the planet by reducing CO emissions.\n\nTo pinpoint when in his life he got the inspiration to want a cleaner Africa, you would need to consider two things; a minister who did his job and a matatu\u2019s smoke cloud.\n\nIn 2004, a man named John Michuki was the Minister of Transportation in Kenya. During that time, the state of buses, or matatus, in the country was terrible. These vehicles had no speed governors, seat belts and would often carry more passengers than they were supposed to.\n\nMichuki established the \u2018Michuki Rules\u2019 which served as a game-changer for the transport sector by providing strict guidelines for matatus at the time. But one thing they inadvertently did was inspire a prepubescent Jesse.\n\n\u201cI actually saw a meaningful change that had a huge impact. And according to my mum, I said I wanted to become something in transport like transport minister.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2018 and Jesse was back from studying in South Africa and living in Nairobi again.\n\n\u201cI was walking around the city, just going on my errands, this massive matatu cuts me off and just as it\u2019s leaving and I have a mouth full of swear words, the thing just blows a huge amount of smoke in my face.\u201d\n\nSet 14 years apart, these two events paved the way for the creation of Mazi Mobility but also helped inform the decisions of a young man who really cares about his environment.\n\n\u201cJesse, meet Tech\u201d\n\n\u201cMy foray into tech really happened in secondary school, where I learned a lot about what actually makes up a game and how to actually make it,\u201d Jesse told me over our WhatsApp call.\n\nHis introduction to tech came in the form of MIT\u2019s Scratch Blocks. The program allowed people to develop programming skills by using blocks to code visually.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just explore software, his tinkering came in handy when he got a chance to work with Arduino motherboards which allow people to create complex computer systems from scratch.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a good engineer, that was kind of my path because it would mix hardware and software.\u201d\n\nJesse\u2019s tango with tech did not end in high school. It followed him right into ALA.\n\nIn 2017, when bitcoin was still worth only $2,000, blockchain was primarily known as the technology behind bitcoin and not much else. For Jesse, it became an interesting tool.\n\n\u201cI was part of a blockchain club. I was running for treasurer [in student government], and the decision was to have the elections on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nHe would go on to win the elections and also create a project that would win his school $100,000.\n\nThe journey to Mazi by way of ALA\n\n\u2018Mazi\u2019 was not always \u2018Mazi Mobility\u2019. At one point, in the time before Jesse got into ALA, it was a photography collective \u2013 one of Jesse\u2019s many interests.\n\nBut getting into the Africa Leadership Academy was not the smoothest ride for him.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you must know, it is that Jesse Forrester sets high expectations for himself. He first heard of the Academy when he turned 12 and he knew he wanted to attend but the minimum age was 15 so he decided to wait.\n\nAt 15, he was in the middle of his high school education and decided not to apply until he was done. In his final year of high school, he finally applied.\n\n\u201cThey waitlisted me. So I had a chip on my shoulder where I had to prove that I\u2019ve got the leadership potential to get into the school.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was the creation of Mazi \u2013 a photography collective with a focus on creating discourse around the environment, speaking at a TEDx talk, and getting networking certifications.\n\nAnd what did he do with all these things? He sent ALA an update. They needed to know that he was meant to be there.\n\nThis time they listened. He was accepted and resumed in South Africa for his 2-year course.\n\nAt ALA, Jesse was a part of the team behind \u201cThe Living Machine\u201d a water treatment system that won them the $100,000 Zayed Sustainability Prize in 2019.\n\nAfter his encounter with the smoky matatu in 2018, Jesse decided he wanted to start a company that provided electric matatus.\n\n\u201cI wanted to start with putting solar panels on matatus but I quickly realised that was not smart because you need like 60 of them for one matatu.\u201d\n\nWith a few calls, he was able to connect with his co-founder and founding investor Troy Barrie.\n\nWhile they discussed kicking off the business, Jesse had to leave the country briefly to present a report on The Living Machine in Abu Dhabi. During this trip, he also got a chance to interview musician and investor, Akon.\n\nJesse with Akon\n\nWhen he returned and settled down, he quit his job and focused full time on Mazi. They made plans to begin getting investors. This was March 2020.\n\nBuilding Mazi through a pandemic and looking to the future\n\n\u201cSo now we are back to running a hardware business, in Africa, in a pandemic?\u201d Jesse laughed when he said this. It was ridiculous to even think about.\n\nThe potential investors all seemed to say the same things: \u201cSo we\u2019re focusing on our portfolio companies right now. Let\u2019s touch base in about a year.\u201d\n\nAnd who could blame them, 2020 was a weird year.\n\nBut he needed to raise money and to most people, Jesse just seemed crazy. While Jesse dealt with the anxiety and despair that came with 2020, he also had to get enough money to match his founding investor\u2019s investment.\n\nA $15,000 fund from ALA helped turn things around and in February the electric motorcycles landed in Kenya \u2013 sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing is, when you import something from China, especially these bikes, you have no manuals whatsoever. So we had no way of knowing what to assemble because there was a huge language barrier, so it was incredibly challenging.\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that one of my chief engineers is a really smart guy and a biker.\u201d\n\nFor the next month, the team would spend time figuring out the bikes and how to assemble them. They were working \u201cfrom eight to eight\u201d.\n\nA deadline for a prototype bike was fast approaching and during our call, Jesse reminisced about what it felt like at the time.\n\nThey were just four men in his living room, trying to put an electronic boda together. It was a Saturday when they decided they were going to have to work all night to figure it out. That night, they had ugali and eggs for dinner.\n\nBy 6 am on Sunday, with none of them having slept a wink, they had built their first product, by themselves, in Jesse\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cAnd right now I\u2019m really proud to say that all the bikes we have are fully assembled here in Kenya, by Kenyans. And we have the capacity to assemble \u2013 with a really small team \u2013 over 200 bikes, a month from parts all the way up. Without investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always tell investors, \u2018You guys give us X cash, you can imagine what we can do.\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nI asked Jesse Forrester, as I always do with these interviews, to tell me what plans he has for the future.\n\n\u201cThe total estimated addressable market right now stands at about $12 billion in East Africa, for electric motorbikes alone, and I say hey we want to capture a fraction of the market so I want to do over 1000 bodas by the end of next year. I want to get to over 5000 bodas by the end of 2023 with up to 200 tuktuks and 100 matatus.\u201d\n\nFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ears, Jesse.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "After months of uncertainty regarding regulations, Chaka has received a license from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate its digital platform for buying and selling stocks.\n\nChaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year. As part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\n\nTosin Osibodu, the startup\u2019s CEO, said on a call on Wednesday that the acquisition took \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d and is the fruit of frequent engagement with the capital markets regulator.\n\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria. SEC\u2019s complaint was that Chaka operated \u201coutside the regulatory purview of the Commission and without requisite registration, as stipulated by the Investment and Securities Act 2007.\u201d\n\nSEC ordered Chaka to stop advertising to users, justifying it as a need to prevent \u201cunscrupulous actors\u201d from harming the investing public. Though the order was particular to Chaka, it was the first major signal that regulation was coming to the investment-tech sector.\n\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC. With the license now acquired, Osibodu says it affirms Chaka\u2019s commitment to full regulatory compliance and provides clarity to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great relationship [with SEC] that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Osibodu said.\n\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence. \u201cWe want this benefit to accrue to as many stockbrokers as possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Chaka\u2019s operations were based on a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Ltd, a Lagos-based broker licensed by the SEC. An official license now places the startup directly under SEC\u2019s supervision.\n\nChaka\u2019s app hosts over 4,000 stocks from publicly traded companies in Nigeria and the US. Founded in January 2019 by Osibodu with Olaolu Ajose as the chief technology officer, the startup bills itself as an \u201cinvestment passport\u201d which powers borderless investing for users.\n\nAnyone with an internet-enabled smartphone can download the app, sign up and begin investing with $2 or \u20a61,000. Chaka is only available in Nigeria at the moment.\n\nOsibodu did not specify what Chaka did, in terms of fees or filings, to receive the license.\n\nBut according to the SEC\u2019s recent amendment (pdf, page 3), a sub-broker license for digital platforms involves a minimum capital of \u20a610 million and a Fidelity Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum capital.\n\nOther requirements include four separate fees totalling \u20a6500,000, a number of SEC forms, company documents and other documentation about people involved with the company.\n\nDigital sub-brokers are also required to fully describe the technology that their infrastructure is built on, including details about security, backup and recovery processes.\n\nThey should have adequate Know Your Customer processes and have documented policies for managing technology risks. Also, they are expected to show how they assess the capacity of potential customers to use its platform for transactions, plus clear explanations of the features, risks, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities that come with using the app.\n\nIt is not clear if this license officially permits Chaka (and other fintechs in the sector) to offer stocks listed in foreign markets \u2013 like Tesla and Google \u2013 to Nigerians. In April, SEC sounded a warning that seemed to declare such offerings as being illegal.\n\nOsibodu\u2019s coy response was that Chaka is committed to SEC\u2019s objectives for financial inclusion in Nigeria by, among other things, increasing retail investor participation in the financial markets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\n.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

          "text": "There\u2019s no doubt that every serious business should have an online presence. This could be either a static or dynamic website for some, based on what is suitable for the kind of services you offer.\n\nIn recent times, social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp, have become important alternatives to owning an actual website.\n\nBuilding a website could cost between \u20a630,000 ($72.90) and \u20a65,000,000 ($12,150.67), depending on the agency approached for a costing.\n\nAlso, the cost of maintaining a website depends on the hosting company and the hosting package.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor some, the pricing could be as low as \u20a610,000 ($24.30) for a year of hosting; however, the fluctuating exchange rate could have affected the cost.\n\nBeing present where your customers are is crucial, but for a small business trying to stay afloat, spending a lot of money on a website just might not be the priority.\n\nMore so when there are alternatives that arguably provide the same results in the social media-driven world we live in today.\n\nIn 2019, we wrote about small businesses in Nigeria preferring WhatsApp to Instagram. And while WhatsApp is still a favourite \u2014 especially with the introduction of WhatsApp Business and its Catalog feature \u2014 small businesses have also embraced Instagram to reach new customers.\n\nWith both platforms serving small businesses in Nigeria, here is a step-by-step guide on how to set up your own online store on WhatsApp and link it to your Instagram page.\n\nSetting up your WhatsApp Business profile\n\nBuilt with the small business owner in mind, WhatsApp Business is free to download and allows businesses to connect with their customers and highlight their products and services via a tool called Catalog.\n\nSetting up WhatsApp Business is pretty straightforward and can be done in a few steps.\n\nStep 1: Download and install the WhatsApp Business app from the App Store or the Play Store\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStep 2: Verify your business phone number\n\nStep 3: Create a profile\n\nStep 4: Create a catalog\n\nStep 5: Add item(s) to catalog\n\nStep 6: Copy catalog link for sharing\n\nLinking your Instagram to your WhatsApp catalog\n\nA while back Instagram introduced its Shopping feature, which allows businesses to tag their photos with products from their catalog, making it shoppable directly from Instagram.\n\nHowever, that feature has not yet been made available in Nigeria (you can see all the eligible markets here).\n\nBut this is where the magic happens. Following the steps below, you can seamlessly link your WhatsApp catalog to your Instagram account, making the photos on your page shoppable.\n\nStep 1: Create a Linkin.bio account\n\nSince you cannot add product tags directly to your photos, you need to create a central \u2018clickable\u2019 display of the photos on your feed. Using Later\u2019s Linkin.bio is the easiest way to do this. Here\u2019s how:\n\n1. Go to Later.com and create a free account (best done on a PC).\n\n2. Connect your Instagram profile.\n\n3. On the left panel, select \u201cLinkin.bio\u201d and set up your profile.\n\n4. Add your \u201cLinkin.bio\u201d link to your Instagram bio.\n\nStep 2: Linking your WhatsApp Catalog\n\nNow, when you share a photo on your Instagram profile with a product that you\u2019ll like to link to, you can follow the steps below:\n\n1. Post the desired photo on your Instagram profile.\n\n2. In the post caption, direct your audience to tap on the link in your bio to shop the product.\n\n3. Copy the corresponding WhatsApp catalog link for the photo.\n\n4. Go to your \u201cLinkin.bio\u201d page and select the photo you just posted on Instagram.\n\n5. Paste the link to the box on the left and click \u201cSave Changes\u201d.\n\nYour Instagram will now lead new customers and clients to the specific product on your WhatsApp catalog, where they can then reach you directly and make purchases.\n\nSo there you have it, a step-by-step guide to setting up an online shop on WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\n\n\nIf you already have one, please share how it has helped your small business in the comments section.\n\nJoin us at SME Clinic 2021 to learn more about how to market and grow your business online.\n\nSME Clinic by Techpoint is the largest training event for SMEs in Nigeria, attended by over 2,500 business owners.",

          "text": "Classifieds marketplace, Jiji, has today announced its acquisition of Cars45 for an undisclosed amount. This would see the class-eds company make a foray into transactional marketplaces.\n\nSince its inception, Cars45, founded by former Konga and DealDey executive Etop Ikpe, has seen several owners. A year after opening its doors, the startup received $5 million in funding from the Frontier Cars Group, supported by Balderton Capital, EchoVC, and TPG Growth. Consequently, FCG became the parent company of Cars45.\n\nIn 2019, OLX Group gained a controlling stake in FCG \u2014 which it valued at $700 million \u2014 for $400 million. In 2020, the group acquired Cars45 from the company.\n\nIn March 2021, OLX Autos announced plans to focus on their Asian and Latin American branches following FCG\u2019s Berlin operations\u2019 shut down, signalling Cars45\u2019s imminent sale.\n\nCars45\u2019s acquisition could be significant as it further strengthens Jiji\u2019s position in Africa\u2019s eCommerce market. Per TechCrunch, Jiji\u2019s co-founder, Vladimir Mnogoletniy, revealed that vehicles listing is the second most popular category on Jiji after real estate. Add to that Cars45\u2019s extensive network of inspection centres that ensure that cars are properly evaluated before being listed. It is easy to see why this acquisition makes sense for Jiji.\n\nReportedly, users of both platforms will get an improved experience as the plan is to integrate both companies into one. While users on Cars45 would benefit from Jiji\u2019s dominance in the classifieds space, Jiji would be able to combat issues of mistrust by leveraging Cars45\u2019s inspection centres.\n\nThe Cars45\u2019s deal might not be the last we hear of Jiji in the transactional marketplace as CEO, Anton Volyansky hinted at more acquisitions.\n\n\u201cIn terms of classifieds, we\u2019re looking at opportunities, but we are already a leader in Africa, so I think there\u2019s very limited space for whom to acquire. However, we\u2019re primarily interested in deals like Cars45, where we bring our leadership positions from classifieds and acquire very close business models that give us exposure to the transactional marketplace. So for us, a major interest will be to acquire adjacent business models,\u201d he said.\n\nAre there any other acquisitions to look out for? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below.",

Source: Menabytes\n\nEgypt\u2019s Minly has raised $3.6 million in seed funding to connect fans and celebrities with authentic and personalised experiences. The round, which the startup says was \u2018oversubscribed\u2019, was co-led by 4DX Ventures, B&Y Venture Partners, and Global Ventures.\n\nIt also included participation from unnamed regional funds and angel investors like Scooter Braun, Founder of SB Projects, and Jason Finger, Co-founder of Seamless Web and GrubHub.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCameo lookalike: Like Cameo, Minly allows users to connect with celebrities such as athletes, musicians, and actors. They can request a video, voice, or business shoutout for a specific fee set by the celebrity as advised by the startup\u2019s team. A percentage of this fee goes to the Magdi Yacoub Global Heart Foundation.\n\nNot the only one: Minly is not the only startup in the Middle East and North African (MENA) region looking to capitalise on the creator industry. Others include Starzly, Halahi, and Starprise, all in the celebrity shout marketplace in the MENA region.\n\nWhat\u2019s the big idea? If you are like me and wondering why this is a thing, these numbers will interest you. Since launching last year, Minly has more than 50,000 users. Add to that the fact that the creator economy market has surpassed $100 billion in value this year, and the picture becomes clearer.\n\nYou might also remember the viral Twitter video made via Cameo by Originals star Joseph Morgan.\n\nEgyptian startups on fire: Recently, the North African country has enjoyed an avalanche of funding. In the last three months, we\u2019ve seen Fatura, Homzmart, MoneyHash, Mozare3, Bosta, Telda, and Koinz making big money moves.\n\nAccording to fDi\u2019s African Tech Ecosystem of the Future 2021/2022 ranking, Egypt places 3rd overall but has the best Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) strategy. Certainly, the country\u2019s space is one to watch.\n\nGoogle will start warning you when search results are unreliable\n\nPhoto on Photostockeditor\n\nIn a blog post, Danny Sullivan, Public Liaison for Search at Google, revealed the company\u2019s newest feature for search results. A warning notice will now appear, indicating that sources for a particular news topic might be unreliable.\n\nEssentially, where information is constantly changing, and a range of sources haven\u2019t weighed in, the notice will appear, telling users to check back later when there might be a more balanced number of sources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe feature was first noticed by Stanford Internet Observatory researcher, Renee DiResta, who described it as a \u201cpositive step.\u201d\n\nFor now, it will only be available in English and to users in the US. Shocker!\n\nWhile the company has not specified the exact range of sources it would consider, it said, \u201cwe\u2019ve trained our systems to detect when a topic is rapidly evolving, and a range of sources hasn\u2019t yet weighed in.\u201d\n\nTaking a closer look, Google has long been criticised for allowing unreliable sources and conspiracy theories on rapidly evolving news to float to the top of search results \u2014 a challenge Twitter and Facebook are familiar with.\n\nRecently, Google has attempted to improve its search function by adding an About this Results panel, a feature to protect people from harassment, an update on product reviews and several others.\n\nWhile all of this is laudable, especially in the fight against misinformation, it also raises issues of censorship of alternative media outlets.\n\nI wonder if this might be an antitrust lawsuit in the making.\n\nCelebrating World MSME Day\n\nIn Nigeria, the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises sector has contributed up to 50% of the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the last five years, providing up to 80% of jobs.\n\nOn a global scale, the United Nations (UN) also records that MSMEs account for 90% of businesses across the globe and provide 60-70% of employment.\n\nImpressive statistics surely, but as with every sector, it was dealt severe blows by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn celebration of World MSME Day, Techpoint Africa had a chat with some of these heroic owners concerning technology\u2019s impact on their businesses and how to determine a way forward.\n\nDon\u2019t sleep on Emmanuel\u2019s story.

          "title": "EXPLAINER: 15 things you need to know about the Continuous Voters Registration (CVR)",
          "text": "Ahead of the 2023 General Elections, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), will on 28 June resume the Continuous Voters Registration (CVR) nationwide.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES brings to you 15 important things to know about the exercise.\n\n1. The CVR is for Nigerians who clocked 18 years after the last time exercise was conducted in 2018 and those who never registered but are above the constitutionally allowed age grade. This means that as long as one is 18 years old or more and has not registered before, he/she is eligible for this CVR.\n\n2. At least 5,346 INEC staff are expected to be deployed in the 2,673 centres nationwide for this exercise. According to the INEC chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, this arrangement is to buy \u201cenough time for the Commission to reach all the nooks and crannies of the country.\u201d He assured that no eligible Nigerian will be disenfranchised.\u201d\n\n3. The exercise will go on continuously over a period of at least one year and last till the third quarter of 2022, both online and across the commission\u2019s provided centres.\n\n4. INEC said it is targeting at least 20 million new voters to its existing voters.\n\n5. INEC launched a dedicated portal for online registration last week for the exercise. This is unlike the previous years where prospective voters queued in various centres to register and obtain their voter\u2019s car.\n\n6. The newly launched portal will enable Nigerians to commence the registration process online by filling the forms, other documents, then make an appointment on the web portal for a date and time to visit an INEC State or Local Government Area (LGA) office to give their fingerprints and complete the registration.\n\n7. To allay the fear of those who are not digitally inclined, physically disable in a way or more, or people residing in urban and suburban areas without access to the internet, the commission also has made provision for 2,673 centres where citizens can register physically without any form of payment, nationwide.\n\n8. Against the former laptop-based old Direct Data Capture Machine (DDCM), the 2021 CVR exercise will be conducted using a new registration machine called the INEC Voter Enrolment Device (IVED).\n\nThe device, according to the INEC chairman, was designed and built by the commission\u2019s engineers before it was fabricated abroad. It could be deployed for other activities such as accreditation of voters during elections. It is more mobile and accessible than the previous device.\n\n9. In addition, those who are already registered as voters can carry out all the other activities such as transfers of voting location from one place to another, correction of personal details and replacement of damaged or defaced Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs) online.\n\n10. Registered voters, who have had any issue during accreditation for any past election with their Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVC) and their fingerprints can use this window (2021 CVR) to make those corrections.\n\n11. Initially slated for the first quarter of 2020, the CVR exercise could not hold due to the scary impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n12. The last exercise was conducted in 2018, just before the 2019 General Elections. At the close of that exercise, Mr Yakubu confirmed in January 2019 that officially, 84,004,084 Nigerians had been duly registered for the 2019 General Elections.\n\n13. In 2018, the commission registered over 12 million new voters, a leap from the almost 70 million voters were accounted for ahead of the 2011 General Elections.\n\n14. The commission, for the first time, began the implementation of the registration of voters on a continuous basis as provided in the Electoral Act, in April 2017.\n\n15. If INEC attains its projected 20 million new voters in addition to the 2019 existing 84 million voters, Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous nation, will have not less than 124 million voting population for the 2023 General Elections.\n\nADVERTISEMENT",

The governor ignored all calls by the PDP chieftains against me.\n\n\u201cAll arrangements have been concluded for the governor to join APC. We will formally receive him on Tuesday,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former commissioner also said with Matawalle in APC, the welfare of the people of the state would be adequately attended to as the federal government would give necessary attention to the state.\n\n\u201cWith him in the APC, the success we are recording in the area of insecurity would be consolidated. We will fully have opportunities to harness the abundant mineral resources in the state for the benefit of our people.\n\n\u201cAs the next door neighbour of Mr. President\u2019s state, Katsina, Zamfara will be better in the ruling party. Welcome onboard Your Excellency, \u201cTsafe said.\n\nZMSG confirms\n\nAnd in line with Tsafe\u2019s declaration, the state Commissioner for Information, Ibrahim Dosara, formally announced the defection plan in a public service announcement on Zamfara state radio and television stations.\n\nDosara announced this Sunday in his capacity as the chairman publicity committee of the defection programme scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nPDP excos, ex-minister, others join\n\nMeanwhile, investigation by one of our correspondents revealed that both the state PDP executives, led by Alhaji Tukur Danfulani, the three senators representing Zamfara North, West and Central, Senator Sahabi Ya\u2019u, Senator Hassan Muhammed Nasiha and Senator Hassan Dan\u2019iya respectively, and some six members of the House of Representatives have unanimously backed Governor Matawalle\u2019s defection to the ruling party.\n\nAlso set to go with the governor are former deputy governor, Malam Ibrahim Wakkala and former Minister of Interior, Ambassador Bashir Yuguda.\n\nHowever, the Seventh House of Representatives member representing Talata Mafara Federal Constituency, Kabir Classic, is not joining the defectors as revealed by him to an online medium-thunder blower\n\nSimilarly, Deputy Governor Mahadi Aliyu Gusau, it was gathered, said he had not yet decided on whether to follow the governor.\n\nThe deputy governor, who is the son of a top former military brass, General Aliyu Gusau, is being rumoured to have pledged remaining in the PDP, a party his father belongs.\n\nSecondus must go, PDP youth insist\n\nAnd from the PDP South-South Youths Vanguard came a call Sunday that the party\u2019s national chairman, Prince Uche Secondus must be kicked out.\n\nThe call is coming on the heel of frequent defection of the opposition party strong members, especially governors, to the ruling APC.\n\nThe PDP youths, under the aegis of South-South Youth Vanguard, called on the party leaders to stop the drift of defection and address the negative situation in the party now.\n\nThe youth vanguard, in a statement by its national chairman, James Efe Akpofure, said the party would be empty before Secondus leaves office by December if he\u2019s not sacked now.\n\n\u201cIf the Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC) is doing well, this exodus of party members to APC will not be experienced,\u201d the youth said.\n\nThey further said \u201cthe continued stay of Secondus as the party National Chairman will destroy the party if not quickly checked.\n\n\u201cIt is embarrassing that within the space of few months, members with key positions are leaving the party.

          "text": "Tertiary institutions within and around the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja are on red alert following escalating incidences of kidnapping in higher institutions across the country in recent times.\n\nWithin the last two months, some tertiary institutions in Kaduna, Niger, Benue, Kebbi and Abia states were attacked and students taken captives for ransom, thereby heightening tension about the safety of students in higher institutions across the country.\n\nThe FCT Police Command had in May, directed the nine public and privately owned universities, polytechnic and college of education located in and around the territory to reduce their academic activities to a \u2018minimal level\u2019 to forestall inadvertently and unduly exposing their students and staff to present danger of kidnapping by insurgents and bandits.\n\nThe directive followed unusual movements of persons suspected to have banditry profiling into the FCT as well as claims that insurgents were occupying Shiroro town and villages around its vicinity in Niger state.\n\nThe alleged occupied places are about two hours drive to Abuja metropolis and the respective area councils, as recently stated by Niger state Governor Abubakar Sani Bello.\n\nTertiary institutions in Abuja\n\nThe FCT plays host to eight public and privately owned higher institutions, including six universities, a polytechnic and college of education namely: University of Abuja, Nile University, Baze University, Veritas University, Dubem Polytechnic, College of Education Zuba, Philomath University Kuje, African University of Science and Technology Abuja (yet to take off) and Bingham University in Karu, Nasarawa state with very close proximity to the FCT.\n\nTertiary institutions meet security agencies\n\nAccordingly, the police authorities held series of meetings with respective higher institutions\u2019 management highlighting the present danger as well as taking precautionary measures aimed at averting such danger in future.\n\nBeyond holding meetings at the level of the FCT Police Command, the tertiary institutions\u2019 managements equally held security meetings with their respective Divisional Police Officers in the six area councils where further precautionary measures were suggested and modalities for implementation put in place.\n\nIn one of such meetings between the Zuba DPO and the College of Education, Zuba held Thursday, June 17th, 2021, the school management was directed to increase the presence of plainclothes security operatives in and around their facilities and to ensure both students and visitors were properly profiled but without attracting attention.\n\nSpeaking on the development, a senior management staff of the college, who, for administrative purpose, spoke under anonymity said: \u201cYes, we were directed by the police authorities in the FCT Command to step up security presence in our facilities because of the escalating incidences of kidnapping in tertiary institutions in the country.\n\n\u201cIn fact, just yesterday (Thursday, June 17th, 2021) we were in a meeting with the DPO of Zuba where we discussed issues of security of the school and its environs and it was resolved that security be stepped up to reflect the current situation.\n\n\u201cEven before the directive, our security arrangement has always been intact. We have the presence of operatives of the Directorate of State Security Service in and around the school. They are there to monitor and assist us coordinate security activities within the school because of our huge students\u2019 population and staff. We are always conscious of security, especially following the escalating cases of kidnapping for ransom of tertiary institutions\u2019 students in the country in recent time,\n\n\u201cBefore now, we had taken solid measures to tighten security around our facilities and the students\u2019 population and we are not about to slack. Instead, in response to the current threat, we are ever more determined to further strengthen our presence and boost security consciousness among students and staff.\u201d\n\nUniAbuja\n\nSimilarly, the University of Abuja Head of Information Department, Dr Habib Yakoob, said the school, in conjunction with the police authorities, has adopted measures to further tighten security within and around the permanent site of the university located along the Airport Road.\n\n\u201cAs you can see in the school, students are going about their normal businesses without tension, there is calm because there is reasonable security. We are on our toes, very alert and monitoring situation.\n\n\u201cThis university is a federal government entity so we are not in charge of the police nor any official security agencies but what we have done is to have our internal security mechanism that we hope can contain any security issues.\n\n\u201cOur security personnel have the capacity to carry out surveillance to ensure the safety of our students. Besides, they are working in conjunction with the federal government security agencies, particularly the police, in case we have a threat,\u201d Yakoob said.\n\nVeritas University\n\nAt Veritas University, a privately owned institution, the institution scaled down academic activities, including vacating the students on campus.\n\nThis was stated by the institution\u2019s Vice Chancellor, Professor Hyacinth Ichuko.\n\n\u201cWe are a residential university and over time, we have been very conscious of the security of our staff and students. We have had to build a police station in front of the university at the buffer zone of the university and they (police) are gracious enough to send 14 police officers there. Still that does not stop our internal security efforts. We have beefed up our own internal security in terms of use of no-armed bearing security operatives,\u201d Ichuko said while featuring on a recent television programme.\n\nNotwithstanding the various security arrangements put in place by the various authorities, Professor Ichuko called for increased military presence in schools as well as collaborative efforts among the higher institutions and parents as well as the security agencies.\n\nThis, he said, would not only ensure the institutions are protected but would also wade off the threat of kidnapping and banditry-related vices and make it almost impossible in the FCT higher institutions.\n\nPerimeter fence\n\nThough each of these schools occupies large expanse of land, very few of them have protective perimeter fence which could stall encroachment by unwanted elements.\n\nFor instance, University of Abuja has almost 12,000 hectares of land at its permanent site along Airport Road, but less than 5,000 hectares enjoy perimeter fence with almost the long stretch of land comprising of hills and rocks and thick bushes behind its perimeter yet to be fenced.\n\nSpeaking on this, spokesman of the university, Dr. Yakoob said: \u201cWell our perimeter fence, in all modesty, covers a relatively large portion of the university and work is still ongoing. But the university is not only relying on the perimeter fence. We have reasonably adequate security and we are working in conjunction with other security forces and we also have a mechanism if there is any threat to our security.\u201d\n\nAlso, Veritas University said it\u2019s doing its best to provide a secure environment for both students and staff, stressing that the security buffer zone created was for that purpose.\n\n\u201cWe also want to create a security buffer around the university and we have gone out of our way to support the vigilante groups around the communities,\u201d Ichuko explained.\n\nBut the situation at the College of Education, Zuba is almost similar to the UniAbuja as the school\u2019s permanent site is entirely without front and back perimeter fence.\n\n\u201cWe have perimeter fence around the temporary site and also around the permanent site,\u201d a senior staff insisted.\n\nHowever, our correspondent observed that though it (COE Zuba) occupies several acres of land, but apart from the unused main entrance, perimeter fence is nonexistent leaving the school completely exposed.\n\nThe sprawling permanent site consisting of about three acres of land is a beehive of construction activities with herders and farmers competing for portions of the land.\n\nThe same is applicable to Baze University where a makeshift security presence is at the entrance with a reflexive mirror used to check the under of cars while pedestrians could walk almost with minimum hassles. From behind it shares a boundary with the thick bush adjacent to the CCECC, International Cancer Centre along the Lugbe Expressway but with a near nonexistent perimeter fence.\n\nStudents raise concern\n\nStudents of Veritas varsity, Baze varsity, UniAbuja and others all lamented the lack of protection which perimeter fence could have offered them and pleaded with the federal government to prevail on their respective school managements to construct perimeter fence to provide a measure of safeguard against intruders into their schools.\n\nA final year student at Veritas University Bwari, \u2018May\u2019 Danjuma, said since they were asked to vacate their hostels sometime April, most students had been anxious to complete their programmes.\n\n\u201cWe have been eager to get over with our programmes because the tension is palpable. In fact, none would want to experience the ordeal the kidnapped students of Greenfield University got in the hands of kidnappers. I can\u2019t imagine being subjected to any ordeal in the hands of kidnappers or insurgents. Most students would gladly welcome the presence of the military in our school pending when the situation normalizes,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, a student of the Faculty of Arts (English Language) University of Abuja, who simply identified himself as Theo, lamented the insecurity around the school.\n\nTheo said: \u201cThe tension generated by insecurity around schools is worsened by lack of adequate presence of security operatives. Besides, we, in the Faculty of Arts, are not safe at all because the school is seriously exposed without the perimeter fence at the stretch of land that constitutes the back of the school. You can see rocky hills, columns of thick bushes all around, herders stray in at will and you don\u2019t know who is who. The school is vulnerable without the protective perimeter fence. We need improved deployment of the police and other armed security outfits.\u201d\n\nAnother student, Ismail Musa, said: \u201cThe federal government needs to step up security presence in schools in the FCT particularly tertiary institutions which seem to be the focus of attacks by unknown gunmen or kidnappers. Whatever internal arrangements the schools have made is not enough to guarantee reasonable security.\u201d\n\nExpressing similar worry, Bobby Frank,a student of College of Education Zuba said: \u201cInsecurity has become the sad reality of our society and it has induced tension, particularly in schools which are gradually becoming the epicentre for kidnappers. Well, while we count on God, we hope the government will beef up security around school facilities not only in the COE, Zuba but everywhere as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsurgents and kidnappers I think are working together firstly to create tension and then scare away students from school. If the government does not want education in the country destroyed, now is the time to act decisively against these unwanted elements in the society. Besides, tightening security in schools, it is high time the government arrested, prosecuted and jailed kidnappers and insurgents to tame the tide of invasion of schools and kidnapping of Nigeria\u2019s future leaders,\u201d said another student, Muradi Bulama.\n\nAt the Philomath University, Kuje which is set to resume academic activities September, communities around the institution urged the authority to tighten security around the facility because of its vulnerability to attacks from \u201cdebased elements.\u201d\n\nExpert says there\u2019s reason to worry\n\nCommenting on the development, a security expert, retired Captain Aliyu Umar Babangida and CEO Coldwater and Riversand Consult, in a recent television programme, shared the concern of the students.\n\nThe ex-military intelligence officer said: \u201cIn virtually all the regions, we have a very heightened state of fear due to insecurity. It is not surprising that people who have seen nomads moving cows from one place to another have become worried.\n\n\u201cThe tension is further heightened because a certain group of people and their activities have become synonymous to insecurity because the situation itself was not managed properly a initio. Certain men did not manage these kidnappers and herdsmen\u2019s security issues properly and today one has become synonymous to the other.\u201d",

          "text": "Public health experts and anti-substance abuse campaigners have warned of the dangers of drug abuse on the occasion of the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking\n\nThey also cautioned Nigerians, especially food vendors, to desist from the practice of using paracetamol as tenderiser in cooking meat and beans, saying it can cause kidney and liver failure.\n\nWhile making reference to the recent killing of Super TV CEO, Usifo Ataga by 21-year-old Chidinma Ojukwu under the influence of hard drugs and alcohol, the experts listed commonly abused drugs in Nigeria to include cannabis, cocaine, rohypnol (roofies), tramadol, amphetamine, heroin, diazepam, codeine and cough syrup.\n\nThey spoke in Abuja at the weekend at the Third Scientific Week and commemoration of the 2021 International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, with the theme \u2018Share Facts On Drugs, Save Lives\u2019.\n\nThe event was organised by the Association of Hospital and Administrative Pharmacists of Nigeria (AHAPN), Abuja Branch.\n\nSpeakers included the Chief of Staff to the Deputy President of the Senate, Pharmacist Otive Igbuzor; Chairman, National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (MDLEA), Brigadier General Mohammed Buba Marwa; Chairman, AHAPN, Abuja Branch, Dr. Abubakar Danraka among others.\n\nIn his remarks, Pharmacist Igbuzor who chaired the event, expressed worry that the rate of drug abuse in Nigeria is about thrice the global average of 5.3 percent.\n\nHe harped on the need to share research findings, evidence-based data and life-saving facts to combat the menace of drug abuse.\n\nHis words: \u201cStatistics show that drug abuse affects the youth more as 70 percent of drug abusers in Nigeria are youth. The facts are chilling. A study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in 2018 indicated that 14.4 percent or 14.3 million people aged 15 and 64 years in Nigerian abuse drugs. This is very high compared to global annual prevalence of 5.6 percent. The drugs mostly abused are cannabis, opiods (tramadol, codeine or morphine) and cough syrups containing codeine.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that drug abuse and illicit trafficking continue to have a profoundly negative impact on socio-economic development and stability of communities across the world. In Nigeria, the increased incidence of armed banditry, terrorism and murder are associated with drugs.\n\n\u201cFrom all indication, a solid basis for global solutions to these challenges lies with the drug, crime and corruption conventions of the United Nations and drug policies of various countries. The conventions and policies offer a balanced approach to halting trafficking, promoting viable alternatives to farmers of illicit crops and offer drug users their health and human rights\u201d.\n\nIn his keynote address, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig. Gen. Mohammed Buba Marwa (rtd), lamented that 90 per cent of criminalities in Nigeria is linked to drug abuse and illicit trafficking.\n\nThe former Military Administrator of Lagos State solicited the support of everyone in tackling the menace.\n\nThe phenomenon of drug abuse has reached a worrisome level, he noted, stressing that it will require collective effort to combat the menace.\n\nRepresented by Mrs Chizoba Etuka, Marwa highlighted the dangers of drug abuse to include incapacitation of work force of organisations, ruining of communities and societies, disintegration of families among others.\n\nHe lamented that it has also given rise to all types of crimes such as insurgency, terrorism. banditry, kidnapping, rape and violent extremism.\n\n\u201cThe dynamism of the drug problem has made it imperative for us to continue to deepen our knowledge and understanding of this deleterious conundrum. In this regard, sharing facts about drug abuse and illicit trafficking in narcotics, as captured by this year\u2019s theme, will go a long way in shedding some light on hitherto hidden factors that aid predisposition to substance abuse, especially the question of new psychoactive substances.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be stressed that the far reaching implications of substance abuse in our society should not be underestimated. It is seriously touching the roots of our society, it ruins the lives of our young children, it influences criminal activities, contributes to the spread of sexually transmitted infections including HlV/AIDS, health consequences, poverty, domestic violence and other forms of violence and in fact every facet of our society and necessitates our urgent attention.\n\n\u201cWhat is even more frightening is the fact that our children are in the forefront of drug abuse. Without any doubt, the phenomenon of substance abuse has reached alarming levels. There is no reason to believe that this problem will be resolved or contained in the near future, if we do not take collective action now. We have to act with determination now to put an end to substance abuse and illicit drug trafficking. The business of fighting against drugs and crime needs to become the priority on the mind of every Nigerian,\u201d he said.\n\nOn his part, Dr. Danraka warned against abuse of rohypnol also known as roofies, date rape drug, forget me drug among others.\n\nHe also decried what he called \u2018chaotic distribution system\u2019 where hawkers and unlicensed patent medicine vendors dispense drugs to citizens, even as he warned against cooking with Paracetamol.\n\nThe public health expert explained that even though rohypnol is used for controlling depression and calming down over-excited people, individuals abuse it by combining it with other substances.\n\n\u201cThe complications of drug abuse is that most of the victims tell you one thing but when you assess and evaluate it, it is another. It is not only rohypnol that can give you that kind of reaction; it is a cocktail. Rohypnol is not the problem. It is what they use in conjunction with the rohypnol They use a cocktail of agents: LSDs, tramadol in high doses.\n\n\u201cSome studies have shown how food vendors are using high dose of Paracetamol to hasten commercial cooking. The danger is that you are killing your kidney at a higher rate. Because the ultimate effect is that we are now having higher cases of kidney and renal failures as a result of these consumptions,\u201d he said.",

The funds are meant to incentivize Tunis to keep its borders shut.\n\nThe EU is also discussing a similar deal with Libya.\n\nPresident Kais Saied met with European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels in early June.\n\nOn June 1, the EU announced that it had disbursed 300 million euros in macro-financial assistance to Tunisia.\n\nThere have been 11,000 departures from January to April 2021 from Libya, over 70 per cent more than in the same period last year, according to the UN refugee agency UNHCR.\n\nThe agency said the \u201cdeteriorating\u201d conditions of migrants in Libya were pushing many to make the dangerous crossing from the North African coast to Europe.\n\nAccording to the UN, at least 760 people have died trying to make the Mediterranean crossing between January 1 and May 31.",
