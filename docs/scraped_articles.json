While Ugochukwu became a parallel candidate of the PDP, Andy picked the ticket of the APC as party elders claimed no primary was held in the state and called for a repeat exercise.\n\nUgochukwu Uba won the primary organised by the Chukwudi Umeaba-led faction of the PDP held at Paul University Complex, Awka. He scored 275 votes of the 665 votes cast to emerge as winner of the faction as announced by Obidi Ebede, chairman of the electoral panel.\n\nAnother aspirant, Godwin Ezeemo, polled 114 votes to emerge second, while Senator Uche Ekwunife was third with 56 votes and Obiora Okonkwo got 44 votes.\n\nOthers aspirants were Godwin Maduka 22, Jonny Maduafokwa 27, Chris Azubogu, Valentine Ozigbo, and Ifedi Okwenna got two votes each, while Walter Okeke had 42 votes.\n\nHowever, Chief Valentine Ozigbo, the immediate past President and former Group CEO of Transcorp Plc, won the PDP ticket in another primary held at the Women Development Centre, Awka.\n\nWith the emergence of the candidates, the shape of the November 6 governorship election is taking form.\n\nFormer Central Bank of Nigeria Governor, CBN, Professor Chukwuma Soludo, had on Thursday won the ticket of the ruling All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA. And Obiora Emmanuel Agbasimelo also picked the Labour Party, LP, ticket, last week.\n\nINEC awaits report\n\nMeanwhile, the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, declined comments on the controversial primaries and candidates, saying it was still waiting for the reports of the various exercises.\n\nINEC Commissioner/Chairman Information and Voter Education, Dr Festus Okoye, speaking on Channels Television said: \u201dWe have to wait to get the report of the priamries in Anambra.\n\n\u201cI am not in the position to talk on the process followed because the constitution of the party determines the guidelines. Conduct of primaries is within the party\u2019s constitution.\u201d\n\nHow Andy Ubah won APC ticket\n\nThe former Senator who represented Anambra South Senatorial District, Andy Ubah, was declared winner of the APC governorship primary contested by 13 other aspirants.\n\nDeclaring the results of the exercise, yesterday morning, at the Golden Tulips Hotel, Agulu, Anambra State, the Chairman of the Anambra State Primary Election Committee and Governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun, said Senator Ubah polled 230,201 votes out of the 348,490 ballots, to defeat his closest rival, Onunkwo Johnbosco who got 28,746 votes.\n\nAbiodun said election took place in 20 of the 21 local councils of the state, noting that election could not hold in Onitsha South due to the failure of the returning officers to conduct the election after collecting election materials from the Committee\u2019s Secretariat.\n\nThe governor further disclosed that an Option A-4 method was adopted in the election, and blamed the delay in the conduct of the election as scheduled on the failure of the contestants to supply 30 of their representatives as directed by the Committee.\n\nAccording to him, only nine aspirants supplied their representatives to the Committee as of 9a.m on Saturday.\n\nAbiodun explained that despite the minor hiccups, returning officers, backed by security escorts were posted to all the 326 Wards in the state, declaring that \u201cthe process was free, fair, transparent and in line with the party\u2019s guidelines, as promised by this Committee\u201d.\n\nThe election committee chairman, however, debunked insinuations from some of the contestants that the exercise was deliberately delayed, pointing out that his committee only needed to be thorough and transparent.\n\nHe added that the minor delay was not the fault of the Committee or that of the party members but that of logistics.\n\nAbiodun thanked party members and all stakeholders, especially the Committee members, who according to him, were carefully chosen for the task, and urged on all hands to be on deck to ensure victory for the party in the coming governorship election.\n\nAPC elders\u2019 forum seek cancellation of result, insist no primary election held\n\nHowever, the APC Elders Forum in the state, led by Chief Innocent Obi, said that general reports from all over the state indicated that no primary took place, that there were no election officials and materials at any of the designated locations for the primary election.\n\nIn a statement issued and signed by the Director of Media and Publicity of the Forum, Chief Joe Offorkansi tiled \u201cRe-Towards a credible APC Primary Election in Anambra state\u201d, the elders noted that reports all over the media and complaints by virtually all the governorship aspirants over the June 26,2021 primary election which didn\u2019t hold anywhere because \u201ctill 6pm on June 26,2021, no official or materials had come even till date.\n\n\u201cThe picture of the general complain depicts the existence of undemocratic practices in the said primary election, as numerous reports indicated that election was not held in any of the 326 wards in the state.\n\n\u201cThe charade could least be described by anyone as fair, credible or acceptable by any of the thousands of our party members who trooped our to cast their votes for any of the 14 aspirants.\n\n\u201cThis therefore painted any reported outcome of the primary election as dubious because in actual fact there was no primary election.\n\n\u2018\u2019We, the members of the APC Elders Forum in the state call on the National and state executives to urgently review the primary election and create a medium for appropriate measures to be taken in ensuring that all aspirants re-align their commitment to the party for unity of purpose.\n\nChief Bona Oraekwe, a former member of the Anambra State House of Assembly saw the primary election as \u201can attempt to destabilize the party to lose the November 6, 2021 governorship election in the state.\u201d\n\nLabour and Employment Minister, Senator Chris Ngige, weekend, made a similar complaint, saying that as of 7pm on Saturday, no primary had been held in any of the 326 wards and urged the APC hierarchy to fix another date for the exercise.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Former Governor of Enugu State, Senator Chimaroke Nnamani has cautioned the government at various levels to quickly find a way of positively responding to youth bulge in the country\u2019s population.\n\nNnamani, who is the Senator representing Enugu East Senatorial Zone, spoke during a public lecture he delivered at the University of Nigeria Enugu Campus, over the weekend.\n\nThe event was an Annual Leadership Forum organized by the Medical Research and Humanitarian Society, MEDRHUS.\n\nWhile linking youth restiveness to demographics, he said an inappropriate response would spell doom for the nation.\n\nHe said there must be a clear roadmap towards addressing poverty and unemployment, recommending that the youth service year could be increased from one to two or three years.\n\nThe Senator spoke on the State of the nation, identifying national transformation, poverty, critical infrastructure, youth bulge, gap crisis, among others as major areas of concern.\n\nHe said, \u201cyouth restiveness has to do with demographics; Nigeria, together with the rest of the world, will go through demographic transition; Nigeria\u2019s population, today you are talking about 195 million, by 2020, Nigeria population is expected to be about 236 million and by 2050, it will be about 410 million, moving Nigeria from 7th most populous nation to the 3rd most populous nation, so you are going to have demographic changes, you are going to have a decrease in gross dependency ratio.\n\n\u201cSo, Nigerians under 25 will increase exponentially. This expansion is called youth bulge. But the question is- how does society react to youth bulge? Society can react to youth bulge by business as usual or they can react to youth bulge by business unusual.\n\n\u201cIf the country reacts to youth bulge as business unusual by providing enabling environment to tag the economic benefits of this youth bulge, through policy formations and implementation, they will have demographic dividend accruing from this expansion population, however, if it is business as usual and the country fails to tap into this population explosion, you are going to have a demographic bomb and the inherent youth restiveness.\n\n\u201cWhat are the business unusual policies- they include providing education to this expansive population, providing health facilities, providing food, skill acquisition training, providing creativity, innovation, providing agrarian loans, entrepreneurship, to this age group to guarantee employment, to guarantee effective and adequate income and guarantee social protection for them.\n\n\u201cWhere these policies are implemented, they will be of use to the State but if contrariwise is done, you are going to have youth restiveness, you are going to have hopelessness, you are going to have social instability, you are going to have vulnerability to indoctrination, you are going to have youth restiveness, you are going to have communal violence, you are going to have religious violence, you are going to have domestic violence, inter-tribal violence as you have in the North-East Boko Haram, North-West so-called bandits, local terrorism, herder-farmer clashes, which is also terrorism, restiveness in the Niger-Delta and in the South-West and even here in the South-East.\u201d\n\nHe said the prevalent problems had to be addressed \u201cthrough policies, like empowerment and job creation. For example, we can extend one year of youth service, provide additional two or three years, but it will be purely voluntary, instead of one year youth service, you can have one or two years extra, and those years can provide skills acquisition, job training and also provide entrepreneurship for the graduates to use and face the world.\n\n\u201cYou can have a youth empowerment school, you can have a youth empowerment commission, such as you have the various character commissions which guarantee that if the government is going to employ, you must have a certain quota for the youths, you can have cottage industries, these are targeted policies to address youth bulge.\u201d\n\nOn critical infrastructure, he said it included \u201ctransportation, roads, waterways, aviation, communication, commerce, agriculture, health, among others.\u201d\n\nSenator Nnamani said the national security architecture was witnessing challenges across the country, especially within the Lake Chad basin, Boko Haram in the North-East and the split group, as well as the Fulani herders\u2019 conflict.\n\nHe said climate change and desertification was worsening the conflict involving herders, noting that stakeholders must be ready to embrace a working solution.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cwe have had cases where some state governments entered into amnesty agreements with the so-called bandits authorities, these agreements of course cannot be implemented because the bandits do not have common leadership, common goals.\n\n\u201cThere must be synergy and partnership with neighboring countries, address critical infrastructure and poverty to provide for the people, rejig security strategy, restore confidence in government. Why not provide for the youths, maybe an adult education programme?\u201d\n\nHe also identified the gap crisis, which he described as \u201cthe expansive void between those who are rich and those who are poor- inequality, massive inequality\u201d, as another major issue confronting the nation.\n\n\u201cWe have regional inequality, we have economic inequality, we have geographic inequality, we have gender inequality, that is the gap crisis; crisis as a result of massive inequality,\u201d he said.",

As you are also aware, all the responsible agencies of government have been directed to ensure that they enforce compliance by the International Oil Companies to international best practices.\n\n\u201cIn addressing your call for immediate restructuring, the National Assembly whose responsibility it is to ensure that our constitution responds to the call for a restructured Nigeria, has already concluded regional consultations and as soon as they finalise the process, necessary action would not be delayed on my part.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, your call for creation of two additional states and more local government areas for the Ijaw people is a legislative matter, which should naturally be handled by the National Assembly and seeking concurrence at the state levels.\n\n\u201cI completely agree with your call to allocate operational licenses for marginal fields to Ijaw people. However, like you know, the process of granting licenses is guided by laid down rules and regulations, most of which even favour local content and local contractors. I see no reason why they should not be granted such licenses if they qualify.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of fair and balanced appointments to reflect federal character principles, I re-affirm that this has always been my focus and would continue to be because I have always seen Nigeria as a country where everyone should be given equal opportunities.\n\n\u201cA contentious issue that has been a subject of discourse amongst the Ijaw people of recent has been the need for the Niger Delta Development Commission to live up to its billing by delivering the required succour to the people of the region. Based on the mismanagement that had previously be-devilled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July, 2021.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board would be inaugurated. However, I would like to implore you that the Ijaw National Congress should play a more active role in making sure that the mismanagement that occurred in the past is not repeated.\n\n\u201cI am particularly happy to note your call for promoting ownership of modular refineries by the Ijaw people and I will urge you to interphase with your sons who are involved in the processes of establishing these refineries, especially the Honourable Minister of State Petroleum Resources to actualize this quest.\n\n\u201cLike you well know, completion of the East-West Road is top on my infrastructure agenda and I will look to its speedy conclusion. Again, the occasional disturbance by youths in some communities along the route to construction work would require your close attention and guidance.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we have made considerable progress with the construction of the Bonny to Port Harcourt Bridge.\n\n\u201cI am very happy with the recent affirmation of your belief in a United Nigeria and while I thank you for standing with me, I will also implore you to use your leverage in making sure that we keep working together to keep this country a united, indivisible entity, so that we can tackle our problems together and overcome our challenges together.\n\n\u201cI would like now to commend Professor Okaba for your emphasis on supporting the fight against insecurity by developing internal control mechanisms as well as working with other institutions in the country to address our current security challenges.\n\n\u201cWhile I thank you once more for this visit and I will continue to count on your support as we work towards resolving our current challenges.\n\n\u201cGod Bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nBreaking News, Nigerians can now work in Nigeria and get paid in US Dollars, click hereto apply today.",

          "text": "Ibrahim Shuaibu in Kano, Laleye Dipo in Minna, Daji Sani in Yola and Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia\n\nThe efforts by President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration to reclaim old grazing routes for herdsmen may be hampered by the building of roads, hospitals, schools and other public utilities on the ways carved out for feeding cattle in the 1950s, THISDAY investigation has revealed.\n\nContrary to the clamour for an end to open grazing and the need to adopt modern ranching techniques to curb incessant clashes with farmers, Buhari has insisted that the federal government will reclaim the old grazing routes for free movement of herders.\n\nHowever, THISDAY\u2019s investigation has revealed that the grazing routes have been taken over, over the years, by modern facilities built for the public good.\n\nIn Kano State, the state government has acknowledged that the grazing routes have been taken over by public infrastructure, including schools.\n\nFollowing this development, the state Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Ganduje, has set up a Rural Grazing Area that is popularly known as (RUGA), as part of his government\u2019s efforts to secure alternative grazing areas and accommodation for herdsmen.\n\nGanduje\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Abba Anwar, told THISDAY at the weekend that the RUGA in Kano has become the first cattle herders\u2019 settlement in the country, where the nomads are to be accommodated for expansive grazing of their flock.\n\nHe stated that the first phase of 25 housing units out of the projected 200, situated on 4,413 hectares of land at Dansoshiya Forest in Kiru Council Area of the state has been delivered by the state government.\n\nAnwar added that work is in progress on phase two and phase three of the project.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that at Falgore forest in Tudun Wada Local Government Area, the remnants of the cattle routes have been lost due to the infiltration of bandits and their attendant negative activities.\n\nGanduje, however, has urged herders to stop open grazing and return to the state, saying there is now modern grazing of animals going on at Dansoshiya Forest.\n\nHe said the investments made by his administration in grazing areas would curb the recurring clashes between herders and farmers.\n\nThe governor added that fodder seeds, which will be cultivated at Dudduru in Ajingi Local Government Area will be planted at Dansoshiya Forest to provide feeds for cattle and other small ruminants.\n\nAlthough Niger State has 11 grazing routes, covering about 1,865 kilometres, 1,368 kilometres of these routes are primary routes while the remaining 496 kilometres are secondary routes.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the Magama to Rijau route is an international route linking the country with the Benin Republic from Borgu Local Government Area of the state.\n\nBut the Permanent Secretary in the state Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development, Dr. Jonathan Wasa, told THISDAY in an interview that all the routes have been encroached upon by major highways, private developers, including small-scale industries.\n\nAccording to him, with the advent of development, cattle now share the major highways with motorists.\n\nHe stated that the state does not have the resources to reclaim the routes taken over by highways and other infrastructure.\n\nWasa said due to the encroachment on the grazing routes, the major focus of the state government is to organise nomads and others into groups and settle them in grazing reserves as being done in other parts of the world.\n\nHe stated that there are the Bobi grazing reserves, which span over 36,000 hectares located in Mariga and Magama local government areas.\n\nIn addition, the state government has also designated seven other reserves. These include: Audi Kanchi in Lavun LGA, Sheyi in Shiroro LGA, Garin- Gabas in Rafi LGA, Gabi in Lapai Ndadokun and Kpotun Woro in Agaie LGA and Iri in Rijau LGA.\n\n\u201cWe are advocates of ranching but it has to be done gradually; it cannot be done abruptly,\u201d Wasa added.\n\nIn Adamawa State, the Permanent Secretary of the State Ministry for Livestock Production, Alhaji Abdulrahman Tukur, told THISDAY that the state government had set up a committee to address the frequent clashes between farmers and herders.\n\nHe said the committee had submitted its report to the state government in which is recommended, among others, that the state government should reclaim the grazing reserves for the settlement of herdsmen and stop their movements.\n\nTukur said the old grazing routes had been taken over by schools, primary healthcare centres, roads, petrol stations and other facilities, which will not allow for movement of cattle.\n\nHe said the ministry had earlier before the wet season set up a committee for each of the 30 grazing reserves gazetted and identified in the map of the state to sensitise stakeholders on the plan to reclaim the grazing reserves to settle the herders.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThe committees are working with already list of encroachers on the grazing reserves and discussions are in top gear to reclaim these grazing reserves.\n\n\u201cThose farmers that are farming on the grazing reserves; we allow them to continue farming temporarily but when they do their harvest, they would allow the herders\u2019 cattle to feed on the residues of their crops until we make the condition better for herders and stop them from movement.\u201d\n\nIn Nasarawa State, THISDAY gathered that the state government has donated all the seven grazing reserves located at Awe, Keana, Doma, Assakio, Konva, Gitata and Kurudu to the federal government for the National Livestock Transformation Programme (NLTP), as part of the efforts to stop the free movement of cattle.\n\nThe Commissioner for Agriculture and Water Resources, Prof. Alanana Otaki, told THISDAY that the state government has succeeded in claiming all gazetted cattle grazing reserves in the state without hitches.\n\nThe Sokoto State Government has also reclaimed the grazing reserves to settle herdsmen.\n\nIn a telephone interview with THISDAY, the Commissioner for Careers and Security matters, Col. Garba Moyi (rtd), said the reserves were inside the forests.\n\n\u201cFor us in Sokoto, the policy is not new to us. I could recall when I was a local government chairman some years ago, I introduced the policy which was also adopted by other local governments in the state,\u201d he said.\n\nMoyi added:\u201d \u201cMost of these grazing reserves are in the bush and we directed the Fulani to graze on any crop planted on them.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Zamfara State Government stated that it would use the grazing reserves to resettle the herders, being the worst hit by the clashes between herders and farmers.\n\nThe Special Adviser on Media and Public Enlightenment to the Governor, Mr. Zalaini Bappa, said even some former governors who trespassed on the grazing reserves returned the land.\n\nAccording to him, the state government has also started building Ruga for the Fulani in order to prevent clashes between herders and farmers.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Petrol Subsidy Bites Harder, NNPC Proposes N114.3bn Deduction in June",
          "text": "\u2022Under-recovery quadrupled in four months\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nNigeria\u2019s three tiers of government may have to look elsewhere to augment revenues accruing monthly from the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is set to make another N114.2 billion deduction from oil revenues in June to pay for petrol subsidy.\n\nA document obtained by THISDAY from the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, detailing the NNPC\u2019s presentation to the committee, which took place between June 22 and 23, indicated that as earlier reported, the corporation, which has continued to shoulder the payment of what it calls under-recovery, deducted N126.2 billion from FAAC for May.\n\nWhat the NNPC has termed under-recovery is the difference between the actual market rate of petrol and the price at which the commodity is sold at the pump, which the federation bears in order to keep the pump price stable at N162 per litre.\n\nHowever, whereas it made zero contribution to the Federation Account in April, which was shared in May, the national oil company managed to remit about N29 billion from its finances to the joint account in May cycle, which was distributed among the three tiers last week.\n\nFor January to May\u2019s funding performance, the data showed that under-recovery or subsidy claims deducted from oil revenues by the NNPC amounted to N25.374 billion in February, N60.396 billion in March and N61.966 billion in April. But it rose astronomically to N126.298 billion in May before falling to N114 billion in June.\n\nThese implied that the deduction by the NNPC more than quadrupled from the N25.374 billion in February to N114 billion in June.\n\nThis development has justified the clamour for the full deregulation of the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry to allow market forces to determine the price of petrol.\n\nHowever, the NNPC remitted a marginal net sum of N29.647 to FAAC in May, which was shared in June, as opposed to its zero contribution in April, its N90.860 billion in January, N64.161 billion in February and N41.184 billion in March.\n\nTo date, according to the document, the NNPC has been able to contribute a net sum of N225.852 billion to the federation for the year, out of its yearly projected remittance of N1.473 trillion and monthly value addition of N122.7 billion, leaving a variance of N820.684 billion.\n\nThe presentation, signed by Mr. Bello Abdullahi, on behalf of the NNPC\u2019s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Mr. Umar Ajiya, showed that the N50 billion, which is part of the corporation\u2019s financial obligations to its Joint Venture (JV) partners, meant to have been subtracted from the latest round of deductions remains pending.\n\nGross revenue from JV crude, gas and other receipts for May was N320.314 billion, less royalty of N58.3 billion, JV cost recovery of N124 billion, Profit Before Tax (PBT) of N104.4 billion, to yield a profit after-tax value of N33.26 billion.\n\nThe document showed that for April, crude oil and gas sales and receipts, available in May and shared in June, the volume of export crude oil stood at 2.78 million barrels with a monetary value of $181.191 million and equivalent of N69.360 billion, while domestic crude oil due in July was 6.63 million barrels and sold at $434.8 million. Added to export crude oil, the revenue generated was $616.037 million.\n\nNLNG feedstock gas was 27.605 MBTU valued at $38.5 million or about N16.011 billion while the total oil and gas sales stood at $654.601 million or roughly N85.3 billion, according to the corporation.\n\nIn May, export crude oil receipt was $167.7 million, about N64.2 billion, NLNG feedstock gas amounted to $34.31 million, the equivalent of N13.17 billion, while the gas company\u2019s paid arrears stood at N623.4 million, to hit a total of N77.96 billion for the receipt from oil and gas for the month.\n\nAll the transactions were hinged on N382.80 to one dollar exchange rate as advised by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), according to the national oil company.\n\nThe report said: \u201cThe sum of N126,298,457,944.36 was deducted as value shortfall resulting from the difference between the landing cost and ex-coastal price of PMS (petrol) recorded in April 2021.\n\n\u201cIn addition, May value shortfall of N114,337,097,352.49 is to be deducted from June federation proceeds in July 2021 FAAC meeting. Also, the balance of March 2021 value shortfall of N50,000,000,000.00 remains outstanding.\u201d\n\nIt stated that the overall NNPC crude oil lifting of 9.42Mbbls (export and domestic crude) in April 2021 recorded 23.59 per cent increase relative to the 7.62MbbIs lifted in March, while Nigeria maintained 1.4 million bpd Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production cut in April 2021.\n\n\u201cCrude oil export revenue received in May 2021 amounted to $167.72 million, equivalent to N64.2 billion. Domestic gas receipts in the month were N2.9 billion. Feedstock valued at $38.56 million was sold to Nigeria LNG during the period, out of which $34.32 million was received during the month, the difference being Modified Carry Agreement (MCA) obligations, gas reconciliation and credit notes.\n\n\u201cThe sum of $16.53 million, being miscellaneous receipts, gas and ullage fees and interest income was received in May 2021,\u201d it stated.\n\nA total loss of 4.527 million barrels of crude was recorded during the month due to shut-ins, repairs, leaks, power outages as well as shutdowns due to protests as a result of non-payment of community workers\u2019 salaries in Batan station and Olomoro, Uzere and Kokori.\n\nOther issues resulting in shutdowns included seawater pump trips, technical issues like high gas to oil ratio or production deferment due to vessel swap.\n\nOf the government \u2018calendarised\u2019 priority projects worth $2.680 billion, given a $536 million monthly budget, the NNPC stated that it had so far funded the projects by $636.472 million from January to May.\n\nThe document showed an outstanding balance of $1.464 billion in JV cash call arrears to International Oil Companies (IOCs) as of May 31, with the NNPC having offset $3.22 billion from a total negotiated debt of $4.689 billion.\n\nThe national oil company told FAAC that it spent N2.263 billion on security and maintenance, N1.580 billion on pipeline and other facilities repairs as well as the payment of a \u201cstrategic holding\u201d of N304.183 million, totalling N4.148 billion in May.\n\nIn addition, it spent N4.412 billion on national domestic gas development, N3.91 billion on gas infrastructure development, N659 million on crude oil pre-export inspection agency expenses, N3.2 billion on frontier exploration services and N196 million on renewable energy development.\n\nBesides, the corporation said it expended N5 billion on export financing, N8.3 billion on the non-functional refineries and N83.3 billion on the ongoing Nigeria/Morocco pipeline.\n\nDepot price of fuel remained at N128, while 1.885 billion litres were imported and landing cost for the 35 import vessels that brought in fuel ranged from N185.17 to N199.90.\n\nLast week, NNPC told the nation that Nigeria now loses about 42 million litres of petrol to smuggling through the country\u2019s borders, increasing Nigeria\u2019s estimated daily consumption of 60 million litres to 103 million litres.\n\nWith the menace now gaining more momentum and illegal dealers more daring, the national oil company stated that the under-recovery or the subsidy that the government pays on the product every month has begun to hover between N140 billion to N150 billion.\n\nThe development has made the corporation unable to contribute to the national coffers, as the subsidy it pays has kept wiping out the little gains made from rising international oil prices, which has now exceeded $75 per barrel.\n\nSpeaking when he met with stakeholders, including the leadership of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Department of State Service (DSS), Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and chief executives of agencies in the petroleum ministry, Group Managing Director of the corporation, Mallam Mele Kyari, said smuggling had gone beyond what the NNPC could handle.\n\nHe stated that with the current exchange rate, the pump price of petrol should be N256 per litre, adding that if the NNPC was to sell at the going rate, and incorporating the current exchange rate, fuel would be selling for about N256 a litre.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Says drug abuse already stretches across three generations\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja and Laleye Dipo in Minna\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, identified drug trafficking and abuse as more threatening to the stability of the nation than banditry and insurgency that are prevalent in some parts of Nigeria.\n\nThe president, declared that drug abuse has become so endemic in the country now that it already stretches across three generations of grandparents, parents and their wards.\n\nThis is just as the the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), has disclosed that within the last five months, no fewer than 2,180 suspected traffickers including five drug barons had been nabbed across the country.\n\nPresident Buhari, who was represented by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustaph, spoke at the launch of the War Against Drug Abuse (WADA), an initiative of the NDLEA to mark the United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking themed: \u201cShare Facts on Drugs. Save Lives.\u201d\n\nThe President emphasised that the anti-drug war was more deadly than the insurgency in the Northeastern part of the country or the acts of banditry in the Northwest or the acts of kidnapping that transcends all the geopolitical zones of this country.\n\nAccording to him, it is a war that is destroying three generations, because there were clips of some grandparents on drugs, parents on drugs, and by extension, their wards and children had also taken to drugs.\n\n\u201cSo, this is a war that is targeting three generations in a stretch. So, it is more deadly than even the security challenges that we are having in this country and I believe strongly that every effort must be put in place to ensure that we deal with the issues of substance abuse and trafficking and manufacture so that we can get to the root cause of the mirage of insecurity problems that are confronting this nation and I believe strongly, with every bit of conviction, that if we are able to deal with the issues of drug abuse, substantially, our security challenges will drastically reduce as we walk towards a drug free, Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe President also charged the NDLEA to intensify efforts at ridding the vast forests of the Southwest and South-South regions of the country of criminal elements, who had made the places their hideouts, from where they launch criminal onslaughts as well as for farming marijuana.\n\nPresident Buhari said: \u201cI am directing the NDLEA to develop a robust risk-communication and community engagement strategy that will not only disseminate the four pillars of the plan to responsible entities, but also deal with destroying production sites and laboratories, break the supply chain, discourage drug use and prosecute offenders as well as traffickers, rehabilitate addicts and enforcement of relevant laws.\n\n\u201cI want to particularly draw the attention of the agency to the fact that the use of many of our forests as criminal hideouts is because large swathes of cannabis plantations are hidden deep within those forests, especially, in the Southwest and the South-South.\n\n\u201cYou may, therefore, need to drive these criminal elements from such hideouts, because they use it for the growth of these plants and also as a repository for criminal elements to conclude and plan their adventures on our people\u201d.\n\nHe, however, called on all families, schools, civil society organisations, professional associations, religious organisations, the academia, community leaders and individuals to work for the common good in order to rid their communities of drug use and trafficking.\n\n\u201cAs your President, I will continue to address underlying causes of drug abuse, including poverty reduction, for which my pledge for lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty in the next 10 years and strengthened by the recently developed National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy signposts my unwavering commitment.\n\n\u201cI would like to appreciate our stakeholders and international collaborators, especially, the European Union, and the United Nations Office for Drugs and Control, for their unwavering support to our drug control efforts, including the development of our roadmap. Also appreciated are the members of the inter-ministerial committee on drug control, civil society organisations, the academia, for their contributions and efforts to our National Drug Control initiatives.\n\n\u201cThe war against drugs is a war that must be fought by all, it is therefore my pleasure, to declare on behalf of the good people of Nigeria, a War Against Drug Abuse (WADA), not just as a slogan, but a call for civil action for all Nigerians to take active part in this war\u201d.\n\nShedding more light on their current efforts, Chairman of the NDLEA, Brig. Gen. Buba Marwa (rtd) put the cash value and drugs seized in the past five months since he assumed office at over N90 billion adding that over 2,180 traffickers had been arrested, including five drug barons controlling different cartels across Nigeria.\n\nHe also revealed that a record 2.05 million kilograms of drugs were intercepted and seized across the country; and 2,100 drug offenders prosecuted with 500 already jailed by courts.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cWhile the statistics are impressive, we wouldn\u2019t deceive ourselves that we have succeeded in cleaning the Augean Stable in five months. We have only made a head start. We need to sustain the momentum. We need to win the drug war. We cannot afford to be complacent.\u201d\n\nMarwa said going by the available statistics, Nigeria ranked the highest users of cannabis worldwide, adding that revelations from kidnapped victims have collaborated the facts that illicit substances were enablers of insecurity currently plaguing the country.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is not difficult to conclude that drugs have been catalysts of terrorism, kidnapping, banditry, armed robbery and various violent conflicts that are currently Nigeria\u2019s albatross. The enormity of the danger of drug abuse calls for an urgent need to nip the problem in the bud. This is the reason we have redoubled our efforts in the past five months with the Maxim of Offensive Action.\n\n\u201cToday, it is a glaring fact that Nigerian youths are involved in drug abuse. Over the years, an undesirable subculture had flourished whereby adolescents and young adults wantonly indulged in the abuse of illicit substances. They not only became addicted to conventional substances such as cannabis and prescription opioids, such as tramadol and codeine, they also experimented with dangerous mixtures leading to novel psychotropic substances such as \u2018monkey tail\u2019 and \u2018skoochies\u2019.\n\n\u201cIn the context of that warped reality, they also normalised the smoking of cannabis as we have seen in some popular music videos and on social media. \u2018High\u2019 became part of their social media. So, it wasn\u2019t surprising, when research began to give us bleak statistics. The National Drug Survey 2019, for example, indicated that cannabis is the most commonly abused substance by an estimated 10.6 million Nigerians, some of whom started smoking as early as 19 years of age.\n\n\u201cThe Global Drug Survey 2019, also, cited cannabis as the most abused substance with West Africa having the highest abuse prevalence. The World Health Organisation on substance abuse also stated unequivocally that cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance in Africa, with the highest prevalence, between 5.2% and 13.5%, found in West Africa. Ladies and Gentlemen, West Africa, by implication, means Nigeria\u201d.\n\nThe NDLEA boss linked the successes recorded by the agency so far to the resolution of officers and men of the NDLEA to clean up Nigeria and make the country drug free.\n\nHe said: \u201cAnd in this campaign, we are tackling the scourge of drug abuse and trafficking on all fronts. In addition to the arrest and prosecution of drug offenders, we have worked out intensive drug abuse awareness and sensitisation programmes targeting different groups, with an emphasis on youths. In this regard, my administration has thrown the door open to all for partnership in the fight against abuse of illicit substances. It is to this end that we have set up a Special Purpose Committee to involve stakeholders in the cause.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Femi Gbajabiamila, called on the President to approve the appointment of 10,000 additional workers for NDLEA, which he said was currently \u201cunderstaffed\u201d, \u201cunderfunded\u201d, and \u201cill-equipped\u201d.\n\nGbajabiamila, who was represented by Chairman, House Committee on Drugs and Narcotics, Hon Francis Agwu, said the NDLEA was using weapons used during the civil war, stressing the need to fight the menace of drugs abuse in the country as all crimes were enabled by narcotics drugs addiction.\n\nAccording to him, the National Assembly was working to amend the Police Trust Fund Act to ensure that other policing agencies like NDLEA benefitted from the pool, adding that efforts would be made to guarantee accelerated endorsement of the president after its amendment.\n\n\u201cIf the surge in crimes must be minimised, then, we must fight narcotics drugs addiction,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a goodwill message, the United Nations General Secretary, Antonio Guterres, lamented that the world drug problem remains an urgent challenge that threatens to exacerbate damage impact and hinder a healthy recovery.\n\nRepresented by Oliver Stolpe, the Country Representative, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the UN Scribe urged law enforcement agents to go after the criminals at the upper level of the drug trafficking chain, who reap the highest profit and wreak the greatest havoc.\n\nGuterres said, the 2021 world drug report of UN, showed that death and crime attributed to disorders have nearly doubled over the past decade, adding that while new HIV/AIDS infections among adults have declined worldwide but not among people, who injected drugs, which accounted for 10 per cent of new infections in 2019.\n\nHe, however, claimed that international cooperation had helped to limit the proliferation of new psycho active substances but the problem was shifting to poorer regions, where control systems were weaker, drug sales continued to rise and non-medical use of pharmaceutical such as Tramadol and Codeine was expanding.\n\nHe too agreed that drug trafficking and organised crime fuel and perpetuate circles of violence and conflicts, adding that armed groups and terrorists profited from the illicit drugs trade, even as the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic has left millions of people more vulnerable to drug crime and illicit drug cultivation.\n\nIn a related development, the Niger State Commander of the NDLEA, Mr. Haruna Kwatiche, has said bandits, kidnappers and terrorists operated after consuming hard drugs, which usually gave them fake confidence and strength.\n\nKwatiche, who disclosed this in Minna, Saturday, said these categories of people often claimed they did not know how and why they embarked on such acts after being arrested and when the effect of the drugs had worn out.\n\nSpeaking at an event to mark this years United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and illicit Trafficking, Kwatiche said the country should rise up to stop the circulation of hard drugs by bringing all peddlers under the law if the activities of bandits kidnapers and terrorists were to be reduced to the barest minimum in the country.\n\nHe admitted that 90 per cent of other crimes and criminalities were committed under the influence of drugs and warned that, \u201cUntil all stakeholders join hands together to fight this menace, crimes and criminalities will continue to increase\n\n\u201cThe NDLEA is committed to confronting circulation and consumption of hard drugs frontally\u201d the Niger commander declared, adding that to achieve this the Agency required the support of all the major stakeholders in the states of the federation.\n\nThe Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Ahmed Ibrahim Matane, commended the NDLEA for its renewed war against drug abuse and illicit trafficking in the state and assured the agency of government\u2019s support in order to reduce the menace of drug abuse in the state.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Emmanuel Addeh in Abuja\n\nIn monetary terms, changes in marginal fields\u2019 ownership in the oil and gas industry were worth about $584 million in 2019, the latest report on the sector by the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) has indicated. The report showed that the changes were mainly due to internal reorganisation by asset owners, inability to pay outstanding debts owed to government, and non-development of oil assets, leading to revocation of licences.\n\nIn all, eight of the deals yielded the $584 million, the sum generated by three of the changes were not available in the report, while four changes were due to revocation of operating licences of the original owners by the federal government.\n\nThe licences cancelled were those belonging to Allied Energy Resources, Cavendish Petroleum, Express Petroleum and Gas, Pan Ocean Corporation Asset, and Summit Oil International Limited, which operated OML 120, 110, 108, 98, and OPL 206, respectively.\n\nWhile 7 Energy transferred 62.5 per cent shares of 51 per cent equity in Stub Creek Universal Energy Resources in a transaction worth $3.682 million, it also moved 100 per cent ownership of its shares in Uquo marginal field to Savannah Petroleum Plc in a $10.586 million deal.\n\nIn the same vein, FHN transferred its 100 per cent interest to Cape Energy Limited, Vertex Energy, and Earl Act Global in a $1.99 million deal while PanOcean allocated OML 98 to the NNPC JV worth $99.836 million in a deal that was expected to be fully paid for by January 2021.\n\nForty per cent equity of Ubima field, according to the document, was assigned to Wester Ord Oil and Gas Limited for $700,000, while there was a reassignment of 38.67 per cent interest from OML 141 to Emerald Energy, Amni, and Blue Water Group.\n\nEroton E&P also assigned 16.2 per cent and 1.8 per cent of Sahara field and Bolton in a deal worth $6.901 million.\n\nBesides, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) acquired OML 11, formerly operated by Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), in a contract totalling $456.03 million. Full payment is due in Q4 2021.\n\nSimilarly, New Age Exploration Nigeria Limited acquired OML 113, while Vitol transferred 12.83 participating interest in the field in a $4 million sale.\n\nDuring the year under review, seismic data acquisition was up by 348 per cent, field development plans 65 per cent, well activities 45 per cent, while gas development plan was down by 75 per cent, with six approved for 2019, as opposed to 24 in 2018.\n\nIn terms of deferred production due to shutdowns, scheduled repairs and maintenance, pipeline breaks/leaks, and general force majeure, SPDC was the biggest casualty, with deferred production of 30.9 million barrels, comprising 56.10 per cent of the entire quantity during the year.\n\nSeplat was next with 7 million barrels, followed by SNEPCo, with 3.8 million barrels.\n\nIn addition, NPDC and Neconde suffered losses and subsequent deferment of 3.7 million barrels, Newcross\u2019 was 3.2 million barrels, Aiteo deferred 2.84 million barrels, Energia\u2019s share of deferment was 1.7 million barrels, while APDNL\u2019s loss was 733,000 barrels during the year.\n\nAll deferred production amounted to 55.2 million barrels while there were 1,387 pipeline breaks, with Mosimi recording the highest with 637 breaks, followed by Port Harcourt, 536, and Warri with 96 breaks.\n\nAccording to the report, in 2019, 43 companies emerged buyers of Nigeria\u2019s federation export crude oil, compared to 41 in 2018, with 20 of the entities accounting for 73 per cent of total sales while the rest 23 accounted for 27 per cent.\n\nIn 2019, companies operating in the Nigeria oil and gas space expended $896 million on social expenditure, including a mandatory sum of $815.59 that is paid to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) and the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), while the non-mandatory expenditure stood at $81.2 million. Of that amount, NDDC got $721.275 million from its three per cent statutory allocation, while NCDMB received $94.3 million.\n\nOf the 34 companies, three entities, including Agip, Total Upstream, and Sterling Global Resources, topped the list of the non-mandatory social expenditure companies, with $12 million, $11 million, and $10.2 million, respectively.\n\nNon-mandatory social expenditure is voluntary payment for or to the host communities and other commitments across the country. They include provision of social amenities, like roads, boreholes, health centres, etc.\n\nNEITI further observed that the requirement for all companies, including government-owned enterprises, in Nigeria to submit Audited Financial Statement (AFS) to the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and Auditor General of the Federation in six months after the preceding year was not strictly adhered to by all covered entities.\n\n\u201cThis has the potential of creating an assurance uniformity gap for the data used in the exercise,\u201d NEITI stated.\n\nHowever, the Dr Ogbonnaya Orji-led agency said despite that limitation, the additional steps taken by the independent administrator using other elements of the accounts covered the gap caused by the development.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Opeyemi Adeyemi works with one of the big finance companies in Nigeria. He had a pay cut due to the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cTo keep your job during this period, a pay cut is a relief, as thousands were fired,\u201d says Adeyemi, a 42-year-old finance expert who lives in Obalende, Lagos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was overwhelmed with the prices of foodstuffs. I often discussed with my wife, who was nursing our second child, ensuring we find a substitute for afternoon meals by taking garri or noodles instead of a three-square meal in a day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cost was high on me and my household. My salary was slashed by 30% to sustain my job, then, rising inflation took a toll on me. I lost most of my savings to cater for the family.\n\n\u201cThe cost of electricity also skyrocketed during this period and I had to work from home. Despite paying a higher electricity bill, most times I still have to get fuel to power my generator, due to the erratic power supply in my area during this period,\u201d a visibly angry Adeyemi let out his frustrations.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdeyemi\u2019s story is that of millions of Nigerians who lost considerable regular income due to the loss of a job or drastic cuts in salaries and wages, especially during the COVID-19 lockdown period.\n\nThe ordeal of his lower income chasing higher food costs corresponds with many people\u2019s responses during Dataphyte\u2019s market survey.\n\nThe research team had set out to investigate how the coronavirus pandemic impacted food prices in Nigeria, the country reputed to be Africa\u2019s biggest economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCOVID-19: The Nigerian Experience\n\nNigeria recorded its first case of the virus on February 27, 2020, in Lagos. Afterward, the virus spread across the country and led to many deaths. In all, Nigeria has recorded 166,560 cases of infections losing 2,099 of them to death as at June 2, 2021.\n\nTo curtail the spread of the virus, measures recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) were adopted. However, the continuous spread led to an ultimate shutdown of the global economy in April 2020.\n\nThe lockdown affected all economic activities in Nigeria, and indeed globally, as many countries devised measures to cope with the debilitating effects of the infections. The effect of the lockdown was felt heavily across key economic sectors in Nigeria as only essential service providers were exempted from the movement restrictions.\n\nThe full outbreak of the coronavirus in 2020 changed the normal working of the Nigerian economy. It affected many lives and livelihoods, with many families and individuals struggling to adjust and cope with its effects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the major activities affected in Nigeria was agriculture, seeing as the lockdown was put in place during the planting season. Though it was relaxed a little to enable farmers to cultivate their crops, they were faced with difficulties in accessing farm inputs and transporting the same across the markets.\n\nThe false resilience of Nigeria\u2019s agricultural sector during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nOfficial data of Nigeria\u2019s gross domestic product between the first quarter of 2020 and March 2021 when Dataphyte conducted a market survey showed that the impact of the contagion was more severe on Nigeria\u2019s industrial sector than the others. The sector had the steepest decline in output and the slowest recovery from the dip in its output.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next hit sector was the services sector. However, the agricultural sector alone remained resilient, recording consistent growth in the money value of its output throughout the turbulent period, or so it appears.\n\nWhile the money value of the output (gross domestic product) from the major sectors of Nigeria\u2019s economy declined at various periods during the pandemic, only the agricultural sector experienced growth throughout the subsequent quarters of 2020 till the first quarter of 2021.\n\nAnalysts at Dataphyte attribute the resilience of the agric sector alone during the pandemic, unlike the other sectors, to either of two things. The first is that the level of agric production increased even during a time of turbulence in public health as the COVID-19 presented, so that more agric products were sold, yielding greater income to those in the agric value chain.\n\nThe other possibility, they posit, is that there was no increase in agric production, and possibly, even a lesser agric production, which created scarcity. The higher income from the agric sector activities then could be attributed to the sales of farm produce at exorbitant prices. The responses of food buyers and sellers interviewed during the Dataphyte survey validated the second proposition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe COVID-19 lockdown restricted the movement and transportation of goods, especially food items, across the country. A ban on inter-state movement and farmers\u2019 inability to cultivate their farmland, amongst other processes, posed a challenge to food security in the country.\n\nThese unusual distortions of farming activities and agricultural business shrunk the supply of various farm produce, with an attendant increase in prices of food items.\n\nDataphyte\u2019s market survey showed that the prices of some food items doubled\n\nAccording to the recently conducted Dataphyte food price survey, Nigerians witnessed an average of 66.8% increase in the prices of food items between last year February, the month the first case of coronavirus was confirmed, and this March, when the survey was conducted.\n\nSource: Dataphyte market survey\n\nDataphyte\u2019s analysis of the prices of foodstuffs across 13 states in the country \u2013 one of the most extensive market surveys in the country \u2013 showed that the food price situation had contracted the purchasing power of citizens. The states sampled are Anambra, Benue, Enugu, Ebonyi, FCT, Kano, Kwara, Lagos, Niger, Ogun, Ondo, Oyo, and Sokoto states.\n\nMap of the 13 states of Dataphyte\u2019s research\n\nThe survey captured most staple food items in every Nigerian home, including rice, beans, egg, garri, plantain, yam, beef, palm oil, fish, pepper, tomatoes, onions, bread and groundnut oil.\n\nDue to the increasing incidents of attacks and high risks of violent deaths in the north-east and several north-west states of the country, Dataphyte\u2019s field researchers were deployed to the relatively safer states.\n\nThus, the responses and results would reflect the food price changes and citizen experience in the researched states more than the entire country. \u201cHowever, future field research that includes the troubled states is currently being considered by the Dataphyte team,\u201d Charles Mba, programme lead at Dataphyte assured.\n\nThe price of beans and garri nearly doubled within the period under review. Beans rose from N1,457 to N2,883 per paint rubber, representing a 98 percent (97.92%) increase. The cost of garri rose from N869 to N1,856 per paint rubber, a 97 percent (97.27%) change. The price increases of these two staple foods were the highest in the last one year period of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nGarri is made from cassava, a tuber plant, which is one of the most important food crops in West Africa. Nigeria produces about 250,000 tonnes of it annually. Nigeria is also regarded as the largest producer of cassava in the world. Garri is either made into \u2018eba\u2019 or soaked to drink as flakes. It is often regarded as the \u2018poor man\u2019s food\u2019 because of its relatively low price and the ease of taking it as a snack without the need of cooking, unlike most of the other food items.\n\nHow much of the increase in food prices can be attributed to COVID-19?\n\nFurther analysis of the responses of food buyers like Opeyemi Adeyemi implied that coronavirus-related activities accounted for about 69% of the increase in food prices in Nigeria within the period covered by the survey.\n\nLike other nations across the globe, Nigeria adopted the ultimate measure to prevent the spread of the virus. By the end of March 2020, the government shut down its entire economy. This halted all production activities, movements, and major economic activities.\n\nThe shutdown affected farming activities, manufacturing, and all productive activities. Border closure further complicated issues as no supplements were coming into the country, creating a high demand for the few available items.\n\nInsecurity and border closure played significant parts in the hike in food prices\n\nDataphyte\u2019s food price survey asked respondents in the 13 states what other factors they thought really contributed to the price increase. The goal was to understand what other socioeconomic factors Nigerians believed were causing food price hike during the period.\n\nBased on the responses from 2,351 respondents who were surveyed, analysis showed that 1,610 respondents (69%) strongly believed that the scarcity of food items and high demand for the available food products during the lockdown period led to the price surge.\n\nHowever, sustained violence and a general state of insecurity in the country, especially in the north-east, could have contributed to the scarcity of farm products and processed food items.\n\nOther factors responsible for the food price surges include border closure, contributing 4%. General insecurity, terrorism, killings, kidnapping, farmer-herder clashes also directly contributed about 3% of the cause, according to the people interviewed.\n\nThe impact of high food costs on households run mainly by women\n\nMorufat Oluyemi, a hairdresser in Arepo, Ogun state, south-western Nigeria, said she now engages in two jobs every day to be able to raise extra cash to cater for her four children after the demise of her husband.\n\n\u201cI have to shuffle between two jobs now. I own a hairdressing shop but the income can no longer sustain my family. I have to go for extra cleaning work as a cleaner to take care of the family,\u201d Oluyemi said.\n\n\u201cGarri was once our saving grace but since the hike, it has been getting worse for my family. I just hope this stress ends soon. I no longer have time for children because of work-related activities.\u201d\n\nIn the same Ogun state, a secondary school teacher, popularly known as Mrs Ajayi, who earns N50,000 (about $100) monthly said she is the family\u2019s breadwinner.\n\n\u201cMy husband works as a gateman in another school, and his salary is not forthcoming. During COVID-19, schools were shut, and owners did not bother to pay the staff remuneration,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPresently, we manage what we have and cut expenses on foodstuffs because we have to pay for other house expenses and school fees of our children.\n\n\u201cIt is terrible and the worst for us. I don\u2019t even know how we have been coping and surviving under these current conditions.\u201d\n\nPrice changes for each food item across sampled states\n\nThe survey results show that Benue, the state regarded as the \u201cfood basket of the nation\u201d because of its large farming population and agricultural output, recorded the highest rate of food price increases in the country in the last year.\n\nThe state had the highest price increase rate for six out of the fifteen major food items surveyed.\n\nSokoto, on the other hand, had the lowest rate of food price increases.\n\nLagos, the economic hub of the country, and Abuja, the federal capital territory (FCT) also had very low food price inflation.\n\nDataphyte\u2019s survey complementary to the Official NBS\u2019\n\nDataphyte embarked on this recent market survey mainly to spotlight the effect of the COVID-19 on food prices. This involved interviews of buyers and sellers and a geolocation of the markets being reviewed.\n\nThe complementary survey sought to ascertain the level of food price fluctuations within the COVID-19 period and to establish whether the pandemic was significantly responsible for the price changes or not.\n\nDataphyte\u2019s research team established, from over two thousand responses of buyers and sellers, that the COVID-19 shocks were significantly responsible for the rise in the general price levels of food items within the period.\n\nThe team\u2019s analysis of other measures of economic performance and balance of trade figures within the period corroborates the people\u2019s submissions.\n\nWhat government did to cushion the high prices of staple foods\n\nGovernments at the federal and state levels made efforts, during the lockdown period, to provide food handouts to Nigerians, especially the poorest of the poor. Despite governments\u2019 food distribution to tens of millions of the poor, the process was disorganised and marred by corruption. This later led to the looting of the food warehouses by citizens during the #EndSARS protests across the country.\n\nSome believe that the government\u2019s mass purchase of the staple food items at the scale it did led to the first artificial scarcity of the staple foods such as rice, beans, garri, spaghetti and vegetable oil. This is coupled with the difficulty in accessing markets to buy food, given the lockdown restrictions.\n\nNevertheless, the Nigerian government has not provided any intervention to curb or moderate the unending increase in food prices across the country.\n\nWhat experts think government should do\n\nTo alleviate the effect of soaring food prices on the people, \u201cIt would be a contradiction for the government to buy food from farmers and resell to everyone especially if the same government is promoting a market-driven economy, Temitope Laniran, an economist from the University, UK commented.\n\nDr Laniran observed that \u201coverall, the factors that make food price hike persist are structural challenges of the government. The foreign exchange rate is at a record high. This is compounded with the difficulty in accessing foreign exchange by businesses. Other social and economic infrastructure including security, ease of doing business, access to credit, robust value chain for agri-businesses are missing in the whole intervention equation\u201d.\n\nHe suggested, instead, that \u201cthe government needs to first identify the factors responsible for the price increase. Then policy measures can then be instituted to curb the problems\u201d.\n\nWhen reached for comments on needed government interventions on the present exorbitant costs of food prices, Atiku Samuel, an economist and policy analyst, acknowledged that the government needs first to \u201copen the border, (and) drop all restrictions and tariffs on food products\u201d.\n\nHe further said \u201cinsecurity is a major driver which needs a comprehensive and inclusive approach by the government and other industry stakeholders. Government seems to stand aloof when making its policies, government officials seem to believe they have everything figured out scanning from the offices with less robust and inclusive deliberations happening\u201d.\n\nOn his part, Tope Fasua, economist and a former presidential candidate, identified three ways on how the government can abate the hike in food prices despite disruptions of economic activities from last year\u2019s COVID-19 lockdown. \u201cOne of the ways is for the government to develop commodity exchanges and ensure there are silos (ways of preserving what farmers produce) to prevent farmers from incurring huge losses.\u201d\n\nHe said this would create a good structure to abate high prices and scarcity during the off-season period.\n\n\u201cAnother challenge is insecurity, and the government needs to find ways to solve the menace and ensure farmers feel secure while farming,\u201d Fasua added.\n\n\u201cThe last one should likely be the price-setting mechanism. The government needs to use moral suasion by engaging associations, farmers groups and others to see how to set the price of a \u2018mudu\u2019 of beans or paint of garri in a way that would not exploit the public.\u201d\n\nReporting by Aderemi Ojekunle, Ode Uduu, Charles Mbah and Joshua Olufemi.

          "title": "Nigerian businesses face an avalanche of losses as the Twitter ban continues",
          "text": "On Saturday the 5th of June, Wunmi*, a digital marketer lost a gig worth \u20a6600,000 ($1,200). The marketing campaign was to start the next day but she got a call from the client telling her they couldn\u2019t proceed anymore due to \u2018orders from above.\u2019 She was dumbfounded.\n\nThat same day, about 39 million Nigerians woke up to realize that they couldn\u2019t access Twitter except via VPNs. Internet Service Providers (ISP) in Nigeria like MTN and Airtel had blocked all access to Twitter.\n\nWhen Peju, owner of Abebi Organics, describes the day the ban was enforced, she recounts how the jokes kept coming until one by one people found that they could not tweet anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s been more than two weeks since and the effects of the ban have been anything but humorous for businesses like hers who built their customer base on Twitter.\n\nThe ban happened a day after the Nigerian government announced an indefinite Twitter suspension. The minister of information had stated that the reason for banning Twitter was because the social media platform has \u201cconsistently made its platform available to those who are threatening Nigeria\u2019s corporate existence.\u201d\n\nWhile still mourning the loss of the first job, Wunmi lost another one for the same reason.\n\n\u201cEverything felt like a waste. What was worse was another \u20a6700,000 ($1,400) deal ended up in the mud. The client paid \u20a6150,000 ($333) at least for the little job I had done,\u201d she said.\n\nThe effect on businesses\n\nFor many Nigerians, this ban has affected how they stay informed, build relationships and get opportunities. Businesses on the other hand have experienced a decline in engagements and sales.\n\nIn the case of Nifries, an online food delivery service that relies on Twitter to reach its audience, its customers aren\u2019t responding as they used to.\n\nFeranmi Ajetomobi, the founder of Nifries, explained that the Twitter ban has affected anon (short for anonymous) sales which drive about 20% of sales at Nifries. Anon sales happen when people surprise strangers or friends by buying goods for them without revealing their identity.\n\nHi @TereSagay_, Anon just opened a tab of N15,000 for you to pick whatever you want from our Menu! \ud83d\ude0d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nKindly visit https://t.co/rmQIkQXPkD and send a DM of what you want \ud83d\udc9b \u2014 Sexy Suya Burgers \ud83c\udf54 (@ni_fries) June 15, 2021\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve realised that when we reach out to a few people and there\u2019s no response, It\u2019s either because they\u2019ve taken a break or the Twitter ban has affected them. How we know it\u2019s the ban is because when these people we reach out to come online, they attribute their absence to the fact that using VPN is confusing,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Habib who runs Smiley Socks, a clothing company that also thrives on the \u2018anon sales\u2019 phenomenon, sales via Twitter have been affected. He\u2019s also noticed that engagements with tweets have reduced.\n\nThis has made him turn to other channels. He\u2019s had to pay more attention to his Instagram page and work on his SEO for his e-commerce website to maximise conversations.\n\nHe\u2019s also started experimenting with TikTok and so far, the results have been astounding. One day after he opened a new TikTok page, it already had 100 followers. The few videos he\u2019s posted already have at least 500 views, with the highest being one with over 4,000 views.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy when you think about the fact that it\u2019s a new page and we are not following anyone. Despite the engagement, there\u2019s a bigger question of how we\u2019ll convert these numbers into sales. For now, we\u2019ll just do more influencer marketing and affiliate marketing as we figure out what works,\u201d said Habib.\n\nWunmi* who has lost two deals worth over $2,500 is now considering focusing on unexplored channels like IG Reels and TikTok.\n\n\u201cFor clients that do not mind me using VPN, I go ahead and use Twitter. Unfortunately, those clients are very few. No one wants to offend President Buhari at this time for fear of being blacklisted by the government or worse, getting forcefully shut down. Clients think of many negative scenarios of how the government can strike back, they sometimes seem hilarious, but can you blame them?\u201d she said.\n\nComparing Twitter to other platforms\n\nCharles Isidi, a growth marketer and digital consultant, agrees with the need to pivot to other digital marketing channels but has a word of caution. He has experienced the effect of the decline first-hand on his personal account. With followership of about 17,000, his monthly impressions have gone from as high as 3.8 million, to under 500,000.\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for April\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for May\n\nCharles\u2019 Twitter Analytics for June\n\nHe says the ban will affect advertising spend and results across other digital marketing channels because Nigerian Twitter users who are using VPNs will also have their locations skewed across every other app.\n\n\u201cIf your most valuable audience is in another country that you do not know, then how can you reach them?\u201d he said.\n\nHe also raised the question of whether people know how to use VPNs safely.\n\n\u201cQuite a lot of people use free VPNs. In the next six months, we might start experiencing a lot of theft. We\u2019ll have to be looking at how much we\u2019ve lost due to cybercrimes.\u201d\n\nBusinesses might need to move to other social media platforms but Twitter offers more favourable returns in terms of marketing efforts.\n\nCompared to other advertising channels, Twitter is a cheaper and less stressful channel.\n\nHe\u2019s been trying to run a billboard campaign for the past 3 months and has been stuck waiting for Lagos\u2019 paid advertising approval. For digital adverts, in less than an hour, the advert is approved and has started delivering value for the business.\n\n\u201cUnlike other social media platforms, take Facebook as an example. A typical page with 10,000 followers reaches 3% of your audience with a post. Meanwhile, on Twitter, an organic post can be retweeted. In terms of shareability and virality, there\u2019s a reason why people love Twitter. I can say something and even if I have just 100 followers, 3 million people can see that tweet.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s difficult on Instagram where you have to make the explore page or use a hashtag that people love to get a similar kind of result.\n\nHow much is being lost\n\nCiting a scenario, he said, \u201cIf you\u2019re currently managing a brand that has 20,000 followers, it\u2019ll get 1-3 million impressions on average. To be conservative, at a 0.1% conversation rate, the brand will have an average of 1,000 \u2013 3,000 new customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we put the average transaction value per customer at $3 dollars per month, that\u2019s an average of $3,000 \u2013 $9,000 dollars lost due to the ban. Let\u2019s put it across all the businesses in that range and you see that the number is massive.\u201d\n\nWith the Twitter ban, Nigerian businesses that have previously relied on the massive reach of the platform now face an avalanche of losses if the decision is not reversed soon.\n\nAnd if we were to be a little hopeful and imagine a world where the ban is lifted, how much irreversible damage has been done to the potential audience reach these businesses used to have? We\u2019ll find out soon enough.\n\n*Name changed to protect their identity.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Google, this week, announced the launch of two new initiatives to support African-founded startups and women-led businesses in underserved communities on the continent.\n\nThe programs include a $3 million Black Founders Fund for African startups and a $3 million Google.org grant to help women in low-income communities develop entrepreneurial skills and access funding.\n\nThrough the latter, Google is looking to support access to economic opportunity for women in sub-Saharan Africa with a $3 million grant to the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). The foundation will then provide entrepreneurship training, mentorship, coaching, and access to networks and key markets for at least 5,000 women via its annual entrepreneurship program.\n\nIn addition, seed capital in the form of one-time cash grants will be given to 500 African female informal business-owners in rural and low-income communities across Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and select francophone countries.\n\n\u201cWe believe this will enable and prepare these women who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to navigate their independent business journey through the critical start-up and early growth phase,\u201d Google said in a statement on its website.\n\nBlack Founders Fund debuts in Africa\n\nThe Google for Startups Black Founders Fund provides grants and technical assistance to early-stage startups led by black and diverse teams, with a goal of advancing the black community.\n\nLaunched in 2020 as part of a series of racial equity commitments to close a funding gap experienced by black entrepreneurs, the program has seen proven success in the United States, Brazil, and Europe, according to Google.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant has now expanded the initiative to Africa, a continent where indigenous startups are faced with insufficient starting capital and a lack of angel investors, and also find it difficult to secure financial support.\n\nAccording to Bosun Tijani, CEO of Co-Creation Hub (CcHub), which is partnering with Google on the Black Founders Fund Africa, the shortage of funding for African startups is driven by several factors.\n\n\u201cOn the demand side, there is an increase in the number of ventures emerging to solve the pervasive challenges that exist. As the number of ventures increases, the requirement for funding increases,\u201d Tijani told TechCabal.\n\nHe adds that while there has been improved investor confidence as a result of the success stories that have come out of the ecosystem, investors remain sceptical about the potential for huge exit opportunities. \u201cThis highlighted risk often dampens the quantum of funding commitment the ecosystem gets.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the number of African venture capital firms closing their funding rounds is not growing as quickly as the number of emerging ventures; institutions with long-term liabilities (such as insurance companies, pension funds, endowments) that match the VC asset class are not willing to support the development of the ecosystem because it\u2019s still nascent; and there are not enough government incentives required to encourage investments into the tech ecosystem.\n\nIn light of these challenges, Google plans to allocate the $3 million non-dilutive fund across a pipeline of 50 investable startups in Africa, with each firm receiving up to $100,000 in equity-free cash awards. Each selected company will also receive $220,000 in Google Cloud Credits and Ad Grants, as well as mentoring, technical, and scaling assistance.\n\nThe company is working with the CcHub, a leading tech community hub with a presence in Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda, to distribute the funding to the 50 selected companies across Africa.\n\nThe CcHUB team will be actively involved in the process providing insight and technical support from the selection process through to the final deployment of the capital, according to Tijani. \u201cWe will monitor and evaluate the performance of the companies that benefit from this catalytic funding,\u201d he said.\n\nWhich startups can apply?\n\nApart from having a black founder, the Black Founders Fund Africa (BFFAfrica) is looking for a startup that is headquartered in Africa or has a legal presence on the continent; building for Africa and a global market; creating jobs, has growth potential to raise more funding, and making an impact; has proven early traction (product in the market / pilots / MVP live / early revenue).\n\nThe founding team should be diverse, with at least one black C-level founding member; directly supporting the black community, and has the relevant expertise on board to be successful (either through their background or an assembled team).\n\nIn addition, Google is looking for technology startups with a live product in the market or businesses where technology is core to their ability to scale (not for consultancies or not-for-profits) as well as compatibility with Google products.\n\nThe inaugural funding for Africa is open to startups in 13 countries \u2013 including Botswana, Cameroon, C\u00f4te D\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.\n\n\u201cWe welcome all startups in these countries that meet the criteria to apply. Female-led startups that meet the criteria are also strongly encouraged to apply,\u201d Tijani said.\n\nApplications for the Fund are currently open until July 7th and eligible startups can visit goo.gle/BFFAfrica now to apply.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Jesse Forrester started an e-mobility company in Kenya after deciding against going to university",
          "text": "My Life In Tech is putting human faces to some of the innovative startups, investments, and policy formations driving the technology sector across Africa.\n\nIf you were to look at three different pictures of Jesse Forrester today, you will notice the same unmistakable red cap.\n\n\u201cIt was given to me by a dear friend and for me, it has just come to represent the people that have supported me and I carry them with me wherever I\u2019m going,\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI also think it\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nJesse Forrester and the Mazi Mobility team. Spot his red cap.\n\nHe pointed out how the hat contributes to his very pan-African life.\n\nJesse grew up in Nairobi, Kenya. After high school, he travelled to South Africa where he finished his A-levels at the African Leadership Academy (ALA).\n\nHis journey at ALA exposed him to several things including a wide network of pan-African thinkers.\n\nHis red cap has often gotten him mistaken as Nigerian, something he does not shy away from. But he never fails to remind people that the cap is actually from Tunisia in North Africa.\n\nAfter ALA, Jesse took up a fellowship. It was his first stab at being employed and he quickly found that it was not something that he fancied.\n\nThe idea of going to university didn\u2019t thrill him either. So he did something he\u2019d always wanted to do \u2013 he started his own business.\n\nToday, his company Mazi Mobility is backed by global venture builder, Satgana, and is aiming at implementing an electric vehicle ecosystem in Africa. To this end, they recently launched a new fleet of electric bodas or motorcycles.\n\nWhen he speaks of Africa and the possibilities that exist in the space of e-mobility, his excitement is almost palpable.\n\nHe started his company without a university degree and he is now preparing himself to dominate the African e-mobility space.\n\nHis name is Jesse Forrester and this is his life in tech.\n\nIf you look back, you see it\n\nJesse grew up in Huruma flats in the Eastlands. He lived with both his parents but more time was spent with his mother.\n\nAs a child, he wanted to be a pilot but his interests varied. On some days he wanted to just sit by the television and watch a NatGeo documentary on exotic animals in the thick Amazon and on other days his PlayStation 2 was all the entertainment he needed.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t an exact time when he decided he didn\u2019t want to be a pilot anymore. It was just one of those things that\u2019s there one day but slowly faded away with time \u2013 like a puddle drying in the sun.\n\nHis varying interests expanded to include his small businesses in school \u2013 selling lemonade and sweets. He also enjoyed tinkering with things \u2013 pulling them apart and putting them together.\n\nMazi Mobility, Jesse\u2019s startup, is making it easier for boda riders to own and use electric vehicles that help save the planet by reducing CO emissions.\n\nTo pinpoint when in his life he got the inspiration to want a cleaner Africa, you would need to consider two things; a minister who did his job and a matatu\u2019s smoke cloud.\n\nIn 2004, a man named John Michuki was the Minister of Transportation in Kenya. During that time, the state of buses, or matatus, in the country was terrible. These vehicles had no speed governors, seat belts and would often carry more passengers than they were supposed to.\n\nMichuki established the \u2018Michuki Rules\u2019 which served as a game-changer for the transport sector by providing strict guidelines for matatus at the time. But one thing they inadvertently did was inspire a prepubescent Jesse.\n\n\u201cI actually saw a meaningful change that had a huge impact. And according to my mum, I said I wanted to become something in transport like transport minister.\u201d\n\nFast forward to 2018 and Jesse was back from studying in South Africa and living in Nairobi again.\n\n\u201cI was walking around the city, just going on my errands, this massive matatu cuts me off and just as it\u2019s leaving and I have a mouth full of swear words, the thing just blows a huge amount of smoke in my face.\u201d\n\nSet 14 years apart, these two events paved the way for the creation of Mazi Mobility but also helped inform the decisions of a young man who really cares about his environment.\n\n\u201cJesse, meet Tech\u201d\n\n\u201cMy foray into tech really happened in secondary school, where I learned a lot about what actually makes up a game and how to actually make it,\u201d Jesse told me over our WhatsApp call.\n\nHis introduction to tech came in the form of MIT\u2019s Scratch Blocks. The program allowed people to develop programming skills by using blocks to code visually.\n\nHe didn\u2019t just explore software, his tinkering came in handy when he got a chance to work with Arduino motherboards which allow people to create complex computer systems from scratch.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be a good engineer, that was kind of my path because it would mix hardware and software.\u201d\n\nJesse\u2019s tango with tech did not end in high school. It followed him right into ALA.\n\nIn 2017, when bitcoin was still worth only $2,000, blockchain was primarily known as the technology behind bitcoin and not much else. For Jesse, it became an interesting tool.\n\n\u201cI was part of a blockchain club. I was running for treasurer [in student government], and the decision was to have the elections on the blockchain.\u201d\n\nHe would go on to win the elections and also create a project that would win his school $100,000.\n\nThe journey to Mazi by way of ALA\n\n\u2018Mazi\u2019 was not always \u2018Mazi Mobility\u2019. At one point, in the time before Jesse got into ALA, it was a photography collective \u2013 one of Jesse\u2019s many interests.\n\nBut getting into the Africa Leadership Academy was not the smoothest ride for him.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing you must know, it is that Jesse Forrester sets high expectations for himself. He first heard of the Academy when he turned 12 and he knew he wanted to attend but the minimum age was 15 so he decided to wait.\n\nAt 15, he was in the middle of his high school education and decided not to apply until he was done. In his final year of high school, he finally applied.\n\n\u201cThey waitlisted me. So I had a chip on my shoulder where I had to prove that I\u2019ve got the leadership potential to get into the school.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was the creation of Mazi \u2013 a photography collective with a focus on creating discourse around the environment, speaking at a TEDx talk, and getting networking certifications.\n\nAnd what did he do with all these things? He sent ALA an update. They needed to know that he was meant to be there.\n\nThis time they listened. He was accepted and resumed in South Africa for his 2-year course.\n\nAt ALA, Jesse was a part of the team behind \u201cThe Living Machine\u201d a water treatment system that won them the $100,000 Zayed Sustainability Prize in 2019.\n\nAfter his encounter with the smoky matatu in 2018, Jesse decided he wanted to start a company that provided electric matatus.\n\n\u201cI wanted to start with putting solar panels on matatus but I quickly realised that was not smart because you need like 60 of them for one matatu.\u201d\n\nWith a few calls, he was able to connect with his co-founder and founding investor Troy Barrie.\n\nWhile they discussed kicking off the business, Jesse had to leave the country briefly to present a report on The Living Machine in Abu Dhabi. During this trip, he also got a chance to interview musician and investor, Akon.\n\nJesse with Akon\n\nWhen he returned and settled down, he quit his job and focused full time on Mazi. They made plans to begin getting investors. This was March 2020.\n\nBuilding Mazi through a pandemic and looking to the future\n\n\u201cSo now we are back to running a hardware business, in Africa, in a pandemic?\u201d Jesse laughed when he said this. It was ridiculous to even think about.\n\nThe potential investors all seemed to say the same things: \u201cSo we\u2019re focusing on our portfolio companies right now. Let\u2019s touch base in about a year.\u201d\n\nAnd who could blame them, 2020 was a weird year.\n\nBut he needed to raise money and to most people, Jesse just seemed crazy. While Jesse dealt with the anxiety and despair that came with 2020, he also had to get enough money to match his founding investor\u2019s investment.\n\nA $15,000 fund from ALA helped turn things around and in February the electric motorcycles landed in Kenya \u2013 sort of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe thing is, when you import something from China, especially these bikes, you have no manuals whatsoever. So we had no way of knowing what to assemble because there was a huge language barrier, so it was incredibly challenging.\u201d Jesse said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy that one of my chief engineers is a really smart guy and a biker.\u201d\n\nFor the next month, the team would spend time figuring out the bikes and how to assemble them. They were working \u201cfrom eight to eight\u201d.\n\nA deadline for a prototype bike was fast approaching and during our call, Jesse reminisced about what it felt like at the time.\n\nThey were just four men in his living room, trying to put an electronic boda together. It was a Saturday when they decided they were going to have to work all night to figure it out. That night, they had ugali and eggs for dinner.\n\nBy 6 am on Sunday, with none of them having slept a wink, they had built their first product, by themselves, in Jesse\u2019s living room.\n\n\u201cAnd right now I\u2019m really proud to say that all the bikes we have are fully assembled here in Kenya, by Kenyans. And we have the capacity to assemble \u2013 with a really small team \u2013 over 200 bikes, a month from parts all the way up. Without investment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always tell investors, \u2018You guys give us X cash, you can imagine what we can do.\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nI asked Jesse Forrester, as I always do with these interviews, to tell me what plans he has for the future.\n\n\u201cThe total estimated addressable market right now stands at about $12 billion in East Africa, for electric motorbikes alone, and I say hey we want to capture a fraction of the market so I want to do over 1000 bodas by the end of next year. I want to get to over 5000 bodas by the end of 2023 with up to 200 tuktuks and 100 matatus.\u201d\n\nFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ears, Jesse.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "After months of uncertainty regarding regulations, Chaka has received a license from Nigeria\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to operate its digital platform for buying and selling stocks.\n\nChaka becomes the first to acquire the digital sub-broker license introduced by SEC in April of this year. As part of a major amendment to its Consolidated Rules and Regulations, SEC recognised sub-brokers who use digital platforms to serve multiple brokers.\n\nTosin Osibodu, the startup\u2019s CEO, said on a call on Wednesday that the acquisition took \u201ca tremendous amount of effort\u201d and is the fruit of frequent engagement with the capital markets regulator.\n\nOn the 19th of December 2020, the SEC published a statement that effectively barred Chaka from offering its services in Nigeria. SEC\u2019s complaint was that Chaka operated \u201coutside the regulatory purview of the Commission and without requisite registration, as stipulated by the Investment and Securities Act 2007.\u201d\n\nSEC ordered Chaka to stop advertising to users, justifying it as a need to prevent \u201cunscrupulous actors\u201d from harming the investing public. Though the order was particular to Chaka, it was the first major signal that regulation was coming to the investment-tech sector.\n\nThat December warning enabled Chaka to take the lead and open talks with the SEC. With the license now acquired, Osibodu says it affirms Chaka\u2019s commitment to full regulatory compliance and provides clarity to the market.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built a great relationship [with SEC] that we think will be beneficial for the whole ecosystem moving forward,\u201d Osibodu said.\n\nHe said the license also means Chaka could now enable other stockbroking firms who want to have a digital presence. \u201cWe want this benefit to accrue to as many stockbrokers as possible.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Chaka\u2019s operations were based on a partnership with Citi Investment Capital Ltd, a Lagos-based broker licensed by the SEC. An official license now places the startup directly under SEC\u2019s supervision.\n\nChaka\u2019s app hosts over 4,000 stocks from publicly traded companies in Nigeria and the US. Founded in January 2019 by Osibodu with Olaolu Ajose as the chief technology officer, the startup bills itself as an \u201cinvestment passport\u201d which powers borderless investing for users.\n\nAnyone with an internet-enabled smartphone can download the app, sign up and begin investing with $2 or \u20a61,000. Chaka is only available in Nigeria at the moment.\n\nOsibodu did not specify what Chaka did, in terms of fees or filings, to receive the license.\n\nBut according to the SEC\u2019s recent amendment (pdf, page 3), a sub-broker license for digital platforms involves a minimum capital of \u20a610 million and a Fidelity Bond covering at least 20% of the minimum capital.\n\nOther requirements include four separate fees totalling \u20a6500,000, a number of SEC forms, company documents and other documentation about people involved with the company.\n\nDigital sub-brokers are also required to fully describe the technology that their infrastructure is built on, including details about security, backup and recovery processes.\n\nThey should have adequate Know Your Customer processes and have documented policies for managing technology risks. Also, they are expected to show how they assess the capacity of potential customers to use its platform for transactions, plus clear explanations of the features, risks, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities that come with using the app.\n\nIt is not clear if this license officially permits Chaka (and other fintechs in the sector) to offer stocks listed in foreign markets \u2013 like Tesla and Google \u2013 to Nigerians. In April, SEC sounded a warning that seemed to declare such offerings as being illegal.\n\nOsibodu\u2019s coy response was that Chaka is committed to SEC\u2019s objectives for financial inclusion in Nigeria by, among other things, increasing retail investor participation in the financial markets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it to a whatsapp group or telegram channel.\n\n.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email [email protected].",

Source: Menabytes\n\nEgypt\u2019s Minly has raised $3.6 million in seed funding to connect fans and celebrities with authentic and personalised experiences. The round, which the startup says was \u2018oversubscribed\u2019, was co-led by 4DX Ventures, B&Y Venture Partners, and Global Ventures.\n\nIt also included participation from unnamed regional funds and angel investors like Scooter Braun, Founder of SB Projects, and Jason Finger, Co-founder of Seamless Web and GrubHub.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCameo lookalike: Like Cameo, Minly allows users to connect with celebrities such as athletes, musicians, and actors. They can request a video, voice, or business shoutout for a specific fee set by the celebrity as advised by the startup\u2019s team. A percentage of this fee goes to the Magdi Yacoub Global Heart Foundation.\n\nNot the only one: Minly is not the only startup in the Middle East and North African (MENA) region looking to capitalise on the creator industry. Others include Starzly, Halahi, and Starprise, all in the celebrity shout marketplace in the MENA region.\n\nWhat\u2019s the big idea? If you are like me and wondering why this is a thing, these numbers will interest you. Since launching last year, Minly has more than 50,000 users. Add to that the fact that the creator economy market has surpassed $100 billion in value this year, and the picture becomes clearer.\n\nYou might also remember the viral Twitter video made via Cameo by Originals star Joseph Morgan.\n\nEgyptian startups on fire: Recently, the North African country has enjoyed an avalanche of funding. In the last three months, we\u2019ve seen Fatura, Homzmart, MoneyHash, Mozare3, Bosta, Telda, and Koinz making big money moves.\n\nAccording to fDi\u2019s African Tech Ecosystem of the Future 2021/2022 ranking, Egypt places 3rd overall but has the best Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) strategy. Certainly, the country\u2019s space is one to watch.\n\nGoogle will start warning you when search results are unreliable\n\nPhoto on Photostockeditor\n\nIn a blog post, Danny Sullivan, Public Liaison for Search at Google, revealed the company\u2019s newest feature for search results. A warning notice will now appear, indicating that sources for a particular news topic might be unreliable.\n\nEssentially, where information is constantly changing, and a range of sources haven\u2019t weighed in, the notice will appear, telling users to check back later when there might be a more balanced number of sources.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe feature was first noticed by Stanford Internet Observatory researcher, Renee DiResta, who described it as a \u201cpositive step.\u201d\n\nFor now, it will only be available in English and to users in the US. Shocker!\n\nWhile the company has not specified the exact range of sources it would consider, it said, \u201cwe\u2019ve trained our systems to detect when a topic is rapidly evolving, and a range of sources hasn\u2019t yet weighed in.\u201d\n\nTaking a closer look, Google has long been criticised for allowing unreliable sources and conspiracy theories on rapidly evolving news to float to the top of search results \u2014 a challenge Twitter and Facebook are familiar with.\n\nRecently, Google has attempted to improve its search function by adding an About this Results panel, a feature to protect people from harassment, an update on product reviews and several others.\n\nWhile all of this is laudable, especially in the fight against misinformation, it also raises issues of censorship of alternative media outlets.\n\nI wonder if this might be an antitrust lawsuit in the making.\n\nCelebrating World MSME Day\n\nIn Nigeria, the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises sector has contributed up to 50% of the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the last five years, providing up to 80% of jobs.\n\nOn a global scale, the United Nations (UN) also records that MSMEs account for 90% of businesses across the globe and provide 60-70% of employment.\n\nImpressive statistics surely, but as with every sector, it was dealt severe blows by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn celebration of World MSME Day, Techpoint Africa had a chat with some of these heroic owners concerning technology\u2019s impact on their businesses and how to determine a way forward.\n\nDon\u2019t sleep on Emmanuel\u2019s story.

          "title": "Policies, technology and Nigerian MSMEs\u2019 battle for survival in a pandemic",
          "text": "It would be pretty difficult to miss small stores on the streets of Nigeria, selling anything from cookware to clothing or electronics. In some buildings, you would find shops stacked to the roof with wares. The arrival of the pandemic seems to have changed the perspective of some small business owners.\n\nThe Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment put the number of Nigerian MSMEs at 37 million and data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and The Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) shows that they account for 96% of businesses in Nigeria.\n\nThis sector has contributed up to 50% of the country\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the last five years and provides up to 80% of jobs in the country.\n\nThese numbers are not exclusive to Nigeria as the United Nations(UN) also records that MSMEs account for 90% of businesses across the globe, and provide 60-70% of employment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite its importance, significant problems have been plaguing MSMEs in Nigeria. Though the country\u2019s government has been trying to implement relief policies and business incentives, few businesses can benefit, as most MSMEs are in the informal sector.\n\nFor context, these are businesses that are not registered or protected by government regulations. As these academic researchers found out, the actual size of Nigeria\u2019s informal economy is challenging to verify.\n\nThe NBS says the informal sector accounts for 99.8% of MSMEs, and only 10% were registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) \u2014 primarily as business names.\n\nPer academic researchers Roberto Dell\u2019Anno and Omobola Adu, Nigeria\u2019s employment uncertainties and rapid urban migration are responsible for the rise of informal businesses.\n\n(Un)foreseen side effects\n\nWhile the number of unregistered MSMEs might not seem like a big issue at first glance, a closer look reveals that such businesses could be missing significant fiscal benefits and escaping taxation.\n\nNigeria\u2019s Finance Act, for example, exempts businesses with an annual turnover of less than \u20a625 million ($61k) from paying income tax. On the other hand, a deep government mistrust seems to keep micro-businesses from formal registrations and paying taxes.\n\nHowever, the arrival of the pandemic created a lot more problems for MSMEs across the globe, and Nigerian business owners faced problems born from systemic and infrastructural challenges.\n\nPeter*, a small business owner running a logistics and haulage service in Lagos, Nigeria, explains that he started this business as a side hustle during his National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGetting a job after service was not certain, so I had to focus on developing my business to make ends meet. Even after I got a job, I have kept running my business,\u201d Peter explains.\n\nPeter, who ardently follows business developments in the media, says none of the publicised government incentives has ever interested him. For him, the goal was to \u201chammer\u201d (hit it big with his business) while staying away from prying government eyes.\n\nHowever, the arrival of the pandemic and the lockdown that ensued changed Peter\u2019s perspective.\n\n\u201cI began to question my entire business model, and I kept wishing I could access the loans from the Central Bank I kept seeing on TV,\u201d he muses.\n\nRecall that the Central Bank of Nigeria earmarked a \u20a650 billion COVID-19 relief fund which it reportedly disbursed to qualified SMEs after some strange delays.\n\nWith government incentives treated with deep scepticism, some Nigerian businesses had to find ways to survive.\n\nThe struggle for survival\n\nIn an interview with Techpoint Africa, Ope Adeoye, CEO of Nigerian fintech, OnePipe, argued that a typical trader that leaves his home with \u20a6100 in his pocket would make all he needs for that day and eat it up on that same day.\n\nNigeria is touted by the World Bank as one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, with 40% (83 million people) living below the poverty line. The informal economy has been a major means for livelihood, but lockdown enforcement in the country\u2019s major cities in 2020 puts these livelihoods at risk.\n\nWorld Poverty clock shows Nigeria at the top of the global poverty chart in 2020\n\nThe outcome was pretty different for most people. Luckily enough, it was business as usual for some who sold essential goods and services like food and groceries. But it was not the same for others.\n\n\u201cFor weeks, we were indoors, wondering how long the food we had stocked would last before the lockdown was lifted,\u201d Efosa, a small-scale Lagos-based fashion designer, recounts. \u201cNaturally, clothes fell in the scale of preference for most people.\u201d\n\nDuring the partial lockdown, Efosa says his son helped him sell off his old printers on the classifieds marketplace, Jiji. He then realised that business was still going on, just not in traditional markets.\n\n\u201cI began to consume a lot of YouTube for ideas on how to improve my skills. I no longer had to get ideas for fashion styles I saw in the market. A lot of them were already online.\u201d\n\nBeing averse to going to government offices, Efosa eventually discovered that he could register his business online, an essential prerequisite for loans he was trying to access.\n\nCynthia, an artisan soap-maker based in Delta State, Nigeria, reveals that nothing much changed for her business during the lockdown. If anything, orders only increased.\n\n\u201cStill, I discovered I could be doing more with my business if I improved my online presence. I wanted it to be more than my WhatsApp status, you know,\u201d she says.\n\nPerhaps, the most drastic change we observed in our various interviews was Peter\u2019s logistics and haulage service.\n\n\u201cWhen I started, all I had was a business card, and people could only reach me via calls. After my reflection, I employed someone to help me create a website where people can just use the tools and filters there to place an order and get quotations,\u201d he explains.\n\nPeter\u2019s scope expanded to running ad campaigns on Google and Facebook and getting a feel of other established businesses running his line of work. As a first step, Peter registered his business name and built a team for his business.\n\n\u201cIt feels like I\u2019m starting a different kind of business all over again, but I\u2019m excited at this new journey.\u201d\n\nAs for government incentives, neither Efosa, Cynthia, or Peter expressed much interest, but they unanimously agreed that several small businesses need as much government support as possible.\n\nCharting a way forward\n\nPhoto by Riccardo Annandale on Unsplash\n\nThe UN has designated today as World MSME day with the theme: \u201cMSMEs: Key to an inclusive and sustainable recovery\u201d. The UN posits that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and an economy that is greener and fairer requires resilient and flourishing MSMEs everywhere.\n\nPer the UN, pandemic recovery efforts are being presented as an opportunity to \u201crebuild better\u201d, particularly by prioritizing sustainability, resilience, and inclusiveness.\n\nSo far, the Nigerian government has primarily been in the news with talks of supporting businesses with relief funds, but this might not be the best approach.\n\n\u201cIt has to be beyond money and tax breaks. Issues with power, roads, security, and other harsh business conditions will likely soak up the money in a blink of an eye,\u201d says Efosa.\n\nHe also claims several people are still without access to information on how they can digitise their services, which could be a severe bottleneck to MSME-driven economic recovery.\n\nTo celebrate this day, we can all take a moment to appreciate the importance of these businesses and how difficult the pandemic has been for them.\n\n*The actual names of these business owners have been withheld upon request. You can reach out to us should you wish to contact any one of them.",

          "title": "How technology is helping this AC technician scale his business",
          "text": "Have you ever walked into a room and immediately started sweating bullets? Have you spent time in a room with air-conditioners that blow hot air?\n\nThen you would quite understand why I was happy when last year, after a lot of convincing and back and forth, my mom finally agreed to get two air-conditioners installed in the house. But, unfortunately, it gets incredibly hot in the dry season even though there are huge windows everywhere. So we contacted a former neighbour that sells used ACs, paid three-quarters of the money, and had him deliver them to the house.\n\nAfter the delivery and installation by Udoka, a very cheerful and outspoken \u201cAC installer\u201d, trouble started. The ACs were not cooling. Udoka was called back several times, the gas was filled and refilled, one split AC exchanged for a standing one, a total of four technicians worked on the cooling units, one AC unit almost caught on fire.\n\nSeveral months later, my parents had spent more than \u20a6250,000 ($524.1)* on ACs that never worked. They are still in the house, an immutable reminder of wasted money and time, and perhaps, another reason to be continually disappointed in Nigerian artisans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s why when we were asked to pitch possible stories for an article, the event \u201cWorld Refrigeration Day\u201d caught my attention. I was increasingly interested when I saw that this year\u2019s theme was \u201cCooling Champions: Cool Careers for a Better World.\u201d\n\nI was immediately transported back to the emotions I felt during the AC installation and repair saga. But, rather than focus on my frustrations, I began to ask questions. What would it take to start a career in the refrigeration industry? How much would it cost? What kind of tools and technology make the work easier?\n\nWorld Refrigeration Day\n\nSince 2019, World Refrigeration Day is celebrated every June 26. It is an international awareness campaign established by the World Refrigeration Day Secretariat to raise the profile of the refrigeration, air-conditioning, and heat-pump sector. It focuses on the significant role that the industry and its technology play in modern life and society.\n\nIt was the idea of refrigeration consultant, Stephen Gill, former President of the Institute of Refrigeration in the UK. It quickly caught on in its first year, with more than 800 physical events held in 153 countries around the globe.\n\nAccording to the World Refrigeration Day Secretariat, more than 15 million people are employed worldwide in the refrigeration sector, while the total number of refrigeration, air-conditioning, and heat-pump systems in operation worldwide is around 5 billion.\n\nQuite impressive statistics, but I was curious about how much of it Nigeria\u2019s economy accounts for, especially for the average AC or refrigerator technician.\n\nI spent some time with Emmanuel to try to answer this, and you\u2019ll find details below.\n\nThe learning process\n\nEmmanuel of Ipese Oluwa Technologies\n\nEmmanuel is an AC technician who runs Ipese Oluwa Technologies, a business in the student town of Ile-Ife, Osun State. The young entrepreneur graduated from the prestigious Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, as a physicist in 2014.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust like many OAU alumni before him, he saw a problem and decided to solve it. Before leaving school, he was already working as a cable TV installer. However, customers began to ask if he could repair ACs. Seeing the business opportunity, he decided to learn.\n\nCurrently, Nigeria has 78 approved and accredited Vocational Enterprises Institutions (VEIs), with the latest getting approval in 2019. However, only two teach Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Practice, with a two or three-year study option. Some of these institutions give scholarships in conjunction with partners, but the rest require payment.\n\nInterestingly, Emmanuel didn\u2019t go down this route. Instead, he chose to learn from technicians in Ile-Ife and Benin City, Edo State. In 2014, he undertook the course for one and a half years and paid roughly \u20a6170,000 ($1062.5)** to learn but claims to have understood the basics in two weeks.\n\nApart from the traditional training, Emmanuel uses YouTube and Google as additional learning tools. For him, they are even more helpful than the conventional training.\n\n\u201cI learn so many things. I watch clips with different styles. It is very helpful,\u201d he says.\n\nAfter watching several hours of AC installation and work tools videos on YouTube myself, I am inclined to agree. But, interestingly, Nigerians are yet to join the DIY video trend.\n\nTools of the trade\n\nSource: United National Environment Programme (UNEP)\n\nAn AC technician requires several important tools to get his work done \u2014 wrenches, pipe bending tools, manifold gauge, pliers, a pen and paper, protective equipment, and so on.\n\nFor Emmanuel, though, certain tools that would make his work easier include a vacuum pump, a drill and a Hi-Lift Jack. A vacuum pump is an essential tool used to repair cooling units to clean the compressor by removing unwanted air and water vapour.\n\nA drill is used to puncture the wall for the AC\u2019s pipes and wall brackets. A handheld drill would be a step up from the chisel and hammer Emmanuel currently uses. The videos I watched showed how technicians use it to create very clean-cut holes \u2014 a far cry from the ragged holes crude tools form.\n\nThis is important because, apart from aesthetics, you don\u2019t want air leaking out from spaces in the room.\n\nWhen it comes to quotes, he gives prices based on the type of building where the cooling unit is to be installed. This is because it takes a lot of effort to move the AC up the house using a ladder, a situation that can be avoided by using a lift that guarantees a safe and hassle-free operation.\n\nAll of these cost quite a bit of money. But these are not the only tools Emmanuel employs.\n\nLeveraging the Internet\n\nThe AC technician reveals that he uses websites like Jiji and Facebook for advertising his products and services.\n\nAccording to him, he has received referrals from those ads.\n\nI find this quite interesting because while searching Google for a cooling technician in the Ile-Ife area, his was the only name that immediately came up. Others were located in Osogbo (1 hour 22 minutes away), Ibadan (1 hour 29 minutes away), and Lagos (3 hours 53 minutes away).\n\nI would later to find others, but that involved a search on Instagram, Google, Olist and Facebook.\n\nAir-conditioning units\n\nSource: Supplied\n\nInevitably, our discussion veered into types of ACs, the most popular, and the best ones to use.\n\nIn Nigeria, the climate is tropical, semi-arid in the far north, and progressively rainier as you move southward. In the north, the temperatures become extreme depending on the season. When it\u2019s hot, it\u2019s scorching. When it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s freezing.\n\nThe south has more temperate weather, but the country is quite hot. A fact most Nigerians can attest to.\n\nPresently, the market for single-split air-conditioners in Nigeria is set at approximately 560,000 units annually. LG leads the pack with an 11% market share, Samsung has 9%, Panasonic and Midea have 8%, Gree and Chigo have 7%, Daikin 5%, while Haier Thermocool and Hisense have 3%. The remaining market share belongs to lesser-known brands like Royal.\n\n86% of these cooling units are assembled in the country, with 14% of them imported. This is because, unlike the automotive sector, for example, Nigeria encourages local assembly of the cooling units by setting a lower import duty (5%) for completely knocked down units, compared to assembled units (20%)\n\nEmmanuel says most customers prefer to buy new units with brands like Hisense, Royal, and Midea as the most patronised due to their relative cheapness. Prices range from the \u20a6100,000s ($243.01) to the \u20a6500,000s ($1215.07). However, he resisted my pressure and declined to name the best brand.\n\n\u201cWhat might be my best might be different for you,\u201d he said.\n\nI certainly wished we had decided to buy new ACs right then.\n\nCool careers for a better world\n\nAccording to Numbeo, the average monthly net salary in Nigeria is \u20a671,945.53 ($174.84).\n\nWhen asked if he would be willing to switch jobs, Emmanuel said no. According to him, he earns more money working as an artisan than most salary earners. So in one sitting, he could make more than most people.\n\nMoney aside, he views his work with enthusiasm. His eagerness to answer questions and willingness to learn things that he previously did not know, and his dedication to attempting his best work, all shine through as we converse.\n\nHappy World Refrigeration Day as we all take a moment to appreciate the cooling technicians who keep our homes and work areas cool and serene enough for comfortable living.\n\nWe should also appreciate the man who invented the modern air-conditioner, Willis Carrier.\n\n*Black market rates, December 2020\n\n**Dollar equivalent in 2014",

          "title": "Insecurity: Govs, LG Chairmen pocket over N375bn security vote annually, yet situation persists",
          "text": "Without doubt, insecurity is one of the fundamental and notorious challenges currently facing Nigeria, the most populous nation in the continent of Africa. The problem has grown in proportion, sophistication and gravity especially with regional militia groups mutating with no restraint. The emergence of the monstrous, ferocious invidious and blood \u2013thirsty organization called Boko-Haram and other groups across the country have alarmingly aggravated the situation. This ugly situation has not only attracted negative global attention to the country but made it become a country of interest.\n\nAmidst this unfortunate situation is the shocking revelation that State governors and local government chairmen in the 36 states of the Federation collect a whopping sum of N375 billion annually in the name of security votes, an act not provided for in the Nigerian constitution or any known law in the country. This amount excludes those collected annually by the president, vice president, leadership of the National and state Assemblies, Ministers and other top government officials.\n\nThe security funds, often provided in cash to the government officials are not subject to legislative oversight or independent audit, and therefore are disbursed at the discretion of the executive. Although, these officials often spend some of the funds on security, they also channel them into political activities or embezzle them outright according to 2018 report by the Transparency International. The result is that security votes have become conduit pipes for corruption\n\nRegrettably, despite the huge sums of money they collect from the public treasury, state governors have been incapable of stopping wanton killings, kidnappings and other criminal activities currently going on in their states.\n\nIn recent media chat President Muhammadu Buhari said he sent two South-west governors back to their states when they came to his office to complain about insecurity in their states.\n\nResponding to a question on the establishment of state police in Nigeria during an interview with ARISE TV, the president said \u201cTwo governors from the South-west came to tell me that the cattle rearers in some of the forests are killing farmers while their cattle are eating their crops. I told them you campaigned to be elected and you are elected. I told them go (to) back and sought out themselves.\u201d\n\nRead Also: When fight against insecurity becomes govt\u2019s main preoccupation\n\nIn Nigeria, security vote is a monthly allowance allocated to state governments for the sole purpose of funding security services within such states. The monthly fund runs into billions of naira and vary based on the level of security required by the individual state. States such as Rivers, Delta, Lagos, Kaduna, Oyo and Kano that face constant security threats receive some of the largest security vote funds.\n\nFigures obtained by BusinessDay across the country revealed the following details: Taraba State: N200M Monthly (N2.4B Annually), Bauchi State: N1.417B Monthly (N17B Annually), Kaduna State: N400M Monthly [N175M (Security vote) + N225M (Security vote (Preventive and Supportive) for the SSG\u2019s office)] N4.8B Annually [N2.1B + N2.7B], Katsina State: N17.583M Monthly (N211M Annually), Zamfara State: N600M Monthly (N7.2B Annually), and Benue State: N3.092B allocation to personnel and overhead costs monthly which cover security vote, among others (total N37.1B Annually. Other states include, Lagos State: N1.429B Monthly [N1.297B (Public order and safety) + N132.5M (Social Protection)] (N17.149B Annually [N15.559B + N1.59B]), Ondo State: N600M Monthly (N7.2B Annually) Osun State: N400M Monthly (N4.8B Annually), Ogun State: N80-N100M Monthly (N960M-N1.2B Annually) Ekiti State: N100M Monthly (N1.2B annually), Oyo State: N1bn Monthly (N120B annually), Borno State: N806.25M Monthly (N9.675B Annually), Yobe State: N316.667M Monthly (N3.8B Annually).\n\nIn the same vein Imo State governor receives N333.333M Monthly (N4B Annually), Enugu State: N600M Monthly (N7.2B Annually), Anambra State: N850M Monthly (N10B Annually), Abia State: N700M Monthly (N8.4B Annually), Cross River State: N500M Monthly (N6B Annually), Rivers State: N1.5B Monthly (N18B Annually), Akwa Ibom State: N1.8B Monthly (N21.6B Annually), Edo State: N900M Monthly (N10.8B Annually) and Delta State: N2B Monthly (N24B Annually), respectively\n\nOthers are, Niger State: N1.308B Monthly (N15.7B Annually), Plateau State: N216.667M Monthly (N2.6B Annually), Kogi State: N400M Monthly (N4.8B Annually), Nasarawa State: N100M Monthly (N1.2B annually). However, the the data for Kwara, Ebonyi and Kano states could not be obtained as at press time\n\nThe governors are not alone. Chairmen of local government areas, it was gathered, collect up to N50m each amounting to N38 billion annually.\n\nThe worrisome aspect of this practice are that there is no limit to, or regulation of, what may be spent as security vote and, sadly, the amount involved is neither appropriated nor subject to any form of legislative scrutiny or accountability. Rather, the allocation and use of the amount involved are usually shrouded in secrecy.\n\nAnd notwithstanding that this so-called security vote is regularly obtained, security challenge has continued to grow with worrisome sophistication and gravity in Nigeria. This sad development has constrained many commentators to query the legitimacy of security votes in the face of the persistence of crimes in the country\n\nIfeanyi Nzelibe, a retired Naval Commodore said the fact that the amount usually obtained as security vote is seemingly limitless, unappropriated and unaccounted for should provoke patriotic and not mere passing interest. This is especially so in a democracy which he said has as its tenets, transparency, openness, accountability and political participation. Besides and more importantly said Nzeribe \u2018is evident that in the absence of control, the practice is susceptible to abuse\u201d.\n\nSecurity analysts estimate that over ($60bn) sixty billion dollars has so far been wasted by Nigerian in the name of security vote to president, Governors and Local Government Chairmen. Although there is no scientific data on which this figure can be predicated and validated, it is nonetheless indicative and revelatory that the amount collected as security votes by those entitled is massive.\n\nTransparency International recently alleged that the use of security votes has expanded in both scope and scale under the present Muhammadu Buhari government with its director for defence and security, Katherine Dixon, saying that, \u201cthe security vote is one of the most durable forms of corruption operating in Nigeria today.\u201d\n\nAccording to TI, the sum total of Nigeria\u2019s various security votes dwarfs the international security assistance it receives, and is comparable to budgeted spending on national defence and security institutions.\n\n\u201cIn one year, these in-cash, extra-budgetary expenditures add up to over nine times the amount of US security assistance to Nigeria since 2012 ($68.6 million) and over twelve times the $53.5 million (\u00a340 million) in counterterrorism support the UK promised Nigeria from 2016 to 2020\u201d the anti-corruption watchdog stated a recent report.\n\nViewed from another angle, security vote spending exceeds 70 percent of the annual budget of the Nigeria Police Force, more than the Nigerian Army\u2019s annual budget, and more than the Nigerian Navy and Nigerian Air Force\u2019s annual budgets combined. For instance, the 2018 budgetary allocation to defence was N145 billion, while allocation to the Ministry of Interior was N63.26 billion, the total falls short of N241.2 billion shared by the executives in security votes annually.\n\nIn December 2019, the government announced the withdrawal of $1 billion from the Excess Crude Account\u2014nearly half of Nigeria\u2019s dwindling rainy day fund\u2014for ad hoc security expenditures.\n\nIn the same vein, president Buhari has increased the number of security votes tucked into the federal budget from about 30 in 2016 to over 190 in 2018. The total value of these votes increased from $46.2 million (N9.3 billion at the time) to $51 million (N18.4 billion now) over those two years.\n\nAnalysts say Buhari should show his commitment to fighting corruption by cutting down on his government\u2019s widespread use of security votes.\n\n\u201cIf it is so important for national security that a proportion of federal and states\u2019 security budgets remains secret, then it should be equally important that it is spent effectively. The only way to ensure this is to put in place effective oversight structures\u201d said a retired military officer who pleaded anonymity.\n\nNo law supporting security votes- Clarke\n\nA senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN) Robert Clarke, said pointedly that there is no law, however small, that sanctions the payment of security votes to the state governors as well as the president. He, therefore, called on Nigerians to rise against what he called impunity in the system.\n\n\u201cI still maintain my stand that the question of security vote has no basis in law. When you look at the history of security vote in Nigeria, you will not find anywhere in the 1999 constitution that allows security vote to be enjoyed by anybody. It was the military that started it all.\n\n\u201cI am bound by the constitution if you can find it anywhere there. There may be provision for the upkeep of the Presidency or the Governor\u2019s house. But you will never find that a special amount of money has been allocated for security.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the security votes for these past years have been used by these governors without appropriation, which by law is illegal. Because the law is clear that no money can be spent without appropriation and if there is no law backing security votes, that means they have been spending the money illegally and unlawfully.\n\n\u201cI have checked from the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation and he has told me emphatically there is no provision covering the security votes. The question is that nobody in Nigeria today knows how much the presidency is spending on security votes, likewise the governors and other executives.

The security agencies have been doing their best, we all need to do more, we all have to play our roles in the circumstance we find ourselves,\u201d El-Rufai said.",

          "text": "A Nigerian Secondary School to start accepting cryptocurrency\n\nNew Oxford Science Academy, a private secondary school in Kano State, Nigeria, has announced it will be accepting cryptocurrency as a means of payments for school fees despite the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) banning financial institutions from providing cryptocurrency-related services.\n\nAccording to a report from Kano Focus, a news outlet in the state, the proprietor of the school, Sabi\u2019u Musa Haruna, will allow students to pay their tuition fees in cryptocurrency. The Proprietor said this while addressing journalists in Kano, stating that the school management took the decision after consulting parents and guardians. He urged the Nigerian government to embrace and regulate cryptocurrency in the interview.\n\nRead Also: What makes Nigeria the No.2 Cryptocurrency Market?\n\nSabi\u2019u Musa Haruna stated, \u201cWe have decided to accept cryptocurrency as school fees because the world today is tilting towards the system. We believe one day; digital money will gain more acceptance than paper money.\u201d\n\nHe further explained that the decision was aimed at easing the strain of payment of school fees for parents, citing that countries like El Salvador and Tanzania had expanded payment options for cryptocurrency users. He did not give specifics as to which tokens the school will accept for payment, however.\n\nNDDC Forensic Audit Report ready by July\n\nThe NDDC has been plagued by a series of scandals which has seen the removal of the acting managing director, Daniel Pondei and approval of an interim administrator for the commission, Effiong Okon Akwa.\n\nAt the House of Reps investigative panel set up to probe the corruption allegations against Akpabio and members of the Interim Management Committee of the NDDC last year, Godswill Akpabio, the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, accused members of the National Assembly of being the beneficiaries of most of the contracts from the Niger Delta Development Commission.\n\nGodswill Akpabio has therefore stated that the final forensic audit report of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) will be ready by July. The Minister disclosed this in an interview with State House correspondents on Tuesday, at the Presidential Villa in Abuja, according to a report by the News Agency of Nigeria.\n\nThe forensic audit of NDDC is on course and it is progressing very well and I am happy with the progress made so far. And I am very certain that by the end of July, which is just a month and a few weeks away, the final result will be given to the president for implementation.\n\nAnd in terms of the composition of the board of the NDDC, of course, we have fast-tracked the process and the National Assembly will soon get the list.\n\nJAMB suspends the use of USSD code to check UTME results and gives new instructions\n\nIn the coming week, \u2018JAMBITES\u2019 would be expected to visit JAMB\u2019s website to access their results. The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) announced the suspension of the use of the USSD code to check the just-released results of the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME).\n\nRead Also: UTME results: JAMB suspends USSD code, redirects candidates\n\nThis is as a result of the current challenges being experienced with the use of the USSD code by the candidates.\n\nThis was made known by JAMB in a statement issued by the Spokesman of the Board, Dr Fabian Benjamin, on Saturday, June 26, 2021.\n\nThe statement from Benjamin reads, \u201cIt has come to the attention of the Board that the result checking on USSD code 55019 is saddled with some challenges. Consequently, the Board hereby directs all candidates to visit JAMB portal to check for their 2021 UTME result.\n\n\u201cCandidates can check their results from anywhere there is internet access, checking by USSD code 55019 is suspended.\u201d\n\nDangote Fertilizer to begin export to US and Brazil in the coming week\n\nDangote Group has concluded plans to begin the export of its first shipment of fertilizer from its new fertilizer plant at the Lekki Free Zone in Lagos, to the US and Brazil. Initial shipment from one of the world\u2019s biggest fertilizer plant, which has the capacity to produce 3 million tonnes of urea and ammonia per year, is expected to start in late June or early July.\n\nThe billionaire chairman of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote, said this while speaking at a virtual economic forum hosted in Qatar on Tuesday, June 22, 2021, according to Reuters.\n\nAliko Dangote said that the new fertilizer plant will export its first shipment in late June or early July, to Louisiana, while the majority of exports from the plant are expected to go to Brazil, adding that it will also be able to supply all the major markets in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nHe said, \u201cApart from meeting the domestic demand, we are going to be able to earn quite a lot of money exporting the goods to the South American countries.\u201d\n\nA lot of Nigerians believe that the fertilizer plant will help solve the problem of low crop yield in the country, which is partly due to insufficient access to fertilizer.\n\nCan anything halt this oil price Rally?\n\nOil prices were up on Monday, driven by the prospect of strong demand during the summer driving season and a pause in talks to revive the Iran nuclear deal that could indicate a delay in the supply of Iranian oil to the market.\n\nAccording to two OPEC+ sources on Tuesday, the organization is considering a gradual increase in supply from August, but no decision has been made yet on the actual volumes.\n\nOil prices gained for the third consecutive session on Friday, as demand growth is expected to outstrip supply on the prospect that OPEC+ producers will be cautious in returning more output to the market from August. Brent had a weekly growth of 3.91%.\n\nIn the coming week, oil prices are expected to be bullish on signs of demand growth.\n\nGold rises amidst personal consumption expenditure data\n\nGold was bullish on Saturday as investors digested mixed signals from U.S. Federal Reserve officials on interest rate hikes earlier last week and the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data released on Saturday.\n\nA key measure of U.S. inflation rose sharply again in May and showed prices rising at the fastest annual pace since 2008, which means that consumers will pay more for goods and services over the summer as the economy recovers from the pandemic.\n\nThe PCE prices index climbed 0.4% in May to mark a third straight big increase. Economists polled by Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal had a forecast of +0.5%. Over the past year, consumer prices have shot up 3.9%, reflecting the biggest gain since 2008 when oil prices hit a record high of $150 a barrel.\n\nWith the increase in the PCE index, senior officials of the Federal Reserve (FED) have downplayed the increase. Fed leaders insist prices will ease next year as the economy returns to normal, most people go back to work and widespread shortages of labour and supplies fade away.\n\nThe core PCE price index moved up 0.5% in May. That nudged the increase over the past 12 months to 3.4% from 3.1%. Although, the PCE is the Fed\u2019s preferred measure of inflation.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. President, Joe Biden reached a deal with a bipartisan group of senators to provide $579 billion in infrastructure investments, which also boosted investor sentiment on the yellow metal.\n\nOn the data front, 411,000 filed for initial jobless claims in the U.S. during the previous week as the labour market is steadily rebounding from COVID-19, thanks to a reopening economy. Forecasts prepared by Investing.com predicted 380,000 claims but the actual was greater than the forecast by 31,000.\n\nOn Friday, the Bank of England handed down its policy decision. The central bank said inflation would exceed 3% in the coming months, but expected that the surge would be transitory and would not impact the current stimulus policy. Gold appreciated by 0.37% while Silver also inched up by 0.23% W-o-W\n\nGold prices are expected to be mixed in the coming week, as the dollar continues to pressure the bullion.\n\nNBS economic data release calendar for the week\n\nThe Week Ahead\n\nThe NBS release calendar for the coming week indicates the following:\n\nMonday 28 th June 2021: Internally Generated Revenue at State Level (2020)\n\nJune 2021: Internally Generated Revenue at State Level (2020) Wednesday 30th June 2021: Prison Statistics (2020)\n\nCurrency market outlook\n\nThe currency market returned to its bearish trend this week both at the official window and unofficial market.\n\nIt depreciated against the US dollar, British Pound and Euro by -2.06%, -0.42%, -0.33%respectively closing at $1/N495, \u00a31/N718 and \u20ac1/N605 at the BDC window.\n\nAt the I & E FX window, the Naira depreciated week-on-week by +0.16% and +0.19% at the NAFEX window. The Naira closed the week at $/N411.67 at the I&E FX window, at the NAFEX (spot market) it closed at $/N411.\n\nMore of the same is expected in the week ahead as the Naira is anticipated to continue to hover around N406/$1-N412/$1 threshold in the NAFEX window.\n\nMoney market\n\nFinancial system liquidity opened the previous week at N75.53bn which pushed funding rates lower at the start of the week.\n\nAt the close of the trading session this week, funding rates rose. Open Buyback (OBB) closed at 22.00% while Overnight (O/N) rates closed at 23.00% indicating a Week-on-Week (W-o-W) rise of +17.33% for OBB and +19.48% for O/N rates.\n\nFunding rates are expected to trend in double digits in the coming week.\n\nTreasury bills market\n\nThe Treasury Bills Market started last week on a quiet note and a similar sentiment was sustained till the close of the week. However, the market was bearish at the close of the market on Friday, average benchmark yields for T.bills rose significantly by +8.59% to 6.90% while OMO bills rose by +0.81% W-o-W to close at 9.74%, CBN\u2019s Special Bill rose significantly by +6.12%.\n\nWe expect activity next week to be dictated by the market liquidity situation.\n\nFGN bond and Eurobond markets\n\nThe Bond market started the previous week on a relatively quiet note as market participants traded on a cautious basis ahead of the Bond auction mid-week.\n\nAt the close of the week, the overall market was bullish with buying interest seen across the board. The overall average benchmark yields closed at 9.83% for the week which fell W-o-W by -0.41%.\n\nSuccessful bids for the 16.2884% FGN MAR 2027, 12.5000% FGN MAR 2035 & 12.98% FGN MAR 2050 were allotted at the Marginal Rates of 12.7400%, 13.5000%, and 13.7000%, respectively.\n\nHowever, the original coupon rates of 16.2884% for the 16.2884% FGN MAR 2027, 12.5000% for the 12.5000% FGN MAR 2035, and 12.9800% for the 12.9800% FGN MAR 2050 was maintained.\n\nThe Eurobond market started the previous week on a relatively weak note as sentiment remains soft given the change in policy stance by the US FED. Selling was seen across the board particularly on the mid to long end of the curve.\n\nMarket sentiment is expected to remain soft as inflation concerns continue to linger.\n\nNigerian capital market\n\nThe Nigerian bourse closed the previous week on a negative note with a decline of -2.56%. The Nigerian Stock Exchange lost N516.32bn thus, year-to-date return moderated to -6.49%, while the market capitalization settled at N19.6 trillion.\n\nSectoral performance across sectors tracked was mixed this week as the NSEAFRHDYI was the highest gainer for the week with +1.71% while NSE-IND recorded the highest decline with -3.33%. NSE Consumer Goods, NSE Banking, and NSE-Oil and Gas closed the week positive with +0.57%, +0.92%, and +0.12% respectively.\n\nMarket breadth for the week closed positive with 24 gainers led by HONYFLOUR as against 10 losers led by NPFMCRFBK.\n\nIn the coming week, we expect the possibility of sustained bargain hunting as investors look to take advantage of good bargains, however, press releases from listed companies and other macroeconomic developments are likely to impact investors\u2019 decisions.\n\nThe movement of yields in the fixed income market could also influence the movement in the market.\n\nThe Nigerian economy in retrospect\n\nThe Federal Government on Thursday said it was investing $1bn on the construction of three flagship projects namely: the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Second Niger Bridge, and Abuja-Kaduna-Zaria-Kano Expressway.\n\nThe minister of state for Works and Housing, Abubakar Aliyu who disclosed this at an event earlier in the week, added that over N15tn would be required to bridge the country\u2019s infrastructure deficit.\n\nMinister of state for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo announced on Thursday that the Federal Government has paid the sum of N24.8 billion as stipends to 413,630 beneficiaries under the Special Public Works Programme. According to the minister, the scheme which enlisted a total of 774000 beneficiaries each of whom would get N60,000 each, is meant to reflate the economy especially as all Local Government Areas will benefit.\n\nAccording to data from NBS, domestic debt accounted for 62.33% of Nigeria\u2019s public debt portfolio as of Q1 2021. The domestic debt portfolio accounted for N20.64trn out of the total public debt stock of N33trn, while external debt was N12.47trn. Meanwhile, further disaggregation of Nigeria\u2019s domestic public debt showed that the Federal Government\u2019s domestic debt stock was put at N16.51trn while the domestic debt of States and FCT domestic debt stock was given as N4.12trn.\n\nThe World Bank has said Nigeria can mobilize revenue of up to N600bn annually by increasing \u2018sin taxes\u2019 especially the excise duties on tobacco and alcohol just as recommended in the Multilateral Organisation\u2019s \u2018Resilience through Reform\u2019 report. According to a senior official of the bank, Nigeria\u2019s excise duty rates on tobacco and alcohol are one of the lowest in Africa and a rise in the excise duty on such items would not impact most of the population.\n\nThe minister of finance, Budget, and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed declared on Wednesday that Nigeria planned to take more loans to fund infrastructure. Ahmed mentioned that the country was grappling with constrained revenue and as such needed to borrow more.\n\nThe minister argued that the debt-to-GDP ratio at 29 % allowed for more debt. Meanwhile, the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, differed on the nation\u2019s debt-to-gross Domestic Product ratio saying that the debt to GDP ratio had risen to 35 percent.\n\nOil dealers in Nigeria under the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Suleja/Abuja Unit started a strike on Monday following disagreements between it and the Department of Petroleum Resource (DPR). The IPMAN said it was against the DPR\u2019s request for daily stock of products supplied by the dealers patronizing the Suleja depot in Niger State, describing it as unethical. The Head, Public Affairs, DPR, Paul Osu, argued that the request was a statutory regulatory requirement for a licensed retail outlet, which enables DPR to provide accurate petroleum products consumption data for the country.\n\nSpeaking at the opening of a two-day National LPG sensitization and awareness campaign in Abuja on Tuesday, Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo said effective implementation of the National LPG Expansion Plan (NLEIP) would move Nigerians away from using cooking fuel that is harmful to health and the environment to cleaner and more efficient energy. The FG noted its plan to upscale the 5 percent LPG domestic usage to 90 percent in 10 years.\n\nThe minister of state for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, during the shareholder\u2019s agreement on the construction of Brass Petroleum Products Terminal Limited (BPPT) on Tuesday, noted that residents of riverine areas had perpetually bought refined petroleum products at exorbitant prices because of the huge cost of transporting products to those locations. He believed BPPT limited located at Okpoama, Brass Local Government Area, Bayelsa State, will resolve these problems for the region.\n\nThe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation on Wednesday said it was collaborating with law enforcement agencies and other relevant downstream and upstream stakeholders to curb the menace of petroleum products smuggling and crude oil theft",

Milland Dixon Dikio (rtd) has urged the leaders of the first phase beneficiaries of the programme to look beyond the monthly N65,000 stipends from the federal government, declaring that the new model from the PAP was designed to make ex-agitators employers of labour.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n\n\nThe meeting with leaders of the first phase held in Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital at the weekend and attended by the speaker of Bayelsa State House of Assembly, Abraham Ingobere who was also a former militant leader, Comrade Paul Eris, popularly known as Ogunboss; a member of Bayelsa House of Assembly, Felix Bonny-Ayah; Pastor Reuben and Joshua Macaiver among others, also agreed that the interim administrator of PAP has rekindled their hope in the programme.\n\nWhile interacting with the ex-militant leaders as part of PAP\u2019s continuous engagements with all ex-agitators and beneficiaries of the programme, Dikio harped on the need for the beneficiaries of the amnesty programme to think beyond the N65,000 monthly stipend, insisting that his new model of train, employ and mentor programme was designed to make ex-agitators employers of labour\n\nHe said, \u201cWe will collaborate with the various levels of government in the region to ensure we get the best out of people in the Niger Delta. We are working to ensure that people in the Niger Delta are also able to attain heights, regardless of their status.\u201d\n\nDikio insisted that the scheme\u2019s scholarship programme must be based on merit explaining that 70 per cent would be allocated for ex-agitators, 20 per cent for impacted communities and 10 per cent based on PAP\u2019s discretion.\n\nHe promised to look into the complaints and concerns of the ex-agitators on the re-organisation of the programme\u2019s offices for effective service delivery. \u201cNiger Delta as a riverine area should be investing heavily on maritime transport and maritime security. Maritime transport should be our domain. We must own it because it is who we are. This Niger Delta will be the best place to live and do business in my lifetime. I know that for sure,\u201d he added.",

          "text": "The Niger Delta Avengers threatened and demanded that economic sabotage be carried out by attacking major oil and gas sites unless specific demands, including the development of the Niger Delta and the reorganization of the Federation, were realized, according to the media on Sunday.\n\nIt is, however, curious that the threat was coming less than 48 hours after President Muhammadu Buhari met with the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress (INC), at the Presidential Villa, and the germane issues had been responded to, especially call for restructuring of the Federation, and the inauguration of a Board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\n\nFor clarity and record purposes, below is full text of the speech by President Buhari on Friday, June 25, 2021, which renders any sabre-rattling rather unnecessary:\n\n\u201cI warmly welcome all the Elders of the Niger Delta and particularly the National Executive of the Ijaw National Congress, under the leadership of Professor Benjamin Okaba. I thank you for paying this courtesy visit not too long after your election in April, and swearing-in last May.\n\n\u201cI also want to congratulate you all for your election and to add that a lot of responsibility is placed on your shoulders, especially coming from the fact that the Ijaw National Congress was almost without leadership for some time.\n\n\u201cAs the symbol of the collective voice of the Ijaw people, which is one of Nigeria\u2019s main ethnic groups, the existence of a focused and people oriented leadership would go a long way in articulating the demands of the Ijaw people and making sure these demands are made part of the national discourse.\n\n\u201cI particularly note your ten point demand to the Federal Government in your inaugural speech and assure you that this administration is frontally addressing them.\n\n\u201cI am equally concerned about the rate of environmental degradation in the Niger Delta and as you are aware the HydroCarbon Pollution Remediation Project has started work with remediation efforts in Ogoni land and I have directed the Minister of Environment to ensure that the projects are implemented with a high percentage of local content and inclusion of the surrounding communities.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency, under the same ministry of Environment is working to make sure that oil spills are reduced and new ones prevented. As you are also aware, all the responsible agencies of government have been directed to ensure that they enforce compliance by the International Oil Companies to international best practices.\n\n\u201cIn addressing your call for immediate restructuring, the National Assembly whose responsibility it is to ensure that our constitution responds to the call for a restructured Nigeria, has already concluded regional consultations and as soon as they finalise the process, necessary action would not be delayed on my part.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, your call for creation of two additional states and more local government areas for the Ijaw people is a legislative matter, which should naturally be handled by the National Assembly and seeking concurrence at the state levels.\n\n\u201cI completely agree with your call to allocate operational licenses for marginal fields to Ijaw people. However, like you know, the process of granting licenses is guided by laid down rules and regulations, most of which even favour local content and local contractors. I see no reason why they should not be granted such licenses if they qualify.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of fair and balanced appointments to reflect federal character principles, I re-affirm that this has always been my focus and would continue to be because I have always seen Nigeria as a country where everyone should be given equal opportunities.\n\n\u201cA contentious issue that has been a subject of discourse amongst the Ijaw people of recent has been the need for the Niger Delta Development Commission to live up to its billing by delivering the required succour to the people of the region. Based on the mismanagement that had previously be-devilled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July, 2021.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board would be inaugurated. However, I would like to implore you that the Ijaw National Congress should play a more active role in making sure that the mismanagement that occurred in the past is not repeated.\n\n\u201cI am particularly happy to note your call for promoting ownership of modular refineries by the Ijaw people and I will urge you to interphase with your sons who are involved in the processes of establishing these refineries, especially the Honourable Minister of State Petroleum Resources to actualize this quest.\n\n\u201cLike you well know, completion of the East-West Road is top on my infrastructure agenda and I will look to its speedy conclusion. Again, the occasional disturbance by youths in some communities along the route to construction work would require your close attention and guidance.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we have made considerable progress with the construction of the Bonny to Port Harcourt Bridge.\n\n\u201cI am very happy with the recent affirmation of your belief in a United Nigeria and while I thank you for standing with me, I will also implore you to use your leverage in making sure that we keep working together to keep this country a united, indivisible entity, so that we can tackle our problems together and overcome our challenges together.\n\n\u201cI would like now to commend Professor Okaba for your emphasis on supporting the fight against insecurity by developing internal control mechanisms as well as working with other institutions in the country to address our current security challenges.\n\n\u201cWhile I thank you once more for this visit and I will continue to count on your support as we work towards resolving our current challenges.\n\n\u201cGod Bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d",

          "text": "Strong indication emerged Sunday that Zamfara state Governor Bello Matawalle will defect from Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP) to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThe planned defection was announced barely 46 days after Cross River state Governor Ben Ayade dumped the opposition party for the governing APC, a development that generated heated reactions from some PDP chieftains.\n\nEbonyi state Governor Dave Umahi left the party last year while a PDP lawmaker, Senator Peter Nwaoboshi also joined the APC last week.\n\nMatawalle\n\nAnnouncing the governor\u2019s plan in a statement obtained by Blueprint in Abuja, a former Commissioner for Rural Development and Cooperatives in the state, Alhaji Abubakar Abdullahi Tsafe, said the governor had heeded the call made to that effect.\n\nTsafe, an APC chieftain in the state, was the first to call on Matawalle to join APC March last year.\n\nHe was one of the APC chieftains in the cabinet of Matawalle until it was dissolved early this month.\n\nTsafe said he was condemned and called names by PDP chieftains when he first called on the governor to join APC.\n\n\u201cWhen as a member of his cabinet, I was appealing to the governor to join the APC, a lot of people expressed reservations but to the glory of Allah, he has accepted to join. The governor ignored all calls by the PDP chieftains against me.\n\n\u201cAll arrangements have been concluded for the governor to join APC. We will formally receive him on Tuesday,\u201d he said.\n\nThe former commissioner also said with Matawalle in APC, the welfare of the people of the state would be adequately attended to as the federal government would give necessary attention to the state.\n\n\u201cWith him in the APC, the success we are recording in the area of insecurity would be consolidated. We will fully have opportunities to harness the abundant mineral resources in the state for the benefit of our people.\n\n\u201cAs the next door neighbour of Mr. President\u2019s state, Katsina, Zamfara will be better in the ruling party. Welcome onboard Your Excellency, \u201cTsafe said.\n\nZMSG confirms\n\nAnd in line with Tsafe\u2019s declaration, the state Commissioner for Information, Ibrahim Dosara, formally announced the defection plan in a public service announcement on Zamfara state radio and television stations.\n\nDosara announced this Sunday in his capacity as the chairman publicity committee of the defection programme scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nPDP excos, ex-minister, others join\n\nMeanwhile, investigation by one of our correspondents revealed that both the state PDP executives, led by Alhaji Tukur Danfulani, the three senators representing Zamfara North, West and Central, Senator Sahabi Ya\u2019u, Senator Hassan Muhammed Nasiha and Senator Hassan Dan\u2019iya respectively, and some six members of the House of Representatives have unanimously backed Governor Matawalle\u2019s defection to the ruling party.\n\nAlso set to go with the governor are former deputy governor, Malam Ibrahim Wakkala and former Minister of Interior, Ambassador Bashir Yuguda.\n\nHowever, the Seventh House of Representatives member representing Talata Mafara Federal Constituency, Kabir Classic, is not joining the defectors as revealed by him to an online medium-thunder blower\n\nSimilarly, Deputy Governor Mahadi Aliyu Gusau, it was gathered, said he had not yet decided on whether to follow the governor.\n\nThe deputy governor, who is the son of a top former military brass, General Aliyu Gusau, is being rumoured to have pledged remaining in the PDP, a party his father belongs.\n\nSecondus must go, PDP youth insist\n\nAnd from the PDP South-South Youths Vanguard came a call Sunday that the party\u2019s national chairman, Prince Uche Secondus must be kicked out.\n\nThe call is coming on the heel of frequent defection of the opposition party strong members, especially governors, to the ruling APC.\n\nThe PDP youths, under the aegis of South-South Youth Vanguard, called on the party leaders to stop the drift of defection and address the negative situation in the party now.\n\nThe youth vanguard, in a statement by its national chairman, James Efe Akpofure, said the party would be empty before Secondus leaves office by December if he\u2019s not sacked now.\n\n\u201cIf the Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC) is doing well, this exodus of party members to APC will not be experienced,\u201d the youth said.\n\nThey further said \u201cthe continued stay of Secondus as the party National Chairman will destroy the party if not quickly checked.\n\n\u201cIt is embarrassing that within the space of few months, members with key positions are leaving the party. The time to take action is now. A stitch in time saves nine.\u201d",
          "summary": "Strong indication emerged Sunday that Zamfara state Governor Bello Matawalle will defect from Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP) to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\nEbonyi state Governor Dave Umahi left the party last year while a PDP lawmaker, Senator Peter Nwaoboshi also joined the APC last week.\nTsafe, an APC chieftain in the state, was the first to call on Matawalle to join APC March last year.\nTsafe said he was condemned and called names by PDP chieftains when he first called on the governor to join APC.\n\u201cAll arrangements have been concluded for the governor to join APC.",

          "text": "Tertiary institutions within and around the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja are on red alert following escalating incidences of kidnapping in higher institutions across the country in recent times.\n\nWithin the last two months, some tertiary institutions in Kaduna, Niger, Benue, Kebbi and Abia states were attacked and students taken captives for ransom, thereby heightening tension about the safety of students in higher institutions across the country.\n\nThe FCT Police Command had in May, directed the nine public and privately owned universities, polytechnic and college of education located in and around the territory to reduce their academic activities to a \u2018minimal level\u2019 to forestall inadvertently and unduly exposing their students and staff to present danger of kidnapping by insurgents and bandits.\n\nThe directive followed unusual movements of persons suspected to have banditry profiling into the FCT as well as claims that insurgents were occupying Shiroro town and villages around its vicinity in Niger state.\n\nThe alleged occupied places are about two hours drive to Abuja metropolis and the respective area councils, as recently stated by Niger state Governor Abubakar Sani Bello.\n\nTertiary institutions in Abuja\n\nThe FCT plays host to eight public and privately owned higher institutions, including six universities, a polytechnic and college of education namely: University of Abuja, Nile University, Baze University, Veritas University, Dubem Polytechnic, College of Education Zuba, Philomath University Kuje, African University of Science and Technology Abuja (yet to take off) and Bingham University in Karu, Nasarawa state with very close proximity to the FCT.\n\nTertiary institutions meet security agencies\n\nAccordingly, the police authorities held series of meetings with respective higher institutions\u2019 management highlighting the present danger as well as taking precautionary measures aimed at averting such danger in future.\n\nBeyond holding meetings at the level of the FCT Police Command, the tertiary institutions\u2019 managements equally held security meetings with their respective Divisional Police Officers in the six area councils where further precautionary measures were suggested and modalities for implementation put in place.\n\nIn one of such meetings between the Zuba DPO and the College of Education, Zuba held Thursday, June 17th, 2021, the school management was directed to increase the presence of plainclothes security operatives in and around their facilities and to ensure both students and visitors were properly profiled but without attracting attention.\n\nSpeaking on the development, a senior management staff of the college, who, for administrative purpose, spoke under anonymity said: \u201cYes, we were directed by the police authorities in the FCT Command to step up security presence in our facilities because of the escalating incidences of kidnapping in tertiary institutions in the country.\n\n\u201cIn fact, just yesterday (Thursday, June 17th, 2021) we were in a meeting with the DPO of Zuba where we discussed issues of security of the school and its environs and it was resolved that security be stepped up to reflect the current situation.\n\n\u201cEven before the directive, our security arrangement has always been intact. We have the presence of operatives of the Directorate of State Security Service in and around the school. They are there to monitor and assist us coordinate security activities within the school because of our huge students\u2019 population and staff. We are always conscious of security, especially following the escalating cases of kidnapping for ransom of tertiary institutions\u2019 students in the country in recent time,\n\n\u201cBefore now, we had taken solid measures to tighten security around our facilities and the students\u2019 population and we are not about to slack. Instead, in response to the current threat, we are ever more determined to further strengthen our presence and boost security consciousness among students and staff.\u201d\n\nUniAbuja\n\nSimilarly, the University of Abuja Head of Information Department, Dr Habib Yakoob, said the school, in conjunction with the police authorities, has adopted measures to further tighten security within and around the permanent site of the university located along the Airport Road.\n\n\u201cAs you can see in the school, students are going about their normal businesses without tension, there is calm because there is reasonable security. We are on our toes, very alert and monitoring situation.\n\n\u201cThis university is a federal government entity so we are not in charge of the police nor any official security agencies but what we have done is to have our internal security mechanism that we hope can contain any security issues.\n\n\u201cOur security personnel have the capacity to carry out surveillance to ensure the safety of our students. Besides, they are working in conjunction with the federal government security agencies, particularly the police, in case we have a threat,\u201d Yakoob said.\n\nVeritas University\n\nAt Veritas University, a privately owned institution, the institution scaled down academic activities, including vacating the students on campus.\n\nThis was stated by the institution\u2019s Vice Chancellor, Professor Hyacinth Ichuko.\n\n\u201cWe are a residential university and over time, we have been very conscious of the security of our staff and students. We have had to build a police station in front of the university at the buffer zone of the university and they (police) are gracious enough to send 14 police officers there. Still that does not stop our internal security efforts. We have beefed up our own internal security in terms of use of no-armed bearing security operatives,\u201d Ichuko said while featuring on a recent television programme.\n\nNotwithstanding the various security arrangements put in place by the various authorities, Professor Ichuko called for increased military presence in schools as well as collaborative efforts among the higher institutions and parents as well as the security agencies.\n\nThis, he said, would not only ensure the institutions are protected but would also wade off the threat of kidnapping and banditry-related vices and make it almost impossible in the FCT higher institutions.\n\nPerimeter fence\n\nThough each of these schools occupies large expanse of land, very few of them have protective perimeter fence which could stall encroachment by unwanted elements.\n\nFor instance, University of Abuja has almost 12,000 hectares of land at its permanent site along Airport Road, but less than 5,000 hectares enjoy perimeter fence with almost the long stretch of land comprising of hills and rocks and thick bushes behind its perimeter yet to be fenced.\n\nSpeaking on this, spokesman of the university, Dr. Yakoob said: \u201cWell our perimeter fence, in all modesty, covers a relatively large portion of the university and work is still ongoing. But the university is not only relying on the perimeter fence. We have reasonably adequate security and we are working in conjunction with other security forces and we also have a mechanism if there is any threat to our security.\u201d\n\nAlso, Veritas University said it\u2019s doing its best to provide a secure environment for both students and staff, stressing that the security buffer zone created was for that purpose.\n\n\u201cWe also want to create a security buffer around the university and we have gone out of our way to support the vigilante groups around the communities,\u201d Ichuko explained.\n\nBut the situation at the College of Education, Zuba is almost similar to the UniAbuja as the school\u2019s permanent site is entirely without front and back perimeter fence.\n\n\u201cWe have perimeter fence around the temporary site and also around the permanent site,\u201d a senior staff insisted.\n\nHowever, our correspondent observed that though it (COE Zuba) occupies several acres of land, but apart from the unused main entrance, perimeter fence is nonexistent leaving the school completely exposed.\n\nThe sprawling permanent site consisting of about three acres of land is a beehive of construction activities with herders and farmers competing for portions of the land.\n\nThe same is applicable to Baze University where a makeshift security presence is at the entrance with a reflexive mirror used to check the under of cars while pedestrians could walk almost with minimum hassles. From behind it shares a boundary with the thick bush adjacent to the CCECC, International Cancer Centre along the Lugbe Expressway but with a near nonexistent perimeter fence.\n\nStudents raise concern\n\nStudents of Veritas varsity, Baze varsity, UniAbuja and others all lamented the lack of protection which perimeter fence could have offered them and pleaded with the federal government to prevail on their respective school managements to construct perimeter fence to provide a measure of safeguard against intruders into their schools.\n\nA final year student at Veritas University Bwari, \u2018May\u2019 Danjuma, said since they were asked to vacate their hostels sometime April, most students had been anxious to complete their programmes.\n\n\u201cWe have been eager to get over with our programmes because the tension is palpable. In fact, none would want to experience the ordeal the kidnapped students of Greenfield University got in the hands of kidnappers. I can\u2019t imagine being subjected to any ordeal in the hands of kidnappers or insurgents. Most students would gladly welcome the presence of the military in our school pending when the situation normalizes,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, a student of the Faculty of Arts (English Language) University of Abuja, who simply identified himself as Theo, lamented the insecurity around the school.\n\nTheo said: \u201cThe tension generated by insecurity around schools is worsened by lack of adequate presence of security operatives. Besides, we, in the Faculty of Arts, are not safe at all because the school is seriously exposed without the perimeter fence at the stretch of land that constitutes the back of the school. You can see rocky hills, columns of thick bushes all around, herders stray in at will and you don\u2019t know who is who. The school is vulnerable without the protective perimeter fence. We need improved deployment of the police and other armed security outfits.\u201d\n\nAnother student, Ismail Musa, said: \u201cThe federal government needs to step up security presence in schools in the FCT particularly tertiary institutions which seem to be the focus of attacks by unknown gunmen or kidnappers. Whatever internal arrangements the schools have made is not enough to guarantee reasonable security.\u201d\n\nExpressing similar worry, Bobby Frank,a student of College of Education Zuba said: \u201cInsecurity has become the sad reality of our society and it has induced tension, particularly in schools which are gradually becoming the epicentre for kidnappers. Well, while we count on God, we hope the government will beef up security around school facilities not only in the COE, Zuba but everywhere as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsurgents and kidnappers I think are working together firstly to create tension and then scare away students from school. If the government does not want education in the country destroyed, now is the time to act decisively against these unwanted elements in the society. Besides, tightening security in schools, it is high time the government arrested, prosecuted and jailed kidnappers and insurgents to tame the tide of invasion of schools and kidnapping of Nigeria\u2019s future leaders,\u201d said another student, Muradi Bulama.\n\nAt the Philomath University, Kuje which is set to resume academic activities September, communities around the institution urged the authority to tighten security around the facility because of its vulnerability to attacks from \u201cdebased elements.\u201d\n\nExpert says there\u2019s reason to worry\n\nCommenting on the development, a security expert, retired Captain Aliyu Umar Babangida and CEO Coldwater and Riversand Consult, in a recent television programme, shared the concern of the students.\n\nThe ex-military intelligence officer said: \u201cIn virtually all the regions, we have a very heightened state of fear due to insecurity. It is not surprising that people who have seen nomads moving cows from one place to another have become worried.\n\n\u201cThe tension is further heightened because a certain group of people and their activities have become synonymous to insecurity because the situation itself was not managed properly a initio. Certain men did not manage these kidnappers and herdsmen\u2019s security issues properly and today one has become synonymous to the other.\u201d",

Hon. Abubakar Suleiman, at Government House, Asaba.\n\nHe stated that as states\u2019 legislatures, the onus was on them to pass the Constitutional amendments in the interest of the nation.\n\nHe said that the nation was in dire need of the amendments to provide equity, justice and fairness in the affairs of the country.\n\nOkowa urged the Conference to continue to be a voice for the people and to remain true in enforcing executive-legislative relations across the country.\n\n\u201cWe are all aware that the National Assembly is currently engaged in the review of the 1999 Constitution and when they are through, it will be passed over to the States\u2019 Assemblies for passage.\n\n\u201cThe management of the country has placed a key role in your hands and I urge you all to look at it passionately to ensure that we are fair, equitable and justiciable in all decisions we will take in passing the ammendment.\n\n\u201cNigeria is in trouble but I believe that in working together, we can pilot the nation out of the current challenges through a passionate approach because as leaders, everything about governance must be in the overall interest of the people,\u201d he said.\n\nHe commended the legislature in Delta for its cooperation which had led to the achievements recorded by his administration in the last six years.\n\nAccording to him, whatever we have achieved as a state so far is because we have a very robust relationship with the State House of Assembly.\n\n\u201cThey are very passionate about the development of the state and that has helped us to make lots of progress.\n\n\u201cI am glad that you have organised yourselves under the Conference to compare notes, just as the Governors, to discuss and share ideas and to also talk to ourselves because it helps to improve the bond of unity among the various states.\n\n\u201cThe more we are talking together and remain strong the better for our country and I believe that was why the Conference of Speakers was berthed and I hope that you will continue to use the conference to better the lots of this nation,\u201d he added.\n\nOkowa who underscored the importance of executive-legislative relations, said \u201cif any state is to make progress there is need for a very warm relationship with the executive and legislative arms to enable policies and programmes work more efficiently than they would have ordinarily had.\n\n\u201cWe are in very trying times and this poses more burden on the various state legislatures. There must be a lot of collaborations and thinking to get the states out of unemployment, poverty and insecurity pervading the nation.\n\n\u201cA very cordial relationship that works will help to improve on the development of our country.\n\n\u201cAs lawmakers, you have a lot of role to play and I charge you to see yourselves going beyond just making laws, to help the executive to ensure that the people get the best of governance.\n\n\u201cThe fear of legislative autonomy is unfounded because our state House of Assembly has been operating in autonomy since 2019,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Rt. Hon. Suleiman had said that the Speakers were in the state for the second quarter meeting of the Conference.\n\nHe said that the Conference was made up of Speakers of the 36 States Houses of Assembly representing the 998 members of Houses of Assembly in the country.\n\nHe commended the Governor for the massive development in Asaba and parts of the state, adding that the mutual understanding between the Executive and Legislative arms of government in the state was commendable and worthy of emulation.\n\nSpeaker of Delta House of Assembly and Deputy Chairman of the Conference of Speakers, Rt Hon.

          "text": "\u2026begins 6 days crusade in Abuja, others\n\nAmidst daunting challenges the country grapples with, the General Superintendent, Deeper Life Bible Church, Pastor William Kumuyi , yesterday, urged Nigerians to connect to God for divine intervention.\n\nKumuyi made the call in his message titled, \u2018Super Living Through Divine Connection\u2019 as he begins six days crusade in Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital broadcasted via zoom and other social media platforms reaching millions of participants across the 36 States and the rest of the world.\n\nThe clergyman who has been concerned with the spiritual, physical, health, emotional and economic challenges of Nigerians amid the COVID-19 pandemic , declared that past disappointment, defeat, working and working without progress will be taken away from their lives if they connect to God who has all solutions to man\u2019s challenges.\n\nThe crusade continues to June 29, and many participants connected via social media platforms as some came to the venue of the programme at the Regional Worship Centre of the Church, Kado in Abuja, where Kumuyi is ministering live to the rest of the world.\n\nHe said: \u201cSuffering came with sinning against God. That is why there is so much suffering in the world. Today, the Lord wants to repair all that is broken down. Only come back and reconnect to Him.\n\n\u201cYou will reconnect and your life will never remain the same. You can begin to think about the freedom, power and authority the angels enjoy, and God made it so that we can enjoy the good life He planned for us. The glory and honour are coming back. The Lord will cleanse and change you, and all you lost will be restored to you.\n\n\u201cHe also made all things: sickness, suffering, oppression, calamities, etc. to be under your feet. By divine connection, from tonight, there will be a restoration of all that God planned for you originally.\u201d\n\nThe former university don stressed that sin is the instrument used by the devil to influence people to do evil and achieve his aim of destroying human lives and all good things that would bring peace and development.\n\nHe added that sin is the spiritual challenge of man that generates physical and moral decays in the society, therefore appealed to Nigerians to connect with God, and the expected divine intervention individually, family, nationally, and socio-economically will come but through absolute repentance from all sin.\n\n\u201cYou can invite sin with one finger but at the end, ten fingers will not be enough to remove them. Many people commit sin today and they feel they are alright. We are saying tonight that when you are in sin, you are not alright.\n\n\u201cThe Lord is your Redeemer, He will save you from all troubles and problems. He knows where your goodness, prosperity, satisfaction and sufficient supplies are, and He will lead you to them as you connect to Him. After giving you all this goodness, in the end, He will take you to heaven.\n\n\u201cWhen God calls you to repentance, you have to come to Him and do away with all those things which cause disconnection, chief of which is sin\u201d, he said.",

          "text": "Chief Olusegun Obasanjo has asked Nigerian leaders to begin at this moment in the nation\u2019s history, to prepare for and against population explosion.\n\nObasanjo said Nigeria\u2019s population is becoming a liability due to its improper management, stressing that except there is urgent intervention, then the nation may be declared the third most populous nation in the world.\n\nThe former president stated this in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital on Sunday, during a mentoring session with students of some selected schools across the country tagged \u201craising the next wave of innovative leaders through entrepreneurship.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, population management must come to the fore, especially in the face of the geometric population explosion without a corresponding socio-economic development.\n\nSpeaking further about the situation which he says has slowed down national development, Obasanjo expressed worry over the management of the population of the nation.\n\nREAD ALSO: Niger Delta Avengers\u2019 Sabre-Rattling Rather Unnecessary, Says Buhari\n\nHe said \u201cWe have moved from 120 million to over 200 million.

If we do not start getting it right now, we will not get it right by the year 2050.\u201d\n\nArguing that the population could either be an asset or a liability, the elder statesman noted that if the nation does not make adequate preparations then the country will pay for its over-population both now and in the future.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is education about population management. Some people don\u2019t like saying family planning, but whatever you do, you must manage your population to the benefit of all that is living within your nation,\u201d Obasanjo stated.\n\nWhile fielding questions from the students on mentorship, the former president highlighted service to the fatherland, integrity, loyalty, and good moral standing as some of the virtues that could sustain them in their varied career paths.",

          "text": "President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the threat issued by the Niger Delta Avengers on Saturday is rather unnecessary.\n\nThe special adviser to the president on media and publicity, Mr. Femi Adesina, in a statement, quoted Buhari as saying that all issues raised by the group were already responded to when the president met with the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress (INC), at the presidential villa on Thursday.\n\nMr. Adesina said when the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress visited the president, issues such as the call for restructuring and the inauguration of a board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) were addressed.\n\nHe quotes the president saying \u201cI am equally concerned about the rate of environmental degradation in the niger delta and as you are aware the hydrocarbon pollution remediation project has started work with remediation efforts in Ogoni land and I have directed the minister of environment to ensure that the projects are implemented with a high percentage of local content and inclusion of the surrounding communities\u201d\n\nThe militant group, in a statement on Saturday, had announced the launch of \u2018operation humble\u2019, a new mission to resume attacks in the oil-rich region.\n\nThey said the south-south remains the most underdeveloped region in the country, with their needs and interests \u201cundermined by the failed Nigerian State\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: How FG Will Tax Profits Made By Global Tech Giants In Nigeria \u2013 Osinbajo\n\nBelow is a statement from the President on Sunday signed by his media aide, Femi Adesina.\n\n\u201cThe media was on Sunday awash with threats and demands by the group to embark on economic sabotage through the bombing of critical oil and gas installations unless certain demands, including the development of the Niger Delta, and restructuring of the Federation, were met.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is, however, curious that the threat was coming less than 48 hours after President Muhammadu Buhari met with the leadership of the Niger Delta and Ijaw National Congress (INC), at the Presidential Villa, and the germane issues had been responded to, especially call for restructuring of the Federation, and the inauguration of a Board for the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC).\u201d\n\n\u201cFor clarity and record purposes, below is the full text of the speech by President Buhari on Friday, June 25, 2021, which renders any saber-rattling rather unnecessary:\n\n\u201cI warmly welcome all the Elders of the Niger Delta and particularly the National Executive of the Ijaw National Congress, under the leadership of Professor Benjamin Okaba. I thank you for paying this courtesy visit not too long after your election in April, and swearing-in last May.\u201d\n\n\u201cI also want to congratulate you all for your election and to add that a lot of responsibility is placed on your shoulders, especially coming from the fact that the Ijaw National Congress was almost without leadership for some time.\n\n\u201cAs the symbol of the collective voice of the Ijaw people, which is one of Nigeria\u2019s main ethnic groups, the existence of a focused and people-oriented leadership would go a long way in articulating the demands of the Ijaw people and making sure these demands are made part of the national discourse.\n\n\u201cI particularly note your ten-point demand to the Federal Government in your inaugural speech and assure you that this administration is frontally addressing them.\n\n\u201cI am equally concerned about the rate of environmental degradation in the Niger Delta and as you are aware the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project has started work with remediation efforts in Ogoni land and I have directed the Minister of Environment to ensure that the projects are implemented with a high percentage of local content and inclusion of the surrounding communities.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency, under the same ministry of Environment is working to make sure that oil spills are reduced and new ones prevented. As you are also aware, all the responsible agencies of government have been directed to ensure that they enforce compliance by the International Oil Companies to international best practices.\n\n\u201cIn addressing your call for immediate restructuring, the National Assembly whose responsibility it is to ensure that our constitution responds to the call for a restructured Nigeria has already concluded regional consultations and as soon as they finalise the process, necessary action would not be delayed on my part.\n\n\u201cIn the same vein, your call for the creation of two additional states and more local government areas for the Ijaw people is a legislative matter, which should naturally be handled by the National Assembly and seeking concurrence at the state levels.\n\n\u201cI completely agree with your call to allocate operational licenses for marginal fields to Ijaw people. However, as you know, the process of granting licenses is guided by laid-down rules and regulations, most of which even favour local content and local contractors. I see no reason why they should not be granted such licenses if they qualify.\n\n\u201cOn the issue of fair and balanced appointments to reflect federal character principles, I re-affirm that this has always been my focus and would continue to be because I have always seen Nigeria as a country where everyone should be given equal opportunities.\n\n\u201cA contentious issue that has been a subject of discourse amongst the Ijaw people of recent has been the need for the Niger Delta Development Commission to live up to its billing by delivering the required succour to the people of the region. Based on the mismanagement that had previously be-devilled the NDDC, a forensic audit was set up and the result is expected by the end of July 2021.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you that as soon as the forensic audit report is submitted and accepted, the NDDC Board would be inaugurated. However, I would like to implore you that the Ijaw National Congress should play a more active role in making sure that the mismanagement that occurred in the past is not repeated.\n\n\u201cI am particularly happy to note your call for promoting ownership of modular refineries by the Ijaw people and I will urge you to interphase with your sons who are involved in the processes of establishing these refineries, especially the Honourable Minister of State Petroleum Resources to actualize this quest.\n\n\u201cLike you well know, completion of the East-West Road is top on my infrastructure agenda and I will look to its speedy conclusion. Again, the occasional disturbance by youths in some communities along the route to construction work would require your close attention and guidance.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, we have made considerable progress with the construction of the Bonny to Port Harcourt Bridge.\n\n\u201cI am very happy with the recent affirmation of your belief in a United Nigeria and while I thank you for standing with me, I will also implore you to use your leverage in making sure that we keep working together to keep this country a united, indivisible entity, so that we can tackle our problems together and overcome our challenges together.\n\n\u201cI would like now to commend Professor Okaba for your emphasis on supporting the fight against insecurity by developing internal control mechanisms as well as working with other institutions in the country to address our current security challenges.\n\n\u201cWhile I thank you once more for this visit and I will continue to count on your support as we work towards resolving our current challenges.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria is set to utilise its legal provisions that empower the Federal Government to collect taxes on profits made in the country by global technology and digital firms not based in the country, but with a significant economic presence here.\n\nVice President Yemi Osinbajo, (SAN) made this known on Friday, while interacting with a delegation of the Chartered Institute of Taxation of Nigeria (CITN), led by its President, Mr Adesina Adedayo who visited him at the Presidential Villa.\n\nWhile noting that the Federal Government will not be raising tax rates at this time, based on the Finance Act 2019, the Vice President said it is already empowered to widen the tax net, including through the collection of taxes on the Nigerian income of global tech giants with significant economic presence here, even if they have not established an office or permanent establishment and are currently not paying taxes in Nigeria.\n\nIn this regard, Section 4 of the Finance Act 2019, provides that \u201cthe Minister (Finance) may by order (of the President) determine what constitutes the significant economic presence of a company other than a Nigerian company,\u201d the VP said.\n\nRead Also: Twitter Gave IPOB Platform To Promote Violence, Lai Mohammed Tells Reps\n\nAccording to Prof. Osinbajo, \u201cwe have had severe economic downturns which of course implies that we may not be able to collect taxes with the aggressiveness that would ordinarily be expected.\n\n\u201cI think the most important thing is that we must widen our tax net so that more people who are eligible to pay tax are paying. Several efforts have been made, and I am sure you are aware of the initiatives including the Voluntary Assets and Income Declaration Scheme (VAIDS) which was also an attempt to bring more people into the tax net, including those who have foreign assets.\u201d\n\nContinuing, the VP said: \u201cwe have also recently taken a step with respect to a lot of the technology companies that are not represented here but who do huge volumes of business here.\n\n\u201cThe Finance Act has shown that we are very prepared to ensure that these big technology companies do not escape without paying their fair share of taxation in Nigeria. Many of them do incredible volumes here in Nigeria and in several other parts of the region.\n\n\u201cWe have drawn up the regulations and we are prepared to go, and I think that we are at least in a good place to tap into some of the tax resources we can get from some of these companies.\u201d\n\nIndeed, besides the FG, a recent Bloomberg news article reported that \u201cgovernments around the world are grappling with how to modernize their legal frameworks to account for the global reach of the digital economy, reshaping how policymakers think about issues as varied as monopoly power, taxation and workers\u2019 rights.\u201d\n\nAlso, international talks are currently ongoing in Paris on global standard rules for governments to receive taxes from such digital and technology firms with significant economic presence in foreign countries.\n\nIn Nigeria, according to the Finance Act 2019, a company will pay taxes if it \u201ctransmits, emits or receives signals, sounds, messages, images or data of any kind by cable, radio, electromagnetic systems, or any other electronic or wireless apparatus to Nigeria in respect of any activity, including electronic commerce, application store, high-frequency trading, electronic data storage, online adverts, participative network platform, online payments and so on, to the extent that the company has significant economic presence in Nigeria and profit can be attributable to such activity.\n\n\u201cIf the trade or business comprises the furnishing of technical, management, consultancy or professional services outside of Nigeria to a person resident in Nigeria to the extent that the company has significant economic presence in Nigeria\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, Prof. Osinbajo noted that while the Federal Government has no plans to raise taxes now, there are those who argue that \u201cour tax rates are too low, comparing us to other places in the region where the rates are much higher.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we have had to balance all of these issues because clearly, higher tax rates can be a disincentive to businesses and investments. In terms of domestic resource mobilization, we are trying to do the best we can, given the present circumstances and I believe that there is room for improvement.\u201d\n\nActually, under the Finance Act 2019, the Buhari administration has reduced taxes for small companies \u2013 companies with less than N25 million in annual turnover are charged Zero Company Income Tax, CIT. Also CIT for companies with revenues between N25 and N100m (described in the Act as \u201cmedium-sized\u201d companies) has been reduced from 30% to 20%. Besides, Nigerians making minimum wage income are not to pay tax at all.\n\nUnder the 2020 Finance Act there is also an exemption of small companies from payment of education tax under the Tertiary Education Trust fund (TETFUND)-meaning companies with less than N25m turnover are eligible\n\nSimilarly, there is a 50% per cent reduction in minimum tax; from 0.5 per cent to 0.25 per cent for gross turnover for financial years ending between January 1st, 2020 and December 31st, 2021\n\nWelcoming the delegation, the Vice President emphasized the need for regular interaction between the council and government to address issues bothering on tax legislation, noting that \u201cthere is need for continuous engagement with the National Assembly because engagement with government cannot be a one-off thing.\u201d\n\nProf. Osinbajo added that the Federal Government has over the past few years, initiated programmes aimed at improving the growth of small businesses including the formalization of many of them. Under the Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP), there is a formalization of 250,000 businesses.\n\nHe said the ongoing MSME Week has encouraged many businesses to register with regulatory authorities in order for them to benefit from the numerous programmes earmarked by the government for their growth.\n\nIn his remarks, the President of the CITN, Mr Adesina Adedayo, commended the leadership of the Vice President in the implementation of key government interventions in the economy, stating that \u201cwe acknowledge your great zeal and commitment to Nigeria project.\u201d\n\nHe said the visit became necessary given the enormous work the Buhari administration has done towards addressing the huge fiscal challenges in the polity, public financing reforms, and sustained efforts towards addressing infrastructural deficit across the country.\n\nRead Also: Falana Faults FG, Says Decision To Meet With Twitter Should Have Come Earlier\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian Economic Sustainability Plan (NESP) and other measures implemented was a right response to the challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemic and were largely instrumental to creating buffers for the government at all levels in withstanding the pressures and waves created during the peak period and the aftermath of COVID-19,\u201d Adebayo said.\n\n\u201cIt is important that we sustain measures already being implemented to improve tax collection at all levels.\u201d\n\nOther members of the delegation included the Vice President of the Institute, Barrister Samuel Olushola Agbeluyi, past Presidents of the institute, Dame Gladys Simplice, and Dr. James Naiyeju, and Council members Prof. Muhammad Mainoma and Hon. Babangida Ibrahim. Mr. Adefisayo Awogbade, CITN Registrar/Chief Executive was also in attendance.",

          "title": "SERAP Asks African Commission To Order FG, NASS To Withdraw Bills To Gag Media",
          "text": "The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has asked the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights in Banjul, The Gambia, to \u201cissue provisional measures to urgently stop the Nigerian government and National Assembly from supporting and pushing through two bills to gag the media, and impose arbitrary and harsh punishment on journalists, broadcast stations, media houses and media practitioners in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, SERAP said: \u201cthe complaint, addressed to the Chairperson of the Commission Mr Solomon Ayele Dersso, and Commissioner and Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and Access to Information in Africa, Ms Jamesina Essie L. King, is brought pursuant to Articles 55 and 56 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights and Rule 100 of the Rules of Procedure of the African Commission.\u201d\n\nThe complaint followed the move to push through two repressive bills to amend the National Broadcasting Act, and to amend the Nigeria Press Council Act. The bills are reportedly sponsored by Chairman, House Committee on Information, Mr Segun Odebunmi (PDP, Oyo State).\n\nDated June 26, 2021, and signed by its Deputy Director Kolawole Oluwadare, SERAP said: \u201cThe push by the Nigerian government and the National Assembly to support and pass the two anti-media bills is unlawful, as passing the bills would be contrary to the country\u2019s obligations to respect, protect, promote and fulfill the right to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom under articles 1 and 9 of the African Charter.\u201d\n\nAccording to the rights group, \u201cthese anti-media bills are the latest threats to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom in the country. The bills are not in keeping with the provisions of the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression in Africa, which supplements articles 1 and 9 of the African Charter.\u201d\n\nSERAP said: \u201cthe Commission has the power to request Provisional Measures from the Nigerian government and National Assembly under Rule 100 of the Rules of Procedure to prevent irreparable harm and threats to human rights including freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom as urgently as the situation demands.\u201d\n\nThe complaint, read in part: \u201cThe bills include retrogressive provisions that threaten human rights, including freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom, and could criminalize reporting and give the government overly broad powers and oversight over journalists, broadcast stations, media houses and media practitioners.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf passed into laws, the bills would be used by those in power to intimidate and harass their critics, and to stifle freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom. The bills would have a chilling effect on the media thereby inducing some measure of self-censorship.\u201d\n\n\u201cMedia freedom, which is an aspect of the right to freedom of expression, is now generally recognised as an indispensable element of democracy. The mass media promotes the free flow of information, which enables citizens to participate in a meaningful and informed manner in the democratic process.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe actions by the Nigerian government and National Assembly are contrary to Articles 1 and 9 of the African Charter, and have thereby violated Nigeria\u2019s positive obligation under Article 1 to recognise the rights, duties and freedoms and to adopt legislative or other measures to give effect to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSERAP regularly relies on the media to carry out its mandate in the promotion of transparency and accountability and respect for socio-economic rights of Nigerians.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government and National Assembly are directly responsible for pushing the bills that would gag the media and impose harsh punishment on journalists, broadcast stations, media houses and media practitioners in the country, action in violation of the African Charter, and therefore also in violation of Article 1 of the Charter.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerians, broadcast stations, media houses and media practitioners in the country face a real and immediate risk of violation of their rights to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom if the anti-media bills are not urgently withdrawn.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nigerian government and National Assembly have failed to produce any evidence that the two bills are necessary or lawful, and in the absence of such, SERAP asks the Commission to order the immediate withdrawal of the bills by Nigerian authorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe media also serves as a watchdog by scrutinising and criticising public officials over the way they manage public affairs and public resources. In the performance of these functions, the media\u2019s debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust and wide-open. Speech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression; it is the essence of self-government.\u201d\n\n\u201cA free press is the lifeblood of a healthy democracy, one in which journalists are both benefactors and beneficiaries of human rights and carrying out their professional duties to inform their communities and enable democratic participation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndividual journalists cannot do their jobs if the institution of the press is compromised or if the legal protections for that institution are subject to approvals by political authorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe exhaustion of domestic remedies requirements set out in Article 56(5) of the African Charter has been met. There are no effective or sufficient local remedies available to the Complainant.\u201d\n\n\u201cNigerian courts do not entertain cases on the legality of anti-media and anti-human rights bills. Also, one of the lawmakers pushing the bills Mr Odebunmi Olusegun has reportedly boasted that \u2018No court will stop us from passing the bills. Requiring SERAP to exhaust domestic remedies in such circumstances would be a mockery of justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the bills, the National Broadcasting Commission can shut down TV and radio stations \u201cin the public interest\u201d and the press code must be approved by the Minister of Information. The overly broad definition of public interest opens the door for the Nigerian government to crackdown on freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bills would also allow the Nigerian government to jail journalists, fine newspapers up to N10m naira ($20,000) or close them for up to a year if they publish \u201cfake\u201d news. Under the bills, journalists could be held liable for the offence committed by their organisations and can be made to pay heavy fines.\u201d\n\nSERAP, therefore, urged the commission to request the following provisional measures from the Nigerian government and the National Assembly:\n\n1.Immediately withdraw the oppressive bills to gag the media. The first is the bill to amend the National Broadcasting Act, and the second, is the bill to amend the Nigeria Press Council Act.\n\n2.Immediately end harassment and intimidation of journalists, broadcast stations, media houses and media practitioners in Nigeria, and to respect the rights to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom, Unless the African Commission urgently intervenes in this case, there is a risk of irreversible denial of the Complainant\u2019s and Nigerians\u2019 rights, which in turn will render nugatory the resolutions and declarations by the African Commission on freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom.\n\n3.Give assurances that they will not support and pass the anti-media bills being pushed by Nigerian authorities. The Nigerian authorities should also give assurances that they will fully implement the resolutions and declarations on freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom in the country.\n\n4.Undertake a prompt review of Nigerian legal framework and administrative practices on freedom of expression, access to information, and media freedom to ensure their consistency and compatibility with the African Charter, and resolutions and declarations by the African Commission. Pending this, the Nigerian government should take concrete steps to respect, protect, promote and fulfil the rights to freedom of expression, access to information and media freedom, and ensure that journalists and media practitioners are able to carry out their work freely, without any intimidation and harassment.",

          "text": "Governor of Edo State,Godwin Obaseki, has revealed plans to speed up the construction of the much-anticipated Edo Museum of West African Art (EMOWAA).\n\nThe Governor announced that construction of an early-phase facility called the EMOWAA Pavilion will begin before the end of the year during a retreat organized by the National Commission for Museums and Monuments in Benin City.\n\nThe establishment of this first facility within the bigger museum complex of buildings and gardens will allow EMOWAA to keep up with an international movement for the return of Benin artefacts and the restoration of the Kingdom of Benin\u2019s cultural legacy.\n\nGovernor Obaseki unveiled the initial Pavilion designs, which were created by internationally renowned architect Sir David Adjaye, in a joint announcement with the Nigerian National Commission for Museums and Monuments and the Legacy Restoration Trust (LRT), (the independent, non-profit organization charged with building and managing the museum).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his presentation, the Governor highlighted features of the EMOWAA Pavilion such as secure, state-of-the-art facilities for functions including conservation, study, exhibition, and public programming, as historic artworks of the Kingdom of Benin are restituted from the institutions where they are now held across the world.\n\nGovernor Obaseki also announced that the EMOWAA Pavilion, and the museum complex as a whole, will be situated within an emerging Benin City Cultural District, as part of a wider Benin City Masterplan that has been commissioned by the state.\n\nAccording to the him, \u201cThe integration of EMOWAA into the daily life of our people, and its impact on a greatly improved urban fabric, will begin with the opening of the EMOWAA Pavilion. In his well-thought-out design, Sir David Adjaye has served all the requirements of the still-developing Museum and at the same time created a place that will welcome and embrace all members of the public.\n\n\u201cThe EMOWAA Pavilion will be an important and integral part of the EMOWAA complex, which will be situated in what was the heart of the historic Royal Palace grounds in Benin City before the British Invasion in 1897.\u201d\n\nIn his reaction to the newly unveiled development, the Director General of the Nigerian National Commission for Museums and Monuments, Professor Abba Isa Tijani, said, \u201cThe ever-increasing pace of agreements to restitute the cultural heritage of the Kingdom of Benin, and the cooperation now being extended to Nigeria by institutions in Europe and North America, have encouraged us to begin creating EMOWAA with this important first phase of construction. The Federal Government of Nigeria is committed to EMOWAA and the Legacy Restoration Trust as a transparent, innovative way of attracting investment into the arts and culture infrastructure in Nigeria. As revealed in Sir David Adjaye\u2019s magnificently sensitive and dignified plans, the EMOWAA Pavilion will enable the museum to begin fulfilling its mission as needed, in the very near future.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhillip Ihenacho, Chair of the Board of Trustees of Legacy Restoration Trust, expressed his gratitude to renowned architect, Sir David Adjaye for envisioning a first-phase facility that is complete in every way and at the same time is achievable on the organisations\u2019 timetable. He emphasised that \u201cthe EMOWAA will be ready to provide a secure, environmentally controlled facility for artworks and artifacts by the end of next year.\u201d\n\nThe EMOWAA Pavilion, according to Ihenacho, was designed as a highly sustainable, efficient single-story building made mostly of locally produced rammed earth.\n\n\u201cThe EMOWAA Pavilion will house an exhibition gallery with views into the secure, climate-conditioned storage and collection study area, an auditorium with seating for 180 persons, conference rooms, conservation laboratories, and a library. The landscaped grounds outside the building will include an informal public gathering place and a museum facility for outdoor programs\u201d, he concluded.\n\nIn the near term, the EMOWAA Pavilion will provide a state-of-the-art secure facility for restituted objects and archaeological finds, a project center for the archaeological work currently in progress on and around the EMOWAA site in Benin City, laboratories for studying artifacts unearthed during the archaeological excavations, a visitor center for engaging the local community and stakeholders, and interim offices for EMOWAA staff.\n\nAfter EMOWAA is completed, the Pavilion will serve as a basis for continuous archaeological research, a training hub for archaeology, conservation, heritage studies, and museology, as well as a storage and conservation facility for EMOWAA\u2019s artefacts.",

However, as you know, the process of granting licences is guided by laid down rules and regulations, most of which even favour local content and local contractors. I see no reason why they should not be granted such licences if they qualify,\u201d Adesina quoted Buhari as saying.\n\nOn the issue of fair and balanced appointments to reflect federal character principles, Buhari was said to have re-affirmed that this had always been his focus and would continue to be because he had always seen Nigeria as a country where everyone should be given equal opportunities.\n\nThe president, according to Adesina, had also promised that as soon as the forensic audit report of the NDDC was submitted and accepted, the NDDC board would be inaugurated.\n\nIbrahim Shuaibu in Kano, Laleye Dipo in Minna, Daji Sani in Yola and Igbawase Ukumba in Lafia",

          "title": "Why Grazing Routes Are Difficult to Recover in Nigeria: Report",
          "text": "The efforts by President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s administration to reclaim old grazing routes for herdsmen may be hampered by the building of roads, hospitals, schools and other public utilities on the ways carved out for feeding cattle in the 1950s, THISDAY investigation has revealed.\n\nContrary to the clamour for an end to open grazing and the need to adopt modern ranching techniques to curb incessant clashes with farmers, Buhari has insisted that the federal government will reclaim the old grazing routes for free movement of herders.\n\nHowever, THISDAY\u2019s investigation has revealed that the grazing routes have been taken over, over the years, by modern facilities built for the public good.\n\nIn Kano State, the state government has acknowledged that the grazing routes have been taken over by public infrastructure, including schools.\n\nFollowing this development, the state Governor, Dr. Abdullahi Ganduje, has set up a Rural Grazing Area that is popularly known as (RUGA), as part of his government\u2019s efforts to secure alternative grazing areas and accommodation for herdsmen.\n\nGanduje\u2019s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Abba Anwar, told THISDAY at the weekend that the RUGA in Kano has become the first cattle herders\u2019 settlement in the country, where the nomads are to be accommodated for expansive grazing of their flock.\n\nHe stated that the first phase of 25 housing units out of the projected 200, situated on 4,413 hectares of land at Dansoshiya Forest in Kiru Council Area of the state has been delivered by the state government.\n\nAnwar added that work is in progress on phase two and phase three of the project.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that at Falgore forest in Tudun Wada Local Government Area, the remnants of the cattle routes have been lost due to the infiltration of bandits and their attendant negative activities.\n\nGanduje, however, has urged herders to stop open grazing and return to the state, saying there is now modern grazing of animals going on at Dansoshiya Forest.\n\nHe said the investments made by his administration in grazing areas would curb the recurring clashes between herders and farmers.\n\nThe governor added that fodder seeds, which will be cultivated at Dudduru in Ajingi Local Government Area will be planted at Dansoshiya Forest to provide feeds for cattle and other small ruminants.\n\nAlthough Niger State has 11 grazing routes, covering about 1,865 kilometres, 1,368 kilometres of these routes are primary routes while the remaining 496 kilometres are secondary routes.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the Magama to Rijau route is an international route linking the country with the Benin Republic from Borgu Local Government Area of the state.\n\nBut the Permanent Secretary in the state Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development, Dr. Jonathan Wasa, told THISDAY in an interview that all the routes have been encroached upon by major highways, private developers, including small-scale industries.\n\nAccording to him, with the advent of development, cattle now share the major highways with motorists.\n\nHe stated that the state does not have the resources to reclaim the routes taken over by highways and other infrastructure.\n\nWasa said due to the encroachment on the grazing routes, the major focus of the state government is to organise nomads and others into groups and settle them in grazing reserves as being done in other parts of the world.\n\nHe stated that there are the Bobi grazing reserves, which span over 36,000 hectares located in Mariga and Magama local government areas.\n\nIn addition, the state government has also designated seven other reserves. These include: Audi Kanchi in Lavun LGA, Sheyi in Shiroro LGA, Garin- Gabas in Rafi LGA, Gabi in Lapai Ndadokun and Kpotun Woro in Agaie LGA and Iri in Rijau LGA.\n\n\u201cWe are advocates of ranching but it has to be done gradually; it cannot be done abruptly,\u201d Wasa added.\n\nIn Adamawa State, the Permanent Secretary of the State Ministry for Livestock Production, Alhaji Abdulrahman Tukur, told THISDAY that the state government had set up a committee to address the frequent clashes between farmers and herders.\n\nHe said the committee had submitted its report to the state government in which is recommended, among others, that the state government should reclaim the grazing reserves for the settlement of herdsmen and stop their movements.\n\nTukur said the old grazing routes had been taken over by schools, primary healthcare centres, roads, petrol stations and other facilities, which will not allow for movement of cattle.\n\nHe said the ministry had earlier before the wet season set up a committee for each of the 30 grazing reserves gazetted and identified in the map of the state to sensitise stakeholders on the plan to reclaim the grazing reserves to settle the herders.\n\nHe explained: \u201cThe committees are working with already list of encroachers on the grazing reserves and discussions are in top gear to reclaim these grazing reserves.\n\n\u201cThose farmers that are farming on the grazing reserves; we allow them to continue farming temporarily but when they do their harvest, they would allow the herders\u2019 cattle to feed on the residues of their crops until we make the condition better for herders and stop them from movement.\u201d\n\nIn Nasarawa State, THISDAY gathered that the state government has donated all the seven grazing reserves located at Awe, Keana, Doma, Assakio, Konva, Gitata and Kurudu to the federal government for the National Livestock Transformation Programme (NLTP), as part of the efforts to stop the free movement of cattle.\n\nThe Commissioner for Agriculture and Water Resources, Prof. Alanana Otaki, told THISDAY that the state government has succeeded in claiming all gazetted cattle grazing reserves in the state without hitches.\n\nThe Sokoto State Government has also reclaimed the grazing reserves to settle herdsmen.\n\nIn a telephone interview with THISDAY, the Commissioner for Careers and Security matters, Col. Garba Moyi (rtd), said the reserves were inside the forests.\n\n\u201cFor us in Sokoto, the policy is not new to us. I could recall when I was a local government chairman some years ago, I introduced the policy which was also adopted by other local governments in the state,\u201d he said.\n\nMoyi added:\u201d \u201cMost of these grazing reserves are in the bush and we directed the Fulani to graze on any crop planted on them.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Zamfara State Government stated that it would use the grazing reserves to resettle the herders, being the worst hit by the clashes between herders and farmers.\n\nThe Special Adviser on Media and Public Enlightenment to the Governor, Mr. Zalaini Bappa, said even some former governors who trespassed on the grazing reserves returned the land.\n\nAccording to him, the state government has also started building Ruga for the Fulani in order to prevent clashes between herders and farmers.",

          "title": "Nigeria: Petrol Subsidy Bites Harder, NNPC Proposes $280m Deduction in June",
          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s three tiers of government may have to look elsewhere to augment revenues accruing monthly from the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) is set to make another N114.2 billion (about $280m) deduction from oil revenues in June to pay for petrol subsidy.\n\nA document obtained by THISDAY from the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, detailing the NNPC\u2019s presentation to the committee, which took place between June 22 and 23, indicated that as earlier reported, the corporation, which has continued to shoulder the payment of what it calls under-recovery, deducted N126.2 billion from FAAC for May.\n\nWhat the NNPC has termed under-recovery is the difference between the actual market rate of petrol and the price at which the commodity is sold at the pump, which the federation bears in order to keep the pump price stable at N162 per litre.\n\nHowever, whereas it made zero contribution to the Federation Account in April, which was shared in May, the national oil company managed to remit about N29 billion from its finances to the joint account in May cycle, which was distributed among the three tiers last week.\n\nFor January to May\u2019s funding performance, the data showed that under-recovery or subsidy claims deducted from oil revenues by the NNPC amounted to N25.374 billion in February, N60.396 billion in March and N61.966 billion in April. But it rose astronomically to N126.298 billion in May before falling to N114 billion in June.\n\nThese implied that the deduction by the NNPC more than quadrupled from the N25.374 billion in February to N114 billion in June.\n\nThis development has justified the clamour for the full deregulation of the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry to allow market forces to determine the price of petrol.\n\nHowever, the NNPC remitted a marginal net sum of N29.647 to FAAC in May, which was shared in June, as opposed to its zero contribution in April, its N90.860 billion in January, N64.161 billion in February and N41.184 billion in March.\n\nTo date, according to the document, the NNPC has been able to contribute a net sum of N225.852 billion to the federation for the year, out of its yearly projected remittance of N1.473 trillion and monthly value addition of N122.7 billion, leaving a variance of N820.684 billion.\n\nThe presentation, signed by Mr. Bello Abdullahi, on behalf of the NNPC\u2019s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Mr. Umar Ajiya, showed that the N50 billion, which is part of the corporation\u2019s financial obligations to its Joint Venture (JV) partners, meant to have been subtracted from the latest round of deductions remains pending.\n\nGross revenue from JV crude, gas and other receipts for May was N320.314 billion, less royalty of N58.3 billion, JV cost recovery of N124 billion, Profit Before Tax (PBT) of N104.4 billion, to yield a profit after-tax value of N33.26 billion.\n\nThe document showed that for April, crude oil and gas sales and receipts, available in May and shared in June, the volume of export crude oil stood at 2.78 million barrels with a monetary value of $181.191 million and equivalent of N69.360 billion, while domestic crude oil due in July was 6.63 million barrels and sold at $434.8 million. Added to export crude oil, the revenue generated was $616.037 million.\n\nNLNG feedstock gas was 27.605 MBTU valued at $38.5 million or about N16.011 billion while the total oil and gas sales stood at $654.601 million or roughly N85.3 billion, according to the corporation.\n\nIn May, export crude oil receipt was $167.7 million, about N64.2 billion, NLNG feedstock gas amounted to $34.31 million, the equivalent of N13.17 billion, while the gas company\u2019s paid arrears stood at N623.4 million, to hit a total of N77.96 billion for the receipt from oil and gas for the month.\n\nAll the transactions were hinged on N382.80 to one dollar exchange rate as advised by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), according to the national oil company.\n\nThe report said: \u201cThe sum of N126,298,457,944.36 was deducted as value shortfall resulting from the difference between the landing cost and ex-coastal price of PMS (petrol) recorded in April 2021.\n\n\u201cIn addition, May value shortfall of N114,337,097,352.49 is to be deducted from June federation proceeds in July 2021 FAAC meeting. Also, the balance of March 2021 value shortfall of N50,000,000,000.00 remains outstanding.\u201d\n\nIt stated that the overall NNPC crude oil lifting of 9.42Mbbls (export and domestic crude) in April 2021 recorded 23.59 per cent increase relative to the 7.62MbbIs lifted in March, while Nigeria maintained 1.4 million bpd Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production cut in April 2021.\n\n\u201cCrude oil export revenue received in May 2021 amounted to $167.72 million, equivalent to N64.2 billion. Domestic gas receipts in the month were N2.9 billion. Feedstock valued at $38.56 million was sold to Nigeria LNG during the period, out of which $34.32 million was received during the month, the difference being Modified Carry Agreement (MCA) obligations, gas reconciliation and credit notes.\n\n\u201cThe sum of $16.53 million, being miscellaneous receipts, gas and ullage fees and interest income was received in May 2021,\u201d it stated.\n\nA total loss of 4.527 million barrels of crude was recorded during the month due to shut-ins, repairs, leaks, power outages as well as shutdowns due to protests as a result of non-payment of community workers\u2019 salaries in Batan station and Olomoro, Uzere and Kokori.\n\nOther issues resulting in shutdowns included seawater pump trips, technical issues like high gas to oil ratio or production deferment due to vessel swap.\n\nOf the government \u2018calendarised\u2019 priority projects worth $2.680 billion, given a $536 million monthly budget, the NNPC stated that it had so far funded the projects by $636.472 million from January to May.\n\nThe document showed an outstanding balance of $1.464 billion in JV cash call arrears to International Oil Companies (IOCs) as of May 31, with the NNPC having offset $3.22 billion from a total negotiated debt of $4.689 billion.\n\nThe national oil company told FAAC that it spent N2.263 billion on security and maintenance, N1.580 billion on pipeline and other facilities repairs as well as the payment of a \u201cstrategic holding\u201d of N304.183 million, totalling N4.148 billion in May.\n\nIn addition, it spent N4.412 billion on national domestic gas development, N3.91 billion on gas infrastructure development, N659 million on crude oil pre-export inspection agency expenses, N3.2 billion on frontier exploration services and N196 million on renewable energy development.\n\nBesides, the corporation said it expended N5 billion on export financing, N8.3 billion on the non-functional refineries and N83.3 billion on the ongoing Nigeria/Morocco pipeline.\n\nDepot price of fuel remained at N128, while 1.885 billion litres were imported and landing cost for the 35 import vessels that brought in fuel ranged from N185.17 to N199.90.\n\nLast week, NNPC told the nation that Nigeria now loses about 42 million litres of petrol to smuggling through the country\u2019s borders, increasing Nigeria\u2019s estimated daily consumption of 60 million litres to 103 million litres.\n\nWith the menace now gaining more momentum and illegal dealers more daring, the national oil company stated that the under-recovery or the subsidy that the government pays on the product every month has begun to hover between N140 billion to N150 billion.\n\nThe development has made the corporation unable to contribute to the national coffers, as the subsidy it pays has kept wiping out the little gains made from rising international oil prices, which has now exceeded $75 per barrel.\n\nSpeaking when he met with stakeholders, including the leadership of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Department of State Service (DSS), Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and chief executives of agencies in the petroleum ministry, Group Managing Director of the corporation, Mallam Mele Kyari, said smuggling had gone beyond what the NNPC could handle.\n\nHe stated that with the current exchange rate, the pump price of petrol should be N256 per litre, adding that if the NNPC was to sell at the going rate, and incorporating the current exchange rate, fuel would be selling for about N256 a litre.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "The U.S. military, under the direction of President Joe Biden, conducted airstrikes Sunday against what it said were \u201cfacilities used by Iran-backed militia groups\u201d near the border between Iraq and Syria.\n\nPentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said the militias were using the facilities to launch unmanned aerial vehicle attacks against U.S. troops in Iraq.\n\nKirby said the U.S. military targeted three operational and weapons storage facilities \u2014 two in Syria and one in Iraq.\n\nHe described the airstrikes as \u201cdefensive,\u201d saying they were launched in response to the attacks by Iran-backed groups.\n\n\u201cThe United States took necessary, appropriate, and deliberate action designed to limit the risk of escalation \u2014 but also to send a clear and unambiguous deterrent message,\u201d Kirby said.\n\nSunday\u2019s strikes mark the second time the Biden administration has taken military action in the region. In February, the U.S. launched airstrikes against facilities in Syria, near the Iraqi border, that it said were used by Iranian-backed militia groups.\n\nThe Pentagon said those strikes were retaliation for a rocket attack in Iraq in February that killed one civilian contractor and wounded a U.S. service member and other coalition troops.\n\nAt that time, Biden said Iran should view his decision to authorize U.S. airstrikes in Syria as a warning that it can expect consequences for its support of militia groups that threaten U.S. interests or personnel.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t act with impunity. Be careful,\u201d Biden said when a reporter asked what message he had intended to send.\n\nOn Sunday, Kirby said Biden \u201chas been clear that he will act to protect U.S. personnel. Given the ongoing series of attacks by Iran-backed groups targeting U.S. interests in Iraq, the President directed further military action to disrupt and deter such attacks.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon spokesman added: \u201cAs a matter of international law, the United States acted pursuant to its right of self-defense. The strikes were both necessary to address the threat and appropriately limited in scope.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Sunday that the U.S. airstrikes \u201cappear to be a targeted and proportional response to a serious and specific threat,\u201d adding, \u201cProtecting the military heroes who defend our freedoms is a sacred priority.\u201d",
