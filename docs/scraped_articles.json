It occurs when you inherit copies of the hemoglobin S gene from both parents. This forms hemoglobin known as Hb SS.\n\n\u201cThat is why people must have pre-marital testing and counselling before going into marriage or reproduction process.\n\n\u201cChildren are only at risk of sickle cell disorder if both parents carry sickle cell trait.\n\n\u201cA blood test called a hemoglobin electrophoresis can help to determine which type you might carry,\u201d he told NAN.\n\nHe attributed the increase in sickle cell cases to wrong diagnoses and called on laboratory management to do their best to correct past mistakes and ensure containment of the disorder.\n\nIzuchuwu advised that such tests should be conducted in more than one or two reputable health facilities to ascertain accurate and reliable results/information.\n\n\u201cTo get accurate information about one\u2019s genotype status, it is advisable to conduct the test more than one or two times and at different reputable health facilities irrespective of the costs.\n\n\u201cThis is because it will be more economical to have the accurate information about your genotype before marriage and marry the right compatible genotype partner than to reproduce SCD offspring and face the complications and financial burden associated with it.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, some people still ignorantly jump into marriage in the name of \u2018love\u2019 without due pre-marital tests or with information that both parties carry sickle cell trait,\u201d Izuchukwu said.\n\nAlso speaking, Mr. Abayomi Okunade, another laboratory scientist, called on the Federal Government to upgrade diagnostic facilities in public hospitals for improved performance and to contain SCD in the country.\n\nOkunade also appealed to the federal and state governments to donate equipment to private laboratories for enhanced diagnosis.\n\nHe said this was necessary to stem the incidence of the disorder because private laboratories received a greater number of clients for pre-marital testing and counseling.\n\n(NAN)",

I remain optimistic that humanity shall overcome the pandemic very soon.\n\n\u201cThe theme for this year\u2019s International Day of Yoga is \u201cYoga for Wellness\u2019\u2019, which is particularly relevant in the current context.\n\n\u201cYoga has many benefits for the body as well as for the mind. Despite all the efforts and precautions, COVID-19 may infect any person. However, a strong immune system can aid in the fight against it.\n\n\u201dYoga can help build that immunity, for instance, through breathing exercises that strengthen the lungs.\n\n\u201dAt the same time, across the world, millions of people have been forced to stay indoors for months.\n\n\u201dThis has taken a toll on their mental health as well. Regular practice of Yoga can also help them recover.\u201d\n\nAccording to the prime minister, Yoga has an inherent power to connect, saying Yoga is good for community, immunity and unity.\n\nHe observed that the theme of International Day of Yoga celebrations this year reflected the concern for the good health and wellbeing of people across the globe.\n\n\u201dIt is an endeavour to ensure that we focus on fitness as well as wellness.\n\n\u201cI wish to extend through your good offices, my deepest gratitude for the cooperation and efforts extended by one and all in making the International Day of Yoga celebrations a resounding success in your nation every year.\n\n\u201dI am sure that this year will be no different.\n\n\u201cPlease accept my best wishes to you, your family and your citizens, for good health and well-being,\u2019\u2019 he added.

          "title": "Okon and wild Rastafarian nabbed on Democracy Day",
          "text": "By Tatalo Alamu\n\nTo Opambata Police Station near Alapere where Baba Lekki was engaged in a battle of will and wits to free Okon and a feral Rastafarian calling himself Jah Jamaica over subversive activities on Democracy Day. The sparse demonstration ended in brisk dispersal and in tears and teargas as the police clinically steamrolled the protesters, forcing a few of them to sit on the wet grass.\n\nDemocracy Day began on a tense and uneasy note with police issuing stern orders to troublemakers to keep off the street. It was a strange way to celebrate democracy, with an ill-tempered law enforcement agency and threats of incarceration hanging ominously in the air. But then Oxymoron has become the nation\u2019s second name.\n\nThe tense truce held at first with the streets eerily deserted by the wise and the wary. Except for the foolhardy motorist, vehicular movement was almost zero. All of a sudden, hell was let loose around the Ogudu intersection. A stocky, wild-eyed man built like a Soviet-era tank and with humongous dreadlocks to match began screaming and pointing in the direction of the island.\n\n\u201cJah, Jah, dem alootin, dem aburning and dem law ashootin. No jesterin, no jesterin. Dem law fire dem gas and dem put Montego peppa for mon eye\u201d, he wailed as he rubbed his eyes.\n\n\u201cHa, orisirisi for this country. What happened, what happened?\u201d a woman asked excitedly from the safe balcony.\n\n\u201cJah, mon sista, dem policeman come use voodoo for man. I come fall and I com roll. As I come rise, me I come run for dem devil man\u201d, he chanted breathlessly as he ran headlong into the crowd of protesters that had materialized around Alapere where the police promptly impounded him. In Okon\u2019s case, he had lied to Mama Igosun that he was heading for Amukoko, where a woman was reputedly selling crocodile meat.\n\n\u201cBuy me some wild goat milk. But if na lie you dey tell you no go return alive\u201d, the old woman cursed at his heels. True enough, Okon was apprehended as an undesirable element loitering about a brothel with state subversion in mind. He was later brought in as a hostage to Alapere and made to sit on the wet grass like other confederates.\n\nAt the Opambata Police Station, Baba Lekki opened cautiously and without his usual legal razzmatazz. The bluff and genial desk sergeant hailed him as a great patriot who had done a lot for the country without asking for a penny.\n\n\u201cThank you. But the fellow you are detaining is not even a Nigerian\u201d, Baba Lekki noted.\n\n\u201cI know. So why is he here causing trouble? Is Jamaica better than Nigeria?\u201d the sergeant asked.\n\n\u201cI know, but injustice everywhere is injustice somewhere\u201d, Baba Lekki responded.\n\n\u201cBaba, you see if not for this your human rights nonsense, we will send this fool back to Jamaica floating on Ejinrin Lagoon\u201d, the sergeant shouted as he ordered Jah Jamaica and Okon to be brought out of the cell. Okon was giggling while the Rasta babbled insensate nonsense.\n\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d the sergeant demanded.\n\n\u201c Ishmael Teferi Ben-Gurion\u201d, the wild man responded poker-faced.\n\n\u201cIs that why you should be rioting in Lagos?\u201d the sergeant screamed.\n\n\u201cJah, Jah, officer be reasonable, how man go riotin for Lagos when I am alreading alootin for Ojota?\u201d the Rastafarian demanded.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cBaba, let me tell you this fool was caught on secret police tape speaking perfect Yoruba\u201d, the sergeant shouted. \u201cHis name is Yekinni Agbomabiwon.\u201d\n\n\u201cNgbo? O ti oo?\u201d Baba Lekki screamed. At this point, the Rasta leapt clean through the window and made good his escape.",

          "title": "Criminal herdsmen in Ibarapa aided by jobless indigenes \u2014 Igboho monarch",
          "text": "The Ona Onibode, Oba AbdulRasheed Adetoyese, is one of the three traditional rulers in Igboholand, Oke Ogun part of Oyo State. In this interview with GBENGA ADERANTI , Oba Adetoyese talks about his relationship with the other traditional rulers in the community, why attacks on the community by criminal herders have been frequent, the roles that monarchs should play in governance, his relationship with ethnic activist Sunday Igboho and why it is difficult to stop criminal activities in Oke-Ogun area.\n\nThe people of Oke Ogun appear to have suffered more than any other community in Oyo State as a result of attacks by criminal herders. What could be responsible for this?\n\nIn my area here in Oke Ogun 2, we have little problems. When I say Oke-Ogun 2, I am talking about the Saki axis of Oyo State. It is different in Oke-Ogun 1, which is Iseyin and Ibarapa areas. There are more herders there than here. But the herders here have been living with us from time immemorial.\n\nAlso, we have constituted a security committee, and Fulani people who have been living with us for a very long time are members of this committee. Any time they see new sets of herders coming into the community, they would inform the monarch of the town. This has helped us in keeping tabs on the new herders that are coming into Igboho. Also, the Old Oyo National Park is very close to us. There some criminal herders used to hide. But to the glory of God, it is impossible now for the criminal herders to hide because of the combined efforts of local hunters, Amotekun, vigilante and the police.\n\nThe army barracks at Saki also deters criminal herders from using the forest. So crime among herders is not pronounced in our area. We have little problem here, unlike other Ibarapa areas.\n\nWhat do you think the government can do to stop the problem of herdsmen attacking communities?\n\nI don\u2019t think you should limit the problems of insecurity to criminal herders alone. I would prefer we address the crimes being perpetrated by both herders and indigenes.\n\nSome of our sons are unemployed and they engage in one crime or the other. If the government gives local government autonomy, these problems will be reduced. At least, governance would be nearer to the people. It is sad that graduates do not have anything to do other than ride okada (commercial motorcycles). This set of people is tempted to commit crime or act as accessories to crime if tempted with money.\n\nIf there is local government autonomy, there will be jobs in the community. The law that established the local government should be re-examined and the government should pump more money into the local government.\n\nGovernment should also fund the local hunters in order to fight crimes. They are closer to the community and they know the terrains.\n\nUnfortunately, these criminals have continued to come with different tactics day in and day out.\n\nLook at Niger State; it used to be safe and peaceful, but not anymore. The increase in crime rate is not peculiar to any region in Nigeria. Everybody is feeling the pain of unemployment.\n\nThe crime rate would have been high in this part of Oke-Ogun if not for the security measure we put in place, though we still have pockets of crimes here and there, like herders going to destroy farms. But if you compare this with the way these criminals attack villages in the north, the difference is poles apart.\n\nCrime in Ibarapa is high because some of the indigenes are working in tandem with the criminal herders in perpetrating crimes in the area. Things are worse there because there is a forest in that axis that shares a border with the Benin Republic. The forest is the hideout for the criminals. Government needs to support the local hunters in fighting crime on that axis. If local hunters go there and invade the forest without the support of the government, it could be counterproductive. For example, those who arrested a suspected kidnapper, Wakili, and handed him over to the police were detained. Government needs to find a solution to insecurity. For the problem of Nigeria to be solved, we need a new constitution, not constitution amendment.\n\nIn all this, what role do you think traditional rulers should play?\n\nUnfortunately, the present political arrangement does not favour traditional rulers. The traditional institution is not part of governance. Traditional rulers are not part of political decision making. Yet traditional rulers are closer to the people. For example, here, in each of the local government areas, there are traditional council members. Each council has 15 members who are expected to be meeting periodically. Besides that, we have the ones for states too. But most of them are currently not meeting. Some governors do not even consult these traditional rulers on security matters.\n\nTraditional rulers do not have any role to play in the Nigerian constitution. In the olden days, monarchs were charged with ensuring peace in their communities. But now, the local government chairman is in charge. Even in electing or appointing these local government chairmen, the traditional rulers are not contacted. The traditional institution will address the problem of insecurity if the new constitution is made.\n\nThere are three traditional rulers in Igboho. How have you managed to avoid clashes?\n\nEach of the monarchs has his own domain. If something happens, we call ourselves to manage whatever happens in the wards.\n\nAlso, the government has created wards. In my domain, I have four wards. I have the largest quarters in the town. We are always in touch.\n\nWhen there is a conflict of interests, how do you resolve it?\n\nYes, we sometimes have conflict of interests, but what we have resolved is that whatever benefit is coming, is coming to Igboho and Igboho people are the ones that would benefit. It is one town under the umbrella of three kings. The government is aware that there are three kings in Igboho.\n\nMajority of the people are more familiar with Sunday Igboho than Sunday Adeyemo. What is the relationship between Sunday Igboho and the Igboho community?\n\nSunday Adeyemo is a native of Igboho. He had in many interviews explained that he grew up in Modakeke, Osun State and his father, while living in Modakeke, was known as Baba Igboho because he hailed from Igboho. Then people were calling him Sunday Omo Baba Igboho. Later, they removed the \u2018omo\u2019 and started addressing him as Sunday Igboho when his father left Modakeke and returned to Igboho. He is an Igboho son. His father and mother are from Igboho.\n\nNot all the Yoruba are in support of his crusade, especially his quest for an Oduduwa nation. If you were to advise him, what would you be telling him?\n\nYou should understand that something brought about the agitation. The killing of the Yoruba in Ibarapa area brought about the agitation. Even many people were in pain before his own agitation started. Many people felt these herders would not stop oppressing the natives to the extent that even when their cattle graze on the farms, if the farmer resisted, he would be arrested. And the police were helpless too. Many of the natives were displeased with this. That was the beginning of the agitation. Some who were displeased but could not do anything decided to support him.\n\nFor those who are against him, you should understand that not everybody would accept your cause. Some people who feel that a united Nigeria holds more benefits for them than a fragmented country would not support him. Probably in his own wisdom, he feels if Yoruba stands as a nation, it would be beneficial than being part of a united Nigeria.\n\nEven among the traditional rulers, there is no consensus.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTraditional rulers are suffering. Ideally, we are supposed to assist the populace. But it is not so. And that is why you see traditional rulers pandering to the wishes of politicians. Those who are advising Sunday Igboho to do this or that have reasons for doing so.\n\nTraditional rulers are now running away from tradition and some rites. Do you think this is healthy?\n\nYes, that is true. And there are many reasons for this. If you don\u2019t know the foundation of something, it will be a lot difficult for you to destroy it. If you check the history of Yoruba monarchs, you would see that the majority of them had short reigns. The reason was not far-flung. Most of these people who were privy to the traditional rites had the key to the lives of these monarchs, and they would do anything to terminate the reigns of such traditional rulers if they were displeased with them. But the present day monarchs are wiser. They avoid some of these rites in order not to be entangled. This is the more reason they run away from certain rites and they live longer. Monarchs are more careful now.",

          "text": "In the wake of reports of alleged herdsmen attacks in a Lagos community, KUNLE AKINRINADE visited the community and reports that it was a false alarm.\n\nNot a few Lagos residents felt disturbed a few days ago when a story filtered out that some herdsmen had invaded Odo-Egiri community in Eredo area of Epe Local Government, with widespread apprehension that the attack could spread to other parts of the state.\n\nIn the report published by a section of the media, it was said that farming activities in the community had stopped, following herdsmen\u2019s invasion of farmlands.\n\nThe herders were also said to have attacked farmers, forcing them to flee from the community.\n\nThe herdsmen, who were said to have migrated from Igangan in Oyo State, reportedly settled on the large expanse on Iganke farmland owned by the Ali Moibi-Balogun family and were already erecting their structures on the land.\n\nThe disturbing news followed a petition to the state government and police authorities by one Ali Moibi-Balogun family, which sought the intervention of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to reclaim the farmland from the herdsmen.\n\nIn the letter, dated May 10, 2021 and signed by its counsel, Adeyemi Adegbite, the family said that it resorted to the letter after the police station in Noforija in Epe had allegedly labelled the family members suspects after they complained that their farmland had been invaded by herdsmen and that they were already threatening to wreak more havoc within the community.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe hereby urge your Excellency to deploy your very good office to intervene in this matter, cause a very discreet investigation to be conducted, and ensure that our society is not turned into a lawless one where might is right and power can be hijacked by a few powerful and privileged individuals or group of individuals to the detriment of the common and law-abiding citizens.\u201d\n\nThe family explained further that they inherited a large expanse of land housing Iganke farmland from their forebears in accordance with Yoruba custom.\n\nThey noted that they had been exercising \u201crights of possession and ownership over the expanse of land without hindrance or challenge from any person, persons, or quarters whatsoever.\u201d\n\nHowever, when The Nation visited the community a few days after, residents explained that no herdsmen invaded the community or attacked anyone in it.\n\nRespondents, including community leaders, told our correspondent that the purported herdsmen invasion was nothing but scare tactics.\n\n\u201cWhen we heard that some herdsmen had invaded this community, a lot of people panicked, but I laughed when I heard the report during a newspaper review programme on the radio.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help but just laugh because there was nothing like that at all,\u201d said a community leader, Yusuf Afolabi.\n\nHe added: \u201cWhat really happened was that some of the people who are laying claim to a parcel of land in the community raised the alarm to dislodge the occupants of the land who had given a part of it to a cattle breeder operating a ranch on two plots of land.\n\n\u201cThe herder is a Yoruba man from Kwara State. He is not a Fulani and did not fight with anyone in this community and no one had any issues with him.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the allegation that herders dislodged from Igangan in Oyo State invaded our community and attacked farmers is nothing but fake.\n\n\u201cI am a farmer too and I have been going about my farming activities without herder confronting me.\u201d\n\nLike Afolabi, Muraina Abdullahi, a resident, said some land speculators contesting ownership of the said land were behind the report.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe man is Yoruba and not Fulani. The cattle were given to him by a community leader living outside this community to breed with agreed compensation with cattle.\n\n\u201cThe man is operating a ranch on two plots of land with his wife and children and never for once had issues with us. But some persons contesting ownership of the land with another family suddenly twisted the story to ensure that the Yoruba cattle breeder is chased away or evacuated from the land by security agents so they can take over the land.\n\n\u201cAsk other residents around, they will tell you the same thing I am telling you now. Or, better still, visit the man\u2019s ranch and hear from him directly.\n\nA farmer in the community, Akanbi Adewale, also described the report of herdsmen invasion and attacks as false.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a hoax by some land speculators to dislodge others from the land they are contesting with another family.\n\n\u201cI am a farmer and I have never been attacked by any roving herder, because there is none here.\n\n\u201cThe man they are labelling as Fulani herdsman is even a Yoruba cattle breeder who does not engage in grazing. Rather, he operates from a ranch he built on the land where he lives with his wife and children.\u201d\n\nThe cattle breeder, Saliu Imoru, his wife, and children were sighted by our correspondent on the land on which they built some thatched houses.\n\nImoru said: \u201cI am a native of Ilorin, not a Fulani. I am from Afon in Basa Local Government Area of Kwara State and did not come from Igangan.\n\n\u201cWe bought this land from a traditional ruler in Badoore.\n\n\u201cThere used to be another ranch in this area, but the owners have since left the community and I am the only one here now.\n\n\u201cI am duly registered as a cattle breeder in the state, and my documents are with authorities in Alausa, Ikeja.\n\n\u201cWe have been living in fear since we heard that some people claimed we are Fulani herdsmen. We usually run at the sight of strangers on this land.\u201d\n\nIt was said that policemen from both the Area Command at Elemooro and state police headquarters had visited the land for on-the-spot assessment of the situation.\n\nContacted, the police spokesman, Mr. Olumuyiwa Adejobi, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), said it was not true that herdsmen invaded or attacked the community and its residents.\n\nHe said: \u201dI have contacted the Divisional Police Officer(DPO) in charge of the division overseeing the area, and he said there was nothing like herdsmen attacks or invasion in the community.\n\n\u201cI think that some persons fighting over land matters are the ones behind the false alarm of herdsmen attack in the community.\u201d\n\nOdo-Egiri community described as untrue the report that Fulani herdsmen invaded the community, urging the state government to carry out a diligent investigation on the matter.\n\nIn a letter they wrote to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the community said there was no iota of truth in the media report that some Fulani herdsmen had attacked some residents on their farmlands.\n\nThe letter dated May 19, 2021, written on behalf of the community by their lawyer, Tunde Jinadu, reads in part: \u201dOn Thursday May 6, 2021, the Baale of the community (Odo-Egiri) got a report from two members of Ali Moibi Balogun Family that their family head told them that they saw a Fulani man with cows on their portion of the community land, and that he was already erecting structures on the land.\n\n\u201cThe Baale, being indisposed, directed one of the community chiefs to confirm the information from the family head.\n\n\u201cOn getting to the family head, he said they had resolved the matter with the family who were claiming their portion of land at Iganke.\n\n\u201cThe two chiefs got to the land and saw a man with his wife and children, a few cows settled on two plots of land and we\u2019re being fed on the same spot.\u201d\n\nThe community noted that the cattle breeder was subsequently invited to the Baale\u2019s palace and advised to vacate the land, or breed his cattle in open space or market in view of the insecurity pervading the country.\n\n\u201cSurprisingly, in the evening of the same day, the Baale saw different stories in the social media that Fulani herdsmen fleeing from Sunday Igboho had settled in Odo-Egiri community farmland at Iganke, causing mayhem and shooting sporadically at people in the community.\n\n\u201cWe strongly believe that there was no such shooting by herdsmen in the community or any persons at all.\n\n\u201cAn investigation would also reveal to your good office that there is no presence of Fulani herdsmen in Odo-Egiri community.\n\n\u201cThe claim by the Ali Moibi Balogun Family that their residence was attacked by herdsmen would be revealed by intelligent investigation as a lie in its entirety.\u201d\n\nThe letter added that the farmland in Odo-Egiri community belongs to the community with the supervision of the Baale and other accredited representatives of the cardinal families in Odo-Egiri, noting that \u201cthe community gives a portion of the farmlands to persons that want to cultivate farms on the land. However, there are respective portions that some families have been farming on and are recognised by the community, which was what led to the petition written by a family that was contesting ownership of the land with another family.\u201d",

          "title": "Charly Boy @ 71 Injustice in Nigeria stinks",
          "text": "By Oscar Nwogu\n\nCharles Chukwuemeka Oputa popularly known as Charly Boy is an enigma of some sort. As maverick as he is, he cannot stop pulling stunts here and there. On June 19, 2020, the ever-bubbly punk king celebrated his 70th birthday with little or no fanfare owing largely to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOne year after, the general feeling is that Charly Boy would mark his 71st birthday today, Saturday June 19. But the weird one has pulled his stunt again, defying all logic, as he vowed to mark another 70th birthday. According to him, he has commenced his backward aging process and would be celebrating his 69th birthday next year, as against marking 72.\n\nAsked why he prefers to count his age backward rather than upward, the musician, producer and activist says there is nothing to celebrate going forward. \u201cThe government in power has not done anything to put smiles on the faces of Nigerians. It is confusion, agitation, rape, killings, maiming, stagnation, nepotism, tribalism and clownishness everywhere. There is no hope for the common man. Since there is nothing to celebrate, I would rather remark my 70th birthday this year. Next year, I will mark 69, a process of aging backwards,\u201d he explained.\n\nHowever, Charly Boy will today celebrate his aging backward birthday with the launch of his EP titled, Odudubariba, which simply means a spiritual warrior. \u201cYes, it\u2019s again my second 70th birthday; next year, I will be 69, and henceforth will continue my backward aging. With the mood of the country and its people, we will keep the celebration simple and low-keyed. I am doing this for my fans and myself. What we are going through in Nigeria today is decades of inaction, docility and my thief better pass your thief mentality. We have been living on corruption money since the \u201860s.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t continue to live as one if we can\u2019t come to the table to resolve our differences. The injustice in Nigeria stinks, that\u2019s why many regions want to go their separate ways. From day one, the foundation of this country was faulty, a scam, and the constitution, fraudulent. We can\u2019t make progress with a faulty foundation. We have no choice but to reap what we have sowed over the years. It\u2019s unfortunate but that\u2019s the reality of our time,\u201d he said.\n\nAre we expecting fireworks, protests and all sort of razzmatazz from Charly Boy as he counts his age backward? His response: \u201cThe mood in the country doesn\u2019t call for any fireworks, say who die? It\u2019s time for deep, meaningful reflection about our dangerous predicament. I\u2019m not insensitive to the pain my people are passing through. I have retired from active street protest, which has not yielded much with the bunch of people in government today. Two years ago, I retired from active street protest after giving it my all for 45 years. I am not a professional protester. I have reviewed my strategy and I am deploying my frustrations through my music, hence my coming back to one of the powerful tools of resistance: music.\u201d\n\nThe Charly Boy brand means different things to different people. His alternative lifestyle and political views have brought in its wake a mix of bad admirers and haters. On the choice of his outrageous brand, the controversial musician says, \u201cI built this youthful brand to shock and awe ignorant, mongoparkish, analogue, outdated, stupid and idiotic Nigerians out of their potopoto mindset.\u201d\n\nAs president of the Performing Musicians Employers Association of Nigeria (PMAN) many years ago, Charly Boy did not only restore respect and dignity of the Nigerian musicians, he also fought piracy and ensured that artistes had a strong voice in the affairs of the industry. \u201cAs PMAN president, I fought for more respect for the Nigerian artiste, I fought for more money, fought for their intellectual property rights. Today, the Nigerian music and musicians are reaping the fruits of our struggles back in the day.\u201d\n\nThe Area Fada, as he is popularly called, believes that the Nigerian youths need reawakening of their mindset. \u201cIt\u2019s either they are vexed enough to understand what is about to happen or happening to them or they are too scared and rigid to act. It is the docility of the youths that has contributed to my decision to stay on my own and use music, which is a stronger tool, to fight for the people.\n\n\u201cI still believe that the salvation of this country lies in the hands of its exceptional youths. I still can\u2019t see how these ancestors from the 18th century can defeat the millennial of the 21st century. This oppressive government can\u2019t operate in perpetuity. It has an expiration date. But for sure, there will be consequences for our docility over the years. Before it gets better, it will get worse. How do we reason with barbarians and animals in human skin? There is a demonic wind blowing across the country now. Prayers alone can never solve this, we must resolve to strategically push back or accept our fate as slaves,\u201d he averred.\n\nHowever, the veteran musician believes that all hope is not lost for Nigeria. \u201cThere is hope for the country,\u201d he enthused, \u201cit is still the exceptional few, Nigerian youths, that will remedy this country when the chips are down.\u201d\n\nAny regrets? Charly Boy retorted: \u201cRegrets? No. Life is a journey of twists and turns. I have lived a charming life, 90 per cent of the time on my own terms and rules. I was the underdog no one gave a chance. I have lived several lives in one and I am not your regular everyday Nigerian, I am a limited edition. I have no damn regrets. My life is better than most Hollywood fiction. I will forever be my authentic self. I\u2019ll forever keep pushing my dreams with consistency, tenacity, sagacity, audacity and tremendous focus.\u201d",

          "title": "We\u2019re finished: 5 dead, scores injured, 25 vehicles razed in Lagos gas explosion",
          "text": "By Omodele Adigun, Lawrence Enyoghasu And Lukman Olabiyi\n\nIt was a tragedy that nobody saw coming. But by the time it was over, it left five people dead, scores injured, some of them critically, 25 cars burnt and one building structure in complete ruins.\n\nThere is, perhaps, no better way to describe the ruins and destruction caused by the liquefied petroleum tanker explosion that shook Mobolaji Johnson Way, Ikeja, Lagos, to its foundation on Thursday night, precisely at about 11p.m. Said to have been caused by a leaking valve of a moving tanker, it ignited a huge fireball that practically licked up every combustible item on its path. Affected mostly are business owners and employees at Ogun State Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) Plaza, Ikeja.\n\nA vulcanizer who lost two cars given to him to sell to the inferno, became the object of pity of sympathizers when he lamented that he wa finished as he didn\u2019t know what to do or to tell the owners.\n\nMany hours later, the smoldering scene still points to a tragedy of immense proportion. Initial report claimed that 13 people, nine males, four females, sustained various degrees of burns in the incident, which occurred in front of the popular Sheraton Hotel, Ikeja. The Acting Zonal Coordinator, South West Zonal Office of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Mr. Ibrahim Farinloye, informed newsmen that three bodies were initially recovered from the scene of the explosion. But the number later increased to five.\n\nThe affected victims are being attended to at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), he added. \u201cOnly four of the critically injured were transferred to Burn Centre, General Hospital Gbagada at about 0230hours today. The yet-to-be-identified bodies were recovered from the generator house of OPIC Plaza and the restaurant,\u201d he said. \u201cSearch-and-rescue is still ongoing at the collapsed buildings.\u201d\n\nHe explained that the LPG tanker exploded at about 10.32 hours. The resulting fire travelled with the wind to the premises of Ogun State Property Investment Company (OPIC) Plaza, besides Sheraton Hotel and housing different commercial outfits, including the Chinese Restaurant.\n\nProviding an update on the incident, he said: \u201cThe fire was put out at about 0030 hours following concerted efforts by five fire trucks from Lagos State Fire Service and two from LASEMA Response Unit. Preliminary assessment on vehicles damaged indicated that about 25 were burnt. Comprehensive post-disaster assessment on the extent of general damages would be done later. The Commissioner of Police, Lagos Command, Hakeem Odumosu was at hand and took charge of crowd control and normalised the situation for a successful operation. NEMA, LASTMA, State Fire Service, FRSC and NSCDC were at the scene.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the inferno was reported to have led to the quick evacuation of all guests at Sheraton Hotel. It later led to a heavy traffic congestion that grounded movements on all entrances/exits routes to Ikeja and trapped motorists for several hours. Some of the affected motorists, who made short videos of the incident, blamed the slow response by emergency services for the escalation of the inferno. The videos shared on social platforms showed aggrieved onlookers lamenting how long it took rescuers \u2013 some claimed it was more than 30 minutes \u2013 to get to the scene of the fire incident.\n\nThe Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), in a short message, said all emergency workers were at the scene working to contain the situation. The Director General (DG), Dr. Femi Oke-Osanyintolu said that the information gathered at the scene revealed that the fire started as a result of explosion while the gas tanker was moving inward Ikeja.\n\nVictims and eyewitness accounts\n\nOscar Odion, a dispatch rider with Sandra Logistics and an eyewitness of the ensuing horror, said that he was on his way back from the day\u2019s work when he saw the fire. Cries of agony rent the air as fire fighters battled hard against the enraging and spreading flame. Smokes and fire billowed from the bodies of people caught in the resultant melee. Some tried to escape only to get crushed by escaping motorists.\n\nHis account: \u201cIt happened around 11 pm yesterday while I was on my way home. I was riding with a friend when we saw the fire. We saw people struggling to escape. A child lay abandoned on the floor. I watched as the building collapsed. We tried to curtail the spread of the fire before fire service people arrived. A guy tried to rescue a victim trapped in the fire. Another guy saved from the fire got knocked down by a vehicle on motion. We mainly engaged ourselves in fetching water from the tap in the compound, because fire service men from the first fire service truck that arrived the scene claimed not to have water. As the fire spread we could not stand and do nothing.\u201d\n\nOluwaseun Olowaremi Peters, a driver with Oasis Supermarket, was not only an eyewitness but much more importantly a survivor of the inferno. When our reporter met him he was in a sober mood and busy quietly telling few people around him how he narrowly escaped death. Donning a pair of oversized black trousers and with his hands folded in praying position, to signify his gratitude to God, he said:\n\n\u201cI wanted to watch the football match. But on realizing that the bet9ja shop had closed, I went back to my car to rest my head and listen to the commentary of the game. But not long after I woke up from sleep to have my night prayer, because I had decided not to go home, I heard a big bang. It was like the sound of a thunder. Everywhere was covered with acrid smoke so much that I could not see. It was painful to the eyes. When I realized it was not raining, I quickly ran out.\n\n\u201cAs I was trying to escape, my trousers got caught up somewhere. I tore it and jumped outside as I saw the enraging fire coming towards me. I thank God that my car\u2019s door opened at once because if it had not, I would have been trapped in the fire. When I jumped from the fence, I landed inside a gas storage tank. All my body became cold up till my toenails. I was immobilized; I could not move. All the same I mustered strength and escaped.\u201d\n\nMuritala Mudasiru, a vulcanizer who lost two cars and two machines to the inferno, was being consoled by friends as he stood behind the yellow demarcating tape, furtively gazing into space.\n\n\u201cI was here till 10 pm before I left for home,\u201d he explained. \u201cI first got the call that a gas trailer had spoiled and released some gas. The fire came from the New China Restaurant. I lost two vulcanizing machines and two cars, Mazda and Toyota Corolla, kept in my custody for sale.\u201d\n\nA little tension rose up yesterday between a team of police officers and some of the victims when the security officers tried to clear and cordon off the scene. One of the victims who gave his name as Niyi decried the police\u2019s attempt to treat him like a miscreant and vehemently objected to it.\n\nLagos State Government has commiserated with Ogun State Government and the families of those who died in the aftermath of the gas explosion which affected OPIC Plaza in Ikeja.\n\nThe State Commissioner for Special Duties and Intergovernmental Relations, Mr Tayo Bamgbose-Martins issued the condolence message during an assessment visit to the scene of the fire incident\n\nMr Bamgbose-Martins who was in company of his Physical Planning counterpart, Mr Idris Salako, the Commissioner of Police and other key government officials described the incident as very devastating. He assured that due diligence would be done and necessary measures implemented to prevent a reoccurrence.\n\nDirector-General of the State Emergency Management Agency, LASEMA, Dr Femi Oke-Osanyintolu stated that instead of milling round scenes of emergencies and sending wrong or conflicting information on social media, residents should always report incidents via the 112 and 767 toll free emergency numbers.\n\nThe LASEMA DG disclosed that the carcass of the gas tanker and truck had been evacuated and forensic evidence would be gathered to ascertain whether the recommended safety measures were violated.",

          "title": "Student Dies in Crossfire as Troops Free Five Kebbi School Abductees",
          "text": "\u2022Bagudu visits school, promises all abductees will be rescued\n\nKingsley Nwezeh in Abuja and Ismail Adebayo in Birnin Kebbi\n\nOne of the students abducted by bandits who attacked the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, Kebbi State, last Thursday night has died during a crossfire between the kidnappers and security agents.\n\nThe kidnappers, who stormed the school in large number, were armed with sophisticated weapons, abducted 30 students, and killed a policeman. A teacher, a vice-principal, the school\u2019s security officer, and the wife of a teacher, were also abducted.\n\nGovernor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State visited the affected school yesterday, where he met with the parents, and promised that all abducted students would be freed.\n\nThe shootout that claimed the life of the student happened yesterday morning when the fleeing kidnappers ran into men of the Joint Taskforce of Operation Hadarin Daji in the North-West Zone, at a roadblock, while heading out of Kebbi State.\n\nAccording to the Deputy Force Commander, Operation Hadari Daji, Air Commodore Abubakar Abdulkadir, as a result of the duel, the bandits were forced to abandon five students and a teacher.\n\nSadly, one of the students, who was unidentified, died in the crossfire. No further detail was given on how the death occurred.\n\nAbdulkadir said: \u201cIn the early hours of this morning, we came across the kidnappers. They came to our blocking point, and we engaged them. At that point, they abandoned five of the students and one of the teachers. Unfortunately, I think we lost one of the students.\u201d\n\nThe Nigerian Army in a statement yesterday confirmed the death of the student but attributed the death to \u201cexhaustion during a rescue operation as troops of Operation Hadarin Daji engaged kidnappers in a fire-fight, culminating in the rescue of five students and two teachers of Federal Government College, Yauri.\u201d\n\nA statement issued by the Army Spokesman, Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu, said troops had launched a manhunt for the kidnappers and bandits, following the abduction of the students.\n\n\u201cThe rescue followed an initial encounter with the abductors in the early hours of today (yesterday) 18 June 2021 after trailing the kidnappers from Yauri through Riyao to Sombo community, where the kidnappers who had split into two groups fled, with one group conveying the abducted children, while the second group conveyed rustled cattle,\u201d it said.\n\nThe update on the abduction said the land troops in conjunction with elements of the Nigerian Air Force, who provided close air support during the rescue mission, intercepted the two groups at about 2.30 am.\n\nIt said the troops also recovered 800 cattle rustled by the bandits and maintained that the gallant troops were still on the heels of the kidnappers to rescue the remaining abductees still in captivity.\n\n\u201cThe rescued teachers and students will be handed over to the Kebbi State Government. The Nigerian Army appreciates the cooperation so far from good-spirited citizens and wishes to solicit more. \u201cThe Chief of Army Staff Maj Gen Faruk Yahaya has directed the commander to spare no effort until all the abducted persons are safely rescued and reunited with their loved ones,\u201d it said.\n\nThe rescued students and teachers are currently receiving medical treatment at the Yauri General Hospital.\n\nBagudu Promises Freedom for Abducted Students\n\nMeanwhile, Governor Bagudu yesterday met with parents of abducted Yauri students at the school premises, assuring them that they would be rescued soon.\n\nHe assured the parents that the state government, relevant security agencies, and the presidency were working together to rescue the student from the bandits.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe will do anything to bring the children back. We have already engaged the necessary security agencies and they are working to rescue them. All we need to do we have done. What we need from you are your prayers and support.\u201d\n\nBagudu said the state government was alerted two weeks ago that the bandits were sighted around the school area, adding: \u201cWe planned to move them but the school authorities said the students have two weeks left to write their final exams. For this, the commissioner of police was gracious enough to dispatch 22 men and officers from the counter-terrorism unit to the school but they were overpowered because the bandits came in hundreds.\u201d\n\n\u2018How Bandits Took Our Children Away\u2019\n\nWorried parents of the abducted Yauri students yesterday narrated to Governor Bagudu how the bandits came in hundreds, overran the security at the school, and went away with many students.\n\nA parent and one of the cooks engaged for the security personnel deployed to the school, Mrs. Aliheri Gabonchok said she was at the kitchen when the bandits stormed the premises and started shooting sporadically.\n\nShe said: \u201cWhen they came, I rushed into hiding with some of the students I could gather. I told them to lie down till the gunshot subsided. I came out when they had left, only to hear from other staff, who also escaped, that they went away with some students, school staff, and even my husband.\u201d\n\nAnother parent, Ainan Muhammed, said the bandits who invaded the school were about 400.\n\nAnother parent, Aliyu Wushishi said his five children were among those abducted by the bandits and appealed to the governor to do whatever he could do to rescue the students from the bandits.\n\nThe Emir of Yauri, Dr. Sayyanu Abdullahi charged the government to have the political will to deal with banditry.\n\nThe emir also said people in the various communities should see it as their duty to expose those serving as informants to bandits in their communities.\n\nThe royal father gave the charge when governor Badugu visited his palace in Yauri after meeting with some parents of the abducted students.\n\nVehicle Used for Abduction\n\nMeanwhile, the police command in Kebbi State yesterday explained that one of the vehicles used for the kidnaping belongs to a high court judge in the state.\n\nNafi\u2019u Abubakar, the Kebbi police spokesman, said the van was hijacked by bandits on Birnin Yauri road.\n\nAbubakar said the police are yet to determine the number of students kidnapped from the school located in Ngaski LGA of the state.\n\nHe said the reports making the rounds that 50 students were kidnapped from the school were false.\n\nThe Kebbi police spokesman said: \u201cThe attention of the police has been drawn to reports made by some media stations that a police vehicle was used in kidnapping about 50 students of the FGC. A White Hilux Van with registration No. kBSJ 29 belonging to a High Court judge with the inscription of Kebbi State Judiciary, hijacked by bandits on Birnin Yauri road was the one used in the kidnapping and not a police vehicle as stated by some media stations.\n\n\u201cThe command wishes to make it clear and set the records straight that yet to be ascertained number of students are still missing as rescue operation is still ongoing.\u201d\n\nThough the Kebbi State Government and the school\u2019s authorities are yet to release the official number of students and staff abducted in the school, unofficial sources said, in all, 30 students and four officials were kidnapped.\n\n\u201c25 students and two officials of the school are still with the kidnappers,\u201d said a source close to the school.\n\nYauri Lawmaker Laments\n\nThe lawmaker representing the Igaski/Shanga/Yauri in Kebbi State at the House of Representatives, Yusuf Sununu, has lamented attacks by bandits in Kebbi State.\n\nSununu warned that the growing insecurity in Kebbi State was a major threat to food security in the country.\n\nSununu said the pervading insecurity in the country was becoming worrisome, saying, \u201cgone are the days when Kebbi used to be the most peaceful in the country.\n\n\u201cA week ago, we had another calamity when bandits \u2013 according to eyewitnesses \u2013 numbering about 250 to 300, each with an AK-47 rifle and using very strong motorcycles, came into my constituency. They had a field day and operated for more than eight hours, going from house to house, room to room, collecting money, handsets, motorcycles, and cattle. That led to a massive influx of internally displaced persons to the headquarters of the emirate in the town of Yauri.\n\n\u201cHowever, we were able to convince people and they started going back to their respective areas. But they (bandits) left a message that they would be coming back. Taking it seriously, some people refused to go back, and in the early hours of today, they repeated what they had done earlier, and they came into the constituency, somehow around 10:30 am or thereabout. They were able to gain access after strong fights with some security guards and policemen guarding the Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri, and they made their way into the school.\n\n\u201cThis is a cause for concern and as representative of the people, I had to come here and make a call on the Federal Government to look at Yauri\u2019s position with its neighbouring Niger State. It has direct access to Zamfara State and west of Yauri is the bank of River Niger. We fear that their major target is to enter Yauri. Now, we are calling on the Federal Government to provide adequate security. I have got in touch with security agencies. We had discussions and it has been confirmed to me that military aircraft are in surveillance in the area.\n\n\u201cWe have to make it clear that Kebbi State and indeed Yauri holds a unique position in the food security of this country. Over 90 per cent of the land of Yauri is for rice farming. But as of today, no farmer can comfortably go back to his farm and farm and come back to sleep with his eyes closed.\n\n\u201cWe are right now facing an influx of some people into Yauri with a higher rate of internally displaced persons. Accommodation, feeding, and other necessary logistics are being affected. The worst part of it is that a nation can only develop when it is sound educationally.\n\n\u201cThe so-called Boko Haram is almost becoming a reality because parents cannot feel free to send their wards to school for fear of being kidnapped. As it is now, a lot of primary schools in the emirate in Yauri town are being occupied by IDPs. This tends to deter the progress so far achieved by the Kebbi State Government in terms of agriculture and in terms of promoting access to education.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Osinbajo: Corporate bodies must ensure accountability in service provision\n\nDeji Elumoye in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday charged the MTN Group to make its services affordable and in high quality to its Nigerian subscribers.\n\nThe President\u2019s charge came the same day Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo urged corporate organisations operating in Nigeria, including the MTN, to ensure there is accountability in the provision of services to customers and to pay greater attention to the needs of the people.\n\nSpeaking yesterday at the State House, Abuja when he received in audience members of the board of MTN Group led by its President and Chief Executive Officer, Ralph Mupita, President Buhari said: \u201cNigeria is your most lucrative market in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, as well as the source of a third of the income of the entire MTN Group. As such, we urge you to offer top-of-the-range and affordable service to Nigerians.\n\n\u201cAs we seek to make broadband widely available and affordable, we urge MTN to continue to support our efforts by expanding high quality connectivity to Nigerians in unserved and underserved areas.\u201d\n\nThe President also called on the group to support the implementation of the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in the Nigerian telecommunications sector.\n\n\u201cI recently unveiled and launched the National Policy for the Promotion of Indigenous Content in the Nigerian telecommunications sector. I call on MTN to support the implementation of this policy and train and engage more Nigerians in your company.\n\n\u201cIn particular, we would like you to continue to support our efforts by improving the quality of service and enabling a downward price review of the cost of data and other services, in view of your large market in Nigeria. We also urge you to step up your Corporate Social Responsibility programmes and support Research and Development that will enhance your services in Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe assured his visitors that his administration was doing everything possible to make Nigeria investor-friendly by addressing identified challenges:\n\n\u201cWe are implementing a number of policies and programmes to ensure that institutions like MTN have a conducive environment for doing business in Nigeria. Our massive jump in the Global Ease of Doing Business Ranking is proof that our efforts are yielding positive results.\n\n\u201cWe have identified and addressed the key challenges that affected the growth of the digital economy sector. One of such challenges was the high Right of Way costs and another was the vandalism of critical national infrastructure.\n\n\u201cI am happy to note that the Right of Way charges have now been pegged at a maximum of N145/linear metre and I have given directives for the protection of critical national infrastructure and this has addressed the issue of vandalism of such infrastructure. Service providers should always appreciate the effort of government and not undermine it.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari expressed his delight that the Information and communications technology sector was doing very well despite the global economic downturn.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe information and communications technology sector was the fastest growing sector in both the fourth quarter of 2020 and the entire year 2020, based on the report by the National Bureau of Statistics. The sector\u2019s 14.70% double digit growth rate played a principal role in supporting our country to exit the recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe growth rate of the sector exceeded four times the next fastest growing sector of Q4 2020, which had a growth rate of 3.42%. This is truly commendable.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Osinbajo, delivered his message on Thursday when he received members of the board of telecoms giant, MTN, led by the company\u2019s Group President and CEO, Mr Ralph Mupita, on a courtesy visit to the Presidential Villa.\n\nHe stated that it was critical for corporate organisations to show commitment to improving services and to build confidence in the people.\n\nWhile noting that there have been hiccups in the relationship, the VP commended MTN for its contribution to the country, adding that the company is clearly an important part of Nigeria\u2019s story.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cCorporate organisations should be more accountable in their services, in the ownership structure, and also in paying attention to the needs of the people. Companies that ensure this will experience progress, as this is the right direction to go. Going forward, most corporates will find that attaching greater importance to the people is the way to go.\n\n\u201cFor telecommunication firms like MTN, financial inclusion is crucial, so is broadband connection in deepening access and will help to connect hard-to-reach places, and to retail social welfare and services. The company\u2019s investment was crucial when Nigeria needed to show that not only is there a large population in the country, but that it is a large market. The market was severely underestimated for a long time. So, MTN is an important part of our story, we regard MTN as an important partner.\u201d\n\nSpeaking earlier, Mupita said that they want to deepen structure of ownership in Nigeria.\n\nWhile disclosing that the company wants to have the largest retail-based shareholding in Nigeria, Mupita said they plan to sell another 14 per cent to Nigerian individuals and institutions.\n\nHe added that MTN as a corporate citizen is responsible in all the countries where it is represented.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Festus Akanbi\n\nThe controversy surrounding the power of the President to extend the tenure of any retiring Inspector General of Police, pending the completion of the process of appointing a successor, was yesterday laid to rest with the affirmation of the President\u2019s power to do so by the ruling of a federal high court in Abuja.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari had on February 4 extended the tenure of Mohammed Adamu as Inspector-General of Police by three months after he clocked the mandatory 35 years in service on February 1.\n\nHowever, a legal practitioner, Maxwell Opara, dragged the president and IGP to court, arguing that by virtue of section 215 of the Nigerian Constitution and section 7 of the Nigeria Police Act, 2020, Adamu cannot continue to function as the IGP, having completed 35 years in service.\n\nIn his defence, the IGP told the federal high court that the new Nigeria Police Act gave him a four-year tenure, which would only lapse in either 2023 or 2024.\n\nSupporting Adamu\u2019s position, President Buhari and the attorney-general of the federation, Abubakar Malami \u2013 who are the second and third defendants in the matter \u2013 told the court through their lawyer that the law permits the IGP to remain in office until either 2023 or 2024.\n\nIn his judgment yesterday, Ahmed Mohammed, the presiding judge, held that since the constitution and the police act empower the president to appoint an IGP, by implication, he could extend the tenure of a retiring IGP before concluding the required consultation with the police council and other processes required for the appointment of a substantive replacement.\n\nThe judge also observed that the constitution and the police act were silent on the issue of whether or not the president could extend the tenure of a retired IGP.\n\nSome senior advocates of Nigeria (SANs) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had assailed Buhari for extending Adamu\u2019s tenure.\n\nThey declared his action as violating the 1999 Constitution as (amended) and the Police Act (2020).\n\nMinister of Police Affairs, Mr. Mohammad Dingyadi, told State House reporters in Abuja that Adamu\u2019s tenure elongation would allow for proper screening of all qualified senior police officers before the eventual choice of a new IG.\n\nHe said then: \u201cMr. President has decided that the present IG, Mohammed Adamu, will continue to serve as the IG for the next three months to allow for a robust and efficient process of appointing a new IG.\n\n\u201cThis is not unconnected to the desire of Mr. President to not only have a smooth handover but to also ensure that the right officer is appointed into that position. Mr. President is extending by three months to allow him to get into the process of allowing a new one.\u201d\n\nAdamu was eventually retired on April 6, when the current IGP, Usman Alkali was named by the President as the acting IGP.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Urges military to ramp up fight against insurgency\n\nDeji Elumoye and Michael Olugbode in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari yesterday assured residents of Borno State of the federal government\u2019s readiness to fight terrorism to the end, telling the military not to give criminals a breathing space to undermine Nigeria\u2019s interests.\n\nThe president, during a visit to Borno State, commended troops for their loyalty and selfless service to Nigeria and urged them not to relent in their efforts to end the insurgency in the North-east.\n\nHe promised support for the families of fallen security personnel, saying he would ensure all Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) return to their homes.\n\nHe also commended the state Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, for his resilience and relentless efforts in rebuilding the state.\n\nBuhari, during the visit to appraise the security situation in the state and to inaugurate some development projects attributed the recent successes recorded by the military against the insurgents and terrorists at Dikwa, Damboa and Gwoza to careful planning, infusion of new equipment and other war materials as well as quality military leadership.\n\nHe, however, acknowledged the enormity of the task ahead of the military.\n\n\u201cThe attacks launched by cowardly terrorists against military and civilian targets last month and in previous months were a pointer to us that the work of defeating insurgency and terrorism and of restoring permanent peace to this region is not yet over,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe will not rest until all the millions of Internally Displaced Persons are able to return and resettle in their homes and rebuild their shattered lives.\u201d\n\nHe expressed the hope that the service chiefs would bring to bear on the war, their experience as commanders in theatre at various times.\n\nThe president said: \u201cAll of them are, therefore, personally familiar with the challenge of insurgency. I fully expect them to bring this wealth of personal experience to bear as we move to end this scourge once and for all.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, these successes owe a lot to the role played by volunteers of the Civilian JTF, hunters and vigilantes. These good people include women, who are making huge sacrifices and patriotic contributions to our peace-restoration efforts.\u201d\n\nHe stated that many servicemen and women, as well as volunteers, had been killed in the fight to rid communities and the country of terrorism and insurgency and thanked all those involved for their gallantry and sacrifices.\n\nBuhari assured their loved ones that their sacrifices will not be in vain: \u201cI must also acknowledge the very important role and the sacrifices made by parents, guardians and other loved ones amongst the people of Borno State, the North-east region and the country as a whole, who support their sons, daughters, husbands, brothers and sisters in going to battlefields to defend Nigeria\u2019s sovereignty, territorial integrity and peace. I thank and commend them for their resilience and assure them success is in sight.\u201d\n\nHe said it was a mark of appreciation for the sacrifices made by Borno State\u2019s volunteers that the Nigerian Army was authorised to enlist hundreds of them into the Army.\n\nHe urged the people to sustain the cooperation with the military and the other security services.\n\n\u201cBoth must see each other as being on one side in order for us to succeed,\u201d he said.\n\nBuhari said the late President Idris Deby of Chad played a major role in the fight against terrorism in the Lake Chad region and urged his successors to work hard in restoring democracy to the country and support the processes of bringing peace to the region.\n\nHe said the recent appointment of Ambassador Babagana Kingibe as special envoy to Chad and the Lake Chad Basin was intended to accelerate the restoration of democratic stability in the Chad Republic and enhance cooperation among all the countries of the Lake Chad Basin.\n\nHe assured the people that the federal government had taken decisive measures to safeguard IDPs and refugees who recently returned from Cameroon and the Niger Republic, adding that it was engaged in the task of rebuilding their communities after more than a decade of war and terrorism.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cIt was part of these measures that I gave approval for the federal government to build 10,000 resettlement homes in Borno State. Four thousand of these homes have already been completed. Furthermore, I approved for constant release of food intervention by the Nigerian Customs Service and the North East Development Commission in order to support displaced persons.\n\n\u201cI have directed these agencies to sustain and deepen this support. I also wish to specially commend His Excellency, Governor Babagana Umara Zulum, for his tireless efforts in directly supervising the distribution of food and economic empowerment to IDPs in all local government areas.\u201d He expressed the belief that the efforts at alleviating the suffering of displaced communities will hamper attempts by terrorists and insurgents to recruit fighters and spies from IDPs and other vulnerable populations through the use of paltry material incentives.\n\nOn electricity supply, Buhari said his administration would continue to make concerted efforts towards guaranteeing energy security to all, adding that Maiduguri could not, and would not be left out.\n\nHe said the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) had been directed to expedite the delivery of 50MW power plant in the state towards ensuring the restoration of electricity to Maiduguri and its environs.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, in the light of the current improvement of security in the state, I have also issued directives for the immediate resumption of oil & gas exploration activities in the Lake Chad Basin. This is part of our overall effort to restore the state back to normalcy,\u201d the president explained.\n\nThe president applauded Zulum\u2019s efforts at providing facilities that directly impact the livelihood of people, particularly building educational and health institutions and constructing roads.\n\nHe also commended the Shehu of Borno, Abubakar Ibn Umar Garbai El-Kanemi, as well as all the other royal highnesses and Bulamas at all levels for their very exemplary leadership, patience, determination and wisdom during the past decade of ravage by insurgency and terrorism.\n\nAccording to him, the fact that royal highnesses now operate from their domains was evidence that peace was being restored to the communities despite the challenges that remain to be overcome.\n\n\u201cThe elders, statesmen, Muslim and Christian community leaders all over this state and region also deserve our thanks and warm appreciation for their resilience, moral leadership and support for the federal and state governments during these trying times.\n\n\u201cI will never forget in my life that during my career as a politician, Borno State is where I got the highest percentage of votes, more than 90 per cent! The least I can do for you is to continue the relentless effort to fully restore peace to this state, the North-east region and the country as a whole,\u201d he said.\n\nHe urged the military and security agencies to continue to make Nigeria proud.\n\nBuhari also interacted with some of the wounded soldiers assuring them that the government was committed to their recovery and welfare.\n\nIn his remarks, the Commander of Theatre Operations HADIN KAI, Maj. Gen. Felix Omoigui, assured troops of the president\u2019s confidence and commitment to their welfare, especially in ending the war.\n\nHe thanked the president for the visit to the troops, which he said would greatly boost the morale of all those fighting to keep the country in peace.\n\nGovernors of Borno and Yobe State, Zulum and Mai Bunu respectively; Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Leo Irabor; Chief of Army Staff, Maj. Gen. Farouk Yahaya; Chief of Naval Staff, Rear Admiral Awwal Gambo; Chief of Staff, Air Vice Marshal Isiaka Amao, and National Security Adviser, Maj. Gen. Babagana Monguno (rtd), were also at the event.\n\nIn his remarks, Zulum thanked the president for the relative peace in the state, buoyed by the heavy presence of military and security men who have been engaging the terrorists.\n\n\u201cWe have witnessed the gradual return of peace to Borno State and it is our sincere hope that insurgency will soon be brought to an end,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor appreciated the president for various developmental interventions, which include infrastructure, particularly the approval of 10,000 units of housing for IDPs of which 4,000 had been completed.\n\nPresident Thanks Nigerians for Opportunity to Serve\n\nIn the meantime, the president has expressed his gratitude to Nigerians for the opportunity given to him to serve them.\n\nHe said under his watch, efforts would be made to improve the livelihood of Nigerians, starting with adequate security.\n\nHe said at the palace of the Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Abubakar Ibn Garbai El-Kanemi, that he started his administrative career as a military officer in Borno State as a governor for seven months, under Gen. Murtala Muhammed, before he was appointed Minister of Petroleum by former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was then a military head of state.\n\nHe added: \u201cMy commitment to serve Nigerians is a payback for the love shown to me. I started my political adventure in Maiduguri and I always look forward to coming here.\u201d\n\nIn his remarks, El-Kanemi thanked the president for consistent response to the plight of the people in the state, saying that the security situation has improved.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "Fellow Americans,\n\nNobody knows the joy of winning better than I do, believe me. I have always been a winner for as long as I can remember. Okay? Nobody knows the beauty of fighting to win better than I do. I am always a fighter and when I fight, I win. Everybody knows that.\n\nI have reached the very top. Absolutely. And I reached the top at a very tremendous speed. You all know it. The first time I ran for office, I ran for president. It was beautiful. Right? What usually takes great men three attempts before they get a win, I won in a landslide the very first time I ran. I heard that it has never been done anywhere else in the world.\n\nIn the last four years, I have accomplished for America things that presidents that were in office for twelve years did not accomplish. It is not even close. I made America a big-league winner again. I put billions and billions of dollars into your pockets through my amazing tax cuts. I have shown you that everything is possible if you have the right man to do the right job. Everybody is saying so.\n\nAll over the world, there is huge respect for America again, in some cases, even massive fear. Bigly! Which is good. I made it happen. Nobody messes with America because I highly insisted on it. I placed America first, which is fair. I stopped those out of control dope and overrated countries that get away with murder at the expense of America. It didn\u2019t happen again. Not on my watch! I was tough so that America would be triumphant.\n\nThe world had never seen anything like that before.\n\nBecause of me, the next generation of Americans will grow up knowing that America is the greatest nation on earth, full of courageous men like me. Thanks to me, they will grow up knowing that ours is a Christian nation where it is allowed to say Merry Christmas. Our children and grandchildren will grow up knowing that the whole world is out there for them to dominate and not bow to the sissies who think that we must worship the environment at the expense of the staggering economy that I built.\n\nFrankly, I have done everything that I set out to do \u2013 most of which were things that have never been done before. I have in place the greatest military that humans ever assembled for our incredible men and women in uniform. I assembled it in just four years by rebuilding our powerful military that they destroyed due to neglect and incompetence. I secured America from coast to coast with walls and wires, cages and visa bans. I took care of it, just as I promised I would do. I returned America under God. Before I came, they had taken America to the shrines of the devil.\n\nAmericans love me because of these outstanding accomplishments. I have seen it on the faces of fabulous Americans while I travelled around the country in the last few weeks.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I could stay around and fight. And it is a fight that I know that I will win. But I have decided not to. There is no point.\n\nI believe that I have nothing else left to prove. My achievements will be around till the end of time. I won\u2019t be surprised if, by January 20, 2021, my face would go up on Mount Rushmore to join other presidents of my calibre. It won\u2019t surprise me one bit. People think it is going to happen.\n\nTo all my special supporters, I say thank you for the unbelievable fantastic ride. Don\u2019t despair, for I will send you a brilliant comforter. Those stupid little lightweights on the other side who have no clue may taunt you. When those clowns do, remind the goofy and crooked losers that I made America great again. Tell those terrible lowlifes that they have proved themselves unworthy of Donald Trump\u2019s genius and have opted to reduce America to a Second Class nation in the world. Total Disaster!\n\nSo, my fellow American, I bide you all farewell. May God bless you, and my God bless the United States of America.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump\n\nThe 45th President of the United States.",

Can any of you reading this write-up imagine Barack Obama, who twice won the popular vote and the Electoral College tallies and who spent 8 good years in the White House without a single scandal, being described as a cat with 9 lives?\n\nNot by a long shot. The answer to the rhetorical question has to be a resounding no. Poor Obama as President of the United States would long have been skinned alive and sacrificed to the gods by the Republicans who obstructed him every step of the way during all of his 8 years in the White House all in the name of partisan politics.\n\nYou would have thought they would have left him off the hook the moment he left office, but Republicans and their Narcissist-in-Chief in the White House have not left Obama alone for one brief moment. In fact, the grossly ignorant and incompetent lunatic in the White House still finds some ways to blame Obama or Hillary even for some of his own insanity or foolishness while fraudulently claiming to be the smartest President America has ever put in office.\n\nWhat is so offensive is that the hypocrites in his Republican base are buying the garbage and defending the impossible because all they care about is supporting the man who is going to put money in their pockets because his greatest motivation for seeking the Presidency is to make money and to make his family and few friends so rich that they would kill to have him removed from office, should it come to that. America under Trump is no longer the America we used to know and the Republican Party has become a den of thieves and sexual predators that have lost their moral compass as a major political party in God\u2019s own country.\n\nIn cahoots with Trump, Republicans have not ended their campaign of calumny to humiliate, blackmail and delegitimize Barack Obama, the first black President.\n\nEven though the White House was built with slave labor, as widely documented by historians, no black man was ever expected to live in that majestic building that the arrogant Donald Trump, in one of his craziest moments, has described as a \u201cdump.\u201d\n\nThe guy is just too arrogant to admit that the Obama couple was far superior to him and his Melania in intellect and education. Barack earned his education from Columbia and Harvard while Michelle earned her own from Princeton and Harvard.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get any better than that for any American President dead or alive but the \u201cC\u201d average student from an undergraduate business program would tell you he is the smartest dude in the universe who never makes a mistake or regrets anything. He sounds to me like a reincarnated Adolf Hitler who told the Anglo-Saxons they were the most superior white race in the world who must dominate the world. Donald Trump is pretty much preaching the same doctrine today. His latest unilateral announcement to make Jerusalem the undivided capital of the Zionist Regime without consultation with any of America\u2019s traditional allies is tantamount to suicide and a move that will go down in infamy, to quote the immortal words of Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nDonald Trump once boasted that he was far more experienced than all of the American generals combined. He is therefore seeking to invalidate or demolish anything the first black President had ever done during his 8 glorious years in the White House.\n\nThe one-term young Senator from Illinois was elected President in 2008 and re-elected again in 2012 with a wider margin. He turned around the American economy while reducing unemployment in America to the lowest it had ever been in 20 years. He killed Osama Bin Laden and he passed into law the Affordable Health Care Reform Law that offered medical insurance coverage to 46 million Americans with the stroke of his pen.\n\nThe Teflon outlaw with 9 lives came to town promising to undo everything Obama has done while promising to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d as if America has ever at any time lost her greatness following the end of the Second World War. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but his Republican base and some charlatans in the party are buying the cheap blackmail from a delusional outlaw in the White House.\n\nEven though Trump had lost the popular vote by 3 million votes to Hillary Clinton, he still managed to ride on the coattails of Vladimir Putin and the KGB to put himself in the White House against the better judgment of the 65 million Americans who voted for his opponent.\n\nMy point is that if Barack Obama had committed just a fraction of the crimes and violations of the norms of decency that Donald Trump has committed less than one year into his Presidency, Obama would long have been thrown out of office and sent to jail and Republicans in their hypocrisy and racism would have made that a justification to bar any colored person from ever aspiring to be President again.\n\nIi is Donald Trump that I call the Houdini of American Politics for how and why he has survived up to this moment despite all of the atrocities he has committed as a candidate and now as President for close to one year.\n\nIf Barack Obama had uttered half the statements credited to Donald Trump, he would never have secured the nomination of the Democratic Party in 2008 and would have been ostracized for life.\n\nI seek your indulgence to go back to memory lane to remind some of the fans of this column about the America we used to know before crazy Donald Trump showed up. Eagleton was dropped from nomination as running mate due to a history of mental health illness. Spiro Agnew, Vice President to Richard Nixon, was defrocked for tax evasion and fraud. Joseph Biden was forced to drop out of his Presidential bid at a point in his career because he was found guilty of plagiarism in one of his stump speeches - he lifted a quotation from Neil Kinnock, a Labour Party leader in Britain without acknowledging his source.\n\nGerald Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976 in large part because he pardoned Richard Nixon, an unconvicted felon, for obstruction of justice and for displaying ignorance when he stated in one of his debates with Jimmy Carter that the now-defunct Soviet Union did not dominate Eastern Europe.\n\nGeorge Bush lost to Bill Clinton for going back on his \u201cread my lips\u201d pledge not to increase taxes. The voters concluded he had told a lie even though he was one of the most honorable and dependable men of honor ever to serve as American President.\n\nI gave all of these examples to show how Donald Trump would appear to have completely changed all the rules of the game for anyone who will be President in America. Republicans nominated a man who has had more than 4000 litigations against him in the Court of Law, most of those litigations he had to settle out of Court because he was too embarrassed to let them go forward.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who falsely tried to delegitimize the man he was going to replace by claiming Obama was not born in America. Republicans nominated a man whose Trump Plaza Building in New York was already known to be the money laundering capital of the world.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man who claimed he loved to sexually assault women by \u201cgrabbing their pussies\u201d because they allowed him to commit the crime because he was a star who could get away with murder. He actually gloated that his supporters would still vote for him even if he had shot and killed a man on 5th Avenue in broad daylight in Manhattan. Republicans nominated and elected a pathological liar who is never ashamed to blackmail his opponents by calling them names and insulting them and getting away with everything.\n\nRepublicans nominated a man whose financial and business record with American banks and financial houses across the board were so bad that no American Bank was willing to do business with him because he had swindled them time and again. Republicans nominated and elected a man who had been divorced three times and who has filed for Bankruptcy more than five times and a man who has bluntly refused to submit his tax returns for public scrutiny because he has managed to avoid paying taxes for more than 20 years.\n\nRepublicans nominated and elected a con artist who is not afraid to lie his way out of every problem and a man who has openly tried to undermine NATO and many of the time-honored agreements all of his predecessors in the White House had committed to for more than 70 years.\n\nThey elected a hoodlum who openly colluded or conspired with the KGB while openly casting aspersion on the credibility of the American CIA and FBI. Republicans elected a man who wants to repeat Harry Truman\u2019s mistake by becoming the second American President to deploy or detonate the nuclear bomb, this time on North Korea.\n\nRepublicans have elected a man who openly emulates and praises dictators like Vladimir Putin. He made it clear he would want to be like them if he had his way. Republicans elected a man who tweets in the early hours of the morning and who has used tweeting as an instrument of policies and presidential orders. They elected a man who on Wednesday made good on his promise destroy the last vestiges of the Camp David Accord by unilaterally moving the capital of Israel to divide Jerusalem, thereby stroking the embers of fire and fury in the Middle East. Republicans have elected a man who has made his inexperienced son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the de facto Secretary of State to the United States through the backdoor.\n\nThe list goes on and on without end but Donald Trump is still there despite an abysmal approval opinion of only 33 percent or less. Republicans elected a man who has claimed that his own opinion or decision is all that counts and who has proclaimed most institutions of the fourth estate of the realm as \u201cfake news\u201d disseminators.\n\nHe has pointed accusing fingers at networks like CNN and print media like the highly respected New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, to mention a few.\n\nWhat atrocity, in less than one year in office, has this President not already committed? The list is inexhaustible. The greatest loser in this entire saga has to be the Republican Party and the clear winner has to be Vladimir Putin who now has the American President in his pocket and dictating to him what he must do or not do. Whoever thought that the whole world is going to turn 180 degrees for America and that Donald Trump is on his way to becoming the Mikhail Gorbachev of American Politics right under our eyes, and Americans appear totally helpless and clueless to do something about it.\n\nIt is a complete outrage and totally incredible!\n\nI rest my case.\n\nDr. Wumi Akintide",

          "text": "The Buhari administration has stepped up efforts to regulate the online media in Nigeria in what is seen by many as attempts to further stifle the civic space in the country.\n\nTwo weeks after blocking Twitter\u2019s operations, the federal government has asked the House of Representatives to enact a law that will empower the Nigerian Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to control all forms of internet broadcasting and social media.\n\nThe request was made on Wednesday by the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, during a public hearing organised by the house committee on information, national orientation, ethics, and values on a bill to amend the NBC Act.\n\nThe commission already controls television and radio broadcasting in Nigeria, based on provisions in Section 2(b) of the NBC Act. It states that \u201cthe Commission shall have [the] responsibility of receiving, processing and considering applications for the establishment, ownership or operation of radio and television stations including cable television services, direct satellite broadcast and any other medium of broadcasting.\u201d\n\nLai Mohammed now wants the commission to also regulate the online media, in addition to other channels of broadcasting. \u201cI want to add here specifically that internet broadcasting and all online media should be included in this because we have a responsibility to monitor contents, including Twitter,\u201d the minister told lawmakers.\n\nBefore Lai Mohammed\u2019s proposal, the broadcasting regulator had asked all social media platforms and service providers in the online broadcasting space in Nigeria to apply for a broadcast licence.\n\nPossible clampdown on freedom of expression\n\nWidespread criticism has trailed the proposal by the Nigerian government, which has only further stoked concerns over a possible clampdown on free speech and internet freedom by the Buhari administration.\n\nMedia stakeholders at the public hearing kicked against the inclusion of online media under NBC\u2019s mandate, asking the panel to instead make the commission more independent of the Minister of Information.\n\nOver time, the NBC has acted as an extension of the Ministry of Information and Culture, which rarely acts independently, and thus, the commission\u2019s operations have often been subject to political interference. This was condemned by the International Press Centre (IPC) and the Centre for Media Law and Advocacy in a joint statement that called for the neutrality of the commission.\n\nAccording to Akin Akingbulu, executive director of the Institute for Media and Society, the commission should not receive directives from the information minister. \u201cThe power to give directives to the commission, vested in the minister of information in section 6 should be removed and replaced with powers which include policy formulation for the broadcasting sector.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial media bill through the backdoor\u201d\n\nDespite the ban on Twitter, Nigerians continue to use the platform thanks to virtual private networks (VPNs) that help bypass the suspension. Many have taken to Twitter to express criticism over the proposed regulation of online media.\n\nBREAKING: NBC Amendment Bill Is Social Media Bill Through The Backdoor \u2014 SERAP (@SERAPNigeria) June 17, 2021\n\nAmendment of the NBC act;grafting the shoot of autocracy. \u2014 Senator Shehu Sani (@ShehuSani) June 17, 2021\n\nNigeria Govt is asking House of Reps to amend the NBC Act and include \u201cinternet broadcasting\u201d.\n\n\n\nThat means all online radio/TV stations must register with NBC and Lai Mohammed. This is social media censorship brought back through the back door.\n\n\n\nLend your voice. Say no.

          "text": "Facebook, this week, said it has removed fake accounts, pages and groups that posted about news and politics ahead of Ethiopia\u2019s general election scheduled to hold next week.\n\nIn a statement published on its website, the social media giant reportedly took down 65 Facebook profiles, 52 pages, 27 groups and 32 Instagram accounts for violating its rules against misleading others about their purpose and identity.\n\nThe fake accounts mainly posted in Amharic about topics that include the Prosperity Party and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. They also criticised opposition politicians and groups in Ethiopia, such as the Oromo Liberation Front, Ethiopian Democratic Party, and the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front.\n\n\u201cThe people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts as a central part of their operations to mislead people about who they are and what they are doing, and that was the basis for our action,\u201d Facebook said.\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, the fake accounts posted the same content across multiple pages and groups to grow their following, and targeted domestic audiences in its own country.\n\nRoughly 1.1 million accounts followed one or more of the Facebook pages, about 766,000 accounts joined one or more of the groups, and around 1,700 people followed one or more of the Instagram accounts.\n\n\u201cGiven the upcoming election and the ongoing tensions in Ethiopia, our teams moved as quickly as possible to complete the investigation and disrupt this operation,\u201d Gleicher said.\n\nFacebook also linked the fake accounts to individuals associated with the Information Network Security Agency (INSA) in Ethiopia.\n\nA brutal war erupted in the country\u2019s Tigray region after which the United States restricted visas for government and military officials of Ethiopia and Eritrea over allegations of human rights violations.\n\nPro-government demonstrators in Ethiopia had criticised the move by Washington and Gleicher added that the fake accounts were critical of the sanctions as well. Although they did not directly focus on the conflict in Tigray.\n\nFacebook\u2019s move comes after severe criticism it has faced in the past for not doing enough to tackle fake accounts during national elections, including in the U.S. The social network has outlined plans in preparation for the Ethiopia vote, including ways to combat misinformation and hate speech.\n\nThe June 21 general elections will see Ethiopians elect members of the House of Peoples\u2019 Representatives.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "text": "Netflix on Sunday, June 13, commenced its first 3-month Episodic Lab (EPL) and Development Executive Traineeship (DET) programmes in Africa. This is in partnership with the Realness Institute, a South Africa-based Centre for African film-makers.\n\nOver 500 applications were received from Nigeria, Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe for the inaugural development lab for African writers and DET initiatives. However, only twelve professionals were selected to take part in both trainings.\n\nTwo Nigerians, Ayoade Adeyanju and Kehinde Joseph, selected to take part in EPL based on their story ideas, will get to develop their concepts with help from expert story consultants and creative producers. Other participants are Andile Ngcizela, Dominique Jossie and Kudakwashe Maradzika from South Africa and Mary Waireri from Kenya.\n\nThe lab participants will receive about $2,000 monthly stipend to enable them to focus entirely on their training, which will run remotely till September 5, 2021. At the end of the lab, each writer will have an opportunity to pitch their incubated concept to Netflix and could see their series further developed for production.\n\nMeanwhile, Ololade Okedare is the only Nigerian selected to participate in the DET, in addition to South Africans Anneke Villet, Antionette Engel and Thandeka Zwane, Damaris Irungu Ochieng\u2019 from Kenya and Lara Sousa, a Mozambican.\n\nThe executive trainees will get to immerse themselves in the story development process and receive technical training by partnering with the EPL writers to develop story concepts into quality productions.\n\nImproving storytelling in Africa\n\nThe Netflix programme is being held to strengthen the foundation of quality storytelling in Africa and is part of efforts by the global streaming giant to produce more original local content from creative writers on the continent.\n\n\u201cWithout the existence of our storytellers, our favourite Netflix stories wouldn\u2019t be possible,\u201d Alison Triegaardt, Netflix manager for Grow Creative in Africa, said. \u201cAfrica has an amazing pool of talent \u2013 both in front and behind the camera \u2013 hence Netflix is committed to investing in African stories and talent long-term.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a 5-day workshop focusing on post-production organised by Netflix is scheduled to be held later this month. The APost Lab is aimed at training film & television professionals from across Africa on technical best practices, technical and creative support methods, and methods to facilitate the best creative process.\n\nThirty-two participants have been invited to participate in the workshops while more than 100 film & TV professionals from across the continent will be part of the Masterclasses.\n\nPotential boost to subscriber base\n\nIn addition to improving quality storytelling in Africa, Netflix would most likely be looking to grow its relatively small subscriber base in the region by producing more relatable, original local content with the help of the development lab.\n\nAccording to a Digital TV Research study, Netflix currently has about 2 million subscribers in Africa, which is half of the continent\u2019s total streaming subscriber base.\n\nThere is a chance having more relatable original African content could lure more viewers on the continent to use the streaming service particularly as the London-based industry researcher estimates streaming subscriptions in Africa will reach 13 million by 2025, up from over 3.9 million in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re energised and excited by the many opportunities that lie ahead for us to help strengthen the quality of African storytelling and to bring fresh voices to our members in Africa and around the world\u201d, Triegaardt concluded.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "It feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction?\n\nHave been running for at least 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nDo you have something truly interesting, like an innovative model?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 6 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to [email protected]).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curios, and even stories indirectly relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify.

          "text": "Kiishu* was still running her undergraduate course when she decided to explore other parts of the country for her six-month internship program. Miles away from home in South-southern Nigeria, she was having an enjoyable learning experience, but with two months to go, she had an awful experience.\n\nShe was sexually assaulted by her host\u2019s friend, who visited, knowing his friend was away on a trip.\n\n\u201cIt was a cold and sad evening,\u201d she recounts, \u201cbut help came, albeit late.\u201d\n\nA trip to the police station provided no succour, even though they knew the culprit. She would eventually be bullied by the perpetrator\u2019s influential family to agree to arbitration outside court \u2014 presided over by her workplace\u2019s governing authority \u2014 with the culprit having only to sign an undertaking to stay away from her after admitting to the crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was hard, but I agreed to take it because I had a short time to spend there.\u201d\n\n\u201cBesides, neither my sponsors nor I could think of any other channel to get help.\u201d\n\nThat was in 2014.\n\nIt\u2019s 2021, but unfortunately, varying degrees of sexual offences are still perpetrated daily, with statistics confirming an increased incidence of the global crime. The United Nations (UN) affirms that the COVID-19-induced lockdowns in 2020 exposed vulnerable people to more risk of sexual violence.\n\nDespite the Nigerian Federal Government launching its first sexual offender register in November 2019, there were so many cases of sexual violence in 2020. Consequently, all 36 state governors declared a state of emergency on rape, agreed to set up a sex offender register, and sign laws to punish the crime.\n\nIn May 2021, Lagos State \u2014 one of the few with an active online sex offender register \u2014 disclosed that it added 206 names to its list of sexual offenders between 2020 and 2021.\n\nHighlighting existing response channels\n\nJust like Kiishu, most sexual assault survivors don\u2019t bother to report their experiences. Their overriding emotion is often fear that their complaints won\u2019t get the required attention, and they\u2019d either be blamed or stigmatised. There is also the possibility that the perpetrator would not be brought to book, further putting them in harm\u2019s way.\n\nHowever, the number of channels currently available to report such cases have increased compared to recent years. Victim support groups, activist movements, non-profit establishments, government-owned humanitarian agencies, and global organisations like the UN are just a few of the options available to victims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA friend introduced me to this support group that helped me talk about my experience. Even though it was years after the incident, I experienced closure and felt I could properly get justice if I wanted to,\u201d Kiishu relays.\n\nApart from support groups, there is the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP), a government-owned organisation that monitors trafficking and sexual-based violence cases.\n\nInterestingly, they have multiple channels \u2014 one of which I tried during my investigation \u2014 for receiving and addressing complaints.\n\nI called the conspicuously written toll-free number on the NAPTIP website and got through to a representative in less than 60 seconds; receiving a response redirecting me to the office closest to me took less than 120 seconds. While the response time was quick, I have no idea how long it would have taken to dispatch help to my location had I been in danger.\n\nThe Agency\u2019s impressive setup is the result of deliberate work done over time.\n\nMr Ganiu Aganran, NAPTIP Zonal Commander for Lagos State, who leads the Sexual and Gender-based Violence unit, tells Techpoint Africa that different tech-enabled channels have made it easier to access help.\n\n\u201cAt the headquarters, we have a 24-hour monitoring centre. When a call is put through, whatever is said is recorded and sent to the appropriate command that will handle it in real-time. We also receive SOS through the website and emails.\u201d\n\nThough he cannot speak to the number of reported cases and prosecuted offenders, he says that \u201cin the Lagos Zonal Command, sometimes, in a week, we have nothing less than 35 cases coming in, including those that come from sister law enforcement agencies through referrals.\u201d\n\nAganran says that social media has been a great tool, and with action taken to address the many cases reported on social platforms, his claim appears to be true.\n\nBetween March and June 2020, several campaigns aimed at getting justice for rape victims trended on social media.\n\nHowever, Aganran submits that the same channel is also responsible for the increasing cases of sexual violence and human trafficking.\n\nHe admits that the Agency would have been able to do more if it has more tools to work with. There are limitations apart from funding,\n\n\u201cThe issue of tracking could come in, but we do tracking through our partners, especially the DSS or the police. These are some of the law enforcement agencies that have this technology, which may not be available when we have to check the environment well to respond promptly.\u201d\n\nHowever, with relevant partnerships, he concludes that the agency can cover more ground.\n\nMore hands at work\n\nAganran attests that the Agency usually looks to partner with private organisations \u2014 for public awareness campaigns, information gathering, and referrals, among others \u2014 so it does not get overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cWe can never have it enough; there are challenges. The issue of logistics is key. You need to be able to move your victims when you rescue them. There are other things like going to court, going to arrest, and going for surveillance; all these demand a lot. But the truth is that working closely with partners, they also come to our aid.\u201d\n\nApart from NAPTIP partners, there are platforms operating in Nigeria that do the same thing.\n\nWhat survivors want: Enter WARIF\u2026\n\nWARIF Webpage\n\nFor obvious reasons, what a survivor wants is to be heard, cared for, and defended. The Women at Risk International Foundation (WARIF) is a non-profit organisation launched in 2016 to respond to and care for young girls and women who are victims of rape.\n\nThe Foundation\u2019s website serves as a channel for anonymous reporting, legal and health assistance, and evidence gathering for the police. It also has a feature that allows survivors to have virtual group therapy.\n\nDuring the lockdown in 2020, it improved the platform\u2019s live chat feature and looked for cases on social media.\n\nGovernment-owned agencies also refer cases to WARIF\u2019s rape crisis centre. And Kemi DaSilva-Ibru, WARIF Founder, disclosed that the centre received up to 300 cases between March and April 2020 in Lagos State.\n\n\u2026 and Helpio app\n\nHelpio App About Page\n\nIn August 2020, Kano-based Android developer and women-in-tech advocate, Sa\u2019adat Aliyu, launched Helpio app, a platform for reporting sexual abuse cases in Nigeria.\n\nAvailable in both Hausa and English languages, users can sign up either as an emergency help centre, report anonymously, share a story, render legal assistance, or provide counselling.\n\nAliyu informs Techpoint Africa that she was inspired to build the platform during the lockdown to remove the hindrances to reporting cases of sexual and gender-based violence and get survivors closer to help.\n\nShe believes that many rape cases are unreported because of the associated stigma. History also plays a part as there are fewer cases of victims getting justice than perpetrators going scot-free.\n\nThis can be put down either to inadequate legal representation or poverty. However, there are non-governmental organisations set up solely to fight against SGBV, which provide financial, legal, medical, or even socio-psychological support to victims of sexual abuse.\n\nWithin the first ten months of launch, the platform already has support groups and certified organisations \u2014 for confidentiality \u2014 signed up to help with reported cases and emergency calls. And for cases requiring counselling, there are experts available for live chats.\n\nStill in its early stage, Aliyu says the platform undergoes regular changes to improve user experience. Subsequently, the platform will reflect real-time statistics of cases and include more localised languages.\n\nShe hopes to get more people to use the platform and render more help.\n\n\u201cThrough the app, over 50+ cases were reported, and the \u201ctalk to experts\u201d feature was among the most-used in the application.\u201d\n\nAganran explains that having recognised their reach, the government wants to take advantage of the opportunities created by platforms like WARIF and Helpio.\n\nWith more tech tools in place, there\u2019s no telling how many cases will be reported, and perpetrators brought to book.\n\nAganran believes that doing nothing isn\u2019t an option as everyone must intervene, show support, or help survivors get what they want.\n\n* \u2013 Not real name",

Duroshola made this announcement today via his Twitter handle and in a Medium post.\n\nI came, I saw and conquered!!! https://t.co/vtdlgCWknP \u2014 Bab\u00e1j\u00edd\u00e9 D\u00far\u00f3sh\u1ecdl\u00e1 (@Babajiide) June 18, 2021\n\nDuroshola took over as Country Manager in 2019. This came after months of speculation regarding the Uganda-founded ride-hailing startup\u2019s launch in the country. During his tenure, the company introduced its finance offerings with users able to purchase airtime on the platform.\n\nThe startup initially announced plans to launch in Lagos following a Series B round, but that never happened. Although not the stated reason, the okada ban in Lagos meant that Safeboda had to launch in Ibadan, where ORide and MAX.ng were already present.\n\nThat decision seems to have paid off, with the company claiming to have completed 1.5 million trips and onboarded over 5,000 drivers. These appear to be impressive figures, especially when you consider that the startup said it had onboarded 2,500 riders and completed 1 million trips on the anniversary of its first year in operation.\n\nAt the time of its launch in Nigeria, there were predictions of bike-hailing wars with ORide and MAX.ng. However, in an interesting turn of events, as Safeboda launched in Ibadan, ORide exited the ride-hailing market.\n\nPerhaps to justify their decision to launch in Ibadan, Safeboda has regularly publicised the number of rides made on the platform. And with MAX.ng not doing the same, it is difficult to say if Safeboda is the dominant player in the ride-hailing industry.\n\nFounded in 2014 by Ricky Rapa Thompson, Maxime Dieudonne, and Alastair Sussock in Uganda, the startup soon spread to Kenya in 2018. However, by 2020, it announced that it was moving out of Kenya, having been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile no announcements have been made regarding Duroshola\u2019s replacement, he hinted that the startup had found a replacement internally.",

          "title": "Nigeria is planning a new telecom licensing regime to rival developed countries",
          "text": "The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has announced plans to restructure the country\u2019s current licensing structure to bring it in line with global standards in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) ecosystem.\n\nThe current structure has served the industry for 18 years since its publication, and as NCC CEO, Umar Danbatta, says, it is due for an \u201curgent review\u201d.\n\nHe also set up a standing committee that would prepare reports and recommendations on existing licences, consultative fora, new licence undertakings, amendment to licence fees and durations, benchmarking of licences with similar jurisdictions, and the impact of certain licences on other licence holders.\n\nThe committee is also expected to recommend solutions and develop an updated regulatory framework for new and amended licences with a final report on the project with all recommendations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanbatta, while inaugurating the committee, said the need for the review of the existing licence structure was informed by the wide range of technological advances and the convergence of technologies and services which have characterised the global telecoms space over the years, and whose impact is increasingly being experienced in Nigeria.\n\nNigeria\u2019s licence structure\n\nNigeria currently favours a two-category regime \u2014 individual and class \u2014 for general and specific services.\n\nClass licences have a flat fee of \u20a610,000 ($24.39), while individual licences are within the range of \u20a6250,000 ($609.76) and \u20a650,000,000 ($121,952.22).\n\nThere will be amendments to fees as the committee is expected to give recommendations based on a comparative analysis of countries with similar jurisdiction.\n\nIn comparison with Nigeria, South Africa also operates a two-category licence structure, but its fees are more expensive. For class licences, they have a flat fee of R13,721 ($971.73), and for individual licences, application costs are determined by the Information Technology Association (ITA).\n\nKenya also operates the same licence regime with prices ranging from Ksh 1000 ($9.28) to Ksh 15 million ($139,146.57).\n\nConsidering all that the committee has to deliberate on, we might see significant changes such as increased licencing fees based on fees in other African countries, new licences relating to 5G implementation, mobile virtual network operators, or over-the-top licences.\n\nGlobal ICT standards\n\nAccording to the International Telecommunication Union\u2019s (ITU) 2020 Global ICT Regulatory Outlook, Nigeria is a third-generation (G3) country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo put this in context, the ITU ranks countries into five generations using Regulatory Tracker indicators divided into four pillars: Regulatory Authority, Regulatory Mandate, Regulatory Regime and Competition Framework. The Regulatory Tracker is an evidence-based tool to help decision-makers and regulators make sense of the rapid evolution of ICT.\n\nWith an overall score of 78.3, Nigeria barely passes the benchmark above G2 countries where basic reform \u2014 partial liberalisation and privatisation across all layers \u2014 occurs.\n\nThe Ethiopian government\u2019s bid to sell off its stake in Ethio Telecom gives more clarity. Before the sale of its first private national telecoms licence to Safaricom\u2019s consortium, the country ranked as a G1 country \u2014 government-owned and controlled industry.\n\nAfter the sale, it was bumped up to a G2 country because the industry had been privatised.\n\nAs a G3 country, Nigeria\u2019s ICT ecosystem enables investment, innovation and access \u2014 dual focus on stimulating competition in service and content delivery, and consumer protection.\n\nKenya is the only African country to rank as a G5 country. According to ITU\u2019s ranking, the East African nation\u2019s ICT Regulatory Framework fosters vibrant markets and is also key to finding market solutions. It also means that Kenya\u2019s ICT regulator plays a leadership role.\n\nIt\u2019s been 18 years since the last licence review. In that time, we\u2019ve seen Glo\u2019s famous per second billing that blew the market wide open, competition leading to reduced \u2014 but still expensive \u2014 data prices, 4G coverage, MainOne\u2019s fiber cable\n\nWill the door be open to new players? Will a new entrant come to break MTN\u2019s dominance? We will have answers when the review is completed.\n\nWhile this move by the NCC shows progressiveness \u2014 especially in light of recent policy amendments \u2014 it appears there are still some ways to go before Nigeria attains global ICT standards.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s travel sector is currently hurting as travellers and airlines operating into Lagos airport are bearing the brunt of poor infrastructure at the airport.\n\nIn the past few days, airlines have had to divert their Lagos-bound flights to Abuja because the centre line lights on 18R, the runway at the international wing, have been unserviceable.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s checks show that before now, the runway lights at 18L, the local wing, were also unserviceable, making it impossible for local airlines to land at the domestic airport at night. This situation forced local airlines to land at the international wing at night, then taxi to local airport.\n\nWith 18R and 18L (domestic and international) runway lights at Lagos airport now non-functional, it means no airline can land or take off at night at both runways.\n\nLagos airport currently processes over 65 percent passenger traffic in Nigeria and travellers bound for Lagos have had to land at Abuja airport because the runway lights at Lagos airport are bad.\n\nExperts say if the lights are not fixed in good time, Abuja airport may soon become congested and airlines may be forced to land at Accra and other neighbouring countries.\n\nOlumide Ohunayo, an aviation analyst, told BusinessDay that Nigeria has had the issue of non-functional runway lights for over 10 years. He said this should be a priority to government but, surprisingly, the government hasn\u2019t done anything about it.\n\nRead Also: BA diverts flight to Abuja as Lagos runway lights collapse\n\nOhunayo said that functional runway lights will improve operational services at Lagos airport, increase flight into the airport and reduce cost of operations for domestic airlines who have to taxi all the way to local airport at night.\n\nHe said government needs to expedite action on providing runway lights not just for Lagos but for all the major airports in the country.\n\n\u201cAs more airlines come on, they need more frequencies and schedules and to operate the schedules, they have to operate beyond the 6pm time. It is only when airlines have frequencies and schedules that they would be able to meet up with their leased aircraft payments,\u201d Ohunayo said.\n\n\u201cIf these frequencies are there, the fares will drop and once fares drop, you have more passengers flying. It\u2019s a win-win for everyone. And once more passengers fly, all the regular agencies would have their revenues increased. Fixing the runway lights at the airport is not a luxury but a component for improving and increasing revenue generation for all parties. It will also improve efficiency and safety,\u201d he said.\n\nBritish Airways on Saturday morning sent a message to its passengers stating clearly that its Friday flight from London to Lagos had to divert to Abuja airport due to local infrastructure issues in Lagos.\n\n\u201cBA075 Lagos \u2013 We\u2019re very sorry your flight to Lagos had to divert to Abuja due to local infrastructure issues in Lagos. Your new estimated departure time is on 19th June at 12:00 local time, arriving into Lagos at around 13:30 local time,\u201d the message said.\n\n\u201cTransport from the hotel will depart for the airport at 08:00 local time. Please continue to check ba.com/flight status,\u201d it said.\n\nOne of the passengers on the BA flight told BusinessDay that his plans for the day had been cancelled as a result of the development. The passenger said it was sad to know that the airport at Nigeria\u2019s mega city did not have functional runway lights.\n\nThe passenger, who craved anonymity, said that this was not the first time a similar situation was occurring despite airport charges passengers pay on each ticket.\n\n\u201cI hear the pilot contemplated landing in Accra. I have never heard of flights to Accra being diverted to Lagos. It is always the other way round. When it is not runway light, it is shortage of aviation fuel or one other failing. We must expose the rot at the Lagos airport. Passengers pay one of the highest airport taxes in the world and get nonsense for it,\u201d a father to one of the affected passengers lamented to BusinessDay.\n\nBusinessDay\u2019s checks show that the Murtala Muhammed International Airport records about 1,540 aircraft movement monthly (arrivals and departures). This implies that the airport records about 51 aircraft movements daily. Therefore, the Lagos airport receives at least 25 arriving aircraft daily from various parts of the world and 25 aircraft departing the city to various parts of the world daily.\n\nAn international aircraft airlifts an average of 250 passengers on a flight. This implies that each day a flight is diverted instead of landing at the Lagos airport, about 6,250 arriving passengers would be affected, while operators would have to pay extra for aviation fuel, accommodation logistics and landing and parking charges at an alternate airport.\n\nTolu Odutola, a pilot and aviation expert, told BusinessDay that for now, passengers that cannot land at the airport would be catered for by the airline, as it is still the responsibility of the carrier until disembarkment while the ones that couldn\u2019t take off are FAAN\u2019s responsibility.\n\nOdutola said the situation doesn\u2019t in any way show that Nigeria is prepared to be West Africa\u2019s aviation hub, adding that to become a hub, the workers in the industry need to be equipped with the right tools to excel.\n\n\u201cWe cannot pay little or no attention to infrastructure and expect miracles to happen,\u201d he stated.\n\nSeyi Adewale, chief executive officer, Mainstream Cargo Limited, told BusinessDay that the incident is very embarrassing for the nation and particularly to the airport authorities.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, this ought to be thoroughly investigated up to escalating it as an \u2018economic and political sabotage\u2019. Anyone found culpable should be treated with the stiff penalties,\u201d Adewale said.\n\nThe immediate impact of infrastructure decay include significant increase in risks associated with Nigeria\u2019s aviation sector with negative consequences for airlines and their \u2018consumers\u2019.\n\n\u201cIf the government is serious about developing the sector, the airports need be privatized or concessioned immediately. The usual limitations or setbacks to this from the aviation unions should be tackled immediately. The Unions must recognize that they need to jettison their \u2018archaic labour theories or tendencies\u2019. The world is moving at a great speed and we must not be left behind,\u201d he said.",
          "summary": "This situation forced local airlines to land at the international wing at night, then taxi to local airport.\nWith 18R and 18L (domestic and international) runway lights at Lagos airport now non-functional, it means no airline can land or take off at night at both runways.\nLagos airport currently processes over 65 percent passenger traffic in Nigeria and travellers bound for Lagos have had to land at Abuja airport because the runway lights at Lagos airport are bad.\nOlumide Ohunayo, an aviation analyst, told BusinessDay that Nigeria has had the issue of non-functional runway lights for over 10 years.\nHe said government needs to expedite action on providing runway lights not just for Lagos but for all the major airports in the country.",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s secret police, the SSS, appears to have taken over investigation into the case of the Akwa Ibom woman who was raped and killed in April by a 20-year-old man, Uduak Akpan, who had lured her with a fake job offer.\n\nThe victim, Iniubong Umoren, 26, was buried in a shallow grave inside the suspect\u2019s family house where she was brutally killed, in the outskirts of Uyo, the Akwa Ibom capital.\n\nThe crime attracted nationwide outrage. Nigerians have been putting pressure on the police to bring her killers to justice.\n\nA former attorney general of Akwa Ibom State, Uwemedimo Nwoko, told PREMIUM TIMES last week that the SSS has taken over the investigation from the police.\n\nMr Nwoko, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, is holding brief in the case for a socio-cultural group, Ati Annang, which promotes and protects the interest of the Annang, one of the ethnic nationalities in Akwa Ibom.\n\nThe late Miss Umoren was an Annang woman. She was an orphan.\n\nShe had just graduated from the Department of Philosophy, University of Uyo, and was hoping she could get a temporary job, make some decent money for herself ahead of the mandatory National Youth Service Corps.\n\nAnd then her dream was suddenly cut short in the most brutal manner.\n\n\u201cOur steps so far have actually led to the matter being further investigated because we (Ati Annang) were not satisfied with the level of investigations that the police carried out, hence we demanded that the matter should be further investigated with all loose ends tight.\n\n\u201cThe transfer of the suspect to the DSS is not a secretive thing, it is a public matter. They have taken custody of the suspect,\u201d Mr Nwoko said.\n\nWhat Mr Nwoko said about the SSS taking over the investigation was corroborated by an official of the Nigeria Correction Service in Uyo who informed PREMIUM TIMES, Friday, that the SSS about a week ago had taken the suspect, Mr Akpan, out from the Ikot Ekpene Correction Centre, along with two other suspects in the case.\n\nThe SSS, apparently conducting their own investigation into Miss Umoren\u2019s killing, took the three suspects away for some days, the correctional officer said on Friday.\n\n\u201cThey (the SSS) have just brought them (the suspects) back (to the correction centre) this evening,\u201d he added.\n\nApart from Mr Akpan who has confessed to the rape and killing of Miss Umoren, another suspect in the case is his father. The other suspect is Emem Emmanuel who is believed to have been part of the plot to lure the victim with the fake job offer.\n\nPolice reaction\n\nThe police spokesperson in Akwa Ibom, Odiko MacDon told this newspaper that the suspects were remanded in the correction centre, but he, however, denied that the case has been taken over by the SSS.\n\nThe spokesperson for the SSS in Abuja, Peter Afunanya, did not respond to calls and a text message seeking comment from him.\n\nA lawyer in Uyo who did not want his name mentioned in the report said the SSS can wade into a case that is being investigated by the police if such a case is believed to have the potential to affect \u201cstate security\u201d.\n\nIf a suspect in a criminal investigation is taken into custody by the SSS, the SSS would eventually have to return them to the police, the lawyer said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMr Nwoko, the lawyer who is holding brief for Ati Annang, told PREMIUM TIMES that it is the office of the attorney general of Akwa Ibom State that would prosecute the case, and not the police.\n\n\u201cIt is not a matter that the police can prosecute, that is why the case file was transferred to the Department of Public Prosecution (DPP).

          "text": "In spite of the overwhelming outcry against the plan to retrace and recover grazing routes across the country, the Federal Government is not showing signs of relenting.\n\nSaturday PUNCH findings revealed that stock routes, popularly called grazing routes, are currently being retraced and recovered by the Federal Government for herders to graze their cattle.\n\nThe Federal Government said this was meant to address the clashes between herdsmen and farmers.\n\nAlthough some of the routes are believed to have been encroached upon due to human activities, Saturday PUNCH found out that the government had embarked on a process of identifying monuments along the routes in order to get them back as locations for cattle grazing.\n\nContrary to the expectations of many Nigerians particularly in South that the grazing routes retracing and eventual recovery might not see the light of day, officials of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development told one of our correspondents on Friday that the routes\u2019 recovery would go on.\n\nThey, however, said it would be done mainly in non-conflict zones.\n\nThey also stated that routes that had been encroached upon as a result of the development of public infrastructure might be left out of the recovery exercise.\n\nThe acting Director, Animal Husbandry Department, FMARD, Winnie Lai-Solarin, stated that while cattle ranching had been one of the major options canvassed for herders, not every pastoralist would be able to afford ranching at the moment.\n\nShe said, \u201cThere are some stock routes that we have across the country, and in the past, we had monuments along these stock routes, particularly the primary stock routes.\n\n\u201cAnd in the course of farming or other human activities along those stock routes, the monuments were altered, but we know where they are. So we are saying that some of them can be retraced.\n\n\u201cAnd this is particularly for areas that are not encroached upon as of now. The pastoralists know the routes, and on some of those routes, you will see the pieces of the monuments along them.\u201d\n\nLai-Solarin added, \u201cSo for those that are not encroached upon and are not in conflict zones, we will go ahead to retrace and guide the pastoralists along them. We didn\u2019t get to where we are today in one day and so we cannot expect that every pastoralist should suddenly start ranching now.\n\n\u201cSome would still have to move but let\u2019s keep the movement as safe as possible and in areas that are not conflict zones. That is what I am saying. We are not going to retrace stock routes where there are infrastructures that are for the public good.\u201d\n\nAnother official at the FMARD familiar with the development stated that the government was not happy with the killings associated with clashes between herdsmen and farmers.\n\nThe official, who requested not to be named for lack of authorisation, explained that the stock routes were in three classes.\n\nThe source said, \u201cWe need to create safe places that are easy for them (herders) to graze their cattle so that they won\u2019t need to travel on the roads. We have primary and secondary stock routes and in some cases, we have tertiary stock routes.\u201d\n\nProviding further explanation on the three classes of routes, the official said, \u201cThe primary stock routes are the major routes that run in a North-to-South direction from the Sahel to the coastal market.\n\n\u201cAnd then, there are some major routes that run inter-state from the North, while others run intra-state.\u201d\n\nThe Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Sabo Nanono, had announced on Thursday that the Federal Capital Territory and 22 states had registered for the National Livestock Transformation Plan as part of measures to establish grazing reserves in their domains.\n\nHe also announced that seven of these states had earmarked 400,000 hectares of land for the initiative, as the establishment of grazing reserves were currently ongoing in Nasarawa, Borno, Niger, Kaduna and some other states.\n\n\u201cTwenty-two states and the Federal Capital Territory have registered with the NLTP office, out of which 10 states have created their own teams which have been trained by the federal office,\u201d Nanono stated.

          "text": "By Ibrahim Bello\n\nKebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu, has vowed to lead hunters and vigilantes in the battlefield against bandits ravaging the state.\n\nHe also joined his counterpart in Ekiti, Dr. Kayode Fayemi to charged the hunters and vigilantes to be ready to defend the territories of states against frequent attacks by bandits.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the governors stated this on Saturday in Birnin Kebbi while addressing hundreds of local hunters and vigilance groups from different parts of the state.\n\nThe groups had converged on the state capital to declare their readiness to wage war against bandits.\n\nBagudu, in an emotion laden-voice, told the hunters that he and other governors were ready to be on the battle fields to defend the lives of the people, their property and territories of the nation.\n\n\u201cWe are not military yet and we are not police. We commend and respect what the security agencies for what they are doing and they are doing a great job; but, sometimes, remember security agents are human beings.\n\n\u201cThey also want the community support; they want the support from the vigilantes. So, if we can go to electioneering campaign rallies and gather 100,000 people, what has taken place in Birnin Yauri should be the last strike.\n\n\u201cWe should follow these bandits wherever they are and deal with them all. And I call on all my colleagues in other states too, to do same. How many are they (bandits)? How many of us can they kill?\n\n\u201cSo, we will discuss with the security agencies so that we don\u2019t interfere in the commendable jobs they are doing. But we will go out there, like I promised you; on the day we move out, I will not be in office; I will join you in the field.\n\n\u201cAnd I am sure other governors will be leading their people so that we can all meet in the fields. It is not the weapons that win the war, it is the will of the people. Bad people cannot trample upon the will of good people, and we will show them that we have the will power,\u201d he charged.\n\nBagudu also commended President Muhammadu Buhari and security agencies for doing their best with limited resources, stressing the need for the people to mobilise themselves and take on the bandits.\n\n\u201cYes, we are afraid of death; nobody wants to die. But who will not die? We are afraid not to be hurt, but who will not be hurt?\n\n\u201cWhich one is more tragic? To die like a coward. I think that should be the greatest fear; or to die without faith?\n\n\u201cBecause, as the people of faiths, we know that our Scriptures, both Christians and Muslims, especially Muslims, Islam teaches us to put our lives at risk in defending our honours, or our property or our faith.\n\n\u201cIn all what these bandits are doing to us, they have challenged our faiths, our property and our honours and we can\u2019t allow them to go.\n\n\u201cSo, go back to your communities and mobilise your people because I will get clearance from the security and we will meet them on the field,\u201d the governor urged.\n\nIn his remarks, Fayemi, who is also Chairman of Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF), charged the hunters and people of the state to use all power within their possession to end bandits attack in the state.\n\nHe said: \u201cOur governor (Bagudu) has put on a good fight. That is the demonstration of his commitment to the welfare of his people.\n\n\u201cWe know, we would overcome these challenges. There are lessons from it, for our own states too; where we have Federal Government Colleges, and we have ordinary schools belonging to the state.\n\n\u201cAnd we must protect our children, we must protect our people because our first job as the governors is the security and welfare of our people.\n\n\u201cGod Almighty will be with us to realise the objective of protecting our people, in sha Allahu,\u201d Fayemi said.\n\nSpeaking earlier, Jigawa Gov. Abubakar Badaru, who also accompanied Fayemi, charged the local hunters to use all power within their possession to rescue and defeat bandits terrorising the state.",

Aminu Bello Masari, has said that banditry in Katsina State and environs was peculiar as it does not represent any ideology, doctrine, religion, or political party.\n\nThis is even as he commended the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) for its responsiveness in the fight against armed banditry and other forms of criminality in Katsina State and other states in Northwest Nigeria.\n\nGovernor Masari gave this commendation when he paid a courtesy call on the CAS at NAF Headquarters, Abuja.\n\nDirector of Public Relations and Information Nigerian Air Force, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet in a statement noted that Governor Masari said that banditry in Katsina is pure criminality.\n\nThe Governor also revealed that the Katsina State Government have made several efforts to engage the bandits, but the moves have yielded little or no result as each group operates independently.\n\nThe security situation in the state, he said, was compounded by the vastness of the Katsina open border with Niger Republic as well as the huge ungovernable spaces in the State which gives the bandits freedom of movement.\n\nHe expressed sadness that the activities of these miscreants which was associated with wanton destruction of lives and properties, kidnapping, rape and arson has greatly affected the progress of the State.\n\nEven more worrisome, according to the Governor, was the sad fact that these bandits attack the same locality they reside in and people they have lived with for years.\n\nNoting that the primacy of governance can only be felt when peace and security is achieved, Governor Masari noted that all efforts must be made to root out banditry to restore sanity and normalcy in the entire North-western Nigeria.\n\nHe expressed happiness with the level of synergy among the various security agencies and stated that the result of the new level of cooperation has started yielding the requisite outcome with some level of normalcy being felt in some areas of the State.\n\nHe therefore called on the collective support of Nigerians as the military work round the clock to ensure the protection of lives and properties.\n\nHe also noted that the glaring commitment and dedication of the Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, as well as the efforts of NAF personnel at the forefront of on-going operations in the Northeast has significantly curtailed the activities of the bandits and limited their scope of operation.\n\nThe Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao thanked Governor Masari for his support to the NAF and other security agencies in Katsina State.\n\nHe also informed the Governor of NAF\u2019s firm support for the Governor\u2019s stance of not negotiating with bandits, while assuring him that in no distant time, the security situation would take a turn for the better.\n\nAir Marshal Oladayo also used the opportunity of the visit to inform the Governor that the mandate given the service chiefs by President Muhammadu Buhari was clear and unambiguous: \u201cDeal decisively with all bandits and other criminal elements in the country\u201d.\n\nAccording to the CAS, \u201cWith the induction of new platforms including the Super Tucanos and other platforms in the next month or 2, there will be no hiding place for these bandits\u201d.\n\nOn ongoing NAF operational projects in Katsina State, Air Marshal Amao assured Governor Masari that when completed, the projects would enhance the operational capabilities and reach of NAF platforms in the State.",

We are here to let them know that they can enhance their livelihoods through specific digital training while leveraging their God-given talents and skills.\n\n\u201cOur core mission is to eradicate hunger, and we can only do that if our communities have the necessary tools and knowledge to lift them out of poverty,\u201d he stressed.\n\nAlso speaking, the Secretary of the Kwachingoro IDP camp, Abuja, , Mr. Luka Yathuma, expressed appreciation to NHI-IndigoAfrica-NHFBS management for the initiative and urged other groups and individuals to emulate such gesture.\n\n\u201cWe are very grateful to No Hunger Initiatives (NHI). Our people have suffered but we thank NHI for always coming to our aid with food and other essential items.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to NHI for this training, my people would have used their meagre monetary resources to receive the training but now, NHI is offering it to us free. Thank you, thank you, thank you,\u201d he said.\n\nYathuma disclosed that no fewer than 30 internally displaced persons attended the \u2018Dignified IDP\u2019 training, comprising 20 young women and 10 young men.\n\n\u201cWe are excited that 67 per cent of the trainees are young women. From a gender perspective, this gendered result will further inform NHI\u2019s EAT programme towards Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related initiatives like \u2018girls-and-boys-who-code,\u201d he said.",

In doing so, we must take realistic and practical decisions which will positively impact our citizens,\u201d he was quoted as saying in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu.\n\nPresident Buhari added, \u201cSome of those decisions, necessarily will have to do with evolving political and security situations in our sub-region as well as evaluate the health of our organisation with the hope of repositioning to serve our people and sub-region better.\n\n\u201cWhile democracy continues to develop in our sub-region, recent events in Mali are sad reminders that vigilance remains a crucial imperative to protect people\u2019s aspirations to freely choose the form of government they want.\n\n\u201cPressures are needed to ensure that the transition process in Mali, which is halfway to its conclusion, is not aborted.\n\n\u201cA further slide in Mali could prove catastrophic to the Sub-region, considering that about half of that country is unfortunately under the grip of terrorists.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: South East Governors Condemn Violent Secessionist Groups, Back United Nigeria\n\nThe Nigerian leader, therefore, appealed to the military leadership in Mali to understand the critical state of their country, which he described as being \u2018clearly under siege\u2019.\n\nNoting that the principal responsibility of the military must be to protect and guarantee the sovereignty of the West African country, the President cautioned them not to perpetuate acts that would facilitate the destabilisation and destruction of Mali.\n\n\u201cI urge our organization to remain engaged with all stakeholders in Mali through our astute Mediator, former President Goodluck Jonathan, who, I congratulate warmly, for his untiring efforts thus far.\n\n\u201cI encourage him to sustain these efforts to ensure that the transition is completed as scheduled,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Libya, President Buhari faulted the recent United Nations Resolution to expel all foreign fighters in Libya, without first ensuring that they were disarmed.\n\nHe lamented that while the decision was aimed at bringing about sustenance of peace in Libya, non-collaboration with regional stakeholders has created newer threats to peace, security and stability in the region.\n\nThe President warned that this could lead to lack of coordinated management of huge humanitarian crisis across the Sahel, North, Central and West Africa, including the Lake Chad region.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt is imperative that ECOWAS leaders, at this Summit, decide how the UN-Sub-regional organisations partnerships should be reviewed to address the dangers that this UN Resolution poses to the region.\u201d\n\nThe statement by the Nigerian leader at the Summit also addressed other pertinent issues of concern in the organisation, including the ongoing institutional reforms in ECOWAS.\n\nDeclaring Nigeria\u2019s unequivocal support to the reforms process, he said he looked forward to an ECOWAS that would be \u2018fit for purpose\u2019, delivering services to the satisfaction of the community citizens.\n\nHe commended the President of the Commission and his team, the Ad-hoc Ministerial Committee on Institutional Reforms as well as the Council of Ministers for the excellent report presented to the Authority of Heads of State.\n\nIn his capacity as the ECOWAS champion on the fight against COVID-19, President Buhari also drew attention to the need for more citizens in the region to be vaccinated, stressing the need for adherence to other non-pharmaceutical interventions.\n\nHe said the West African region was in the grip of a third wave, warning against complacency in national and regional initiatives to address the pandemic.\n\nPresident Buhari reaffirmed Nigeria\u2019s commitment to the noble objectives of the organisation, saying, \u201cI encourage us to take bolder steps towards ensuring that the organisation fulfils the aspirations of its founding fathers, which include a truly integrated sub-region, economically, politically, socio-culturally united and secured to permit its sustainable development and growth.\u201d",

Initially it looked like the Chelsea forward had got his foot to tap it into the net but replays showed the ball had come off Dias.\n\nGermany added to their lead on 39 minutes after putting a number of crosses into the box. The ball was pinging around the penalty area with Havertz and Joshua Kimmich attempting to land it in the net. Guerreiro attempted to clear the ball but instead put it in his own net.\n\nHavertz was able to get his name on the scoresheet officially in the second half after Gosens, who was everywhere for Germany, put a low cross into the box that Havertz tapped in.\n\nGermany had the game wrapped up after an hour when Kimmich launched another corner into the box. Both Havertz and Gosens rose to meet it but it was the latter who got his head to the ball and put it past Rui Patricio.\n\nRonaldo repaid Jota for his earlier assist on 67 minutes. Portugal were awarded a free kick on the edge of the penalty box which was flicked on and looked like it was going to go wide.\n\nHowever, Ronaldo managed to keep it in and flashed it across the face of goal where Jota was waiting to point it into the net.\n\nFrance lead Group F with four points after drawing 1-1 with Hungary earlier in the day. Both Germany and Portugal are on three points with the former ahead in second place on goal difference.",
