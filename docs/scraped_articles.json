          "title": "Anambra accident: Police react as truck drivers block Onitsha-Owerri road",
          "text": "The Anambra State Police Command on Saturday reacted to the fatal accident which occurred at a police checkpoint on the Onitsha-Owerri Road, Ihiala Local Government of the state.\n\nThe accident occurred when a truck with number plate UWZ556XA, rammed into six other vehicles around Ken Maduako Oil and Gas Filling Station along the Ihialla-Onitsha road area of the state, killing two persons and injuring nine others on Friday.\n\nIt was gathered that the truck driver, who was on a top speed, while approaching the police checkpoint at Ihiala, lost control and rammed into the vehicles on the queue at the checkpoint and crashed.\n\nNo fewer than 63 persons were involved in the crash as it also involved commercial vehicles. Some motorists escaped unhurt.\n\nIt was gathered that the accident created some pandemonium around the scene as members of the truck drivers union blocked the busy Onitsha-Owerri Road, on noticing that the accident was a result of the police checkpoint in the area.\n\nThe truck drivers mobilised heavy trucks around the scene of the accident and blocked the ever busy highway on both sides, an action, which caused heavy gridlock on that road.\n\nThe real reason for their actions was not provided, but eyewitnesses said they were protesting the havoc the police checkpoint is causing motorists on that road, as a similar event had occurred a few months ago on that axis.\n\nThe eyewitness lamented that motorists are always being asked to come down from their vehicles to trek past the police checkpoint, an action that has become a burden to the motoring public.\n\nHowever, the state Commissioner of Police, CP Echeng Echeng, had commiserated with the families of the two persons who died and the nine others, who sustained injuries in the accident.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, the police spokesman, DCP Ikenga Tochukwu, identified the driver of the truck as one of the victims that died in the crash while attributing the fatal crash to overspeeding and brake failure by the trailer driver.\n\nThe police said the truck drivers were misinformed about the cause of the accident, which led to their protest while appealing to them to have a rethink.\n\nThe statement read in part, \u201cWhile the Police indeed have a \u2018Stop and Search Point\u2019 close to the scene of the accident, it is wrong to blame the police for the unfortunate incident.\n\n\u201cThe fact that only six vehicles were on the queue on a dual carriageway as busy as that expressway is evidence that the Police has been responsible and sensitive to the plight of the motoring public by ensuring minimal delay as it conduct its stop and search operations aimed at protecting not only Police facilities in the area from insurgents\u2019 attacks, but also the general public, who are mostly at the receiving end of escapades by criminal elements.\u201d\n\nThe police boss, however, commended the officers of the Federal Road Safety Corps for promptly rising to the occasion and partnering with them in getting the injured to the hospital and clearing the wreckage from the road to allow for free flow of traffic.\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that drivers of container bearing trailers, under the umbrella of their union, who were misinformed about the cause of the accident mobilised heavy trucks to the scene at about 1630 hours on the day of the accident and blocked the ever busy highway on both sides.\n\n\u201cAll entreaties made to them to consider the plight of the motoring public fell on deaf ears. Innocent motorists were at the receiving end of this ill-advised blockade.\n\n\u201cThe Nigeria Police wish to appeal to the unionists to have a rethink in the interest of their fellow citizens and consider the plight of stranded travellers to remove the blockade from the highway. The Police will continue to explore peaceful means of resolving the imbroglio to prevent further loss of precious human lives,\u201d the statement added.\n\nIt also added that the CP, while thanking the good public for their robust support, assured them that the Police would continue to raise the bar of service delivery in the interest and safety of the law-abiding public.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "text": "The retired teachers in Anambra State have protested the nonpayment of their gratuities by the state government for four years.\n\nThey, therefore, asked Governor Willie Obiano to pay the backlog of their gratuities which had accrued since 2017 before leaving office in March.\n\nThe angry retirees protested along the Teachers\u2019 House Road, Awka, on Friday, carrying placards with various inscriptions.\n\nSome of the placards read, \u201cObiano, pay us our pension and gratuity in line with the approved structure,\u201d \u201cGive us our arrears of pension,\u201d \u201cOur gratuities are our rights,\u201d \u201cPay us now that we are alive,\u201d and \u201cIs it when we die that others will collect what we worked for?\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson of the group, Mrs Victoria Maduka, who retired as a Zonal Director in 2018 from Ogidi zone, explained that many of them, including those who retired in 2017, were yet to receive any payment from the government having served for thirty-five years.\n\nMaduka expressed regret that the situation had adversely affected them, as they struggled to eat, pay hospital and electricity bills as well as house rents and children\u2019s school fees.\n\nShe said that it was unfortunate that despite the letter they wrote to the government three weeks ago, no response had been given to them as regards what was delaying their gratuities in the last four years.\n\nAccording to her, though the tenure of the present administration would end in less than one month, they believed their emoluments could still be paid considering the efforts and sacrifices they had put in moving the state forward.\n\nAnother retiree, Mr. Raymond Achebe, while narrating the impact of the long denial of their monies on their families, appealed to the government to consider their plights and pay them.\n\nThe teachers lamented that they recently buried a deputy director, who died while waiting for the state government to pay her emoluments after 35 years of service.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

He said the new Mayor of Urhobo Land was he who tamed rather than supported the Avengers in their onslaught against the economic wellbeing of the nation.\n\nAkpodoro, he noted deserves all the honours and privileges in Urhobo Land owing to his unwavering belief in the Urhobo project noting that the Mayor remains the only Urhobo Youth who can hold his own anywhere in the world without let or hindrance and on account of this labyrinth of achievements, he conferred on Akpodoro, who is the National Taskforce Chairman, of the Association of Nigerian Refineries and Petroleum Marketers, ANRPM the Mayoral honour.\n\n\u201cIn recognition of your outstanding and excellent distortions to the development and growth of Urhoboland, you are awarded the Mayor and we hope you take Urhobo nation to the highest level.

          "text": ".\n\n.. say status quo should be maintained\n\n..as DC-23 visits, lobby Delta North Monarchs\n\nBy Festus Ahon, ASABA\n\nAS the struggle for which senatorial district should produce the next Governor of the State ranges on, Delta North Traditional Rulers Forum, Friday, insisted on senatorial zoning arrangement, arguing that zoning based on ethnicity was not tenable.\n\nChairman of the Forum, Obi (Prof) Chike Edozien who disclosed this when the Delta Central Senatorial District, DC-23 led by Senator Ighoyota Amori paid a consultative visit to Anioma traditional rulers, said the status quo of the zoning arrangement put in place in the days of former Governor James Ibori should be maintained.\n\nEdozien who was joined by over 35 Delta North Traditional Rulers in his Palace to receive the DC-23 delegates, said: \u201cDelta State is for everybody and as traditional rulers, we preach peace because we want peace to reign. When there is peace, there will be progress.\n\n\u201cWe all know very well the position of Delta State in the nation\u2019s economy. Therefore, Delta State cannot afford to make mistakes, we can\u2019t afford to have peace because anything that disturbs Delta State peace is going to affect the whole country.\n\n\u201cThis is our State, we don\u2019t have any other place to relocate to; we want peace in Delta State. The Governorship zoning system that has been working for us is on senatorial basis. The central has gone, which is Chief James Ibori, Delta South has gone, Dr Emmanuel Uduaghan and today our son, Dr Ifeanyi Okowa is on the saddle.\n\n\u201cWhen we were going round to canvass for support in 2015 for Delta North, our campaign was based on senatorial district. Today Delta North, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa is now the Governor, which by God\u2019s grace his tenure will end in a year time.\n\n\u201cFor somebody from Delta North to say he wants to be governor after Senator Ifeanyi Okowa is wrong, not that the person does not have the constitutional right, but is going to be a fruitless effort because the person will end up wasting his money. We Delta Northerners know that is our son that is occupying that position now.\n\n\u201cIn Anioma Congress, we have the political class, we have the traditional rulers class and the business class. Our political class and business class have not come to us the traditional rulers to say there is a change in the zoning pattern. Even our son, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa has not come to us to say there is a different arrangement apart from the senatorial zoning which we have been using.\n\n\u201cSince they have not come to us to say otherwise, the status quo remains, which means the senatorial district zoning arrangement is what we will still maintain. I, therefore, call on Urhobo people, which is Delta Central to be steadfast and put their house together.\n\n\u201cI congratulate DC-23 for being able to prune the aspirants to three. Any of these persons, Olorogun David Edevbie, Olorogun Kenneth Gbagi and Rt Hon Sheriff Oborevwori are all qualified to be Governor. I have known these three persons very well.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, National Chairman of DC-23, Senator Ighoyota Amori solicited the support of the Delta North Traditional Rulers, arguing that it was the turn of the Delta Central Senatorial District to produce the next Governor.\n\nAmori said Delta Central have waited for 16 years, adding that it was only proper to allow them to come in after Governor Ifeanyi Okowa.\n\nHe maintained that zoning along ethnic nationality was not practicable, saying that the state was made up of seven ethnic groups.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

The EFCC was then in charge of NIA bank accounts.\n\nIn a statement at the weekend, EFCC Head of Media, Wilson Uwujaren said Mohammed was not its staff.\n\nThe spokesman noted that the claim was false and intended to mislead the public.\n\n\u201cFor the avoidance of doubt, the EFCC has no accountant by name, Jafaru Mohammed and could not have appointed him to serve in another agency.\n\n\u201cIt is infantile to suggest that the Commission would appoint an accountant for the National Intelligence Agency, NIA, which is not a department of the EFCC.\u201d\n\nAfter Abdulrasheed Bawa assumed office last year, the EFCC secured an interim forfeiture order on assets linked to Mohammed.\n\nIn March 2021, Justice Folashade Ogunbanjo of the Federal High Court in Abuja, in suit FHC/ABJ/CS/007/2021, directed the seal of the properties.\n\nA House on Plot 7, God\u2019s Own Estate, Road 1, Wamna District, Abuja; a fenced plot at No 1 Jubril Aminu Crescent, Katampe Extension, Abuja; a plot at Kubwa Express, opposite Abuja Model City Gate; a house on Block SD 22 House 2, Road 5, Kabusa Garden Estate, Abuja.\n\nOthers are No 15, 21 Crescent, 2nd Avenue, Gwarinpa Estate, Abuja; No 3 Liverpool Close, Sun City Estate, Abuja; No 52 Mainstreet, Sun City Estate, Abuja; No 25 Osaka Street, Sun City Estate, Abuja.\n\nOn February 14, 2022, Justice N.

Ifeoluwa Oyedele and his team on Tuesday, Engr. Sule, who was represented by his deputy, Dr. Emmanuel Akabe, said with the completion of the substation has come \u201cpraise galore for the government of President Muhammadu Buhari across the state.\u201d\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nHe thanked President Buhari, the management and staff of NDPHC, and all those involved in the execution of the project, stressing that it will definitely improve the economy of Nasarawa State.\n\n\u201cSmall, medium, and micro enterprises will all thrive because they need energy,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, Oyedele had commended the Governor and his predecessor, Alhaji Tanko Al-Makura for their doggedness in the pursuit for the development of their State.\n\nHe said, although the National Integrated Power Projects (NIPP), Lafia Substation was funded by the Federation, it was important to emphasise the contributions of Engr. Sule and his predecessor.\n\n\u201cOn the day that we came to take over this site, a Certificate of Occupancy had been issued. In three years, no worker \u2013 whether expatriate or local has been harassed \u2013 not to talk of being kidnapped or any such thing.\n\n\u201cAnd since the incumbent Governor took over, he has assumed the role of Project Manager. He has visited this site more than 33 times. He is purely showing good example. To see a Governor who is interested in the progress and development of his people, is commendable. I remember that he visited the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP), the Nigeria Customs Service and the Federal Ministry of Finance to facilitate the early release of imported materials for the project when their clearance was being delayed. If all Nigerians are like this, this country would be a better place.\u201d\n\nThe Lafia Transmission Substation is equipped with State-of-the-Art Digital Control and Protection facilities with fully functional Human-Machine-Interface (HMI) that enhances real-time operational flexibility, monitoring & control of all the substation electrical variables.\n\nThe project will also help to provide back feed to the FCT, whenever necessary since FCT is being served from Shiroro and Geregu Power Stations.",

He said that a year ago, aviation fuel was sold at N190 per litre, but that the cost has risen to N400 per litre and that considering the fact that fuel takes up at least 30 per cent of operation cost, many airlines will struggle if there is no price adjustment.\n\n\u201cThe least ticket we sold a year ago was N23, 000 when aviation fuel was N190 and the official rate of naira to a dollar then was N340, but today, if forex is available, it is N450 but when it is not available, the alternative market is N570 to a dollar. Despite this, you can still buy your ticket at N20, 000 to N21, 000 and what this means is that as long as all the airlines are buying from the same market and selling tickets at the current rates, any ticket that you buy is being subsidised by the airlines. Why did I say this? aviation fuel, depending on the aircraft type you are flying, could take up to about 30 to 40 per cent of your cost components.\n\n\u201cAs you know, for every ticket you sell, you give five per cent of Ticket Sales Charge (TSC) to the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), you have other deductions to the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) and to other airport owners. As a matter of fact, by the time you remove these deductions from the N20, 000 that you charge, you have to use your money to take care of other operational needs.\n\n\u201cIn year 2000, you may have bought an air ticket at N2,000, which was about $100 then and 99 per cent of aviation component is foreign exchange denominated. From that N2, 000 up till now, the cost of aircraft has not reduced, salaries to staff have increased, the landing charges and other charges have increased, yet this item of ticket remains same. Safety is very critical in aviation business, but you cannot deal with safety in isolation of efficient operations. It must come with proper financing of your operations. The cost of tickets is very important, yet aviation is a chain and the airline operators are at the centre of the chain. However, there is need to establish a better customer service with operators,\u201d Okonkwo said.",
          "summary": "By Chinelo ObogoAirline Operators of Nigeria (AON) have resolved to increase the cost of economy flight tickets to a minimum of N50, 000 nationwide, Saturday Sun has learned.\nSaturday Sun can also confirm that the increment has already taken effect as a visit to the website of many of the airlines show that economy tickets now sell for N50, 000.\nAt the time of filing this report, economy tickets from Lagos to Abuja which used to cost between N29, 000 and N35, 000, now cost N50, 000.\nThe websites of Dana Air, United Nigeria, Azman Air, Air Peace and Max Air show that economy tickets from Lagos to Abuja are from N50,000.\nHowever, Green Africa, which used to sell for N20, 000 is now selling at N39, 000, excluding cost of baggage.",

          "text": "From Kenneth Udeh, Abuja\n\nA bill for the amendment of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) to create a criminal justice administration legislation that is more effective and humane has been commended by stakeholders, including government agencies and civil rights organisations, among others.\n\nThe bill is sponsored by Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr Orji Uzor Kalu. While applauding the motive of the bill and its sponsor, stakeholders at Wednesday\u2019s public hearing also presented their recommendations to some provisions of sections of the proposed amendment of the Criminal Justice Act.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nThe public hearing of the bill entitled, \u2018Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015 (Amendment) Bill, 2020 (SB: 465) organised by the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters; and Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes, had several Federal Government security agencies in attendance. They include the Nigerian Correctional Services (NCS), the Nigerian Navy, National Security Adviser (NSA), Nigerian Immigration Services (NIS), Nigerian Air Force (NAF), the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and others.\n\nIn his presentation on the legislative proposals, Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya commended the motive. He however sought the replacement of some words in Section 14 (3) of the ACJA. General Yahaya who was represented by the Nigerian Army\u2019s Director of Legal Services, Major Mahmood Wambai, suggested that the words \u201cshall be done in the presence of\u201d in Section 14(3) of ACJA should be replaced with \u201cmay be done within the sighting distance of.\n\nHe stressed that this would give the detaining officer the power to determine the circumstances to permit unrestricted communication between the detainee and any other person.\n\nHe added that it would also aid the use of eavesdropping devices during such communications. He said: \u201cThe circumstances here could include the nature of the allegation against the detainee, his/her criminal history and the status of the visitor.\u201d On the amendment to Section 17, subsection 3, the Army opposed the inclusion of a new paragraph which reads \u201csuch an interpreter shall be at the instance and choice of the suspect held in custody.\u201d\n\nThe Army held that it is always the constitutional responsibility of the state to provide an interpreter in all proceedings where a suspect does not understand the language of the court, stressing that the responsibility should not be shifted to the suspect who could end up choosing an interpreter that may do his/her biddings.\n\nMaking further recommendations the Nigerian Army also sought another inclusion to the proposed amendment to Section 172 of ACJA which seeks to add the words; \u201ceither orally or by a motion on notice \u201c before the words; \u201con application to court \u201c. The Army suggested that the following words could be added; \u201csubject to the discretion of the Judge\u201d after the proposed amendment. This according to the COAS will confer on the judge the powers to direct that such application shall be on notice in appropriate cases.\n\nLauding the initiative to amend the ACJA, the office of the National Security Adviser (NSA), Gen Babagana Monguno described the amendment as a welcome development. He was represented by his spokesperson, Zakari Usman. The Nigerian Correctional Service in a submission by its Controller-General, Haliru Nababa applauded the proposed legislative amendment to the ACJA. In its submission the NCS agreed with the amendments Sections 8(4), 14, 17, and 162.\n\nHaliru, who was represented by a top official of the NCS at the public hearing, however opposed the amendments to Sections 223 and Section 229. He maintained that the section does not infringe on the principle of fair hearing. He said: \u201cIt does not in any way make the hearing time unreasonable, and has not interfered with the independence and impartiality of a court or other tribunal established by law.\u201d\n\nOn its part, the Nigerian Navy disagreed with the deletion of Paragraph 6 section 223 and 229.\n\nChief of Naval Staff , Vice Admiral AZ Gambo, who was represented by Navy\u2019s Director of Admin, Rear Admiral Kennedy Egbuchulam stated that the section of the ACJA proposed to be deleted has similar provisions in Sections 226(6) and 142 of the Penal Code Act and Armed Forces Act Laws of the Federation of Nigeria respectively.\n\nThe paragraph 6 of the bill is seeking to delete the provisions of Sections 223 and 229 of the Administration of the Criminal Justice Act (ACJA) 2015. It reads that: \u201cWhere a defendant is charged with one offence and it appears in evidence that he committed a similar offence with which he might have been charged under the provisions of this Act, he may be convicted of the offence, which he is shown to have committed, although he was not charged with it,\u201d and \u201cwhere a defendant is charged with an offence relating to property and the evidence establishes the commission by him with respect to the same property of another offence, he may be convicted of that other offence although he was not charged with it.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Nigerian Navy, the intention of the above provisions is that an accused person can be convicted for similar or kindred offences based on evidence on record. Gambo said the extant provisions of the ACJA which was being proposed for deletion do not constitute a breach of the right of fair hearing of an accused person.\n\nRendering special commendations to the bill\u2019s sponsor, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, Centre for Socio-Legal Studies described the proposed amendments sought by the bill as highly laudable and commendable.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\nIn a speech read by the centre\u2019s President, Prof Yemi Akinseye \u2013 George (SAN), he said the bill\u2019s amendment would address the emerging developments and judicial pronouncements on some of the provisions of the extant Act \u201cas it is intended to address the aspect of concern noticed in the course of implementing the Administration of Criminal Justice Act 2015.\u201d\n\nEarlier in his remarks, sponsor of the bill and Chief Whip of the Senate, Orji Uzor Kalu, said the legislative proposal seeks to amend in the Administration of Criminal Justice Act of 2015, the sections contradicting the principles of fair hearing and court jurisdiction as provided in the Constitution. This, he said, is to avert some loggerheads between the Administration of Criminal Justice Act and the constitution.\n\nKalu, who was represented at the event by Senator Abdu Kwari, maintained that the nation\u2019s constitution is supreme and its provisions shall have binding force on all authorities and persons throughout the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nKalu emphasised that in line with the provision of the constitution, all authorities in Nigeria shall conform to the constitutional provision.\n\n\u201cTherefore the Administration of Criminal Justice Act shall conform with the supreme provision of the 1999 Constitution as amended.\n\n\u201cEach legal norm of the society derives its validity from the basic norm. Any other law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution must give way or abate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court has also held that- \u2018The constitution of a nation is the \u2018fons et origo\u2019 not only of the jurisprudence but also of the legal system,\u201d Kalu said. The former governor of Abia State said the various High Court Rules and Court of Appeal Rules have provisions with regards to the position of pending cases when judges are elevated, adding that more often the position is for the matter to start de novo.\n\nHe added that although the constitution says in Section 252(2) that the National Assembly will by law make provision conferring upon the Federal High Court additional powers to those conferred by the Constitution, there exists a lacuna in respect of the position of an elevated judge from the High Court to the Court of Appeal (that is there is a gap that needs to be filled).\n\nSaid he: \u201cIt will be advisable that the Act be amended to expressly handle the gap created when judges are elevated to the next bench, by being given the right or powers to conclude part-heard cases before moving to the next level.\n\n\u201cOur judicial system recognizes and applies the rule of stare decisis, meaning rules of precedent and hierarchy of courts. More so, our courts are classified according to the constitution and other extant laws. We should clearly demarcate or clearly spell out jurisdiction of court to avoid contradiction and uncertainty.\u201d\n\nExplaining further, the Senate Chief Whip reiterated the aspiration of the legislative amendment to create a criminal justice administration legislation that is both more effective and more humane.\n\nHis words: \u201cBy \u2018more effective,\u2019 I mean that we should respond to crime in ways that produce socially desirable results\u2014greater safety, less fear, less suffering, greater respect for the rule of law and less injustice\u2014and that we do so efficiently, investing our precious financial and human resources in ways that maximize the results we desire.\n\n\u201cBy \u2018more humane,\u2019 I mean we should respond to crime in ways that recognize the humanity of those victimized by crime, those arrested and convicted of crime, and others who experience the ripple effects of crime and our justice system. This affirmation of humanity, as I see it, incorporates values we hold dear in our democracy, such as equal protection of the laws, access to the rights guaranteed by our constitution, and our fundamental belief in the dignity of the individual.\u201d\n\nThe ACJA Amendment Bill passed First Reading on June 30 2020. It also passed the Second Reading on December 8 2020.",

          "text": "From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Osogbo\n\nIt is bound to be a battle of the titans as the state\u2019s All Progressives Congress (APC) holds its primary election today. The soul of the party is being fought for between Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, the Minister of Interior, and the fourth civilian governor of Osun State, and the current Governor, Gboyega Oyetola, who also doubles as his successor.\n\nThe earth is literally going to shake as supporters of Aregbesola, and Oyetola who is seeking for a re-election to which his predecessor is vehemently opposed seek to outdo each other at the polls. Already, Aregbesola has urged the party faithful in the state to come out in their thousands to ensure that his anointed candidate, Moshood Adeoti, emerges the party\u2019s chosen one. But in a related development, a faction of the party loyal to him has raised the alarm over alleged plan by Oyetola to rig the election.\n\nNigerians can now work and earn dollars DAILY from home. Regular individuals can earn as low as $300 daily Find out how it works.\n\nIts governorship aspirant of the party and the former Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti who addressed a press conference in Osogbo yesterday faulted Governor Oyetola\u2019s membership of the National Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (NCECPC) of APC till date.\n\nHe said the governor\u2019s failure to resign from the committee was as a result of his influence that he claimed was against the party\u2019s constitution, adding that the governor would use the advantage over him in the primary election.\n\nHe said: \u201cIn the spirit of fair play, objectivity and natural justice, Governor Oyetola is not supposed to remain in the membership of the NCECPC. What we are witnessing is a case of a thief adjudicating in his own case. He can never convict himself. Governor Oyetola\u2019s membership of the NCECPC is against the democratic norms. We dare say that this is capable of causing disquiet, more than we are facing in Osun APC now, if it is allowed to pass us by. We put on record, the fact that The Osun Progressives (TOP), a caucus of APC to which I belong, has not been availed with the membership register of the party, which will be the basis of voting. We put on record that there ought to have been display of party register, with claims and objections made before we go into voting.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. Click Here Now .\n\n\u201cWe recall that TOP had reported the abuse and manipulation to which the party\u2019s register had been subjected to while being compiled by Governor Oyetola and his cabinet members. And this allegation was unattended to, but cannot be wished away. We state that if there is no deliberate attempt to manipulate the primary process, it is important to make the membership register available, display it for claims and objections before using it for the primary election. The APC, we say with confidence, will not want to involve itself in a muddled-up arrangement that could tarnish its democratic image.\u201d\n\nBut in his reaction to Adeoti\u2019s allegations, the APC\u2019s Director of Publicity, Research and Strategy, Mr Kunle Oyatomi noted that Aregbesola/Adeoti\u2019s faction of the party are crying wolf where there is none. He added that Governor Oyetola is a peace-loving person who would not encourage violence of any kind in any issue that involves members of his party.\n\nHe said that the Osun Progressives (TOP) which Adeoti referred to has no locus standi as the only recognized leadership of the APC in the state is under the chairmanship of Prince Gboyega Famodun while Governor Oyetola is the leader of the party. He promised that the primary election would be free and fair, assuring that the Governor or any leader of the party would not interfere in the exercise.\n\nOyatomi who said there was no cause for the alarm regarding the primary election, like Aregbesola earlier did, called on members of the APC across the state to troop out in large numbers and assemble at their wards\u2019 voting centres throughout the state from 8.00am today to participate fully in the direct primary.\n\nThe party\u2019s spokesman said that the APC\u2019s candidate for the July 16 governorship election will be elected by all card-carrying members of the party and urged them not to be scared by rumours of violence and attack. He also advised to comport themselves orderly, peacefully and responsibly in order to ensure a successful election.",

          "text": "*Governor AbdulRazaq heads 7-man election supervision team, says he\u2019ll be fair to all\n\nBennett Oghifo in Lagos, Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja and Yinka Kolawole in Osogbo\n\nGovernor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State and the Interior Minister, Rauf Aregbesola, who is Oyetola\u2019s predecessor, will today go to war, as the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) holds direct primary elections across the 322 wards in the state to pick its candidate for the governorship election holding next July.\n\nThe Osun State Governor and Aregbesola have been at loggerheads for almost three years, over the control of the state and the party.\n\nOyetola is seeking the party\u2019s ticket to run for a second term while Aregbesola and his political movement, The Osun Progressives (TOP) are backing erstwhile Secretary to the Osun State Government, Moshood Adeoti to unseat Oyetola.\n\nMany agree that Oyetola has performed creditably well since he assumed office despite the mountain of debt left behind by Aregbesola.\n\nAside the power of incumbency, as well as his achievements in the past three and half years in office, Oyetola enjoys the support of former governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, the national leadership of the party and the backing of the State Executive of the party, led by Adegboyega Famodun.\n\nBut Aregbesloa insists Oyetola must not get the party\u2019s ticket to run for a second term because the governor has been disloyal to him and the party members in the state.\n\nThe Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the party has sent a seven-man team led by Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara State to supervise today\u2019s primary in the state. Senator Julius Ucha is the Secretary of the committee.\n\nOther members of the committee are Senator Ibrahim Yahaya Oloriegbe, Hon. Abdulkarim Abdulraman, Hon. Wale Raji, Mrs. Yetunde Imolehin and Mr. Ofonmbuk Okon Bassey.\n\nThere were moves by some chieftains of the party to postpone the primary in order to address the rift between Oyetola and Aregbesola, but the national body resisted the moves.\n\nIncidentally, AbdulRazaq has been engaged in a feud with the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, just like the case between Oyetola and Aregbesola.\n\nBut AbdulRazaq promised all contestants that he would be fair to them in the conduct of the primary election.\n\nHe said he would act in strict compliance with APC\u2019s Constitution in the conduct of the election.\n\nThe governor said he and other members of the panel on the Osun primary were looking forward to conducting a free and fair primary election in the state.\n\nOyetola has persistently resisted Aregbesola\u2019s moves to operate as the Godfather of Osun State politics and dictate to him as the governor, on the day to day running of the state.\n\nThis has resulted in numerous violent clashes among supporters of the two camps.\n\nThe Special Adviser to Oyetola on Political Affairs, Sunday Akere, explains further: \u201cOyetola did not fight Aregbesola. He (Aregbesola) declared that Oyetola\u2019s tenure was his third term and he wanted to be in charge. He also promised those close to him that 80 per cent of them would return as cabinet members, which did not happen. The ex-governor thought the eight-year tenure was for eternity. It has ended but he could not believe that reality. The root cause of the issue is what I just said.\u201d\n\nThe Chairman, Elders\u2019 Caucus of the Osun State APC, Sola Akinwumi described the \u201cstreet shows\u201d by Aregbesola as a display of thuggery and hooliganism.\n\nAkinwumi adds: \u201cAs a matter of fact, the erstwhile governor belittles himself and I am very sure he didn\u2019t know the implications of what he did. He acted so low and naively as if he was the sitting governor.\n\n\u201cWas he telling us that there are two governors in the State? Has he forgotten that he is no longer a Governor? We have known his intention and we leave everyone to his or her conscience.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, members of the APC in Osun State have been urged to remain focused and resolute in their resolve to re-elect Oyetola at the party\u2019s primary election coming up today, as they have demonstrated during the strategic tour conducted round the state.\n\nThe Secretary to the State Government, Prince Oluwole Oyebamiji gave the charge in a press statement, describing the atmosphere of tension recently created in the State as a mere distraction.\n\nThe SSG affirmed in the statement that Osun \u201cis the most peaceful state and will remain so during and after the primary election.\u201d\n\nHe then urged every member of the public to embrace peace and go about their lawful duties without any fear.\n\nThe statement further revealed that the Oyetola administration had touched lives and impacted the society in an unprecedented way without relegating human capital development to the background.\n\nAregbesola: Oyetola Waging War against Me\n\nOn the other hand, Aregbesola alleged that Oyetola had been waging a war against him since becoming the governor.\n\nThe Interior Minister reiterated this in Ikire town last Thursday while addressing a rally held to garner support for Adeoti, his anointed candidate in today\u2019s primaries.\n\nSpeaking in Yoruba, Aregbesola said he pleaded with Oyetola for about two years not to fight him, adding that his successor rejected his advice, which made him call his supporters to salvage the party.\n\nHe said, \u201cI begged him (Oyetola) for two years; I told him that people must not mock us; I told him that he was heading for destruction. I served this state with the whole of my heart; I also positioned Oyetola so that he could succeed me in office.\n\n\u201cWhen we came to this town (Ikire) for his campaign, we were drenched in rain from the Akire\u2019s palace to this place. He got to the office and claimed I am his enemy; those who contested against him during our party primary he pulled closer, while he is fighting me.\n\n\u201cSince Oyetola assumed office, he has waged a war against me as if I once harmed him. He claimed that I did not want him to emerge as the governor; I told him that I heard him and that now that he had been governor, what else did he want?\n\n\u201cI begged him for two years; I sent people to help me beg him and that he should not love me, but he must not fight me; even if he wanted to fight me, he should not abuse me and destroy my legacies.\n\n\u201cAll that I warned him not to do was what he did. He opposed what I did; all the things I did together with him for eight years, he opposed and reversed them. He thought he could destroy me through my work; nobody was pushing him, he is pushing himself. He deliberately towed that path. He waged a war against me and refused to listen to my pleas until he got rid of me.\u201d\n\nSack Aregbesola Now, Coalition Tells Buhari\n\nMeanwhile, a Coalition of Civil Society Organisations in Osun State has demanded the sack of Aregbesola for promoting civil unrest ahead of today\u2019s governorship primary election.\n\nThe Spokesperson of the Coalition, Mr. Wasiu Alli, while addressing a press conference on Thursday in Abuja, said according to the 5th Schedule of the constitution, Aregbesola was expected to act only in ways that promote National Security and does not expose Nigerians anywhere to threats to their lives and property.\n\nThe Coalition added that where the contrary becomes the case, erring government officials must receive appropriate sanctions.\n\nThe coalition said Aregbesola in the past one week had engaged in a public show of rascality, encouragement of followers to behave in manners that undermine the superintendence of the present administration in the State, denigration of Elder Statesmen, among many others.\n\nIt noted that the recent utterances of Aregbesola were already heating the polity in the State to a point where residents now live in fear.\n\nIt stated: \u201cWhile superintending over Security Agencies under the Ministry of Interior, Mr. Rauf Aregbesola, has now turned security details attached to him by these Agencies (NSCDC and NPF) into tools of political warfare, clearly undermining the jurisdiction of the Nigeria Police Force in maintaining security in Osun State.\n\n\u201cMr. Rauf Aregbesola, despite being responsible for coordination of public security, is, by his actions, promoting disunity and insubordination between two key security agencies that should ordinarily be cooperating. This portends grave danger for the maintenance of peace and security within Osun State and indeed, Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe coalition said if the federal government failed to call Aregbesola to order and charge him to focus on his official responsibilities instead of going about causing civil unrest, he would end up inflaming the otherwise peaceful Osun State.\n\nIt said, \u201cWhere he cannot be cautioned, we demand his outright sack or redeployment if he cannot act responsibly in line with the dictates of the office he presently holds. A public officer must never be seen acting contrary to the spirit and provisions of the Nigerian Constitution.\u201d\n\nResponding, Aregbesola said the Coalition was hurriedly put together and plotted by the leadership of the government in Osun State.\n\nThe minister, who responded in a statement issued by his Media Adviser, Sola Fasure, insisted that the state government in particular had mounted a campaign of calumny against the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) because they were providing security for some citizens in Osun while they hold meetings and ward off attacks against them.\n\nYou Have Been Chosen to Rule Osun for Second Term, Ataoja, Olobu Tell Oyetola\n\nThe Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba Jimoh Oyetunji Olanipekun, and the Olobu of Ilobu, Oba Ashiru Olatoye Olaniyan, yesterday reiterated their support for Governor Oyetola, saying they were resolute to work for his success in the forthcoming governorship election.\n\nThe monarchs showered encomiums and prayers on the governor for his modest achievements in the last three years, just as they assured him of their royal backing before, during and after the July 16 governorship election in the State.\n\nThis is even as Oyetola rounded off his strategic engagement tour across the nine Federal Constituencies of the State in Osogbo, the State capital, on Thursday night.\n\nOyetola had in the last three weeks embarked on a familiarisation visit to each of the 30 local government areas, including Ife-East Area Office, to identify and solidarise with the newly-elected executives of the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the State.\n\nReceiving the Governor in his palace, the Ataoja of Osogbo, Oba Jimoh Olanipekun, threw his weight behind Governor Oyetola whom he described as a promise keeper.\n\nIn the same vein, Olobu of Ilobu, Oba Ashiru Olatoye Olaniyan, acknowledged the monumental achievements of the Administration of Governor Oyetola, which he described as unprecedented in the history of the State.\n\nOba Olaniyan, who implored the Governor to remain steadfast and not be distracted, said, \u201cWe are solidly behind you and we are ready to mobilise our subjects to re-elect you.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

The Caretaker Committee and the governors will meet with the President on Saturday (today) to propose the new date.\u201d\n\nAlso, a former member of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party, who pleaded for anonymity, said it was already clear that the convention would not hold, \u201cbecause there are some things that needed to be done for the convention to hold as scheduled on February 26 and most of them had not been done, with few days to February 26.\u201d\n\nThe source stressed that, for instance, one of the things that ought to have been done was zoning of party offices.\n\nHe continued: \u201cPeople have not bought forms and people cannot buy form if the zoning is not done; and forms cannot come out until the zoning is done. That is when aspirants will know what kind of forms they are buying. If you don\u2019t know the zoning, you can\u2019t buy a form.\n\n\u201cThere are no committees; all the sub-committees have not been set up as we speak. I remember that at the last convention, there were over 20 committees beside the main convention committee.\u201d\n\nReacting to the purported plans by some governors and a principal officer in the Senate to foist Senator Abdulahi Adamu on the party, he said \u201cwhile individuals or groups can have preference, President Muhammadu Buhari has the final say on who becomes the next Chairman of the party.\n\n\u201cWhatever you are hearing now are mere speculations because nobody can push anybody. All of them are waiting for the president. Everybody is waiting for the president and that is why until the president says this is the chairman before they can now zone other positions around where he comes from.\n\n\u201cSo, they have to know whom; they have to know which zone he is from before they can now zone the remaining offices based on that. But that is not to say that individual governors or some group will not have their preferences. But those cannot mean anything, except such individuals or groups are able to convince the president to now adopt their own.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "WHO Names Nigeria among Six African Countries to Receive Technology for Production of COVID-19 Vaccine",
          "text": "Deji Elumoye and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja\n\nThe Director General of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has named Nigeria and five other African countries \u2013 Egypt, South Africa, Senegal, Kenya and Tunisia \u2013 as the first in Africa that would receive the technology needed for the manufacturing of mRNA (Messenger Ribonuclieic Acid) used in producing COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nGhebreyesus who announced this yesterday at the European Union \u2013 African Union summit in Brussels said the countries all applied and were selected as recipients.\n\nThe announcement was made at a ceremony hosted by the European Council, France, South Africa and WHO in the presence of President Macron, President Ramaphosa, the President of the European Council, Charles Michel and the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nThe mRNA vaccines are different from most vaccines which contain a weakened or inactive piece of the target virus which triggers the production of antibodies.\n\nInstead these game-changing type of vaccines use laboratory engineering mRNA that give cells instructions on how to create a protein that resembles a piece of a protein found in the virus of concern \u2014 COVID-19 in this case.\n\nThis triggers the body to create antibodies to deactivate the foreign protein. The antibodies then linger in the body to fight subsequent infection from COVID-19. This technology is used in the production of Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines.\n\nGhebreyesus said the COVID-19 pandemic had shown that reliance on a few companies to supply global public goods was limiting and dangerous.\n\nWith the addition of Nigeria to the four countries earlier approved for the vaccine production on the continent, efforts by the Buhari administration to change the selection that the country considered unrepresentative of the needs, capabilities and population distribution in Africa has thus yielded the desired result.\n\nPresident Buhari has since welcomed the development.\n\nIn his contribution at the Roundtable on Health Systems and Vaccine Production at the ongoing 6th Europe-Africa Summit in Brussels, Belgium yesterday, Buhari called for a closer collaboration with the EU to tackle the effects of the pandemic on the African continent.\n\nHe expressed delight at receiving the news of the selection of Nigeria among recipients of mRNA Vaccine technology transfer.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cWe shall ensure the best use is made of the opportunity. Nigeria also offers to host the Bio-manufacturing Training hub proposed by World Health Organisation (WHO). We commit to providing support to make the hub functional in the shortest possible time.\u201d\n\nWhile commending the efforts of the foreign partners in making the Covid-19 vaccine available, he urged them to do more as less than 10 per cent of the African population had gotten the jab, stressing that this situation could negatively affect Africa\u2019s developmental projections.\n\n\u201cIn the mid- to long-term, the best way to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage is to significantly increase the capacity of all regions to manufacture the health products they need, with equitable access as their primary endpoint,\u201d Buhari said.\n\nResponding to the announcement, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa said: \u201cThis is an initiative that will allow us to make our own vaccines and that, to us, is very important. It means mutual respect, mutual recognition of what we can all bring to the party, investment in our economies, infrastructure investment and, in many ways, giving back to the continent.\u201d\n\nThe global mRNA technology transfer hub was established in 2021 to support manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines, ensuring that they have all the necessary operating procedures and know-how to manufacture mRNA vaccines at scale and according to international standards.\n\nAlso French President, Emmanuel Macron said: \u201cImproved public health benefits, supporting African health sovereignty and economic development are the principal goals of strengthening local production in Africa. In an interconnected world, we need stronger and new partnerships between countries, development partners and other stakeholders to empower regions and countries to fend for themselves, during crises, and in peace time.\u201d\n\nOn his part, President of the European Council, Charles Michel said the world needed to create an environment where every scientist, health worker, and government can band together for a common cause by working together \u201cto build new solutions to protect what is most precious \u2013 our health and our lives.\u201d He said the initiative will ensure that all countries build the necessary capacity to produce their own vaccines and other health technologies.\n\nThe WHO mRNA technology transfer hub is part of a larger effort aimed at empowering low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines, medicines and diagnostics to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Oba Of Benin In Modern Slavery Scandal, Uses Influence To Detain Palace Aide Who Served Him From Age 15 In Prison For Months, Denies Him Bail Over Allegation Of Stealing",
          "text": "The Oba of Benin in Edo State, Oba Ewuare II, is currently enmeshed in modern-day slavery scandal and an alleged violation of human rights of one of his palace aides, Nelson Oghogho \u2013 a 20-year-old who was detained by the police for months and remanded in prison over an allegation of stealing.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Oghogho, who joined the palace in 2016 as a 15-year-old boy, was also denied bail by the police who were reportedly acting on \u201cpalace instructions.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the palace detained Oghogho and another palace aide, identified only as Bright, from May to August 2021 when they were taken to court and the two had been in prison ever since.\n\n\u201cSo everyone is scared of the big name and the family of this boy is really helpless now; He was detained since May 31, 2021. The strange part is that they even denied his bail even when it was a case of someone being accused of stealing,\u201d a source said.\n\n\"It may also interest you to know that these people are doing everything possible to sweep this issue under the carpet so people don\u2019t know about it and they constantly give the impression that Nelson must serve some time for this outrageous allegation.\n\n\"Some time ago, Nelson tried to run away from the palace because of the maltreatment and hardship he had endured. You should also know that his poor parents who are farmers have not been spared by this cruel monarch as their few hard-earned landed properties have been seized and they are constantly at risk.\n\n\n\n\"They have done all they can to beg and are still begging and saying he (Oba of Benin) should have their properties in exchange for their son\u2019s freedom but to no avail. In my opinion, this is a pure case of modern slavery and this should not be tolerated.\n\n\"They are just using influence to keep the poor guy in prison, he was supposed to have been granted bail but they denied the bail, the state council opposed it and they are all trying to please the king.\"\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that Oghogho and the other were accused of stealing N200 million cash from the palace.\n\nHe was charged with stealing and conspiracy\n\nSpeaking with SaharaReporters, a top source revealed that the allegation of stealing N200 million cash from the palace was both frivolous and inhumane.\n\n\u201cHow is it humanly possible for a 20-year-old boy to steal the sum of N200 million in cash from the palace with all the security and pageantry without being noticed and traced? Even a bullion van will hardly hold that much money. It may also interest you to know that these people are doing everything possible to sweep this issue under the carpet.\n\n\"Initially, he (Oba of Benin) said it was $20,000, then, he said N10 million, when he saw that he wasn\u2019t getting as much solidarity. He started increasing it till now it\u2019s currently N200,000,000, which he is accusing Nelson of stealing.\n\n\u201cThe state council gave some flimsy excuses that Nelson will run off if granted bail while his lawyer sat there and said nothing. Seemingly they\u2019ve all been bought over. His lawyer later suggested that we should go for an appeal for the bail and charge an outrageous sum of N1 million,\u201d he said.\n\nSaharaReporters learnt that the palace aide now 20 years old (to turn 21 this year), wrote some notes while in remand, detailing how his ordeal at the Oba of Benin\u2019s palace started.\n\nHe is being remanded in Oko correctional centre in Benin City.\n\n\n\nIn the notes written by the accused while in prison, and obtained by SaharaReporters on Friday, Nelson said, \u201cBefore reading this book, things you need to know; one, I have been serving the King (Oba Ewuare II) for five years plus. I have been serving without off day, break or relaxation time. I work 365 or 366 days a year.\n\n\u201cI am not on any payroll, I don\u2019t receive any salary. My family don\u2019t get any benefit or compensation. They haven\u2019t received anything from the palace. My education got tampered with since I got to the palace because the school is not functioning well and no proper equipment or lab. I was over-laboured.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have fixed working hours. Sometimes I do work from morning (6am) till midnight (12am); sometimes till dawn. I don\u2019t have time for myself because I was occupied. I was being maltreated. I have photo proof. I was always beaten and threatened every day. I was just waiting for the whole issue to die so I can leave because it was becoming more unbearable. I called my parents and I explained everything to them; I even told my friends. They all advised me to just bear that maybe everything will soon be over.\n\n\u201cIt all started when an issue arose on May 15, 2021, about some missing cash in the King (Oba Ewuare\u2019s) inner chamber. I happen to be one of the close aides to him. So one of my colleagues, Bright, was detained on that same day; May 15 for questioning.\n\n\u201cMeanwhile I was still doing my daily routine without knowing how the whole matter was going. I was beaten and threatened to confess about my colleague (Bright) that I saw him taking the money. But I refused to do so because I never saw him taking the money. Truth be told, it wasn\u2019t very easy; I couldn\u2019t run because they would falsely accuse me. Though I kept on complaining to the person that brought me (Rowland), he kept telling me to keep calm that I can run when everything is over. He told me everyone will conclude I am the one who took the money if I run.\n\n\u201cOn May 31, Rowland told me that I was going to the State Criminal Investigation Department to write a statement that Bright mentioned my name in his statement ad I was really confused because I don\u2019t even know what he was talking about. So I walked up to his car and entered there. I heard a lot of rumour that police can torture you and you will start confessing what you didn\u2019t do. I was really scared.\n\n\u201cThen I asked Rowland if I could go home from the police station because all I wanted in my life was freedom. So I told Rowland I was going to confess that I saw Bright and Igwe coming out from the inner chamber with brown envelope but I don\u2019t know what was inside; that they gave me some cash later that day not to tell anyone I saw them.\n\n\u201cThe story was made up, no incident like that ever occurred. I wanted to get myself involved so I will be chased from the palace and I see that as the only way to freedom. So Rowland drove me to the State CID with two bouncers who they were going to detain too. We met the Commander, anti-cultist unit and I wrote my statement in his office. I was surprised that after writing the statement, Rowland left me there and I was detained on May 31, 2021. At first, I thought Rowland was going to inform the king so that I would be sent home as we both agreed. But I never heard from him for more than a week. I waited for weeks but he never showed up but kept giving excuses when called.\n\n\u201cI was detained for two months, a week and a day. (May 31 to August 8, 2021); my parents never visited nor called to check up on me. It was my girlfriend that kept on bringing food to me. It wasn\u2019t really easy though.\n\n\u201cNote that my parents\u2019 property; a house on 100 by 100 and extra land were seized by the palace even before investigations started. The properties have not been returned yet.\n\n\u201cSo after being detained again on October 25, 2021, we were charged to court. We were taken to a High Court for a stealing case. We were remanded in Oko Prison on October 26, 2021, as awaiting trial persons.\n\n\u201cSo on a fateful day, we were called for a visit by some prison wardens that there were some visitors from the palace. On getting there, we saw Dennis Osaretin, Oyaniyen and one other palace functionary who I assume the palace sent to check to see if we were really suffering.\n\n\u201cTomorrow is Christmas and I am still in prison; worst Christmas ever not for me though because I always celebrate it without going out or having fun but it\u2019s actually the worst Christmas for my family. How are they going to celebrate Christmas knowing their son, brother is in prison? Don\u2019t really know how they feel now but I still give thanks to GOD.\u201d\n\nFrank Irabor, Secretary of Benin Traditional Council, told SaharaReporters that the monarch is too big to respond to such allegations, especially as the matter is in court.\n\n\"I don't understand the case you are talking about, the case is in court, do you want Omo n'Oba (Oba of Benin) to react to that?\n\n\"If someone is detained, even for one year, that is at the discretion of the judge or the agency handling the case. They will want to continue to remand the person, maybe to conclude their investigation.\n\n\"They should not drag Omo n'Oba into it at all; he is too big for that. So there is no need to say the palace or the secretary should react. Let the court handle it. Please, he is too big for that,\" Irabor said.\n\nOba of Benin in Modern Slavery Scandal, Uses Influence to Detain Palace Aide Who Served Him From Age 15 in... by Sahara Reporters on Scribd",

A murderer is banished from the community and the land is cleansed of the abomination.\n\nHave the Igbo settled for this governing abomination? Have the elders been functionally vasectomised? How can murder, anarchy, and fear reign in the land uncontested? Have we become a people given to bloodletting, beheading and cannibalism? Have we gone backwards in our evolution as a humane and cosmopolitan people to become savages?\n\nWhy has this cumulus of evil persisted and remained hanging over an entire region? A region that was once prosperous, peaceful and bubbling on the growth index is now a slaughterhouse that investors are running away from. The south-east is being destroyed by the same people who claim to be fighting for the people.\n\nSecurity agents have been killed. Traditional rulers have been killed. Men have been killed and women have been raped and killed by this band of parademons. A few days ago, \u2018\u2019unknown gunmen\u2019\u2019 attacked a police station and killed three policemen in Ebonyi. Last week, gunmen killed seven community leaders in Imo. And the killings persist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has now become customary for residents of the south-east to wake up to severed heads dangling from poles in market squares, roads and community facilities. An unsleeping evil has taken over the land.\n\nOn Wednesday, these \u2018\u2019unknown gunmen\u2019\u2019 invaded a cattle market at Omumauzor; a community in Ukwa West LGA of Abia. The market is said to be peopled by Nigerians from the north. They came not to buy cattle, but to kill. By the time they were done, eight citizens were dead. These parademons did not spare anything, they killed cattle and set the market ablaze. What sort of bestiality is this?\n\nAccording to Abia state government, the gunmen struck around 11pm on Tuesday. \u201cOn Tuesday, 15th February 2022 at about 11:35pm, some yet-to-be-identified hoodlums allegedly invaded traders at the New Cattle Market located in Omumauzor, Ukwa West Local Government Area of our dear state.

This makes it very dangerous. These ravagers are not only threatening the lives of Igbo citizens and other Nigerians in the south-east, they are also jeopardising the safety and security of Igbo citizens in other parts of the country.\n\nAs I said in the column, \u2018Ndi Igbo stand for One Nigeria\u2019, those crusading for the secession of the south-east today are deficient students of history and sociology.

          "text": "Pan-African fintech firm Flutterwave on Friday announced a rebrand of its logo and dashboard as well as the addition of small business lending, fintech-as-a-service (FaaS), and more to its suite of offerings.\n\nThe announcement comes 2 days after Flutterwave confirmed it had raised $250 million in a Series D round that tripled the company\u2019s valuation to over $3 billion. Led by founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, the company facilitates cross-border payments transactions of small-to-large businesses in Africa via one API.\n\nIn a virtual event themed \u201cFlutterwave 3.0\u201d, Africa\u2019s most valuable startup and payments giant rolled out a series of products and services including FaaS services for embedded finance, SME loans for its users, card issuance for a wide array of clients while announcing the addition of Apple Pay and Google Pay to its payment options.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nFlutterwave Capital, the new SME loans product, is offered in partnership with the company\u2019s lending partners\u2014CashConnect Microfinance Bank, MoneyWise Microfinance Bank, Wema Bank, Zenith Bank, Stanbic IBTC Bank, and Sterling Bank.\n\nThe new product will enable businesses \u201ceasily access loans without collateral, cumbersome documentation, and other stringent terms and conditions,\u201d a blog post on Flutterwave\u2019s website reads, adding that eligible applicants can access the funds they need in less than 2 business days.\n\n\u201cWith Flutterwave Capital, we\u2019re making it easier for business owners to access the funds they require to grow their businesses. Business owners can expand, increase inventory, hire more labour, pay bills, run marketing campaigns, and ultimately grow revenue with these funds,\u201d the company said.\n\nCurrently, only Flutterwave businesses in Nigeria can access loans but the company says it is working to make it available to its businesses in South Africa, Kenya, and other markets where it operates.\n\nAs regards the fintech-as-a-service solution, Flutterwave is opening up its infrastructure to allow other companies to use its APIs to embed financial capabilities into their existing applications, products, and services.\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s FaaS service provides a unified tech stack that includes KYC, account opening, debit card issuance, payments, and real-time transfers through a single endpoint, account servicing, and compliance.\n\nThe solution helps companies bypass the often gruelling work of building the infrastructure, integrating multiple, disparate financial systems, licensing, and compliance required in building and offering consumers digital financial services.\n\nFlutterwave also helps businesses outside Africa expand their operations on the continent with an international clientele that includes Booking.com, Flywire, and Uber.\n\nThe new set of offerings and features is in line with Flutterwave\u2019s ambitious product expansion drive. Last year, the company launched Flutterwave Market for merchants to sell their goods via an online marketplace and, most recently, Send, a remittance service that empowers customers to seamlessly send money to recipients to and from Africa.\n\nIn March 2021, the San Francisco-headquartered and Lagos-based startup raised $170 million in a Series C round at a valuation of $1 billion. The latest financing thus brings its total investments secured since launched in 2016 to $475 million (plus a $35 million Series B in 2020 and a $20 million Series A in 2018).\n\nThe $3 billion valuation sees Flutterwave surpass the $2 billion mark set by SoftBank-backed fintech OPay and FTX-backed cross-border payments platform Chipper Cash last year.\n\nCurrently, Flutterwave has an infrastructure reach across 34 countries on the continent and processes 200 million transactions worth more than $16 billion. More than 900,000 businesses globally use its solution to process payments in 150 currencies and across different payment modes: local and international cards, mobile wallets, bank transfers, and its consumer product Barter, which now allows for multicurrency wallets.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Crypto crime grows to $14 billion as crypto popularity increases",
          "text": "In 2021, crypto criminals made a killing, as illicit crypto transactions hit $14 billion, a 79% jump from the $7.8 billion recorded in 2020, according to a report by US-based blockchain analytics company, Chainalysis.\n\nThe growth in illicit crypto transactions is attributed to a 567% jump in overall transaction volume in 2021. Given that overall crypto transactions grew to $15.8 trillion in 2021, it is not surprising that cybercriminals are increasingly using crypto. Despite the increase in the total volume of illicit transactions, illicit transactions represented just 0.15% of the total cryptocurrency transaction volume in 2021\u2014its lowest ever. What this means is that legitimate crypto transactions far outstrip illegal transactions.\n\nScams and theft ranked as the highest source of crypto crime and decentralised finance (DeFi) contributed most part of the funds stolen, the report shows. Scamming revenue jumped 82% to $7.8 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen from victims. Over $2.8 billion of this total were stolen through a new type of scam called \u201crug pull\u201d. A rug pull is a type of scam where developers disappear with the money invested in crypto projects or exchanges that appear legitimate.\n\nCryptocurrency theft also jumped 516% to roughly $3.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency stolen in 2021. With 72% or 2.2 billion of those funds stolen from DeFi protocols.\n\nDeFi is a term for a financial ecosystem of tools and applications running on any blockchain that allows an individual to pay, lend, borrow, or store funds without intermediaries such as traditional financial banks.\n\nDeFi saw the biggest year-on-year growth\u20141,964%\u2014for laundering activities, while mining comes second place at less than 500% growth. The Chainalysis report attributed this growth to the hype around the DeFi space: incredible returns on decentralised tokens like Shiba Inu, which encourages people to speculate on DeFi tokens, and the ease of creating DeFi tokens\u2014all of which caused its transaction volume to grow by 912% in 2021.\n\nWhile Chainalysis acknowledges the huge opportunities DeFi presents to crypto users and entrepreneurs, it believes widespread theft and scamming will not allow it to realise its full potential. It suggested that the public and private sectors should engage in communication to teach investors how to avoid dubious projects. Although it noted that, as a long term strategy, the industry may need to prevent \u201ctokens associated with potentially fraudulent or unsafe projects from being listed on major exchanges\u201d.\n\nApart from crypto-based transactions or revenue, the Chainalysis report also shows that the volume of cryptocurrency owned by addresses on the blockchain that it has traced to criminal actors has increased from $3 to $11 billion. This data is important, Chainalysis noted, because it represents how much can be theoretically retrieved by law enforcement agencies. Stolen funds accounted for 93% of such criminal balances, at $9.8 billion; followed by Darknet market funds at $448 million; scams at $192 million; fraud shops at $66 million; and ransomware at $30 million.\n\nIn a separate analysis by Chainalysis, in the same report, 4,068 criminal whales hold over $25 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Chainalysis describes a criminal crypto whale as any private wallet holding $1 million or more worth of cryptocurrency that has received more than 10% of its funds from illicit addresses. It is important to note that the above figure of criminal whale balance won\u2019t align with the overall criminal balance because it calculates all the holdings in the private wallet (both legal and illegal) while the overall criminal balance calculates only holdings of addresses tagged as illicit. Criminal whales represent just 3.7% of all cryptocurrency whales\u2014private wallets holding over $1 million worth of cryptocurrency.\n\nDespite the massive increase in crypto crime, a positive development is the growing ability of law enforcement agencies to seize illicit cryptocurrency from criminals. For example, America\u2019s Internal Revenue Service criminal investigation (IRS-CI) seized, over the course of 2021, over $3.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency. Also in the US, the Department of Justice (DOJ) also seized $2.3 million worth of cryptocurrency from the operators of DarkSide ransomware, responsible for the attack on Colonial Pipeline. London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) seized \u00a3180 million worth of cryptocurrency from a suspected money launderer.\n\nEarlier this month, the United States arrested and charged a couple, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, for allegedly conspiring to launder stolen cryptocurrency worth 119,754 bitcoin, which is now worth an estimated $4.5 billion. The couple had allegedly laundered the bitcoin stolen in the 2016 hack of cryptocurrency exchange, Bitfinex, but the stolen bitcoin were worth $74 million at the time, a tiny fraction of their current value. The US Justice Department was able to recover more than $3.6 billion of the laundered $4.5 billion worth of bitcoin, despite the couple\u2019s sophisticated laundering technique that saw them shuffle the funds using crypto tools and techniques like unhosted wallets, a darknet marketplace, chain hooping, peel chain, and privacy coin. The agency has labelled the operation its largest financial seizure ever.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Inside Ckrowd\u2019s plan to help African creators monetise their content",
          "text": "The term \u201ccreator economy\u201d became popular throughout 2021 when venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and independent creators not only threw the phrase around but also invested heavily in the content industry\u2014an industry that would leapfrog into becoming a $100 billion industry.\n\nContent creators\u2014writers, artists, social media influencers, videographers, gamers, podcasters\u2014are raking in millions of dollars annually by monetising their craft. But only a tiny fraction of these creators are Africans. This means African creators are still struggling to earn much from their craft, compared to their global counterparts.\n\nTwo things may have caused this: one is, global payment networks like Paypal that should connect African creators with the rest of the world have shut Africans out of their network; secondly, lack or shortage of efficient local creator platforms that connect the rest of the world directly to African creators.\n\nGet the best African tech newsletters in your inbox\n\nWhile there are some companies already building to solve the first problem, Ckrowd, a content streaming platform and marketplace, is solving the second problem at scale.\n\nCkrowd is positioning itself as the platform that bridges the gap between African content creators or suppliers and their global content consumers by providing creators with the opportunity to earn income while giving \u201cunique, exclusive, and engaging content experiences to their consumers\u201d.\n\nCkrowd was founded out of a will to do more\n\nCkrowd was founded by Olukayode Adebayo in November 2020. But before then, Adebayo, who was freshly back to Nigeria after a stint with the Nigerian embassy in China, had founded a real estate company that morphed into a hospitality business. He then started a media outfit in September 2016, called KAM Africa.\n\nAt KAM Africa, Adebayo started an initiative that would help creative professionals like musicians and actors understand the business part of their craft. But as he continued with the initiative, he realised that there was a need to bring all these promising enterprises together. Nobody builds in isolation, especially in the entertainment scene. So KAM Africa started Amfest, a festival-like event that brings together African creative businesses.\n\nAdebayo\u2019s cross-continental experience helped Amfest to quickly scale out of its founding country Nigeria into Ghana, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, and even Dubai.\n\n\u201cWe started building business partnerships with other platforms and scaled very fast. It was in the process of supporting the sector that we found out that many of these talents that are now enterprises had a problem with anything that doesn\u2019t involve physical human interaction,\u201d Adebayo told TechCabal. \u201cAt the point of this discovery, COVID-19 happened and it became even clearer as most of them were left without income. So, there was a need to bring them online.\u201d\n\nThe next thing to build became apparent; Ckrowd\u2014the solution to these persistent problems. After doing a lot of research and consultations throughout 2020, Adebayo launched the beta version of Ckrowd early last year and then launched publicly in August.\n\nHow Ckrowd works\n\nThe platform is a direct-to-consumer platform where original and exclusive African content in education, information, and entertainment is distributed directly to local and global consumers in short videos and live stream format. Think of a marriage between OnlyFans, Patreon, and YouTube\u2014in fact, a combination of all the streaming platforms out there\u2014but now for African content.\n\nLast year in December, uduX, a Nigerian streaming platform, partnered with telecoms giant MTN to live stream Wizkid\u2019s \u201cMade in Lagos\u201d concert from London\u2019s 02 Arena to over 238,000 Africans. But the event was quickly moved to YouTube after the day one of the three-days concert. Regardless of what might have caused the relocation, it\u2019s, however, an indication that Africa needs more efficient indigenous platforms that can aggregate content and put more money in the pocket of local creators while providing a seamless experience for local and global consumers.\n\nFor Adebayo, Ckrowd is taking an all-encompassing approach to building for the African creator economy, one that\u2019s a win-win for all the stakeholders.\n\nTo better understand CKrowd\u2019s advantage, let\u2019s look at how existing streaming platforms work: On YouTube, for instance, creators make money according to their view numbers and sometimes from ads. This means, if YouTube pays $0.0001 per view, you\u2019ll need 10,000 views to make $10. In the case of Netflix, let\u2019s say you subscribe at $10 per month, what happens if you are too busy for Netflix that month? Will you be refunded? No!\n\nFrom the creator\u2019s end, 10,000 views for $10 is not sustainable. How many African creators hit hundreds of thousands of views or millions? A small number. For consumers, the subscription model is not good if you can\u2019t flip unused subscriptions.\n\nOn Ckrowd, creators can livestream their content like uduX live and upload on-demand contents like on Netflix. Creators also control their spaces and how they want to be paid\u2014per view or by subscription. Unlike on social media platforms where creators, after creating content and amassing views and followers, would have to go outside the platform to market their views and followers to brands, Ckrowd lets creators set their prices and make their money as they go. It also allows viewers to select how they wish to pay for content\u2014all inside the platform.\n\n\u201cOur mission is to deliver economic value to African creators. The platform pays 70% of total income on content to creators, which we believe is the highest pay-out on digital content to African creators,\u201d said Adebayo.\n\nCkrowd is not only for music and film content; educational, culinary, sports, and other forms of content are allowed on the platform.\n\n\u201cThe Ckrowd platform is similar to a large arena in the cloud where you can broadcast live & short on-demand video content and charge access fees on behalf of the creators of that content. This allows the platform to uniquely function as an edtech, mediatech and adtech hybrid,\u201d said Adebayo.\n\nGrowth and traction\n\nCkrowd, from 4 users at its beta launch, has grown to have over 2,000 users on its platform. Last year in October, it raised $160,000 in pre-seed funding; $60,000 of equity funding, and $100,000 export grant investment from an international angel investor group, as well as backing from the Export Expansion Facility Programme from Nigerian Energy Support Programme (NESP).\n\nCkrowd plans to use the new capital to expand with new innovative technologies and strategies to get more customers, accelerate growth and promote intra-African creative industries. In addition to that, the company plans to hire more talent, especially in product, Research and Development (R&D) and engineering.\n\nAccording to Adebayo, the startup has already made headway in some of these plans. It acquired a marketing agency last year to power the ads sector of its business. The company said the agency\u2019s channels had access to about 50 million people across Africa, which means Ckrowd can now reach these people through email, SMS, and other channels available. This sounds like a transfer of data without the consent of the owners; however, if these people opted in with the marketing agency, which has now been acquired, then, by extension, they have opted in with Ckrowd.\n\nThe startup also recently announced the appointment of the founder and director of Music Works International Katherine McVicker and co-founder of Cultural Connections of Africa (CCA) Adeleye Fabusoro as executive members to its advisory board. Adebayo also said the company has built its own production studio and is currently partnering with other media houses across the continent, He hinted that they [Ckrowd] will soon start rolling out the results of the partnerships.\n\nCkrowd is taking on big players like Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, ShowMax, uduX and even cable television channel who\u2019ve got their claws deep in the streaming market. Will it curve, niche down, or dominate? This is not an easy one to predict but from Adebayo\u2019s confidence in the product and their pan-African play, there\u2019s something to root for in Ckrowd.\n\nShare this article",

The brand refresh includes forgoing the white, yellow and red lettering in favour of a black lettered MTN logo surrounded by an oval, similar in shape to a rugby ball.\n\nThe new brand is expected to roll out from 27 February, Nompilo Morafo, MTN Group chief sustainability and corporate affairs officer, confirmed to TechCentral. She explained that the new-look branding is part of the group\u2019s \u201cAmbition 2025\u201d strategy, which is aimed at creating \u201cleading digital platforms for Africa\u2019s progress\u201d.\n\nThe new look is \u201caligned to our evolution from a telecommunications company to a technology company underpinned by one simple and consistent yet striking brand\u201d, Morafo said.\n\nCurrent MTN logo\n\nNew MTN Logo\n\nMTN\u2019s expansion drive to become a fully-fledged technology services company also means that it\u2019s on a hiring drive to hire 150 digital experts in South Africa. It\u2019s looking for UX and UI designers; Product owners; Performance marketers; Digital content specialists; E-commerce experts; Full-stack developers; Scrum masters; Business analysts.\n\nThis rebrand will help shift public perception of the MTN brand and also influence its market valuation. It currently offers a range of services such as short form video content (MTN Shortz), music streaming (Music Plus), social media service (MTN Ayoba), mobile money services, voice and data services.\n\nLast year, it valued its mobile-money arm at about $5 billion and mentioned that it\u2019s considering a listing of that division. With more than 277 million subscribers in 20 countries in Africa, the MTN group is valued at over $11 billion.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "How to get free (and effective) press for your startup",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels good to own a startup. But building it, getting customers, making profit, making it a recognised brand, etc. is not always easy.\n\nAt our last edition of Techpoint Startup School, I taught a class on getting free press for your startup. I thought I should share some the lessons I gave with the Techpoint Africa audience.\n\nNote: This is not an exhaustive list. Feel free to ask questions/seek clarification.\n\nLesson 1: Do you even need press?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by Markus Winkler on Unsplash\n\nEarly startup founders always seem to forget to ask this question and that is mostly because there is a common misconception about marketing and press. Press is different from marketing. Marketing is advertising your brand to get customers, it helps you build traction. Press, on the other hand, may not necessarily get you customers but it highlights your previous successes and achievements, number of customers, level of revenue achieved, that is, traction, to build your reputation. You need marketing in the early stage because you need traction which you can use to get press.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you answer \u2018yes\u2019 to any of the following questions, you need press:\n\nDo you have some traction (quick growth, prominent clients, etc.)?\n\nHave you been operational for at least 3 to 6 months?\n\nDo you already have some reputation?\n\nHave you previously run a successful or prominent startup?\n\nIs there something truly interesting about you, like an innovative, unique business model, or a ridiculously valued pre-seed round?\n\nLesson 2: Do the work\n\nIf you answered \u2018Yes\u2019 to any of the previous questions, you need to do the work. Especially if you run an early stage startup, getting someone to handle press relations for you will cost you a lot, so you just have to do the work yourself. You need to make things easy for the journalist. You have to learn the art of storytelling and, when you can, you should make the journalist\u2019s work easier by providing good pictures. This will make your pitch stand out.\n\nLesson 3: Where is your audience?\n\nDepending on the stage you are, and your immediate objectives, you need to know who your audience is and where they hang out.\n\nIf you are a Nigerian agro-crowdfunding startup, for example, and your objective is to increase your number of crowdfunders, you have no business looking for press on Techcrunch. Focus on trying to get press on a Nigerian publication. And no, not just tech publications. Most of your potential crowdfunders are probably hanging out in places like Nairaland.\n\nBefore Tage Kene-Okafor took over from him, Techcrunch\u2019s Africa correspondent, Jake Bright would not even pay attention to your startup unless you had at least gotten to the Series A stage. Even now, most African startups that end up on Techcrunch do so after they raise a Series A round. In their case, their objective is to signal their viability to potential investors in their next round.\n\nAs an early stage startup, your primary focus should be getting customers. The questions you should be asking are: What do my customers read? Where do they hang out? Linda Ikeji\u201ds Blog? Nairaland? Nairametrics? Techpoint Africa? You need to seriously consider this.\n\nLesson 4: Connect with subject matter journalist\n\nAfter finding publications and media houses that cater for your target audience, find their journalists on social media. Follow them, engage them, drop valuable insights on their posts. Let them notice you for good.\n\nDo not pitch yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t interrupt their quiet breakfast randomly at a restaurant where they\u2019re just recharging for the day or anywhere at all and start talking about your startup (true story). Don\u2019t do that.\n\nLesson 5: Pitching\n\nEmail or Text first. Do not cold call\n\nUnless you met the journalist earlier at, say an event and you have established a relationship, please do not cold call. It is a complete turn off, journalists are distracted enough from trying to keep up with 20 stories at the same time. Be nice, send an email or a text message and be patient.\n\nPress, not puff piece\n\nNow it is time to pitch your startup. Points to note:\n\nThis may be a hard fact to swallow but, the media does not owe you coverage.\n\nThe media is beholden only to its audience.\n\nIf you are not bringing value to their audience, you risk being ignored.\n\nIt should, and can, be a win-win for both you and their audience.\n\nIf you just changed the logo of your startup, don\u2019t expect the publication to announce that. That\u2019s marketing, a paid service. A better approach to get free press is to find a journalist who has shown interest in the intricacies of UI and design. You could pitch a story about the inspiration for your new design choices and lessons other startups can learn from your process.\n\nThe average journalist is chasing like 10 stories at a time. Make things easier for them by pitching an interesting angle they can build your story from. This is where your storytelling abilities come in.\n\nPitch to suit\n\nEvery media publication has its leanings and processes. You need to study them. Some tech publications for example lean more towards gadgets than startups. Some have a certain bias for certain types of stories. Some have repeatable series you can build on.\n\nFor example, Techpoint Africa has Techpoint Digest which is published every weekday morning.\n\nTechpoint Africa also has a bias for new and innovative startups. We publish at least 3 new startup features every month. It is one of the few times you can get an article where the spotlight is solely on your startup. The only other times are when you raise funds, hit an exciting (for our audience) or truly groundbreaking milestone and (sadly) your startup fails (we hope you share).\n\nPress is about gaining reputation, not marketing. Most publications have a paid service for marketing (shameless plug, send an email to business@techpoint.africa).\n\nOtherwise, you need to be willing to accept that sometimes, the article might not be solely about you. It might be on a topic that your startup can relate to and you can be mentioned alongside others. This provides an opportunity to subtly build your reputation as an expert in your field.\n\nYou can also offer exclusives\n\nBut don\u2019t abuse it. Don\u2019t offer fake exclusives (multiple-timing other publications breeds distrust) and ensure that your offer aligns with their bias and leanings.\n\nJournalists are human too\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe tend to dehumanise people who are not playing in the same space that we are. Journalists are probably among the most dehumanised. We feel it is their job to give you coverage. Quick reminder; they do not owe you coverage.\n\nApproach them with respect, show them you value them. They have hundreds of stories they are chasing at a time. They have targets to meet and a lot of pitches coming in.\n\nIf you are tempted to say \u201cbut I am giving you content and traffic,\u201d don\u2019t. Any publication or journalist worth their salt will be fine without your content. There are always content ideas for the discerning and curious, and even stories relating to you can be told without your input.\n\nWhen pitching via mail, do not blind copy, it is disrespectful and you\u2019re likely to be ignored.\n\nLesson 6: Maintain the relationship\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter applying the previous lessons and you succeed, don\u2019t end it at that first publishing. Keep the relationship going, don\u2019t forget them and don\u2019t let them forget you.\n\nRespond to journalists when they seek for insight on stories they are writing. Respond if they have a negative tip about you and want to get comments and clarify. Reaching out to you means they respect you and are giving you a fair chance at a balanced story.\n\nResponding to queries about negative news also gives you the opportunity to somewhat control the narrative (not guaranteed). Take a leaf from Jumia, they preempt the media, with proactive spins to all negative stories and challenges.\n\nIf you always respond to journalists, when they reach out to you as a source, and with valuable insights, you manage to stay on their radar. This opens you up to other reputation building opportunities like speaking at events, AMAs, etc.\n\nRemember\n\nPress is about building reputation, not blatant selling (again, that\u2019s marketing, a paid service). You must be willing to build it slowly. And remember, you should always aim for win-win situations.\n\nTo pitch to the Techpoint Africa editorial team, email news@techpoint.africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMu\u0301yi\u0300wa\u0301 Ma\u0301tu\u0300lu\u0341ko\u0300 Chief Servant.

Please, leave your thoughts in the comment section.\n\nWell, today, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nSolving critical bankend freight industry challenges\n\nEarnipay\u2019s plans to reach 200,000 employees\n\nSolving critical backend freight industry challenges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe all know Africa lags in terms of modern technology adoption. For example, some freight companies in Africa still manage their shipments using outdated methods like spreadsheets, phone calls, and emails.\n\nFor most of them, multiple software platforms are used to complete various tasks. However, some platforms combine these software to make their work easier, faster, and more effective.\n\nOne of such companies is Freterium, a Moroccan startup that offers a single software that serves multiple functions. And this company has announced $4 million in seed funding to expand across the country and into neighbouring regions.\n\nPartech, a San Francisco-based investor, led the round. CDG Invest, Y Combinator, Flexport, Swiss Founders Fund, Outlierz Ventures, and a few angel investors from the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa were among those who took part.\n\nFounded in 2020 by Mehdi Cherif Alami (CEO) and Omar El Kouhene (CPO), the company creates a comprehensive approach to addressing critical backend challenges in the freight industry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Alami, Freterium onboarded more than 20 enterprise customers in its first full year of operation, growing 35% month over month. Over 3,000 people also use its software.\n\nHe also said that the funds would be used to invest in the company\u2019s research & development activities, hire more talent to double the current size of its team within the next 12 months, market its software, and expand across Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE.\n\nEarnipay\u2019s plans to reach 200,000 employees\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarnipay, a fintech solution startup that provides income-earners with flexible and on-demand salary access, has raised $4 million in a seed round to provide on-demand salaries to African employees.\n\nThe round was led by VC, Canaan. It also saw participation from XYZ Ventures, Village Global, Musha Ventures, Ventures Platform, Voltron Capital, and Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade.\n\nNonso Onwuzulike officially launched the company in January 2022 to improve employees\u2019 financial well-being. It accomplishes this by utilising technology to allow employees to deposit their paychecks into their accounts in a flexible, real-time, and interest-free manner.\n\nEarnipay collaborates with employers and integrates seamlessly with their payroll systems to provide its services to employees, who can then track and withdraw their accrued salaries via the app.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the company will use the seed funding to speed up the development of its platform to serve large enterprise employers. It will also provide employees with the tools to make better financial decisions and improve their quality of life.\n\nBy the end of 2022, the company plans to offer its on-demand salary solution to 200,000 employees.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nMost people with EUPD/BPD aren\u2019t manipulative \u2013 but often those around us can be.

But Meta says it has to process data across continents because it is crucial for ad targeting.\n\nAd targeting or not, the European leaders are very adamant about the new rule. Germany\u2019s new economy minister Robert Habeck said, \u201cAfter I was hacked, I have lived without Facebook and Twitter for four years, and life has been fantastic.\u201d\n\nMeta could be on the receiving end of its threat to the EU as it closed with a market cap below $600 billion on February 8, 2022, losing daily active users for the first time in its 18 year existence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, we\u2019re discussing:\n\nWhy female founders should learn the venture capital game\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s $3bn valuation\n\nCrowdForce\u2019s $3.6m pre-Series A\n\nWomen should play the VC game\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, women got less than 1% of startup funding. Sadly, the statistics have been quite similar in previous years.\n\nWhy is it this way? \u201cGetting funded is a bit of a game.\u201d \u2014 the words of Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures.\n\nAccording to her, women need to learn the rules of the VC game and know what works and what doesn\u2019t.\n\nEnygma Ventures has spent two years teaching women what venture funding requires. Dusek started the firm when she realised how difficult it was for women to access capital.\n\nIn her chat with Chimgozirim, she detailed the rules and tactics that could mean better odds for women in winning the venture capital game. Read all about it here: Female founders need to learn how to play the venture capital game\u2013 Sarah Dusek\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s $3bn valuation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlutterwave has come a long way since it was founded in 2016. The San Francisco-headquartered fintech startup broke into unicorn status last year after a $170 million raise led by New York-based private investment firm Avenir Growth Capital and US hedge fund and investment firm Tiger Global.\n\nIn just 12 months, Flutterwave has tripled that valuation after a $250 million Series D raise announced yesterday, February 16, 2022. The raise was led by global investment firm, B Capital. Leader of its $170 million Series C. Avenir Growth also participated in the round.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTripling its valuation isn\u2019t the only thing the fintech company has achieved since attaining unicorn status 12 months ago. Businesses using its platform have increased by 610,000 \u2014 290,000 to 900,000.\n\nIts total transaction, valued at $9 billion last year, has grown to $16 billion with 200 million transactions processed.\n\nAlthough Flutterwave started out as an enterprise payment fintech startup, it has detoured into creating fintech products for small and medium businesses and remittance products over the years.\n\nIn 2020 we saw the launch of Flutterwave Store revamped to Flutterwave Market in 2021. The platform now boasts 30,000 merchants according to TechCrunch. Flutterwave\u2019s remittance service, Send, also launched recently to help customers send money within and outside Africa.\n\nAway from fintech: Flutterwave also displayed interest in the creator economy with the acquisition of Disha, a platform that allows creators to curate content and receive payment. However, the payments feature still falls within Flutterwave\u2019s court.\n\nIPO insight? If you\u2019re planning on investing in Flutterwave via stocks the CEO and Co-Founder, Olugbenga Agboola, told TechCrunch that the startup has no plan to IPO anytime soon. The funding will be geared towards its ambitious expansion plans and rapid customer acquisition.\n\nIf you want to go down memory lane before Flutterwave became a mammoth in the African tech space, you can start with the story of Agboola\u2019s first day as CEO.\n\nPlease read here: In conversation with Olugbenga Agboola on his first day as Flutterwave CEO\n\nCrowdForce\u2019s $3.6m pre-Series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions to financial inclusion most times comes in two ways online or offline. However, some people, like Twitter user, Mudia, are of the opinion that the former isn\u2019t true financial inclusion. Mudia sums up his opinion up in a tweet that reads,\n\n\u201cBanking the un-banked, but your solution na app wey dey work from Android 11 upwards.\u201d\n\nMost people with a similar stance believe a solution to financial inclusion that requires a smartphone isn\u2019t practical as most smartphone users are already banked. According to Dataphyte, a media research and data analytics organisation, 38 million Nigerians were financially excluded in 2020.\n\nFintech startups like OPay and TeamApt are tackling the problem with agent banking, taking physical banking services to hard-to-reach locations.\n\nHowever, these agents still need banks to get cash, and that\u2019s where CrowdForce, which announced its $3.6 million pre-Series A yesterday comes in.\n\nThe startup offers agency banking services like OPay and TeamApt, but agents do not need to visit banks to get cash.

          "title": "Female founders need to learn how to play the venture capital game \u2014 Sarah Dusek",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA cursory look at the venture capital landscape in Africa will reveal an impressive number of deals and the triumph of innovation over regulation. Yet, a closer look at the numbers will show a wide gulf between the amount of money raised by men and women.\n\nWhile funding for female founders globally is minimal, African women have seen significantly less money than their male counterparts, receiving less than 1% of startup funding in 2021. One reason for this is that most female-led businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa are small businesses with little capacity for scale.\n\nAccording to Sarah Dusek, Managing General Partner at Enygma Ventures, who spoke to Techpoint Africa on Zoom, a second reason is that most women don\u2019t know how to play the venture capital game.\n\n\u201cI think one of the biggest components that we\u2019ve been working on for the last couple of years has been not knowing how you play this game, and getting funded is a bit of a game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are very specific rules to it; there are specific metrics that people like me are looking for. There are specific types of businesses that work and those that don\u2019t, particularly with this type of funding. Women are more familiar with taking debt and grants, and I think there are a lot of unfamiliarities in the space that disadvantages women.\u201d\n\nDue to this, Dusek, an entrepreneur, revealed that a huge part of Enygma Ventures\u2019 work in the last two years has been teaching women what venture funding requires. She also added that the presence of a few role models makes it harder for women to raise money.\n\nWith venture capital a novel concept in Africa, not too many people, regardless of gender, understand how it works. Therefore, the lack of knowledge plays a role in how women access funding. \u201cIf you know, you can build it,\u201d she said.\n\nHelping women build scalable businesses\n\nBuilding a business is a daunting task for anyone, but it can often seem like an impossible task when you\u2019re a woman. Centuries of restricting the participation of women in the economy to the informal sector have led to a small number of women in the workforce. Dusek knows this all too well, having built and sold Under Canvas, an American hospitality company.\n\nAfter selling Under Canvas, Dusek, who started her career working with non-governmental organisations in Africa, decided to invest in female founders. That decision birthed Enygma Ventures, a sector-agnostic firm providing women with the capital required to scale and grow their businesses.\n\n\u201cMy experience of being a female founder made me realise how hard it is for women founders to get access to capital, and so it\u2019s a natural progression from being an entrepreneur to being a guide to helping other women do the same thing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Dusek, Managing General Partner, Enygma Ventures\n\nEnygma Ventures invests in early-stage women-led or women-founded startups across the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and East Africa. The ticket sizes for startups the firm invests in vary from $100,000 to as much as $1 million. While the firm is sector-agnostic in its approach to investment, Dusek disclosed that it would not invest in startups that cannot scale.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we look at is the size of the addressable market. So how big is the problem you\u2019re trying to address, and how big could you be?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe quality of the team is another factor that Enygma Ventures considers, with Dusek revealing that they like to see proof that founders have created value. Since opening its doors in 2019, the firm has invested in over 12 women-led startups, including Adbot, Koa Academy, Candor, Premier Credit, Play Sense, and Lupiya.\n\nBiggest mistakes entrepreneurs make\n\nAn entrepreneur\u2019s path is filled with uncertainty. Many of the problems they face are unanticipated or not taught in schools. Consequently, they are likely to make quite a few mistakes. Dusek shared a few that she has seen in her time.\n\nBuilding a venture-backed business means working to meet certain milestones, and Dusek revealed that many early-stage founders are not clear on what these milestones should be.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge with early-stage founders is recognising what your major milestones are. We talk a lot about the valley of death, which is this early-stage era in a startup\u2019s life where it\u2019s very easy for startups to crash and burn and die, or they make it to the next level.\n\n\u201cThe big challenge for startups is how to manage their available cash and get to the next level because if you\u2019re a company that\u2019s taking on venture capital in the early stages, the likelihood is that you\u2019re going to raise more capital to keep growing,\u201d she noted.\n\nThe next frontiers in Africa\n\nWhile there are quite a few factors responsible for the low level of funding that women get, my conversations with various founders and investors suggest that one major factor is that there are not enough women building scalable businesses. Venture capital is, in many ways, a numbers game, and the more women there are building companies that investors like, the higher the chances of women receiving investments.\n\nSo, what industries does Dusek want to see more women play in? Pretty much every industry that can drive economic development in Africa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see more women building any kind of business. I think we\u2019ve got a few frontiers to move the continent forward, and I\u2019d love to see more women pioneering. I think we have huge opportunities in education, healthcare, financial services, and almost anything where we are trying to raise the standard of living for millions.\u201d\n\nIn the early 2000s, the growth of the African middle class and mobile phone penetration, amongst other developments, gave birth to the term \u201cAfrica rising.\u201d Yet, most African countries have failed to live up to the hype. However, a few people still hold out hope that the new crop of entrepreneurs can spearhead the development of Africa.\n\nDusek believes that African economies have a distinct advantage as they do not have to make bite-sized changes but could leapfrog certain developments.\n\n\u201cI am super passionate about Africa\u2019s ability to lead. I feel like so often, we wait for the world to allow us to come to their party, and Africa is at this moment where she has to lead and build her own future, and that\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nVenture capital can be complicated, but Enygma Ventures wants to demystify it. Prospective founders can head over to the website, where an eligibility quiz helps both parties to determine if they\u2019re a good fit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Taraba, Niger, Bauchi and Kaduna states saw significant growth in voice and internet subscriptions services in 2021, indicating a gradual pick-up in economic activities in some northern parts of the country. The aforementioned states outperformed others on both the voice and internet growth charts as of December 2021.\n\nNigeria\u2019s telecommunications and information services sub-sector recorded real GDP growth rates of 7.69 percent in Q1 2021; 5.90 percent in Q2 2021; 10.87 percent in Q3 2021, and 5.31 percent in Q4 2021, leading to an annual real GDP growth rate of 7.28 percent in 2021.\n\nActive voice subscriptions grew by 42 percent in Taraba State in the fourth quarter of 2021 when compared with half-year voice subscriptions in that state. Niger, Bauchi and Kaduna states all recorded double digits growth rates to the tune of 41 percent, 40 percent and 18 percent respectively.\n\nThe above development may not be unconnected with the different mouth-watering promos telecoms firms rolled out in 2021 to gain new subscribers and retain the existing ones as fierce competition continuously sweeps through the industry.\n\nTo mark its 20th anniversary, Airtel Nigeria launched a N100 million \u201crecharge and blow promo\u201d that allowed customers to win cash, airtime and data. Globacom gave out 500,000 prizes that ranged from luxury cars to household appliances through the \u201cjoy unlimited extravaganza promo\u201d. The two firms performed well on the growth charts in both southern and northern parts of the country.\n\nThe growth rate in voice subscriptions was 9.9 percent in Kogi, 9.5 percent in FCT, 8.8 percent in Nasarawa, 8.1 percent in Yobe, 7.5 percent in Plateau and 5.2 percent in Imo, which is the only southern state among the top ten states with the highest growth rates in voice subscriptions as of December 2021.\n\nFor the entire country, voice subscriptions grew by 4.2 percent from 187.27 million lines in June 2021 to 195.12 million lines as of December 2021.\n\nActive internet subscriptions grew by 1.3 percent nationwide from 139.82 million lines in June 2021 to 141.62 million lines as of December 2021. Northern states dominated the growth chart as Lagos State, Nigeria\u2019s commercial capital, made it among the top ten states with the highest growth rates.\n\nLike voice subscriptions, Taraba, Niger, Bauchi, Kaduna and Kogi states topped the internet subscriptions growth chart as they posted 42 percent, 40 percent, 37 percent, 13 percent and 9.4 percent growth rates respectively.\n\nOthers are Yobe and FCT, 7 percent each; Nasarawa, 6 percent; Plateau, 4 percent and Lagos, 2 percent.\n\nIn both services \u2013 voice and internet subscriptions, the worst-performing states were Katsina and Zamfara where voice subscriptions declined by 12 percent and 16 percent, while internet subscriptions fell by 21 percent and 28 percent respectively. The two states had telecommunications services disrupted last year as a result of the war on insurgency and banditry.\n\nFollowing the above, the market share of the telecommunications industry increased in the northern part of the country. Voice subscriptions\u2019 market share rose from 45 percent in June 2021 to 47 percent by December of the same year. On the contrary, its market share which was 55 percent in the southern part of the country as of June 2021 fell to 53 percent by December 2021.\n\nEconomic analysts have attributed the increase in market share in the north to work at home policies of many companies and the fact that the subscribers in the southern part are exploring other options of getting internet services.\n\n\u201cNigerians, particularly those in the southern part who work from home now realise the internet services of most telcos are not as reliable as initially anticipated. They are now exploring other alternatives. Meanwhile, telecommunications services are still developing in the north. While their southern counterparts are exploring other options, northerners are just embracing the technology\u201d, says Moses Ojo, a Lagos-based economic analyst.\n\n\u201cMost of the companies are in southern Nigeria and every Nigerian works here. The work at home policy allows Nigerians to relocate to their states of origin and work from there. Northerners whose places of work are in the south could go back to their respective states given the work from home policies being implemented by some companies in Nigeria\u201d, says another analyst who pleaded anonymity.\n\nRead also: Telecom sector sees first voice subscriber decline in 5 years\n\nWhen analysed by operators, MTN Nigeria\u2019s voice subscriptions grew in eight states the highest being Niger, Taraba and Bauchi. Globacom\u2019s voice subscriptions grew in 31 states during the period the highest being Yobe, Kano and Borno states. Airtel Nigeria\u2019s voice subscriptions grew in 34 states the highest being Yobe, Ekiti, Gombe, Taraba and Jigawa states, while 9mobile\u2019s voice subscriptions grew in 15 states the highest being Oyo, Imo, Kano, Ebonyi and Adamawa states.\n\nInternet subscriptions market share in the northern part increased from 45 percent at half-year 2021 to 46.3 percent as at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021. On the contrary, internet subscriptions\u2019 market share in the southern part fell to 54 percent in December 2021 down from 55 percent at half-year 2021.\n\nAirtel Nigeria\u2019s telecommunications services are now concentrated in the northern part of the country. According to our analysis, 51 percent of Airtel Nigeria\u2019s voice subscriptions market, and 50 percent of internet market activities are in the northern part of the country.\n\nIn the voice subscriptions services, 52 percent of MTN Nigeria\u2019s market, 58 percent of Globacom\u2019s and 56 percent of 9Mobile\u2019s are in the southern part of the country.\n\nSimilarly, 53 percent of MTN Nigeria\u2019s internet services, 58 percent of Globacom\u2019s, and 62 percent of 9Mobile\u2019s are in the south while the balance is in the north.",

          "text": "For the first time in six years, activity in Nigeria\u2019s wholesale and retail trade sector grew in 2021, according to data by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).\n\nAccording to the GDP report released Thursday by the NBS, the trade sector grew 8.62 percent.\n\nBefore now, it had contracted by 8.49 percent, 0.38 percent, 0.63 percent, 1.05 percent, and 0.24 percent in 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\n\nAlso, the growth rate in 2021 is the highest since 2012 (9.61%).\n\n\u201cThe positive growth can be attributed to the low base effect, full reopening of the economy and the removal of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, which has made activities in the trade sector to be much easier leading to its recovery,\u201d Ayorinde Akinloye, a consumer analyst at United Capital plc, says.\n\nCommenting in the same vein, Damilola Adewale, a Lagos-based economic analyst, notes that the recovery shows that businesses and economic activities have improved in the sector\n\n\u201cBut despite the recovery, I am still bothered because the structural challenges such as high cost of foreign exchanges, weak demand, logistics issues, etc. still linger in the sector,\u201d Adewale states.\n\nThe report also highlights that the country\u2019s overall GDP grew by 3.98 percent (year-on-year) in Q4 \u20182021, showing a sustained positive growth for the fifth quarter since the recession witnessed in 2020 when output contracted by -6.10 percent and -3.62 percent in Q2 and Q3 of 2020 under the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe fourth quarter growth indicates a steady economic recovery accounting for an annual growth of 3.40 percent in 2021,\u201d it states.\n\nIn terms of contribution to GDP, the trade sector contributed 15.66 percent, higher than the 15.46 percent it represented in the previous year, and higher than the 14.93 percent recorded in Q3 \u20182021.\n\nTrade, which is the second biggest sector by output production, can be likened as the barometer of consumer purchasing power. The higher the level of consumption, the better the sector performs.\n\nAnd due to this, the sector has been touted by economists as an important tool in the quest for development as it contributes roughly 15-16 percent to the GDP.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s private sector sets aside N100bn to fight insecurity\n\nBut in Africa\u2019s biggest economy, it had been in and out of negative territory since 2016 over myriad challenges like macroeconomic volatility, rapid naira\u2019s depreciation, weak purchasing power, and household incomes.\n\nRecently, a report by FBNQuest shows that Nigeria\u2019s real household consumption as a proportion of GDP rose to 76 percent in 2021, the highest level since 2010. According to the report, the surge led to a fast recovery post-pandemic for Nigeria\u2019s consumer\u2019s industry.\n\nAdditionally, a 2021 Global Retail Development Index (GRDI) reported that the country\u2019s total retail sales rose to $108 billion after it had been trending south, falling to $105 billion in 2019 from $109 billion in 2017, $125 billion in 2016 and $135 billion in 2015.\n\nAnalysts at Kearney, a global management consultancy firm, said the Nigerian economy is making a steady recovery from COVID-19.\n\nAlso, Uchenna Uzo, consumer expert and faculty director at Lagos Business School, says people have started coming out more and they have been able to spend on other items beyond the discretionary ones, noting, \u201cE-commerce has also made it possible to increase the portfolio of what people buy.\u201d",

          "text": "Nigeria\u2019s economy may have grown by the most since 2015 when President Muhammadu Buhari was first voted into office, but the size of the economy has shrunk since then and Nigerians are worse off.\n\nThe shrinking size of the economy means there is a smaller pie to share among Nigeria\u2019s 200 million people, a painful squeeze for a country that is home to the world\u2019s largest number of poor people.\n\nThat explains why many Nigerians can not relate with the latest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures put out by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), according to Deji Obe, a Nigerian youth who has been without a job since what would be the first of two recessions in five years in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe data gives the impression that things are finally getting better now that GDP growth has outpaced population growth for the first time since 2015,\u201d Obe said. \u201cBut in reality, times are still very hard.\u201d\n\nThe economy grew by 3.4 percent in 2021, the NBS said Thursday, marking the fastest growth rate in 7 years, helped by an improvement in the trade sector and low base effects.

In that time the population has grown 13 percent.\n\n\u201cGDP numbers in isolation is incomplete when measuring the health of an economy, other factors like unemployment, poverty rate, inflation and human development index matter and Nigeria is nowhere near the desired level,\u201d said Muda Yusuf , an economist and former head of trade advocacy group, the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI).\n\nNigeria is not only the world\u2019s poverty capital, ahead of India which has five times its population, it\u2019s unemployment rate at 33 percent is the second highest globally after Namibia and it has 7th highest inflation rate in Africa.\n\nA cocktail of poor economic policies has made life in Nigeria tough, according to observers,\n\nas tough as it has ever been in a long time.\n\nEconomists say the country\u2019s performance in 2021, not significantly improved from the chaotic years since the recession in 2016, is made to look impressive by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when the economy shrank by the most in over two decades.\n\nRead more: IMF raises red flag over Nigeria\u2019s economy again\n\n\u201cThe magnitude at which the economy contracted in 2020 has certainly had a big role to play in the 2021 growth numbers so it is no surprise,\u201d said Taiwo Oyedele, an economist and partner at consulting firm, PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC).\n\n\u201cThe challenges the economy has faced since 2016 have not gone away, there is still a need for more fiscal and monetary reforms to take growth to sustainable levels,\u201d Oyedele said.\n\nWhile economists say the relatively high growth rate in 2021 is largely as a result of base effects, Harry Simon, who heads the government-owned NBS, could not agree more.\n\nHe said the impact of the low base effect could not be ruled out as it played a significant role in achieving the current figures and that it was not time to celebrate.\n\nNigeria\u2019s 2021 GDP growth beats estimates",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\n1 \u201c Wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise\u201d Prov. 20:1\n\nAlcohol has turned many in our street to be stupefied. They become object of ridicules and mockery. When alcohol makes them rage they find themselves in a state of extreme anger which in itself is uncontrollable like a mad man. That is why any one who is a new creature cannot go by it nor be deceived by it.\n\nSatan has his strategies; he teaches those who have not given their lives totally to Christ two words to swallow: \u201cDrink moderately\u201d or sometimes: \u201cdrinkbut not drunk\u201d that is Satan\u2019s strategy. He will not tell his disciples do not drink at all. He knows that would keep them entirely from strong drink from alcohol although he knew what that Angel of God told Manoah\u2019s wife: \u201cthou art barren and bears not: but thou shelf conceive, and tear a son. Now therefore, beware, I pray thee and drink not wine or strong drink, and eat not any Maclean thing.\u201d Judges 13:3-4 she obeyed God. But Eve did not obey God. Manoah\u2019s wife did not allow any suggestibility from Satan. Satan would have been capable of suggesting to Manoah\u2019s wife to stick to alcohol but should drink moderately so as not to cause any miscarriage or harm to the child in the womb.\n\nMany people have fallen because they listened to Satan\u2019s suggesting. And he brings his suggestions to people in a subtle way.\n\n2.In a new life one cannot be deceived by Satan. \u201cDrink a little, drink moderately\u201d. That is Satan\u2019s subtle way of opening the door of alcoholism to those who have not totally surrendered to Christ for a new life, for to be a new creature, for to allow old things to pass away and to allow one to be born again. So Jesus was blunt in telling Nichodemus the truth, the gospel truth: \u201cExcept a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God\u201d John 3:3.\n\nMany have been deceived into alcohol because they see Priests and Pastors who drink alcohol. The other day I was with some one who still opposed to doing away withalcohol entirely. He was gladdened and satisfied in his heart that Archbishop so and so was drinking alcohol; Bishop so, so and so, mentioning them by their names were drinking alcohol; that Provost so, so and so was drinking alcohol going by names; Cannon so, so and so going by their names were still with alcohol; that Venerable so, so and so going by their names were drinking alcohol; that it was only the present Bishop so, so mentioning his name that preached to his ministers, priests that they should forsake alcohol entirely but that some of the priests were still in alcohol secretly. That was one in his church narrating what he knew. Another could also narrate what goes on in his church concerning alcohol. We can see what great havoc that can be caused when people looking at their leaders see what they do or hear what they say.\n\nMany hundreds, many thousands, many millions have fallen into sin by what they see their leaders do. It is pathetic, disturbing and heart breaking. You look at this scripture: \u201cBut they also have erred throughwine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the Priests and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink\u2026.. Alltables are full of vomit and blitheness so that there is no place clean\u201d. Isaiah 28:7-8.\n\n3.Let those who delight in alcohol forsake their alcoholism and accept Jesus Christ and never seeking any hiding place in the bad examples of their leaders:\u201cmany pastors have destroyed my vineyard and \u2026\u201d Jer. 12:10. What you have to do now if you still drink alcohol, is to come truly to Christ and surrender your life to him and ask for a new life. He will surely do that for you. Be wise and not be deceived into alcohol.\n\nThere is no drunkard throughout all ages that ever agrees that he was at any time drunk. And there is no one in drunkenness that ever agrees that he is a drunkard.\n\nSatan has not relented in his ministrations. To you; he has not relented in whispering to you in his subtle way that you will be in a happy mood when you are in alcohol. Be ware of his suggestibility it is capable of pulling you out of the Christian way. If is capable of removing God\u2019s word from you and replacing it with deceit and unbeliever.\n\nRemember that all that God would use would be filled with the Holy Spiritand not with alcohol or strong drink. Paul was one; Peter, John, Stephen etc were filled with the Holy Spirit. Ask Jesus today to fill you with the Holy Spirit and there will be a change. Remember Hab.2:15\u201cwoe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink\u2026\u201d The end was that the neighbour became naked.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

If you ask me, I would tell you unequivocally and expressly that the letter sent out as the position of the NWC of our great party is a mistake and this mistake will be pointed out and corrected.\u201d\n\nOur correspondent also spoke to one of the leaders of the group who is a commissioner during the tenure of Prince Olagunsoye oyinlola, Sooko Sunday Adewole.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have gathered this afternoon to send strong signal to the Sen Iyorchia Ayu\u2019s led NWC of our great party to watch their back. He should desist from walking on the same path as the erstwhile occupant of that office, Prince Uche Secondus did.\u201d\n\nA former Chairman of the Party in Osun, Barr. Ojo Williams, said \u201cthe Peoples\u2019 Democratic Party which you all know is a democratic and law abiding party. What are we as a party going to campaign with, if we cannot obey a simple court pronouncement?\n\n\u201cThe constitution of our party is supreme. What this implies is that the dictates of the party constitution is supreme and in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\u201d\n\nHe further implored the NWC led by Ayu to be cautious and never allowe itself to be used as a destabilizing agent.",

          "text": "The Chief Executive Officer, 9PSB, Branka Mracajac, has emphasized the need to pay close attention to content creation as an important factor in driving and accelerating financial inclusion in the country, stating that it is capable of enhancing the future of digital banking in the long-term.\n\nMracajac made this assertion, while presenting a keynote address, themed \u201cContent Creation and Financial Inclusion; The Future of Digital Banking\u201d at the Tech Summit Ogun 2022, which held at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library Abeokuta, Ogun State on Thursday February 17, 2022.\n\nAccording to her, while there are ongoing efforts to support the country\u2019s financial inclusion drive, a lot more rest on formulating tailored strategies that address specific needs. \u201cProviding access to the banking agents and touch points, across the country is happening as we speak; payment service banks,\n\nmicrofinance banks, and FinTech companies are all working on this. But will this be enough? Will the access to digital banks change the mindset of Nigerians in rural areas of the country and be enough to drive the transition from cash to cashless society?\u201d she questioned.\n\nProffering the way forward, Mracajac stressed the need to provide financial literacy through content that speaks to an average Nigerian in unserved rural areas of the country, stating that financial inclusion is a process, not just a point in time and space that we want to reach.\n\nShe added that, developing content that speaks only to the already banked and mirroring the digital financial habits of those who are fully included and heavily banked, will not help to keep the newly on-boarded in the system long-term.\n\nShe stated: \u201cWhile creating and delivering the content for financial inclusion, we need to have in mind the needs of its beneficiaries, the targeted end-users of the financial services who are currently underserved and the only sustainable way is that we join our forces and create the content \u2013 apps and services that will address the specific needs of a farmer in Benue, market women in Onitsha, trader in Kano, fisherman in Delta, and the woman selling ofada rice in Ogun State.\u201d\n\nSpeaking further, she noted that, to drive the offline individuals and MSMEs from cash to cashless, from analog to digital and from informal to formal, content creators need to focus on two major goals; one, to deliver relevant and on-point digital financial literacy content, educating people about the principles, ways, modules, and benefits of banking. The second one, she stated, is needed for sustainable Financial inclusion: delivery of digital banking services that are a reflection of the lifestyle of the currently unbanked and underserved population.\n\nShe called on all stakeholders within the financial ecosystem, including content creators to work collectively to develop and implement a digital content strategy for the unbanked to move the financial inclusion needle and ultimately advance the economy, society and improve life of every Nigerian.\n\nIn his own keynote address, titled \u201cDisruptive Innovation: Production and Distribution of Creative Content, the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Professor Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, who was represented by the Chief Executive Officer, Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited (NIGCOMSAT), Dr. Abimbola Alale remarked that the quality of creatives and start-ups that Nigeria has produced is a testament to the potential of the ecosystem, and as such the ministry will continue to support the tech and creative entrepreneurs to play their part in developing Nigeria\u2019s digital economy.\n\nThe Tech Summit Ogun is an annual convergence of Tech disruptors, innovators, startups, organizations and technology enthusiast in Ogun State, aimed at spurring technological innovation towards the digital transformation and technological advancement of Ogun State. This year, the summit attracted over 2000 participants, mainly the youths and start-ups.\n\nFacebook Notice for EU! You need to login to view and post FB Comments!",

          "text": "By Sunday Oguntuyi, Osogbo\n\nHon. Rasaq Salinsile led faction of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State, has accused Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of importing thugs into the state for tomorrow\u2019s governorship primary election.\n\nAccording to Salinsile, the thugs were conveyed into the state in 38 vehicles in the early hour of today, Friday.\n\nSalinsile said the vehicles were escorted by a police van into the state through Abere.\n\nHe spoke at a press conference addressed by Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, a governorship aspirant, on Friday, in Osogbo.\n\nThe Chairman alleged the Governor and his faction, IleriOluwa of plans to unleash attack on members of the party who are loyalists of the Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola in tomorrow\u2019s primary.\n\nSalinsile spoke just as Adeoti doubted the fairness of the primary election.\n\nAccording to Adeoti, the primary election has already been schemed in favour of Oyetola because of his membership of National Caretaker and Extra Ordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party.\n\nAdeoti said the date of the primary election which had earlier been slated for March 5, was reversed by the NCECPC to February 19, to favour Oyetola.\n\nThe former Secretary to the State Government, said: \u201cWe have it on good authority that the NCECPC was influenced by Oyetola to reverse the date to have the primary before the National Convention coming up on February 26, 2022.\n\n\u201cIt is believed that Oyetola is afraid of contesting a free and fair primary election to be conducted by an objective committee after the convention\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIn the spirit of fair play, objectivity and natural justice, Governor Oyetola is not supposed to remain in the membership of the NCECPC. What we are witnessing is a case of a thief adjudicating his own case. He can never convict himself.\n\n\u201cGovernor Oyetola\u2019s membership of the NCECPC is against the democratic norms. Tomorrow\u2019s governorship primary cannot be fair, free, and equitable if Governor Oyetola is still a member of NCECPC.\n\n\u201cWe note that like it happened in time of the party congresses, we are reliably informed that Governor Oyetola is the one who hand-picked the chairman and members of the primary election committee. It is within human reasonability not to trust such handpicked committee by an interested party member. Such committee would never be fair to other contenders.\n\n\u201cThere can only be point of convergence for us if Governor Oyetola could resign his membership and the process of conducting the primary begins afresh.\u201d\n\nButtressing his argument on why the primary election will not be free and fair, Adeoti said the register of APC members is not made available to him and his tendency, the Salinsile faction of the party.\n\nAccording to Adeoti, Governor Oyetola has refused to release the register of party members which will be used for the primary election.\n\n\u201cIf there is no deliberate attempt to manipulate the primary process, it is important to make the membership register available, display it for claims and objections before using it for tomorrow\u2019s primary election or any time it will come up\u201d, he said.\n\nAdeoti, however, said in spite of the anomalies raised, he and his supporters will not boycott the primary election.\n\n\u201cMy supporters and I are going to participate in the primary election tomorrow. We are not going to boycott. I want to urge all APC members to go to their Collation centres in their various wards to vote for me.\n\n\u201cI called on the security agencies in the state to provide adequate security for our people. As said earlier, the Governor\u2019s camp is planning violence, but we are resolute and believe that the security agents will act responsibly\u201d, Adeoti declared\n\nFacebook Notice for EU!

          "text": "By Fredrick Nwabufo\n\nKilling, killing, killing in the name of Biafra! When did murder become typical of the Igbo stock? When did taking innocent lives become classic in Igbo land? In Igbo cosmology, murder, \u2018Igbu oshu\u2019 is a cardinal sin deserving of banishment. A murderer is banished from the community and the land is cleansed of the abomination.\n\nHave the Igbo settled for this governing abomination? Have the elders been functionally vasectomised? How can murder, anarchy, and fear reign in the land uncontested? Have we become a people given to bloodletting, beheading and cannibalism? Have we gone backwards in our evolution as a humane and cosmopolitan people to become savages?\n\nWhy has this cumulus of evil persisted and remained hanging over an entire region? A region that was once prosperous, peaceful and bubbling on the growth index is now a slaughterhouse that investors are running away from. The south-east is being destroyed by the same people who claim to be fighting for the people.\n\nSecurity agents have been killed. Traditional rulers have been killed. Men have been killed and women have been raped and killed by this band of parademons. A few days ago, \u2018\u2019unknown gunmen\u2019\u2019 attacked a police station and killed three policemen in Ebonyi. Last week, gunmen killed seven community leaders in Imo. And the killings persist.\n\nThere is no victory in war; only pain, blood and death. Nobody should provoke another pogrom or full-scale war in Igbo land. Ndi Igbo must not let the vocal minority drown them out. They must speak up and be heard.\n\nIt has now become customary for residents of the south-east to wake up to severed heads dangling from poles in market squares, roads and community facilities. An unsleeping evil has taken over the land.\n\nOn Wednesday, these \u2018\u2019unknown gunmen\u2019\u2019 invaded a cattle market at Omumauzor; a community in Ukwa West LGA of Abia. The market is said to be peopled by Nigerians from the north. They came not to buy cattle, but to kill. By the time they were done, eight citizens were dead. These parademons did not spare anything, they killed cattle and set the market ablaze. What sort of bestiality is this?\n\nAccording to Abia state government, the gunmen struck around 11pm on Tuesday. \u201cOn Tuesday, 15th February 2022 at about 11:35pm, some yet-to-be-identified hoodlums allegedly invaded traders at the New Cattle Market located in Omumauzor, Ukwa West Local Government Area of our dear state. We are shocked and saddened by this mindless and barbaric act of violence that claimed the lives of about 8 innocent citizens of our great country and we totally condemn this dastardly act together with its wicked perpetrators,\u2019\u2019 the state government said.\n\nThe attack appears to be ethnically-motivated and targeted. This makes it very dangerous. These ravagers are not only threatening the lives of Igbo citizens and other Nigerians in the south-east, they are also jeopardising the safety and security of Igbo citizens in other parts of the country.\n\nAs I said in the column, \u2018Ndi Igbo stand for One Nigeria\u2019, those crusading for the secession of the south-east today are deficient students of history and sociology. Even the late Odumegwu Ojukwu, the captain of the secessionist struggle during the war, regretted that devastating episode in our history. Ojukwu said: \u2018\u2019I don\u2019t think the second war is necessary. We should have learnt from the first one.\u201d\n\nThere is no victory in war; only pain, blood and death. Nobody should provoke another pogrom or full-scale war in Igbo land. Ndi Igbo must not let the vocal minority drown them out. They must speak up and be heard.\n\nThe Igbo elite and citizens must take a stand to end this fast descent into utter devastation. Instead of angling for the presidency in 2023, we should work at ending the carnage in our home. Onye ulo ya na-agba oku, anaghi achu oke. Our house is on fire we cannot afford to be chasing a will-o-the-wisp.\n\n*Nwabufo aka Mr OneNigeria is a writer and journalist.",

          "text": "\u2018\u2026None of the parties has youth-based ideology\u2019\n\n\u2026Youths have been govs, but couldn\u2019t change anything \u2013 Abdulrahman\n\n\u2018\u2026They don\u2019t have the required political structure\u2019\n\n\u2018\u2026Young Nigerians need the bigwigs to achieve something tangible\u2019\n\n\u2026We\u2019re experienced, capable \u2013 Young Nigerians\n\nAs the political scheming for the 2023 general elections continues to gather momentum, many aspirants, including the youth, have declared their intentions to run for one office or the other. As the declaration, consultations and mobilisation continue, ABDULRAHMAN ZAKARIYAU wonders if the youth have any chance.\n\nNigeria is the largest and most populous black nation on earth, with a population of over 200 million citizens. Interestingly, out of this population, there are over 84 million registered voters. Notably, the Nigerian youth aged 18-40 constitute more than 60 per cent of the registered voters. This is an indication that the Nigerian youth have the power to change the direction of Nigeria, even if the political leadership is not ready to share power with them. They have the power to determine who leads and how they lead Nigeria.\n\nHowever, despite this power, old politicians still lead and dictate what happens in the country\u2019s political sphere. The youth don\u2019t usually occupy the critical elective positions. As many political analysts said, power is not served a la carte. A few pundits, politicians and other political stakeholders have expressed concern over the chances of Nigeria youths as we approach the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u2018Our demands\u2019\n\nA group of young Nigerians under the aegis of Youth Engagement and Inclusion Agenda have demanded that for a new Nigeria, each candidate seeking to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari must reserve specifically the vice-president\u2019s seat for the youth. The group also asked that governorship candidates toe the same line and zone the deputy governorship seats to the youth, noting that they are the next generation of leaders.\n\nAt a recent event, the group stated that the move was to prevent a leadership vacuum that might arise when the present crop of leaders retire from active politics as well as the need to proffer solutions to the country\u2019s challenges. It added that \u201cthis will enable the youth to garner the needed experience to rescue Nigeria.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s convener, Idris Aregbe, declared that their requests were not too difficult to be approved by any of the presidential candidates. He noted that their concern was not about political parties, but that Nigerian youths should occupy critical leadership positions.\n\nHe also acknowledged that the youth were very influential and that their numbers could swing the votes in the right direction for the benefit of all.\n\n\u201cWe believe so much in ourselves as youths and the numbers that we have which is also our strength and that is why we have decided to come together as well as speak with one voice.\n\n\u201cThis is a group of people that understand what politics is all about and we will definitely work to ensure that we get it right. This is a youth agenda that will ensure inclusion for the youth. We are ready to ensure that the youths get their desired positions in the government come 2023.\n\n\u201cWe are one Nigeria and the only thing that separates Nigerians is either you are youth or the elderly. We are willing to ensure that the youth become part of governance in 2023,\u201d he said.\n\nA member of the group, Japheth Odesanya, said they were determined to ensure that beginning from 2023, the country is governed by anyone ready to build the youth and make key stakeholders in the government.\n\n\u201cWe will use all our energy, as youths, to galvanise and mobilise young Nigerians to see this through because the time has come for the youths to start manning key leadership positions across the country,\u201d Odesanya said.\n\nNYCN\u2019s position\n\nIn his remarks, the president, National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), Ambassador Sukubo Sara-Igbe Sukubo, said Nigerian youths stood a chance in the 2023 general elections.\n\nSpeaking on the telephone with this reporter, Sukubo said, \u201cWe have the numbers, we have the experience and we have the energy. So, we will determine what will happen in the 2023 general elections.\n\n\u201cIf you notice, there is more agitation for a younger candidate for all offices. Interestingly, more of the demands for a younger person into political positions have come from the elder statesmen like former heads of state, Abdulsalami Abubakar, Ibrahim Gbadamosi Babangida and former President Olusegun Obasanjo.\n\n\u201cThis is because they have seen it all and they believe that Nigerian youths have the capacity, in terms of experience, technological knowledge and energy to lead and proffer lasting solutions to some of our problems.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sukubo, \u201cIf you have been following the on-going voter registration, you will have an idea of what to expect. You see, 2023 will certainly be different from 2019. If you notice those that have registered to vote, more youths have shown interest to aspire for one office or the other. It means more youths will be involved and they will participate actively to determine who leads the country.\n\n\u201cSo, youths who are aspiring for elective positions stand a chance because we have resolved to support one of us, a youth for most elective positions.\n\n\u201cWe also stand a chance in determining who leads us. So, it is not just about electing fellow youths, we have also strategically positioned ourselves to support only those who will support the youth agenda.\u201d\n\nAnalysts\u2019 views\n\nOn his part, a youth activist and public affairs commentator, Agboola Abdulrahman, said Nigerian youths \u201cdon\u2019t have the political structure that will give them a better chance in the 2023 elections.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThe idea of coming to the political sphere and using one nomenclature to negotiate for political positions has never worked in Nigeria and it will never work. Up till today, there is no party that is sprung up that you can call youth party that has a youth-based ideology.\n\n\u201cWe have so many youths that became governors in this country and it has not changed anything in the polity and country. The most important for me is to have quality people that can deliver the dividends of democracy to the people.\n\n\u201cIt is a matter of energy for you to galvanise your energy to win an election in the country, except you are talking about people contesting in the House of Representatives level that is popular within their constituency. And even within this constituency we are talking about, they still require the support of the political bigwigs to achieve something tangible.\u201d\n\nHe said further, \u201cSo, the question is how many young people in Nigeria are now political bigwigs for them to make something out of 2023 general elections?\n\n\u201cIn the demography of youths, what is the level of political participation at the leadership level? PDP organised its national convention and the person that emerged as national chairman is an old man. APC will do theirs very soon; let us see if they will give the chance to a young person. So, if party leadership will not go to young people, how will you expect other offices or positions to go to them?\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to politics it has to do with your test. Who are you? What is your orientation? Who groomed you? What is your background? As we go into the 2023 elections, there is no young person in Nigeria that has that popularity, charisma or the political structure to emerge as governor, president. This is about political party structure; if the youth don\u2019t have the political party and structure that is sponsoring them then there is no chance for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, the youth we are talking about, do they have the contact, the connectivity and they participate actively in the entire process? From what we have seen over the years, it means this thing is not age backed. It is about their involvement, what they can do and how committed they are. If the youth are serious they should start from their constituency.\n\n\u201cYoung people who are serious, who believe they have the energy, intellectual capacity and popularity start from their constituency. They should mobilise, join a platform or form their platform for a political structure. If they can not do this, then I don\u2019t think they stand any chances.\u201d\n\nLikewise, a political analyst, Aminu Mohammed, believes that the youth stand a chance in 2023 only if they are united, noting that their participation in the process is key to their chances.\n\nIn a chat with Blueprint Weekend, Mohammed said, \u201cOver the years, as a matter of fact, whenever is time for another general election this youth thing becomes a topical matter. But what happens during and after the elections? The youth go to bed.\n\n\u201cIt is a known fact that the democratic processes in Nigeria and most of the world largely depends on the Youths. They have the number, the energy and know-how to turn around things in Nigeria. But do they use all these to their advantage and the advantage of their country? Certainly, not in the case of Nigeria!\n\n\u201cThey have used their energy, numbers and know-how wrongly. They are allowed themselves to be used. Instead of participating in an electioneering process, they prefer to remain on social media and allow the old ones to take over their chances.\n\n\u201cThough like a few others, I believe Nigerian youths stand a chance in every election as candidates and even to determine what will happen as the electorates, but their chances depend on many things. It depends on their strategy, unity of purpose and their level of involvement in party politics, before the election, during the election and even after the election.\n\n\u201cSo, their chances in 2023 depend on their level of seriousness and what they set out to achieve. Youths would not make any meaningful impact in 2023 if they are not united, actively involved and committed to their plans.\u201d\n\n\u2018Won\u2019t be business as usual\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, a new youth group under the auspices of We2gedaNG Movement has vowed to kick against godfatherism, moneybags politics and thuggery, adding that \u201c2023 will not be business as usual.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s chairman, Board of Trustees, Ibrahim Abdulkareem, who made the vow while unveiling the Movement, said, \u201cWe2gedaNG was initiated out of a passion to re-unite the young generation of Nigeria regardless of religion, tribal and political sentiments and build a transparent and competent leadership structure in the country.\n\n\u201cThe mission of We2gedaNG is premised on building youth that will develop new Nigeria. It is no longer business as usual. We would not allow anybody to use and dump us the youth anymore. We have come to realise that it is only during elections that politicians use religion and tribal sentiment to canvass support. This time, it will not work.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to eliminate godfatherism in our politics, moneybags will not work. We would not allow them to use young people as thugs. We are ready to mobilise and rehabilitate the youth and ensure they know the right direction.\n\n\u201cWe will use social media networks to engage and evaluate aspiring leaders. It is time the government must value the life of the youth. We are not part of the decision making and unfortunately, when the decision is taken, it is to our detriment. We will raise an army of youth that will build new Nigeria that will work for us.\u201d",
          "summary": "Notably, the Nigerian youth aged 18-40 constitute more than 60 per cent of the registered voters.\nThis is an indication that the Nigerian youth have the power to change the direction of Nigeria, even if the political leadership is not ready to share power with them.\nAs many political analysts said, power is not served a la carte.\nA few pundits, politicians and other political stakeholders have expressed concern over the chances of Nigeria youths as we approach the 2023 general elections.\nHe noted that their concern was not about political parties, but that Nigerian youths should occupy critical leadership positions.",

For many decades, our continent has been deprived of political stability and socio-economic development due to terrorism and violent extremism,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMore worrisome is the current state of democracy on the continent, which has become a great source of concern to many of us, with increasing cases of unconstitutional change of governments across the continent, particularly in West Africa. This is in addition to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe African Union has often responded to these challenges through its different structures, such as the African Peace and Security Architecture and the African Governance Architecture.\n\n\u201cThrough enhanced collaboration with our development partners, especially the European Union, we can identify areas of cooperation for quick and substantive results.\n\n\u201cAs leaders and policymakers, it is important for our partnership to place priority on tackling the root causes of conflicts in Africa, as well as taking measures in safeguarding peace and security if we are to achieve the African Union Agenda 2063.\n\n\u201cWe also call for stronger support from the European Union in the condemnation and imposition of weighty sanctions on countries that engage in unconstitutional change of governments, as well as manipulation of constitutions in favor of extension of term limits.\u201d\n\nAccording to his spokesman, Garba Shehu, the Nigerian leader added that it was imperative to ensure that election processes in Africa have outcomes that truly reflect the wishes of the electorate, as to go contrary to these is courting instability.\n\nHe said, \u201cwe have a responsibility to reduce conflicts that stem from lack of good governance, unaccountability, corruption and social exclusion.\n\n\u201cFree, fair, credible, and transparent elections remain crucial elements in ensuring peace and security and promoting constitutional order, democracy, and inclusive governance on the continent.\n\n\u201cIt is, therefore, imperative for our partnership to also focus on strengthening election processes in Africa and prevent interference to influence the process and outcomes of elections.\u201d\n\nPresident Buhari also called for the concretization and transformation of promises of cooperation made by the European leaders to actions.\n\n\u201cI wish to underscore the need to convert our pledges on political cooperation in the area of peace, security, and conflict prevention into concrete initiatives such as joint field missions, shared understanding and analysis on crisis situations, as well as joint early action and swift implementation of agreed positions.\n\n\u201cThe movement and operation of terrorists and violent extremist groups along the Sahel could better be addressed through an improved Continental Early Warning Mechanism. Consequently, we believe there is a clear need to strengthen our cooperation on security with the European Union, particularly through improved intelligence sharing and acquisition of military equipment and hardware.\n\n\u201cWe invite the EU to upscale its support for the G5 Sahel and the Multinational Joint Taskforce in the Lake Chad Region as we strive to further degrade the Boko-Haram insurgents and their Islamic State in the West Africa Province counterparts. Africa also looks up to Europe for enhanced support in the area of combating Illicit financial flows and terrorism funding that aid the activities of terrorists and violent extremist groups,\u201d the president added.\n\nHe called for all hands to be on deck to ensure that Africa\u2019s Blue Economy Agenda for development is realized.\n\n\u201cI must emphasize the importance of expanding regional and international cooperation on ocean governance, on the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing as well as on maritime security, including piracy, illicit trafficking and other maritime crimes and threats as reflected in the 2050 Africa Integrated Maritime Strategy,\u201d the Nigerian leader added.",

President Obasanjo was focused and determined in all that he wanted to do.\u201d\n\nAnyim, who represented Ebonyi South, succeeded Chuba Okadigbo as the Senate President in August 2000 after the latter had been impeached \u2013 at a time when Obasanjo was president.\n\nHe held the position until May 2003, but not without a disagreement between the legislature and the executive. This was said to have led to a rift between the duo with purported impeachment plots.\n\nDuring his interview with Channels Television, the former Senate President stressed that there was no rift between him and Obasanjo.\n\n\u201cWe had a little disagreement, and it was the National Assembly and the Executive; not Pius Ayim and (former) President Obasanjo. What brought about the problem was a motion moved by Senator Idris Abubakar from Gombe, it wasn\u2019t a motion moved by me,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cIt was the action taken in the Senate that the former President was reacting to, and it was friction between National Assembly and the Executive.\n\n\u201cOf course, being the head of the legislature, I cannot run away from it; I was leading the legislature and he (Obasanjo) was leading the Executive on the other hand, but there was nothing personal.\u201d\n\nHunger For Power\n\nAyim, who also served as Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) under former President Goodluck Jonathan, revealed why he chose not to return to the Senate after 2003.\n\nHe faulted the claim that he was concerned the former President would block his bid in an apparent continuation of the supposed disagreement between them.\n\nInstead, the former SGF stated that I would amount to hunger for power to sit on the floor of the house, having served as the most senior lawmaker in the land.\n\n\u201cI had been President of the Senate and Chairman of the National Assembly, I had gotten to the peak of that career; there was no reason for coming back because if I come back and I was not elected President of the Senate, I will be at the floor,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cApart from that, if I have to come back, I should not expect to be elected as the President of the Senate because it should rotate and when I was leaving, I said that I believe in rotation. So, what makes you think that it was because of anybody?\n\n\u201cThe election was in my zone; it wasn\u2019t in the National Assembly. So, I wouldn\u2019t have come back after being President of the Senate and Chairman of the National Assembly to sit on the floor for whatever reason, that should be a hunger for power, and I didn\u2019t think I was hungry for power.\u201d",

          "text": "Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has called for the imposition of severe costs for delays in justice administration and delivery.\n\nThe vice-president explained that the court is a taxpayer-funded public resource and the wasting or abuse of its finite time and resources without strict consequence will eventually discredit the justice system.\n\nAccording to a statement signed on Saturday by Laolu Akande, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, the Vice President said this on Friday night at the 20th year memorial anniversary symposium in honour of a legal luminary, Bankole Olumide Aluko, SAN.\n\nThe Vice President, who spoke on the issues of judicial appointments, delays in the dispensation of justice, democracy, and digitisation in the judiciary, among others, noted that \u201cthe administration of justice system is the foundation of law and order, commerce and democracy.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cSevere costs should attend adjournments. There is no greater waste of taxpayer\u2019s funds than for a scheduled case to have to be adjourned. It is only heavy costs that will discourage this malfeasance.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Buhari Rues Youth Migration, Seeks Europe\u2019s Partnership To Halt Trend\n\nAccording to him, addressing delays should \u201cinvolve imposing sanctions by a more intentional regime for the award of adverse and wasted costs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdverse costs are paid to the successful party in a civil case and wasted costs are directed against legal practitioners for poor professional standards in the conduct of a case.\u201d\n\nOsinbajo said \u201ccertainty or predictability of judicial outcomes is one of the major strengths of the common law.\u201d\n\nRegarding the impact of the law on democracy, Osinbajo said that \u201cthe democratic rights of the people and their confidence in the notion of a government of the people, by the people, for the people, suffers when the system of electoral justice fails to see itself as a handmaid of the democratic process.\u201d\n\nCiting the decision of the Supreme Court in the 2019 elections in Zamfara State to buttress his point, the VP noted that \u201cto make sense, judicial decisions and reasoning must in most cases meet the common notions of fairness and justice.\n\n\u201cThe system of justice must recognize the larger principles that it serves. In judicial interpretation, the spirit is as important as the letter of the law. Otherwise, judicial decisions become technistic applications far removed from common sense.\n\n\u201cThe notions of justice that would meet public expectations of fairness and equity are those that promote substance over form. The observance of technicality over merit will always alienate the system of justice from the people it is meant to serve.\u201d\n\nOn the expectations from judicial officers, Prof. Osinbajo said \u201cwhile we ask for the best from our judicial officers, we must equally ensure that the conditions under which they operate are not only befitting but are good enough to attract the best of minds in our profession.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the Vice President said the institution and infrastructure remain key to reforming the system, stating that \u201cthe judge is, of course, central to how our system of justice works. It is the court, not counsel that must determine the pace of cases.\u201d\n\nOn the process for judicial appointments, the VP stated that the robustness and transparency of the processes in other jurisdictions \u201cprovide comfort to the candidates of the fairness of the selection process; and enable the public to have front-row seat in some of these processes\u201d, arguing that such a process be replicated in Nigeria.\n\nHe, however, assured that the challenges affecting the administration of justice in Nigeria are being addressed, and \u201cthere is much hope for the positive reform of the system as more result-oriented work is going on and some real changes expected.\u201d",

          "text": "U.S. President Joe Biden says he is now \u201cconvinced\u201d Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine and assault the capital, an ominous assessment that emerged as the country\u2019s war-torn east saw more attacks that the West said could be designed to establish a pretext for an attack.\n\nAfter weeks of saying the U.S. was not sure if Putin had made the final decision, Biden said Friday that his judgment had changed, citing American intelligence.\n\n\u201cAs of this moment, I\u2019m convinced he\u2019s made the decision,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe have reason to believe that.\u201d He reiterated that the assault could occur in the \u201ccoming days.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s comments at the White House followed a day of rising violence that included a humanitarian convoy hit by shelling and a car bombing in the eastern city of Donetsk. Pro-Russian rebels began evacuating civilians from the conflict zone with an announcement that appeared to be part of Moscow\u2019s efforts to paint Ukraine as the aggressor instead.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kremlin announced massive nuclear drills to flex its military muscle, and Putin pledged to protect Russia\u2019s national interests against what it sees as encroaching Western threats.\n\nBiden reiterated his threat of crushing economic and diplomatic sanctions against Russia if it does invade, and pressed Putin to reconsider. He said the U.S. and its Western allies were more united than ever to ensure Russia pays a steep price for any invasion.\n\nAs further indication that the Russians are preparing for a major military push, a U.S. defense official said an estimated 40% to 50% of the ground forces deployed in the vicinity of the Ukrainian border have moved into attack positions closer to the border. That shift has been under way for about a week, other officials have said, and does not necessarily mean Putin has decided to begin an invasion. The defense official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal U.S. military assessments.\n\nThe official also said the number of Russian ground units known as battalion tactical groups in the border area had grown to as many as 125, up from 83 two weeks ago. Each group has 750 to 1,000 soldiers.\n\nLines of communication remain open: The U.S. and Russian defense chiefs spoke Friday. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov agreed to meet next week.\n\nImmediate worries focused on eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting pro-Russia rebels since 2014 in a conflict that has killed some 14,000 people. With an estimated 150,000 Russian troops now posted around Ukraine\u2019s borders, the long-simmering separatist conflict could provide the spark for a broader attack.\n\nFears of such escalation intensified amid Friday\u2019s violence. A bombing struck a car outside the main government building in the rebel-held city of Donetsk, according to an Associated Press journalist there. The head of the separatist forces, Denis Sinenkov, said the car was his, the Interfax news agency reported.\n\nThere were no reports of casualties and no independent confirmation of the circumstances of the blast. Shelling and shooting are common along the line that separates Ukrainian forces and the rebels, but targeted violence is unusual in rebel-held cities.\n\nAdding to the tensions, two explosions shook the rebel-controlled city of Luhansk early Saturday. The Luhansk Information Center said one of the blasts was in a natural gas main and cited witnesses as saying the other was at a vehicle service station. There was no immediate word on injuries or a cause. Luhansk officials blamed a gas main explosion earlier in the week on sabotage.\n\nOverall, monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe reported more than 600 explosions in the war-torn east of Ukraine on Friday.\n\nSeparatists in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions that form Ukraine\u2019s industrial heartland known as the Donbas announced they were evacuating civilians to Russia.\n\nDenis Pushilin, head of the Donetsk rebel government, said women, children and the elderly would go first, and that Russia has prepared facilities for them. Pushilin alleged in a video statement that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was going to order an imminent offensive in the area.\n\nMetadata from two videos posted by the separatists announcing the evacuation show that the files were created two days ago, The Associated Press confirmed. U.S. authorities have alleged that the Kremlin\u2019s disinformation campaign could include staged, prerecorded videos.\n\nAuthorities began moving children from an orphanage in Donetsk, and other residents boarded buses for Russia. Long lines formed at gas stations as more people prepared to leave on their own.\n\nPutin ordered the government to offer a payment of 10,000 rubles (about $130) to each evacuee, equivalent to about half of an average monthly salary in the war-ravaged Donbas region.\n\nBy early Saturday, more than 1,100 residents of the rebel-controlled areas arrived in the neighboring Russian region of Rostov, according to the region\u2019s authorities, and thousands more were expected. Separatist officials have said they plan to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nThe explosions and the announced evacuations were in line with U.S. warnings of so-called false-flag attacks that Russia could use to justify an invasion.\n\nAround the volatile line of contact, a United Nations humanitarian convoy came under rebel shelling in the Luhansk region, Ukraine\u2019s military chief said. No casualties were reported. Rebels denied involvement and accused Ukraine of staging a provocation.\n\nUkraine denied planning any offensive.\n\n\u201cWe are fully committed to diplomatic conflict resolution only,\u201d Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the threat to global security is \u201cmore complex and probably higher\u201d than during the Cold War. He told a security conference in Munich that a small mistake or miscommunication between major powers could have catastrophic consequences.\n\nRussia announced this week that it was pulling back forces from vast military exercises, but U.S. officials said they saw no sign of a pullback and instead observed more troops moving toward the border with Ukraine.\n\nIn other developments, the White House and the U.K. formally blamed Russia for recent cyberattacks targeting Ukraine\u2019s defense ministry and major banks. The announcement was the most pointed attribution of responsibility for the intrusions, which barraged websites with junk data to make them unreachable.\n\nThe Kremlin sent a reminder to the world of its nuclear might, announcing drills of its nuclear forces for the weekend. Putin will monitor the exercise Saturday that will involve multiple practice missile launches.\n\nAsked about Western warnings of a possible Russian invasion on Wednesday that did not materialize, Putin said: \u201cThere are so many false claims, and constantly reacting to them is more trouble than it\u2019s worth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are doing what we consider necessary and will keep doing so,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have clear and precise goals conforming to national interests.\u201d\n\n___",

          "title": "Canada: Police Arrest 100 in Ottawa after 3-week Protest",
          "text": "Police arrested scores of demonstrators and towed away vehicles Friday in Canada\u2019s besieged capital, and a stream of trucks started leaving under the pressure, raising authorities\u2019 hopes for an end to the three-week protest against the country\u2019s COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nBy evening, at least 100 people had been arrested, mostly on mischief charges, and nearly two dozen vehicles had been towed, including all of those blocking one of the city\u2019s major streets, authorities said. One officer had a minor injury, but no protesters were hurt, interim Ottawa Police Chief Steve Bell said.\n\nPolice \u201ccontinue to push forward to take control of our streets,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe will work day and night until this is completed.\u201d\n\nThose arrested included four protest leaders. One received bail while the others remained jailed.\n\nThe crackdown on the self-styled Freedom Convoy began in the morning, when hundreds of police, some in riot gear and some carrying automatic weapons, descended into the protest zone and began leading demonstrators away in handcuffs through the snowy streets as holdout truckers blared their horns.\n\nTow truck operators \u2014 wearing neon-green ski masks, with their companies\u2019 decals taped over on their trucks to conceal their identities \u2014 arrived under police escort and started removing the hundreds of big rigs, campers and other vehicles parked shoulder-to-shoulder near Parliament. Police smashed through the door of at least one RV camper before hauling it away.\n\nScuffles broke out in places, and police repeatedly went nose-to-nose with the protesters and pushed the crowd back amid cries of \u201cFreedom!\u201d and the singing of the national anthem, \u201cO Canada.\u201d Later police on horses were used to push back the crowd for a time.\n\nPolice said late in the afternoon that protesters had assaulted officers and tried to take their weapons. Some began dismantling equipment at a stage where they had played music for weeks, saying they didn\u2019t want it to get destroyed.\n\nMany protesters stood their ground in the face of one of the biggest police enforcement actions in Canada\u2019s history, with officers drawn from around the country.\n\n\u201cFreedom was never free,\u201d said trucker Kevin Homaund, of Montreal. \u201cSo what if they put the handcuffs on us and they put us in jail?\u201d\n\nBut a steady procession of trucks began leaving Parliament Hill in the afternoon.\n\n\u201cThere are indications we are now starting to see progress,\u201d Ontario Premier Doug Ford said.\n\nPolice would not disclose how many protesters or vehicles remained downtown. All indications were that police would be working into the weekend to clear the area.\n\nThe capital and its paralyzed streets represented the movement\u2019s last stronghold after weeks of demonstrations and blockades that shut down border crossings into the U.S. and created one of the most serious tests yet for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. They also shook Canada\u2019s reputation for civility, with some blaming America\u2019s influence.\n\nAuthorities had hesitated to move against the protests, in part because of fears of violence. The demonstrations have drawn right-wing extremists and veterans, some of them armed.\n\nWith police and the government facing accusations that they let the protests get out of hand, Trudeau on Monday invoked Canada\u2019s Emergencies Act. That gave law enforcement extraordinary authority to declare the blockades illegal, tow away trucks, arrest the drivers, suspend their licenses and freeze their bank accounts.\n\nOttawa police made their first move to end the occupation late Thursday with the arrest of two key protest leaders. They also sealed off much of the downtown area to outsiders to prevent them from coming to the aid of the protesters.\n\nThe emergency act enabled law enforcement authorities to compel tow truck companies to assist. Ottawa police said earlier that they couldn\u2019t find tow truck drivers willing to help because they either sympathized with the movement or feared retaliation.\n\nAs police worked to dismantle the siege, Pat King, one of the protest leaders, told truckers, \u201cPlease stay peaceful,\u201d while also threatening the livelihoods of the tow truck operators.\n\n\u201cYou are committing career suicide,\u201d King warned on Facebook. \u201cWe know where the trucks came from.\u201d\n\nKing himself was later arrested by officers who surrounded him in his car.\n\nOttawa police had made it clear for days that they were preparing to retake the streets. On Friday, even as the operation was underway, police issued another round of warnings via social media and loudspeaker, offering protesters one more chance to leave and avoid arrest.\n\nSome locked arms instead as officers formed a line to push them back.\n\nDan Holland, a protester from London Ontario, packed up his car as police closed in. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get beat up by this police,\u201d he said.\n\nChildren bundled up in coats and hats stood amid the crowd. Police said the protesters had put the youngsters in the middle in the confrontation.\n\nThe Freedom Convoy demonstrations initially focused on Canada\u2019s vaccine requirement for truckers entering the country but soon morphed into a broad attack on COVID-19 precautions and Trudeau\u2019s government.\n\nOttawa residents complained of being harassed and intimidated by the truckers and obtained a court injunction to stop their incessant honking.\n\nTrudeau portrayed the protesters as members of a \u201cfringe\u201d element. Canadians have largely embraced the country\u2019s COVID-19 restrictions, with the vast majority vaccinated, including an estimated 90% of the nation\u2019s truckers. Some of the vaccine and mask mandates imposed by the provinces are already falling away rapidly.\n\nThe biggest border blockade, at the Ambassador Bridge between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, disrupted the flow of auto parts between the two countries and forced the industry to curtail production. Authorities lifted the siege last weekend after arresting dozens of protesters.\n\nThe final border blockade, in Manitoba, across from North Dakota, ended peacefully on Wednesday.\n\nThe protests have been cheered on and received donations from conservatives in the U.S",

          "title": "WHO Names Six African Countries to Receive Technology for Covid Vaccine Production",
          "text": "The Director General of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has named Nigeria and five other African countries \u2013 Egypt, South Africa, Senegal, Kenya and Tunisia \u2013 as the first in Africa that would receive the technology needed for the manufacturing of mRNA (Messenger Ribonuclieic Acid) used in producing COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nGhebreyesus who announced this on Friday at the European Union \u2013 African Union summit in Brussels said the countries all applied and were selected as recipients.\n\nThe announcement was made at a ceremony hosted by the European Council, France, South Africa and WHO in the presence of President Macron, President Ramaphosa, the President of the European Council, Charles Michel and the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.\n\n\n\nThe mRNA vaccines are different from most vaccines which contain a weakened or inactive piece of the target virus which triggers the production of antibodies.\n\nInstead these game-changing type of vaccines use laboratory engineering mRNA that give cells instructions on how to create a protein that resembles a piece of a protein found in the virus of concern \u2014 COVID-19 in this case.\n\nThis triggers the body to create antibodies to deactivate the foreign protein. The antibodies then linger in the body to fight subsequent infection from COVID-19. This technology is used in the production of Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines.\n\nGhebreyesus said the COVID-19 pandemic had shown that reliance on a few companies to supply global public goods was limiting and dangerous.\n\n\n\nWith the addition of Nigeria to the four countries earlier approved for the vaccine production on the continent, efforts by the Buhari administration to change the selection that the country considered unrepresentative of the needs, capabilities and population distribution in Africa has thus yielded the desired result.\n\nPresident Buhari has since welcomed the development.\n\n\n\nIn his contribution at the Roundtable on Health Systems and Vaccine Production at the ongoing 6th Europe-Africa Summit in Brussels, Belgium yesterday, Buhari called for a closer collaboration with the EU to tackle the effects of the pandemic on the African continent.\n\n\n\nHe expressed delight at receiving the news of the selection of Nigeria among recipients of mRNA Vaccine technology transfer.\n\nBuhari said: \u201cWe shall ensure the best use is made of the opportunity. Nigeria also offers to host the Bio-manufacturing Training hub proposed by World Health Organisation (WHO). We commit to providing support to make the hub functional in the shortest possible time.\u201d\n\nWhile commending the efforts of the foreign partners in making the Covid-19 vaccine available, he urged them to do more as less than 10 per cent of the African population had gotten the jab, stressing that this situation could negatively affect Africa\u2019s developmental projections.\n\n\u201cIn the mid- to long-term, the best way to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage is to significantly increase the capacity of all regions to manufacture the health products they need, with equitable access as their primary endpoint,\u201d Buhari said.\n\n\n\nResponding to the announcement, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa said: \u201cThis is an initiative that will allow us to make our own vaccines and that, to us, is very important. It means mutual respect, mutual recognition of what we can all bring to the party, investment in our economies, infrastructure investment and, in many ways, giving back to the continent.\u201d\n\nThe global mRNA technology transfer hub was established in 2021 to support manufacturers in low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines, ensuring that they have all the necessary operating procedures and know-how to manufacture mRNA vaccines at scale and according to international standards.\n\n\n\nAlso French President, Emmanuel Macron said: \u201cImproved public health benefits, supporting African health sovereignty and economic development are the principal goals of strengthening local production in Africa. In an interconnected world, we need stronger and new partnerships between countries, development partners and other stakeholders to empower regions and countries to fend for themselves, during crises, and in peace time.\u201d\n\nOn his part, President of the European Council, Charles Michel said the world needed to create an environment where every scientist, health worker, and government can band together for a common cause by working together \u201cto build new solutions to protect what is most precious \u2013 our health and our lives.\u201d He said the initiative will ensure that all countries build the necessary capacity to produce their own vaccines and other health technologies.\n\n\n\nThe WHO mRNA technology transfer hub is part of a larger effort aimed at empowering low- and middle-income countries to produce their own vaccines, medicines and diagnostics to address health emergencies and reach universal health coverage.\n\nDeji Elumoye and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",
