          "title": "UPDATED: Consider students\u2019 plight, call off strike, Buhari begs ASUU",
          "text": "The President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) on Thursday appealed to the Academic Staff Union of Universities to consider the plight of students and call off the ongoing strike.\n\nThe President also urged students in Nigeria\u2019s public tertiary institutions to exercise patience as the government strives to address the nagging issues in the nation\u2019s university system within the ambit of the resources available.\n\nHe made the appeal at the 19th National Productivity Day and the conferment of the National Productivity Order of Merit Award to 48 eminent Nigerians and organisations in both the public and private sectors, for their high productivity, hard work, and excellence.\n\nThis was contained in a statement by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, titled, \u2018At National Productivity Day Awards, President Buhari appeals to ASUU to call off strike\u2019.\n\nBuhari recalled that he had earlier directed the Chief of Staff, Hon. Ministers of Labour and Employment, Education, Finance, Budget and National Planning to immediately bring all parties to the negotiation table to again critically look at the grey areas in the demands of ASUU and in fact all other University-based labour unions.\n\nOn the theme of this year\u2019s celebration \u2018\u2018Achieving Higher Productivity through Improved Education System,\u2019\u2019 the President pledged that the Federal Government would continue to do everything possible to uplift the standard of the educational system in the country.\n\nHe added that his administration recognised that the future of any nation is contingent on the standard of its educational system.\n\n\u2018\u2018Therefore, if we desire to transform Nigeria into a competitive, strong, vibrant, productive and sustainable economy, improving our educational system should be accorded the highest priority.\u2019\u2019\n\nHighlighting notable achievements in the education sector including the drastic reduction of the number of out of school children from 10.1million in 2019 to 6.9 million in 2020, automatic employment for graduates of education, review of the retirement age of teachers from 60 to 65 years, among others, the President said more still needs to be done.\n\n\u2018\u2018Quality educational system is good not just for the national economy; it is also good for the citizens.\n\n\u2018\u2018Ignoring the productivity dimension of education would endanger the prosperity of future generations, with widespread repercussions for poverty and social exclusion.\n\n\u2018\u2018It will be difficult to improve our economic performance and overall productivity, without improving our educational system.\n\n\u2018\u2018Government notes the emergency situation in our educational system with particular reference to the dearth of qualified and dedicated teachers to enhance the quality of teaching and learning at all levels of our educational system,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nTo address these challenges, Buhari said his administration has reviewed the retirement age of teachers from 60 to 65 years, while years of service have now been moved from 35 to 40 years to encourage more graduates to join the teaching profession.\n\nSimilarly, the President said the government has also approved a special salary scale for teachers in Basic and Secondary schools including provisions for rural posting allowance, Science teachers allowance and peculiar allowance, while prioritising timely promotion and prompt payment of salaries.\n\nFurthermore, the President said the reintroduction of bursary award to education students in universities and Colleges of Education comes with the assurance of automatic employment upon graduation as well as payment of stipends to Bachelor of Education students.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

          "title": "Jonathan and APC: Who is fooling who?",
          "text": ".\n\nI AM in love with the phrase, \u2018political silly season\u2019, which, I understand, possibly came from an article in the July 13, 1861 edition of the London weekly newspaper, The Saturday Review, and was listed in the second edition of Brewer\u2019s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. So iconic is the phrase that it has remained in use till date.\n\nIt is defined as a period of time in which the behaviour of an individual or group tends to become uncharacteristically frivolous, mirthful, or eccentric \u2013 a period marked by outlandish and illogical activity or behaviour.\n\nIt is understandable if in politics, the season is a time, especially just before the elections, when undeliverable promises and wild accusations are the order of the day. Politicians the world over make promises during political silly seasons they neither have the capacity nor intention to fulfill. They simply use those unfulfillable promises to wheedle the politically-unwary and corner undeserved votes. But Nigeria\u2019s political silly season goes way beyond all that. Granted, the activities of politicians are mostly frivolous and illogical, but it is even more so in this election cycle. What is going on is simply bizarre and beyond the pale.\n\nOr how else can one explain the self-inflicted and completely avoidable injury of former President Goodluck Jonathan who seems to be in a quandary whether to remain in his political closet or be man enough to throw his hat into the 2023 presidential ring. Jonathan, an unknown political entity before 1999, is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the current political dispensation having served as a deputy governor, governor, vice- president and ultimately president.\n\nHe only failed in his re-election gambit in 2015 when the then opposition All Progressives Congress, APC, founded on February 6, 2013, barely two years before the elections, supplanted the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, after 16 years on the presidential saddle.\n\nAnd Jonathan\u2019s unbridled greed for power was the culprit \u2013 the reason why PDP lost power. To that extent, he was the greatest enabler of the Muhammadu Buhari presidency. If Jonathan had honoured the agreement he reached with PDP chieftains in 2011 to do only one term after completing the term of his boss, President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua, who died in office and allow power to rotate back to the North, there would have been no Buhari presidency in 2015.\n\nHe reneged on that agreement and the consequence was that Northerners, most of them PDP members, who saw his action as a gross betrayal of trust rallied round the APC that fielded a Northern candidate. Even Northerners who hitherto could not stand General Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s atavistic socio-political disposition rallied round him, nonetheless; a man who had all but bid farewell to his presidential ambition in 2011 after three failed attempts.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nReports alleging Jonathan gave sitting Gov N200m to buy APC form lies \u2013 Reno Omokri\n\nSo, Jonathan resurrected Buhari\u2019s dead political career. The 2015 presidential election was lost by Jonathan and not necessarily won by Buhari and he remains the reason why PDP is in political wilderness today. Yet, rather than being remorseful and asking for forgiveness, the former president claims to be the offended party. The PDP, like the proverbial millipede in Igbo folklore, has remained stoic, even as Jonathan who stepped on and crushed its head continues to wail and complain of disrespect. For too long, Jonathan stopped taking part in PDP activities. He even boycotted the last national convention of the party, while at the same time having a hot romance with the APC.\n\nIt is no gainsaying that as the age-long Scottish \u2018if wishes were horses, beggars would ride\u2019 axiom goes, Jonathan would gladly run for the presidency again if Buhari assures him that victory would be a fait accompli, delivered to him on a platter of his legendary good luck. Of course, those who are wooing him are not known to be Father Christmas when it comes to the issue of power. In the event that it becomes inevitable that power must rotate to the South after Buhari\u2019s statutory eight years in office, they see in another Jonathan presidency the shortest route to power by 2027. Besides, in Jonathan, they see a man who could easily be manipulated, a puppet who will be in office while the puppeteers are in power pulling the strings.\n\nBy acquiescing to this unholy alliance, Jonathan is pretending not to know that he will be shortchanging the entire South. Besides, he has no qualms over the quest of the Southeasterners to produce the president knowing full well that their unqualified support for him is the only reason Buhari went for the region\u2019s jugular. Granted, politics is not a game of morality, but a man\u2019s conscience does not need to take a flight simply because he is in the arena of politics.\n\nIf Jonathan decides not to support the aspiration of the Southeast based on the principles of equity, fairness and justice, that will be true to character and no one should begrudge him his ever-abiding good fortune in the unlikely event that he once again enjoys another coronation as the president of this beleaguered country. But he should be man enough to step into the arena rather than hiding behind his finger pretending that he is not a member of the APC and disowning those who bought the party\u2019s presidential nomination form for him.\n\nTrying to distance himself from those who bought the form is childish because the APC officials who sold it to the Fulani pastoralists and Almajirai, no doubt, knew who the beneficiary was. At least, nomination forms are not sold to non-card carrying members of political parties. In any case, assuming, without conceding that indeed, Jonathan knew nothing about the forms, and is actually not in cahoots with the APC wizards and their shenanigans, why not say so categorically and unmistakably? When did \u2018I will not run\u2019 become such a complex thing to say? Jonathan may think he is fooling Nigerians, taking all for a jolly good ride, but truth be told, the joke is on him.\n\nVanguard News Nigeria",

          "text": "Ministers were caught napping yesterday shortly before the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting.\n\nThis follows President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s bombshell that ministers eyeing political offices, who have obtained nomination forms, must resign.\n\nSpeaking calmly, the President did not mince words. He showed a bit of anger.\n\nWhat followed was pin-drop silence before Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) Boss Mustapha rounded off the meeting.\n\nNo fewer than 10 ministers are affected by the directive to resign latest on Monday.\n\nThese are ministers of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi; Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio; Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige; State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva; and Science, Technology and Innovation, Ogbonnaya Onu, who have joined the presidential race on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nOthers are the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) and Minister of State, Mines and Steel Development, Uche Ogah, who are running for governor in Kebbi and Abia states respectively.\n\nThe Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen, declared her ambition to contest for a senatorial seat in Plateau State.\n\nMinister of State Niger for Niger Delta Affairs, Chief Tayo Alasoadura, is running for Senate in Ondo State.\n\nMinister of State (Education) Emeka Nwajiuba, who is also eying the presidential ticket, resigned before the directive.\n\nIt was learnt that the President took the action to forestall what a source called \u201cpossible abuse of office due to reckless ambition\u201d.\n\nPresident Buhari was said to be uncomfortable with the accusations of conflict of interest levelled against the ministers by notable and well-meaning Nigerians.\n\nIt was gathered last night that the decision by Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor Godwin Emefiele to go to court over his presidential aspiration fueled the President\u2019s anger.\n\nHe, however, singled out Nwajiuba for braving the odds to quit to avoid being accused of conflict of interest.\n\nNwajiuba reportedly incurred the wrath of other ministers vying for offices for provoking the President to ask them to resign.\n\nThey accused him of sending his resignation letter directly to the President instead of through the SGF.\n\nThey felt Nwajiuba\u2019s letter might have triggered the action of the President who felt the former Minister of State for Education was \u201cforthright and bold enough to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nAccording to a top source, the President had been angry since Tuesday when he read about Emefiele\u2019s court action.\n\nThe President was said to make his feelings known to SGF Mustapha on Tuesday.\n\nHe was also reportedly upset at the way ministers were sourcing N100million to buy the Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms of the APC.\n\nAlthough he did not tell Mustapha his next line of action, the SGF was terrified that Buhari might wield the big stick.\n\nThe source said: \u201cSome of us suspected that something was in the offing because Mustapha compared notes with some cabinet members before the commencement of the FEC meeting.\n\n\u201cThe SGF did not mince words that the President was unhappy with Emefiele and he has reservations on some presidential aspirants.\n\n\u201cWithout any tone of finality from the SGF, we went into the meeting with the President in his best element at the session.\u201d\n\nHow the President dropped the bombshell\n\nAnother cabinet source gave insights into how the President announced his decision to FEC members.\n\nThe source added: \u201cWe were about to conclude the meeting when the President spoke. The SGF was reading the notice, usually at the tail end of the meeting, when Buhari interjected. He then said: \u2018Before you conclude, I have something to say.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe President said he had received the resignation of Nwajiuba seeking to be President. \u2018I expect other members of this council seeking to be President to resign with immediate effect\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe source said: \u201cThere was a pin drop silence because most cabinet members felt the affected colleagues were untouchable.\n\n\u201cThere was also a fresh confusion among ministers. They were not clear or sure if this directive will affect other ministers aspiring to be governors, Senators and House of Representatives members.\n\n\u201cWe have been expecting more clarifications. A minister later brought news that the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu may clarify the status of ministers aspiring to be governors, Senators and House of Representatives members.\u201d\n\nAsked to capture the drama, a third source said: \u201cThe ministers were all transfixed with attention shifting to Malami, Onu and Ngige who were physically present at the meeting.\n\n\u201cWith the SGF helpless, ministers formed clusters to discuss the decision of the President. No one could be of assistance to another other than to review the situation.\u201d\n\nA minister\u2019s confession\n\nA minister said: \u201cThe conclusion of most of us was that Nwajiuba must have provoked the President to act because he took his resignation letter directly to him instead of sending it through the SGF.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that some ministers had gone to the SGF to intimate him of plans to resign but he said they should wait for the directive of the President. The latest twist was beyond what the SGF could handle.\u201d\n\nConfusion over May 16 resignation date\n\nAs of press time, there was confusion over the May 16th deadline given to ministers to resign as announced by the Minister of Information Lai Mohammed.\n\nA highly-placed source said: \u201cAt the meeting, the President did not mention May 16 but he said aspiring ministers for the presidency should resign.\n\n\u201cWe did not know how and where our colleague got the date. Other ministers seeking to be governors, Senators and House of Representatives were still busy trying to seek clarifications last night if they were affected or not.\u201d\n\nThe directive affects all, says official\n\nA senior government official, who spoke with our correspondent yesterday, said: \u201cWhen cabinet members were confused, the Minister of Information and Culture went to seek clarification from the President. This was how he came about May 16.\n\n\u201cMohammed was not on a self-seeking mission. He said what he was directed to say.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that the directive applies to all ministers and appointees who want to contest for any elective office in 2023. It is not only presidential aspirants.\u201d",

Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nClark, had in a media report, erroneously labeled Kalu a betrayal and claimed that he was not in support of South East presidency.\n\nIn a statement personally signed by Kalu, he tackled Clark and wondered why the elder statesman didn\u2019t call his kinsmen from the South South, plotting to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari to order.\n\nKalu said though he respects Clark as an elder statesman, he will not however allow his unsubstantiated claims to go unchallenged.\n\nKalu said: \u201cI have great respect for Chief Edwin Clark. He is an elder statesman and a patriotic Nigerian. I want to sincerely commend him for openly supporting the South East geopolitical zone to produce the next President of Nigeria.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that I remind him that I didn\u2019t betray my people. Rather, I am doing my best to reintegrate them into mainstream politics.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\n\u201cIn the last two years, I have been at the forefront agitating for a Nigerian President of South East extraction, when most of them were all saying \u201cSouthern Presidency\u201d.\n\n\u201cNone of these actors openly said the South East geopolitical zone should have it. I was shocked that even the zone the entire South East supported in unity, including myself in 2011 and 2015 respectively, has the highest number of contestants without thinking of their brothers.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\n\u201cThis is knowing fully well that the South East zone has remained the only zone in Southern Nigeria that has not produced the nation\u2019s president since the rotation convention dispensation that began in 1999.\n\n\u201cComing to this late hour to support the South East is rather suspicious to me if they couldn\u2019t do it two years ago. The truth is, Chief Edwin Clark knows the South East cannot get the ticket of any party in an open contest as it is today without a gentleman agreement to concede it to them.\u201d\n\nContinuing, he said: \u201cIf all the aspirants from the South West and South South cannot support their brothers from the South East, it is only politically correct to support the North East geo political zone, which to me is the shortest route for the South East geopolitical zone to produce the president after their eight years instead of waiting for another 16 years.\n\n\u201cIt is rather surprising to me that Chief Edwin Clark didn\u2019t call the majority of other Southerners including governors working against the South East to order or the names he called me.\n\n\u201cWhat did you say or do when all the aspirants from South South and South West were buying forms to run against South Easterners who have always supported them .\n\n\u201cI know some people want us to keep quiet and then allow other Southerners take turn of South East. If you meant well for the South East , you could have discouraged other aspirants against running for President. Nothing stops the South supporting only presidential aspirants from the South East . The betrayers are those who don\u2019t care about South East . We are wiser.\n\n\u201cLet me also inform the elderstatesman that majority of the Southerners in his party (PDP) are secretly supporting a Northeasterner to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\n\u201cThe welfare of my people is a passion that is driving me, I am not doing anything to advance my personal interest or seek personal glorification. I also lost my businesses fighting for the political interest of the Igbos. I cannot betray them now if I didn\u2019t do it yesterday.\u201d",

It should be affirmed and it is hereby affirmed. We must always try to enshrine justice justly and fairly.\n\n\u201cThat it is in the interest of justice and fair play that the party should take decision on zoning timeously so as to prevent complication to the process as it is happening now.\n\n\u201cIn the light of the above, the presidential election should now be left open. However, the party should work towards a consensus candidate where possible,\u201d the NEC said, even as it adopted the zoning committee report.\n\nIn his opening address, National Chairman of the PDP, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, said, the NWC was working round the clock to reposition the party.\n\nAt the same time, Chairman of the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum and Sokoto State Governor, Waziri Tambawul, said, the party was well-mobilised towards various congresses and national convention and ultimately, the 2023 general election.\n\n\u201cI assure you, Mr. Chairman, as your governors, we are always ready to continue to give you every support that is required for our party to emerge successful in the general election, starting with congresses at various levels. We\u2019re very proud of the work, you\u2019re doing and members of the National Working Committee,\u201d he said.\n\nHouse of Representatives Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu, said the array of credible, competent and experienced statesmen as PDP presidential aspirants, had unsettled the failed, corrupt and rejected All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe rattled APC is parading a congregation of pretenders and political strange bedfellows; flocking treasury looters, narrow-minded politicians and failed government officials, many of whom are not in contest but recruited as conduits to siphon billion of naira from public treasury as exorbitant nomination fees to corruptly amass election slush fund for the APC.\n\n\u201cAmong these are individuals who, as officials of the failed APC administration engaged in reckless pillaging of our commonwealth and foisted a life of misery where millions of Nigerians can no longer afford their daily meals and other necessities of life.\n\n\u201cThey include those who condone and rationalise the daily killings and acts of terrorism in our country; who sit in government that deliberately denies our youths the education and opportunities they deserve; failed politicians, rejected by Nigerians, yet, they have the impudence to seek office as president.\n\n\u201cIs it not provocative that while thousands of our university students are shut out of their classes over the lingering strike by lecturers in our public universities, the ministers whose responsibility it is to address the issues are more interested in politics?\u201d\n\nHe, therefore, called on the federal government to immediately resolve the industrial action so that the students could return to their studies.\n\nHis words: \u201cWe also restate our demand to the federal government to address the challenges in the aviation sector as well as the lingering fuel crisis, which have further crippled our nation\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, we call on President Muhammadu Buhari to take stronger steps to secure the release of those abducted by terrorists including in the Kaduna/Abuja train attack and especially, the woman who put to bed at the den of kidnappers. We must not let our citizens continue to languish in captivity.\n\n\u201cLeaders of our party, it is apparent that the APC, having lost all goodwill is deliberately deploying poverty and social dislocation as political weapons to weaken the resolve of Nigerians ahead of the coming elections.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, one thing is sure, Nigerians have seen through the antics of the APC and cannot be compromised by money or coercion. That is why they are rallying the PDP platform. I salute their courage and determination and we must not let them down.\n\n\u201cWe must remain united and focused in all our activities. We must go into this NEC meeting with undiluted patriotism, eschew all personal, group and sectional interests and come out with strong decisions that will lead our party to victory in 2023,\u201d he said.\n\nThe presidential convention is scheduled to take place in Abuja and the committee is headed by a former President of the Senate, David Mark.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "\u2022Senior lawyers split on A\u2019Court\u2019s voiding of judgment striking down Section 84(12) of Electoral Act\n\n\u2022Despite ruling, appellate court insists section unconstitutional, breaches Section 42 (1)(a) of Constitution\n\nAlex Enumah\n\n\n\nSome Nigerians have expressed concerns that the National Assembly\u2019s latest amendment to the Electoral Act, 2022, to allow statutory delegates \u2013 all those elected \u2013 to participate and vote in the conventions, congresses or meetings of political parties, saying it was designed to boost the chances of the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, who recently joined the 2023 presidential race under the All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nThis is just as the decision of the Court of Appeal yesterday which set aside the judgment of a Federal High Court, Umuahia, Abia State which voided the provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022, has continued to generate mixed reactions in the polity as well as among senior lawyers.\n\nTHISDAY gathered that the aim of the fresh amendment to the Electoral Act which received accelerated passage at both chambers of the National Assembly, was to increase the chances of Lawan in the party\u2019s presidential primaries and subsequently in the presidential elections.\n\n\u201cWhat the National Assembly is trying to do is to back Lawan with the huge number of statutory delegates of past and present legislators that the amendment would be allowed to attend such conventions and congresses. They are in the region of almost 4,000, who are expected to support Ahmad Lawan. So, that is why they are trying to amend the law again to suit their own selfish purposes and calculations. But will President Buhari sign it? That is what everyone is asking,\u201d a source who pleaded to remain anonymous stated.\n\nAnalysts easily point to what happened to the previous electoral bill where they reached an understanding with the president to amend after signing the amended Electoral Act only for the lawmakers to renege. .\n\nThose identified as \u2018statutory delegates\u2019 include the President, Vice President, Members of the National Assembly, Governors and their deputies, Members of the State Houses of Assembly, Chairmen of Councils, Councillors, National Working Committee of political parties, amongst others. Meanwhile, some senior lawyers who spoke on yesterday\u2019s appellate court ruling noted that with the judgment, political appointees are free to participate in the congresses and conventions of their political parties without having to resign their appointments 30 days to such congresses and conventions.\n\nHowever, others disagreed, claiming that with the setting aside of the judgment which had ordered the striking down of the section of the electoral act, the section subsists until set aside.\n\nJustice Evelyn Anyadike of the Federal High Court, Umuahia had in a judgment delivered on March 18, 2022, held that the said Section 84 (12) which barred political appointees from participating in the congresses and conventions of their political parties except they resign their appointments 30 days to the period was unconstitutional.\n\nThe lower court had predicated its decision on the fact that the constitution had already stipulated the criteria for the qualification and disqualification of persons seeking election into public offices, adding that the provisions of the amended electoral act runs contrary to the provisions and as such must be struck down.\n\nHowever, not pleased with the decision, the People\u2019s Democratic Party had approached the court to set aside the judgment of the lower court on the grounds that it erred in law when it entertained a suit wherein it lacked the legal authority to do so because the plaintiff was not qualified to institute the legal action.\n\nHowever, delivering judgment on the appeal yesterday, the appellate court held that the lower court lacked the jurisdiction to entertain the suit and subsequently voided the judgment of Justice Anyadike.\n\nThe judgment was in the appeal marked: CA/OW/87/2022 and had Nduka Edede and the Attorney General of the Federation as respondents.\n\nIn a unanimous decision, the three-member panel of the appellate court presided by Justice Hamma Barka held that the Federal High Court, Umuahia, had no jurisdiction to have entertained the case in the first case because the plaintiff, Edede, did not have the legal authority to initiate the suit.\n\nAccording to the panel the plaintiff failed to establish any cause of action to have warranted his approaching the court on the issue because he did not establish that he was directly affected by the provision.\n\nThe Court of Appeal subsequently struck out the suit marked: FHC/UM/CS/26/2022 which Edede had filed before the Umuahia court.\n\nIn reaching the decision that plaintiff lacked locus, the court held that he failed, \u201cto show that he is that political office holder who is affected by the vexed section.\n\n\u201d Curiously, none of the numerous office holders, to which the section of the Electoral Act is targeted has shown interest in the matter.\n\n\u201cI agree with the appellant that from the 1st respondent affidavit in support of the originating summons, no discernable personal interest to the 1st respondent has been shown to exist.\n\n\u201cTo that end, I am in full agreement that the1st respondent in the circumference, lacked the requisite locus standi to initiate the action before the lower court, and the court devoid of jurisdiction in entertaining the suit/action.\n\n\u201cThe aggregate of all I have been saying is that owing to the fact that the 1st respondent lacked the locus standi to sue, and there being no right of action in his favour, the lower court had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit and thereby laboured in vain. The resultant effect is that the action before the lower court is liable to be struck out and is accordingly struck out.\n\n\u201cConsequently, we would proceed to examine issues two and three which forms the fulcrum before the trial court generating the instant appeal and issues two and three being interwoven and related, the issues would be considered at the same time.\u201d\n\nAccording to the justices, the nullification of the judgment of the lower court ought to have ordinarily settled this instant appeal, \u201cBut, we are very conscious of the fact that the decision of this court may not be the final decision on the issue, this being a penultimate court.\u201d\n\nThe panel acknowledged that there are divergent views on what they should do in the circumstance, \u201chaving arrived at the decision that the lower court lacked the necessary jurisdiction to entertain the action, in the first leg.\u201d\n\nWhile they submitted that there was the need and duty to avail the apex court a view on the matter being agitated, the panel subsequently delved into the merit of the suit and held that the said Section 84 (12) was unconstitutional because it breaches Section 42 (1)(a) of the Constitution by denying a class of Nigerian citizens their right to participate in an election.\n\n\u201cThe provision of Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022 specifically targets political appointees and disqualified them from being voting delegates or from being voted for at convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election.\n\n\u201cThis provision does not disqualify any other class of person.\n\n\u201cThe term community is not defined by the constitution but it is a Canon of constitutional interpretation that where words used in the Constitution are clear and unambiguous they must be given their natural meaning\n\n\u201cThe term: community in Section 42(1)(a) of the Constitution as members of that group share the same job and therefore, the same political interest.\n\n\u201cSection 84(12) of the Electoral Act expressly subjects them to disabilities and restrictions from other citizens of Nigeria, other communities, political interests and political views and thereby contravenes the provision of Section 42 (1)(a) of the Constitution and thereby null and void,\u201d he said.\n\nReacting to the judgment, rights activists and constitutional lawyer, Chief Mike Ozekhome, told THISDAY that, \u201cthey are just saying that because the plaintiff did not have locus standi and if a plaintiff does not have locus standi it means that the court has no jurisdiction. But on the merit of the case, they said Section 84 (12) is unconstitutional and invalid.\u201d\n\nAlso, senior lawyer and President of the Center for Socio-Legal Studies, Professor, Yemi Akinseye-Goerge while also agreeing that Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022, was patently unconstitutional as has now been confirmed by the Court of Appeal added, \u201cUntil the Supreme Court says otherwise, political appointees are free to participate in their party\u2019s convention as voters or as candidates without resigning their appointments until 30 days to the general election.\u201d\n\nWhile agreeing that the law was discriminatory, the law professor argued that the National Assembly lacks powers to make any law that discriminated against any group of Nigerians \u201csuch as this provision which abridges the rights of appointees to participate fully in the primaries of their parties. No one should suffer any disability not recognised by the constitution.\u201d\n\nAkinseye-Goerge added that, \u201cQualifications for participation in elections are clearly stated in the Constitution. They cannot be modified through subordinate or inferior legislation like the Electoral Act. This is in line with a long list of authorities decided by the Supreme Court on the relationship between the Constitution and other laws.\u201d\n\nHe, however, acknowledged that the decision of President Muhammadu Buhari and the Federal Executive Council (FEC) that they should resign is the best for the country.\n\n\u201cThey are already distracted and can no longer give their best to the government. It is embarrassing that rather than finding solutions to the problems facing the country they are busy campaigning for votes,\u201d he added.\n\nAlso speaking in the same vein another senior lawyer, Chief Adeniyi Akintola, SAN, commended the appellate court for delving into the merit of the appeal and reaching the decision that the said Section 84 (12) was unconstitutional.\n\nHe said, \u201cTheir lordship has done the right thing as the middle court, they have to delve into the merit of the case and they have even settled it for the High Court judges because they now know that that section is null and void,\u201d adding that only the Supreme Court could set it aside.\n\nAccording to Akintola, \u201cfor now it stands\u201d, because once a judgment is delivered by a court of record that judgment must be enforced, as parties have no other choice on the issue but enforce it.\n\nThe senior lawyer while blaming the legislators for placing political consideration over the law stressed that any law that discriminates against citizens can hardly stand the test of time.\n\n\u201cA law is no law if it fails the litmus test of quality; the quality of a good law is that it must be certain, it must not be discriminatory, it must be universal because when a law is targeted at a group of people it is termed a bad law and that is exactly what has happened in respect of Section 84 (12).\n\n\u201cThat section is unconstitutional because it deprives Nigerians of their rights\u201d, he said, stressing that whether a governor has 400 appointees, it is left for Nigerians to decide whether they are good for political offices.\n\nBut Mr. Dayo Akinlaja, SAN on his part disagreed with the two submissions, observing that the position appears rather unclear yet.\n\n\u201cI just came across another story in the social media that the Court of Appeal referred the issue of the validity or otherwise of the provision to the Supreme Court for determination. On this standpoint, it is sheer wisdom for one to read the judgment of the Court of Appeal before proffering opinion on the issue.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cNonetheless, it should be safe to say that once the Court of Appeal has held that the High Court in Umuahia had no jurisdiction to entertain the matter for want of locus standi on the part of the person who instituted the suit, it follows that the decision of the High Court is non-existent.\n\n\u201cAs a sequel to that, whatever decision reached by the Court of Appeal would remain the correct position pending the intervention of the Supreme Court, given the opportunity.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, if the Court of Appeal held that it is invalid, that would represent the position of the law as of today.\n\n\u201cHowever, if the Court of Appeal merely referred the question of the validity or otherwise of the provision to the Supreme Court for determination, the situation would be that there is no judicial determination of the validity or otherwise of the provision yet.\n\n\u201cIn that case, the law would remain as it is in the Electoral Act, meaning that political appointees cannot vote or be voted for during primaries\u201d.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

Hon. Chibuike Amaechi, and Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, both of whom have joined the presidential race on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nOthers are Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, who is seeking to contest the governorship position in Kebbi State; Minister of State for Mines and Steel, Uche Ogah, who is running for governorship in Abia State, and Minister of Women Affairs, Paulline Tallen, who declared her ambition to contest for a senatorial seat in Plateau State.\n\nWith few days to the party primaries ahead of the 2023 general election, Buhari yesterday ordered ministers in his cabinet who were nursing the intention to run for elective offices to resign.\n\nHowever, it was gathered that Nwajiuba had tendered his resignation letter on April 28, after the purchase of nomination and expression of interest forms for him by a group. On their part, Onu and Akpabio, it was also gathered, submitted their letters of resignation to the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha.\n\nBriefing journalists after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided by Buhari, Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said the president directed that ministers with political ambitions had up till Monday, May 16, 2022, to resign.\n\nBut presidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, in another interview, said the president\u2019s directive to the ministers was with immediate effect.\n\nSpeaking with journalists after the cabinet meeting, the information minister said, \u201cThe mandate I have from the president is to announce that all members of the FEC contesting for elective office must resign their ministerial cabinet appointments on or before Monday, the 16th of May, 2022.\u201d\n\nAsked if the directive affected the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, who had declared interest in the presidential race, Mohammed declared, \u201cThe vice president was elected, he was not appointed.\u201d\n\nOn the fate of other political appointees, like Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele, who might also be contesting the presidential election, the minister explained that the directive was likely to be extended to non-cabinet members.\n\nHe stated, \u201cAs of this moment, the mandate I have is for members of the Federal Executive Council. Subsequently, it might affect other political appointees, but that will be made known. If there is going to be any amendment or any inclusion, you will be informed in due course.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the issue, the presidential spokesman said Buhari, at the FEC meeting, asked the ministers with political ambitions to toe the footsteps of Minister of State for Education, who had resigned before the FEC meeting.\n\nShehu, who spoke in Hausa after the cabinet meeting, said, \u201cThe president has given a directive to ministers who purchased nomination forms to contest for the presidency.\n\n\u201cHe told them to follow the example of Minister of State for Education, Nwajiuba, who purchased form and tendered his resignation. The president said anybody who bought form to contest any elective position, excluding the vice president, should immediately resign and face his ambition. That is the directive he gave.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, anyone aspiring for the presidency should not remain in position. What I want people to understand is that whether there is law or no law the president is the one who appoints and he has power to remove any appointee. He has asked them to immediately resign, so we are waiting to see what they will do.\u201d\n\nHe added that a circular would soon be issued by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation to explain the category of political appointees to be affected by the presidential directive.\n\nShehu said, \u201cI will advise that you wait for the circular that would be issued by the secretary to the government. The circular will explain in details those affected.\u201d\n\nWhile reacting to the development, Ngige said the president gave a window for those that needed clarification on his pronouncement to meet him, adding that he would meet Buhari for explanation. He added that the ministerial position he occupied was held in trust for the government and his state, adding that he would consult them before taking any decision.\n\nNgige said, \u201cI have no reaction for now because the president said if anyone wants clarifications, the person should meet him.\n\n\u201cSo I have to consult him and consult my constituents, Anambra State, because I am holding the office for the government and my constituents.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a coalition of civil society organisations (CSOs) commended Buhari\u2019s instruction to the ministers with political ambitions to resign.\n\nThe CSOs had on Tuesday asked the president to relieve the ministers with interest in vying for elective offices of their duties or face a mass action from Nigeria.\n\nA statement from the CSOs yesterday read, \u201cThe Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), Transition Monitoring Group (TMG), and the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) commend Mr. President for taking this laudable step and listening to the call of Nigerians towards a free and fair election, following the issuance of his directives that all members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) running for elective office must submit their letters of resignation on or before Monday, the 16th of May, 2022.\u201d\n\nThe statement added, \u201cWe hope that this directive takes full effect pending legislation on the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision to void Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022, which made it mandatory for political appointees to resign from office before they could vote as delegates or vie for any elective position.\n\n\u201cIt is worthy of note to mention that this action puts to bed worries of complicity in the impunity with which some political appointees have expressed their political interests ahead of the upcoming general election in total disregard for the provisions of the Electoral Act 2022 and the sensibilities of Nigerians whose collective resources have been diverted to satisfy personal political ambitions.\n\n\u201cThese illegalities have been well condemned by the public and the president\u2019s decision at this time is, indeed, a welcome one and reflects a responsiveness to the yearnings of the citizenry.\u201d\n\nThe CSOs also called on all political parties to demonstrate ethical and moral standards that ensure a democratic election and avoid the commercialisation and proliferation of money politics, which disqualified patriotic Nigerians from partaking in the elections.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "text": "President Goodluck Jonathan has formally defected to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in a bid to recontest for President in 2023.\n\nThis comes hours after disowning a nomination form purportedly procured for him by a northern group.\n\nFollowing reports that a coalition of northern socio-cultural groups, basically of Fulani extraction, purchased N100 million nomination and expression of interest forms of the APC for the former President to contest for President again in 2023, Jonathan swiftly rejected the presidential form purchased for him on Monday.\n\nSpeaking through his Media Adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, the former president said it was an insult for the group to have bought him the form without his permission.\n\nBut according to the News Agency of Nigeria, a credible source in Jonathan\u2019s camp said the former President has finally decided to vie for the top office again.\n\nJonathan lost to the incumbent, President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015 as a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nThe source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told NAN that the former president has formally joined the APC after registering at his Otuoke Ward in Bayelsa.\n\nHe is expected to submit the duly filled forms on Thursday.

          "title": "The biggest African tech moves from April",
          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "CAF is tackling Africa's $4bn cybersecurity threat",
          "text": "As African businesses grow in number and reach, the importance of cybersecurity in Africa must be reiterated. More Africans are coming online, increasing the continent\u2019s contribution to the global economy, and everyone from businesses to governments and individuals must learn to protect their data and digital sovereignty.\n\nGlobally, businesses lose about $1 trillion per annum to cybercrime. From ransomware attacks and phishing scams, to cryptojacking and malware, cybersecurity threats are on the rise as the world moves to become a \u201cglobal village\u201d.\n\nAfrican countries are often erroneously tagged as the countries where most cybercrimes originate from, but this has consistently been proven false. China, Russia, Brazil, India, and the United States have repeatedly topped the charts, and only 1 African country\u2014Nigeria\u2014has frequently made some of these lists.\n\nAlthough many African countries might not have the largest cybersecurity threats, they are still at risk of cyberattacks. Interpol\u2019s Africa Cyberthreat Assessment Report states that over 90% of businesses on the continent are operating without the necessary cyber security protocols in place. In 2021, cybercrime reduced GDPs across Africa by 10%, resulting in a $4 billion loss. The top 5 cyber threats are online scams, digital extortion, business email compromise or BECs, ransomware, and botnets, and most were distributed through emails. Over 679 million cybercrime-related emails were detected last year alone\u2014with 219 million of this emanating from South Africa.\n\nAs these threats grow, so do the development of cybersecurity organisations like Ciberobs, an Ivorian cybersecurity firm providing analysis, information, and tools for governments and businesses. Ciberobs also hosts an annual cybersecurity conference\u2014Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\u2014where decision-makers across sectors gather to highlight the cyber threats facing Africa, and how to address them.\n\nIn preparation for the second edition of CAF scheduled to hold in Abidjan on May 9 and 10, TechCabal held a conversation with founder and Managing Partner Franck Ki\u00e9 to underline the importance of events like CAF.\n\nFranck Kie, Managing Partner of Ciberobs\n\nTimi Odueso: How did Ciberobs start?\n\nFranck Ki\u00e9: Well, I had my Masters\u2019 in cybersecurity. I remember I was doing a research paper and project on cybercrime in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and I couldn\u2019t find the data I needed. So I put up keyword alerts on the internet and found an old article with all the data. That journey\u2014searching for and finding the data\u2014is what really brought about Ciberobs. On a more personal level, I\u2019ve always really been interested in bringing my contribution to make Africa safer. As a kid, I grew up seeing political unrest all around C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and I always wanted to make Africa safer, one way or the other. When I had the chance to switch careers from business to cybersecurity, I took that chance, and I haven\u2019t looked back since.\n\nTO: Since Ciberobs founding in 2019, have you found any trends across regions? Are there some countries taking cyber security more seriously?\n\nFK: I wouldn\u2019t say that some regions are doing better than others, but we could say that for countries, some of which are doing better than others. Kenya, and East Africa in general, is making a lot of advancement, partly due to the growth of the mobile money industry. There are also other countries that are more advanced because they need the economic advantage; there\u2019s danger and risk at stake, and they need to tackle it. Countries like Morocco, Mauritius, Kenya, Togo, South Africa, and even C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are definitely putting cybersecurity at the top of their lists. And C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, for example, is taking it quite seriously because we\u2019ve been on the receiving end of global financial restrictions brought on by growing cybercrime in the country. Up until a few years ago, it was forbidden to send money, through Western Union, to Canada from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nTO: Hmm. Interesting. What advancements have been made since then to help curb these restrictions?\n\nFK: Awareness is the biggest advancement we\u2019re making now. People need to know about these cybersecurity risks. At Ciberobs, a lot of our work focuses on awareness and sensitisation. We write news, articles, and host webinars on cybersecurity. We\u2019re also planning to go to schools and universities to carry out these awareness programmes. Our biggest activity, however, is the Cyber Africa Forum event which we launched last year. In that first edition, we had over 700 attendees representing 60 countries, and we held roughly 150 meetings during the whole run.\n\nFirst edition of Cyber Africa Forum (CAF)\n\nTO: Wow, was there a resolution made in the first edition?\n\nFK: No, there wasn\u2019t. Last year was really about promotion and awareness. We wanted governments to know the importance of taking more measures in order to improve cybersecurity. Last year was more like a sub-regional event. This year, we\u2019re going bigger. We\u2019re having delegations from ministries from Kinshasa, and Brazzaville; and top cybersecurity leaders from companies like Huawei, Ecobank, Deloitte, Orange Bank, Kaspersky, and PwC. What we\u2019re really looking forward to doing this year is facilitating discussions that will highlight information and solutions to cybersecurity issues for decision-makers across sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to be a part of the conversation at CAF register for free here. The programme will take place in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, on May 9 and 10, 2022.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?

          "title": "CAR becomes first African country to legalise crypto",
          "text": "The Central African Republic (CAR) has just become the first African country to adopt bitcoin as a legal tender.\n\nThe Parliament of the Central African Republic (CAR) today voted unanimously to sign a bill that will recognise Bitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrency as national legal tender, according to a statement posted to the country\u2019s presidential Facebook page. After El Salvador, CAR is just the second country in the world to legalise it.\n\nThe bill was earlier proposed by Gourna Zacko, CAR\u2019s Minister of Digital Economy, and Calixte Nganongo, CAR\u2019s former Minister of Finance and Budget. Last week, lawmakers adopted proposals to facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies and create regulatory bodies to oversee the use and adoption as well. At Parliament earlier today, the draft bill was officially adopted and will soon be signed into law.\n\n\u201cWith cryptocurrency, there is no more control of the Central Bank. You have your money, you send it to an investor for a business, you receive it in any currency, you can dispose of it in Dollar, Euro, CFA, or Naira,\u201d said Zacko, according to a report by iAfrikan.\n\nHow popular is crypto?\n\nAlthough bitcoin has gained worldwide popularity and usage in the past decade\u2014with global adoption growing by 2300% since 2019 and 103 countries allowing crypto trading\u2014governments and regulators worldwide are still debating its safety. At least 9 countries, including China and Qatar, have absolute bans on crypto, while 42 others have levied other forms of prohibition.\n\nFour African countries\u2014Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia\u2014have banned all forms of crypto trading, while 7 including Nigeria, Cameroon, and Gabon have some forms of prohibition regarding crypto trading.\n\nThese governments have cited numerous reasons for the bans from fraud and money laundering to tax evasion and terrorist financing.\n\nThese prohibitions, however, do not mean that crypto adoption amongst citizens isn\u2019t growing in these countries. In its 2021 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report, Chainanalysis reported that Africa\u2019s cryptocurrency market grew by over 1200% between 2020 and 2021. Kenya, Nigeria, Togo, South Africa, Ghana, and Tanzania are also featured in its Top 20 Global Crypto Adoption Index. In fact, Kenya is leading the continent in peer-to-peer crypto trading.\n\nChainanalysis\u2019 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report\n\nThis is what makes the CAR\u2019s adoption an interesting feat. The country hasn\u2019t topped any charts, the highest crypto transactions don\u2019t originate from it. In fact, at 11%, CAR has the fifth-lowest internet penetration rate in Africa, and this brings into question the feasibility of crypto adoption in the country. As of 2020, only 48% of its population had access to mobile connections, while less than 2.8% were connected to social media. Unlike mobile money, trading, storing and transacting with cryptocurrencies require both smartphone and internet connections, both of which the CAR is low on.\n\nCentral African Republic's adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender is interesting.\n\n\n\nIf they manage to do transactions via USSD, this might just work. Not sure how BEAC (central bank for 6 central African countries that use XAF currency tied to Euro) will react. pic.twitter.com/mUvxrgfhNA \u2014 Rebecca Enonchong (@africatechie) April 27, 2022\n\nWhile CAR remains the first and only African country to legalise cryptocurrency for now, other African countries are rushing towards another form of digital currencies, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) which are digital representations of fiat currencies and unlike crypto, can be regulated by their central banks.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this article, please share it in your WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Does Nigeria have too many fintech startups? What the numbers say",
          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are at least 150 fintech startups in Nigeria, depending on who you ask. Statista reports that there were 144 fintech startups as of 2021 and a 2020 McKinsey report puts the number of standalone fintech startups at over 200. Ongoing research by our data arm, Intelligence by Techpoint, reveals there are at least 270 active startups in Nigeria.\n\nAccording to the McKinsey report, most of these startups are focused on payments and lending. Consequently, it is not unusual to hear comments on the proliferation of fintech startups in the country, which begs the question, are there too many fintech startups in Nigeria?\n\nWhy is every Nigerian startup entrepreneur trying to create a fin-tech startup. Why do I need a 1000 different ways to pay for my plantain? \u2014 Aniekan (@ObiHabbibi) May 10, 2022\n\nA common criticism in the fintech conversation is that too many startups are solving the same problem and barely moving the needle. The value proposition for many startups revolves around banking the unbanked and providing better (read faster) financial services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, even with all this, one could argue that financial services have only marginally improved, with most fintech services unable to offer superior services to traditional financial institutions.\n\nFor example, lending apps in Nigeria offer loans in minutes without requiring collateral for users. As impressive as this is, startups still have to contend with debt recovery. While a few startups report repayment rates in the 90th percentile, there are widespread reports of lending startups resorting to desperate measures to get their loans back.\n\nCustomer service is another aspect that fintech startups do not seem to have completely figured out. In a test conducted by the Techpoint Africa team, we discovered that traditional financial institutions did not fare badly in customer service compared to fintech startups. In fact, in some metrics, they fared better than fintech startups.\n\nThe mission to bank the unbanked, which is frequently bandied about, is also moving slowly, and only 54.6 million Nigerians have a BVN, a vital requirement for opening a bank account in Nigeria.\n\nAdmittedly, people can only register for their BVN at banks. Therefore, there is only so much fintech startups can do in this regard. Still, one must wonder if most startups have not opted to build replicas of existing solutions rather than going after new frontiers.\n\nToo many fintech startups?\n\nLooking at the numbers alone will suggest that there are too many fintech startups, so let\u2019s look at how Nigeria compares to other countries.\n\nWith 1.4 billion people, India is only second to China in population. It is also home to 6,636 fintech startups. The largest country in South America, Brazil, has 1,446 fintech startups for its 215 million inhabitants.\n\nIn the United States and the United Kingdom, we have two world\u2019s largest economies. While the United States has 8,775 fintech startups for its 334.6 million people, the United Kingdom has 1,600 fintech startups serving 68.5 million people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBelow is the ratio of fintech startups to the population of each country:\n\nIndia \u2013 1 fintech for 210,970 people\n\nBrazil \u2013 1 fintech for 148,686 people\n\nUnited States \u2013 1 fintech for 38,131 people\n\nUnited Kingdom \u2013 1 fintech for 27,200 people\n\nNigeria \u20131 fintech for 740,740 people\n\nOn this evidence, there aren\u2019t too many startups in Nigeria. Looking at the numbers, one could say that we need at least 1,000 more fintech startups in the country.\n\nWhile the focus is often on how well they have improved financial services in the country \u2014 a fair metric for assessment \u2014 perhaps we should look at other metrics like how many jobs they have created and the industries or services they power.\n\nTo bring financial services closer to the last mile, fintech startups have used an agency banking model that indirectly provides jobs for these agents. OPay, TeamApt, Paga, and CrowdForce are some of the startups with the most agents; between them, they have at least 434,000 agents.\n\nWhen you add the 770,000 and 120,000 agents from MoMo and First Mobile, respectively, it is clear that fintech startups are creating value.\n\nFintech startups also power other industries. A familiar example is PiggyVest, launched in 2016 to help users digitise their savings. A crucial part of their success was launching after Paystack did. If they had launched earlier, users would have had limited options to deposit money, which may have shut the business down.\n\neCommerce startups also benefit from fintech startups with a wide range of payment options provided for merchants, which would have been impossible just a few years ago.\n\nTo the moon\n\nRegardless of the progress made by fintech startups, one thing is sure; much more can be done. While the population of Nigerians with a bank account has steadily grown, a 2021 EFInA report reveals that only 45% of Nigerians are banked.\n\nSimilarly, it states that less than 30% of adult Nigerians have or use financial services from non-banking institutions. With most active fintech startups focused on payments and lending, there is still room for innovation in insurance, where 97% of Nigerians do not have health insurance, investments/wealth management, and cross border payments.\n\nWith a growing population, more players are needed to do the hard work of providing financial services to rural dwellers or improving the services currently available to urban dwellers. Either way, as a wise man once said, \u201cit is day one.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

Using data from Statista, Adetola Onayemi, Norebase\u2019s Co-founder, claims Nigeria has 144 fintech startups. Meanwhile, Yinka, Intelligence by Techpoint\u2019s team lead, says it\u2019s closer to and most likely over 250. This is, of course, based on the information the team has gathered so far.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?

More importantly, did you find a genuine connection online? \ud83d\ude09\n\nIs it even possible for you to find a true connection online?\n\nIf you\u2019ve used Tinder, you should understand how Bantaba \u2014 an African startup that provides a service similar to the matchmaking platform \u2014 works.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to know that Bantaba is not another match-making platform. Instead, it connects African tech startups with African diaspora investors, mentors, and consultants. Isn\u2019t it completely different?\n\nWhen I saw the word \u201cBantaba\u201d for the first time yesterday, my first thought was, \u201cWhat is Bantaba again?\u201d \ud83d\ude02\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNonetheless, Ogheneruemu details the startup\u2019s journey and provides a brief history of the word \u201cBantaba\u201d. If you\u2019re Gambian, you should be familiar with it.\n\nA history class is in order, though: Bantaba is an ancient Manding word for a large tree in the village square where elders gathered to talk about issues that affected everyone in the village.\n\nTo grasp how the word\u2019s origin relates to the startup, Lamin Darboe (CEO) describes Bantaba as the digital version of the square-like convergence at the foot of the big village tree. But this time, it\u2019s to help diaspora and tech startups \u201caddress the challenges back home.\u201d\n\nAlso, Ogheneruemu discusses how the company operates and what it is, and it\u2019s not.

You should be reading this with your morning coffee (or tea, your choice).\n\nCheck it out here: Y Combinator is changing the African startup game\n\nIdentitypass\u2019 $2.8m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentitypass, a Nigerian digital compliance and security startup, has announced that it has raised $2.8 million in seed funding.\n\nMaC Venture Capital led the round, with participation from Y Combinator, Soma Capital, True Capital Fund, and Sherwani Capital.\n\nHow did the company start? Initially, Identitypass was developing a platform that required customers to make payments with biometrics \u2014 face, fingerprints, or voice \u2014 and cards. However, while developing the platform, they ran into problems with verification checks.\n\nConsequently, they transitioned into a company that makes it simple for African digital businesses to validate that their customers are who they claim to be.\n\nSince its launch in January 2021 by co-founders, Lanre Ogungbe, Niyi Adegboye, and David Obi, Identitypass claims it has verified over one million unique government-issued IDs.\n\nExamples of these are national IDs, driver\u2019s licenses, international passports, bank verification numbers (BVN), phone numbers, vehicle plate numbers, debit cards, security watchlists and tax history.\n\nFurther, the company recently launched a SaaS platform. According to Ogungbe, Identitypass\u2019s new offering \u2014 software rather than a plug-and-play solution \u2014 gives it a competitive advantage.\n\nThe company intends to collaborate with numerous regulatory agencies to create a world-class data security framework for Africa. Plus, they will work with multiple alliances to form more formidable and strategic partnerships across Africa.\n\nAlso, it plans to use the seed funding, to expand its existing infrastructure, launch new verticals focused on compliance, security, and data collection, and expand into new African countries.\n\nMARA\u2019s $23m seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMARA, a pan-African crypto exchange platform, has completed a $23 million equity and token seed raise.\n\nCrypto and web3 investors included Coinbase Ventures, Alameda Research (FTX), and Distributed Global. Also, TQ Ventures, DIGITAL, Nexo, Huobi Ventures, Day One Ventures, Infinite Capital, and DAO Jones, with about 100 other crypto investors, participated in the round.\n\nFounded by Chi Nnadi (CEO) in 2021, the company plans to \u201cincrease the number of Africans who can participate in the crypto economy.\u201d\n\nIt claims to be developing a suite of products to address various crypto-finance needs for the African market.

          "text": "Despite huge taxpayers\u2019 money spent yearly on 285 schools of nursing and midwifery across Nigeria, the country has failed to keep the nurses it needs amid growing competition in the international nursing labour market.\n\nToday, the International Nurses Day is being observed to mark the contributions that nurses make to society, with the theme \u2018Nurses: A Voice to Lead \u2013 Invest in nursing and respect rights to secure global health\u2019.\n\nThousands of nurses and midwives who should cater to patients\u2019 needs at proportionate ratio, elevate access to quality care and reduce mortality have continued to leave the country, in their quest for higher pay, improved working environment, visa packages and accommodation.\n\nWith a high attrition rate and a lean nursing workforce, Nigerians have to grapple with the reality of one nurse managing 25 to 30 patients on a shift in public health facilities, Blessing Israel, national vice-president of National Association of Nigeria Nurses and Midwives, told BusinessDay.\n\nPrivate hospitals do not have it better as they have equally seen unprecedented migration of their skilled hands in recent years, leaving the country with 15 nurses and midwives per 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organization Global Health Workforce statistics database.\n\nBased on recent increases in capacity to train, Nigerian schools of nursing and university departments of nursing sciences should produce over 22,000 skilled people to the market, who can help meet WHO\u2019s recommendation of 83 nurses and midwives per 10,000 people.\n\nAccording to the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria, about 7,000 of these nurses migrate annually to top destinations such as Europe, North America and the Middle East, despite the council\u2019s refusal to upgrade the verification of nurses electronically for ease of migration.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stop them. Other countries value us more, and the energy we put into our job and that\u2019s why they are recruiting from Europe, US and the rest. Everybody including the old and young professionals are keying into it because the remuneration is better,\u201d Israel said.\n\n\u201cWe are urging the government to create the enabling environment for our people to thrive in our country. Government also needs to employ more hands. There are also a lot of nurses out there looking for jobs.\u201d\n\nDepending on the level, experience and qualifications, the annual salaries of nurses and midwives ranges between \u00a320,330 and \u00a393,735 in England; \u00a321,709 and \u00a3103,358 in Scotland; \u00a319,737 and \u00a393,735 in Wales; and \u00a319,337 and \u00a391,004 in Northern Ireland, data obtained from United Kingdom on pay scales in healthcare show.\n\nAbout 8,241 Nigerian nurses worked in the UK\u2019s National Health Service in 2019. From April to September 2021, more than 10,000 new international nurses were registered in the UK, including 1,300 from Nigeria.\n\nData from the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics of the United States show that the annual wages of registered nurses hover around $59,450 and $ 120,250.\n\nIn Canada, registered nurses earn between $26.28 per hour and $48.37 per hour.\n\nJennifer Oyelade, employability specialist and Europe, Middle East, Africa consultant, told BusinessDay that the migration would continue, especially with the huge gap that the COVID-19 pandemic had created in places such as the UK.\n\nAccording to her, the current staff of National Health Service are burnt out and overworked, and the authorities are actively creating incentives to woo people to come into the medical field, offering more competitive packages compared to what they are being offered in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, there will be an increase. You have people who are working double shifts, 45 to 60 hours a week, in the NHS. There are people who caught COVID and have gone off work and they need replacement. The demand for nurses is high. They are enticed to come through a tier one highly skilled migrant visa,\u201d Oyelade said.\n\nNurses make up the largest proportion of the health workforce, comprising 90 percent of the contacts between patients and health professionals, according to the International Council of Nursing. They are integral at all levels of the health system, from primary care, population health, specialised services, and policy and management.\n\nNurses make an essential contribution to all components of primary health care and are frequently the highest level provider, on the frontline, providing primary care services.\n\nNurses have been essential in expanding the delivery of more advanced services to rural and remote populations, through the informal reallocation of tasks, such as HIV treatment and medical male circumcision.\n\nOlamide Brown, founder of Flying Doctors Healthcare Investment Group, said the government can approach the migration crisis in a way that enables it to sign agreements with top destinations of recruitment and earn the country foreign exchange on each professional that is taken.\n\n\u201cThere are ways we can get more money into the healthcare system. One is to outsource medical skills. We have a huge brain drain problem. Why not change that into opportunity by making trade deals with countries that need doctors and taking a fee for it. Countries like Cuba and the Philippines have done this and it\u2019s a source of income for them,\u201d she said.",

          "text": "Despite helping the Nigeria Customs Service to generate N2.3 trillion in revenue last year, the only access road to Nigeria\u2019s major economic gateway, Apapa and Tin-Can Island Ports, has been left to be riddled with gaping potholes.\n\nThe ports in Lagos, namely Apapa, Tin-Can, and PTML, generated over N1.588 trillion last year in Customs revenue, according to official figures.\n\nPort users lamented that despite the huge revenue, the government failed to repair the potholes on Ijora-Wharf Road and others.\n\nBusinesses that depend on the ports for critical production inputs are currently counting losses to man-hours spent on evacuating goods from ports and damages to goods in transit.\n\nWhen BusinessDay visited the road, it was discovered that motorists, businesses, and residents of Apapa usually get trapped at the potholes on the road immediately after descending from Ijora-Seven-up Bridge.\n\nThe potholes have since over a year made the expressway to Western Avenue axis of the road exactly under the Iganmu Bridge impassable, forcing motorists to make use of the service lane, which has also become a danger zone, with hoodlums attacking commuters during traffic peak periods.\n\nThe road, port users say, ought to be the only exit from Apapa and Tin-Can Island Ports, following the protracted construction work on Apapa-Oshodi Expressway.\n\nAdeyemi Adeola, a trucker, told BusinessDay that the state of the road is taking a toll on haulage business at the nation\u2019s seaports, adding that it affects mostly bulk cargo and damages the goods when a truck falls at the bad spots.\n\n\u201cThis is why we see trucks carrying bulk goods like plywood upturning on the road when they forcefully enter the holes. The development has become difficult for truckers, particularly now that the Apapa-Oshodi Expressway has remained out of use due to the construction,\u201d he said on the phone.\n\nAccording to him, truckers are now going through hell to move goods from Apapa and Tin-Can such that truckers that want to access Tin-Can from Mile 2 now have to go as far as Alakija to turn because of the construction.\n\nWhile appealing to the government to come to the aid of port users and truckers by repairing the roads and making them motorable, Adeola said truckers are struggling to do business in both Apapa and Tin-Can Ports owing to bad roads.\n\nTony Anakebe, managing director of Gold-Link Investment Ltd, a Lagos-based clearing and forwarding company, said that trucks and containers had been falling at Ijora because of the bad portions of the road.\n\nCiting an example, he said that on Tuesday, a container fell at Area B, which resulted in heavy traffic gridlock in Apapa that disrupted cargo evacuation and delivery to importers\u2019 warehouses.\n\n\u201cThe situation of the road is affecting business and cargo evacuation from the port. It is sad that Nigeria\u2019s busiest seaport does not have an access road and both the state and federal governments have overlooked those bad portions of the Ijora-Wharf road despite the trillions generated by Customs annually from both ports,\u201d Anakebe said on the phone.\n\nAccording to him, to enter Apapa has become easier probably due to the use of the electronic call-up system, but to exit Apapa with one\u2019s goods has become a hard nut to crack.\n\n\u201cTo evacuate goods from the port, sometimes the truck stays up to two days at that failed portion of the Ijora road. The only way out of Apapa now is going through Ijora-Olopa to Iddo, which is usually clogged due to rail line construction and market activities,\u201d he added.\n\nRead also: Photos: Gaping potholes undo Apapa decongestion\n\nHe said the traffic gridlock resulting from the bad road at Ijora had created opportunities for street boys and miscreants to break people\u2019s vehicles to demand money or rob them of their belongings.\n\nSegun Demola, a staff of one of the terminals in Apapa Port, said that leaving Apapa at night on a daily basis had become a huge challenge for him and his colleagues.\n\nHe recalled how his colleague\u2019s car was vandalised and robbed by street robbers at that bad portion of Ijora Road last week.\n\n\u201cI am always afraid whenever I approach Ijora and there is traffic gridlock,\u201d he said.\n\nChika Amaechi, a clearing agent, said that his principal (importer) was forced to pay over N500,000 as demurrage on a container to a shipping company recently after suffering a serious delay when a cleared container fell at Ijora on the bad road.\n\nHe said the road condition had worsened due to the rain and flood that covered the potholes on that road.",

          "text": "Continuous Voters Registration to end soon- INEC \u2026as CSOs charge INEC to do more to improve on the conduct of Ekiti election\n\nShare Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nChairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu has said the on-going continous voters registration exercise nationwide will be ending soon. He made this known during the quarterly meeting with civil society organizations (CSOs) at the Commission\u2019s office in Abuja.\n\nAccording to the chairman, the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise will be ending on the 30th June 2022.\n\nHe said, \u201d both the online pre-registration as well as the physical registration at designated centres are taking place simultaneously. However, online pre-registrants would require time to schedule appointments to complete their registration physically at designated centers.\n\nFor this reason, the Commission has decided to suspend the online registration in the next three weeks to enable the online registrants to complete their registration physically at the designated centres before the exercise is suspended on 30th June 2022.\n\nThis according to him, will enable the Commission to clean up the registration data, print the Permanent Voters\u2019 Cards (PVCs)and compile the register ahead of the 2023 General Election.\n\nOn the cleaning up of the registration data,the chairman said that, the Commission addressed a Press Conference four weeks ago to present a report on the CVR exercise covering the period from June to December 2021.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, the Commission deployed the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) which is a comprehensive and robust system involving not just the fingerprint identification but also the facial biometric recognition. The report of the ABIS is included among the documents in your folders for this meeting. There will also be a presentation on the exercise by our ICT Department\u201d.\n\nHe also said that, the Commission has reviewed the functionality of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) following the complaints received after the recent Area Council elections in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) held on 12th February 2022; noting that the Commission has just finished the configuration of the BVAS for the Ekiti State Governorship election.\n\nProf. Yakubu also said that, \u201cbeyond the conduct of primaries by political parties, the Commission is required to make Regulations and Guidelines for the implementation of the provisions of the Electoral Act. These Regulations and Guidelines, together with the Constitution and the Electoral Act, constitute the electoral legal framework that govern the conduct of elections. I am glad to report that the Commission will finalise the Regulations and Guidelines next week to guide the conduct of future elections, including the forthcoming Ekiti and Osun Governorship elections as well as the 2023 General Election\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere are many progressive provisions of the Electoral Act 2022 which require clear understanding to guide implementation. One of such provisions is the electronic transmission of election results. At this meeting, we will discuss the implementation of the provisions of Sections 60, 62 and 64 of the Electoral Act 2022 regarding the management of election results. We have prepared a document for discussion which is included in your folders for this meeting\u201d.\n\n\u201cSection 54(2) of the Electoral Act makes provision for assistive materials for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs).\n\nThis is another progressive provision of the new Electoral Act. Over the years, we have worked with the disability community in designing some of the assistive materials such as the Braille Ballot Guide and the provision of magnifying glasses for visually challenged voters and posters for the deaf. We are also working together to collect disaggregated data for PWDs to assist the Commission in optimally deploying the assistive materials. To deepen our collaboration, a meeting will be convened as early as next week with the disability community to discuss the implementation of the provisions of the new Electoral Act on inclusivity\u201d, he added.\n\nWhile commending the Commission for a job Welldone, Mrs Ene Obi, Country Director ActionAid & Convener Civil Society Situation Room who spoke on behalf of the CSOs said the Commission needs to do more to encourage citizens to register and come out to vote saying that that is one of the greatest challenges facing the electoral system.\n\n\u201cEven with the PVCs, a lot of people don\u2019t come out to vote and this is not helping the system. We want the Commission through its department for voters education to create more enlightenment,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Civil society organizations also urged the commission to do all within its powers to ensure there is serious improvement on the upcoming Ekiti state election and others.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "title": "The Age of Social Media: Friend or Foe?",
          "text": "Back in the day, finding out what happened to someone in another town or street took days, months, and sometimes even years. Tough, right? but now thanks to the explosion of technology, especially social media, information even about strangers in another continent is now available at the click of a button.\n\nToday\u2019s society fortunately and unfortunately is largely dependent on social media, not just for information gathering but for socialising, exploring, learning, bullying, intimidation, exposure and more. The advent and growth of social media originally started as a need to expand the human intellect, but slowly over time, it has grown into a sort of mini-god, ruling over everyday thoughts and judgements. While social media is generally about creating wholesome personal influences to immense extents, we are here to see if it\u2019s truly a friend or foe.\n\nFashion\n\nIt harnesses the power of aesthetics beyond borders. Fashion in any country has always been a fast-rising sector, where brands get to show off tailoring skills and contoured outfits. In fact, back in the day, many thought that owning a fashion line, especially in Africa, meant your family had a lot of money and often this was true, simply because fashion was termed a hobby and not an actual job. Parents fought tooth and nail with their children, encouraging them to become doctors, lawyers, pilots, etc. As technology advanced and style became more extroverted, social media has so far led a lot of new and old consumers to accept fashion trends quicker than before; from engaging cultural knowledge to body positivity and showcasing them, it has definitely soothed a lot of people\u2019s sense of style. And in some cases, the term \u201cmodesty\u201d is no longer in vogue. The older generation see social media as a friendly foe of sorts: friendly, because it allows a wider reach; foe, because clothing these days is suddenly barely even recognised as strips of clothing. It is now all about exposure, and quite a lot of it.\n\nTourism\n\nTourism has definitely seen an increase via consumption/patronage. Social media continues to play a weighty role in many areas such as the promotion of native tourism supervision, increasing local profits, regional development, aiding in local employment, advancing local governance, revamping social policies, cultural displays, etc.\n\nThanks to beautiful edits, consistent promotions and showcases, this has steadily, yet significantly, impacted the tourism system, by constantly engaging the roles and uses of social media by countries, by engaging travellers\u2019 decision making about where to visit, when to visit and how to take effective measures in protecting themselves\n\nAs great as social media has positively impacted tourism, it has also unavoidably shown the darker underbellies of countries which tend to promote themselves the most, such as human trafficking, enslavement, racism and so many more horrible aspects that nations/countries would rather keep away from the public eye, especially if that \u201cpublic\u201d is meant to aid in its growth and development.\n\nSocial media helps in tourism promotion and in focusing on best practices for interacting with consumers. Leveraging social media to market tourism products has proven to be an excellent strategy.\n\nInfluencing Influencers\n\nInfluencers, the new IT people of social media. From gathering like minded followers to promoting brands, lifestyle and everything in between, social media influencing has definitely become a big factor in long distance or close-range money-making efforts without necessarily working a nine-to-five shift with a corporation. As much as this sounds like such a positively friendly view, it also has its downsides, such as unrealistic showcasing, intimidation, unmerited lies and scandals in order to get to the top of the internet food chain, and adverse effects on psyches such as depression, suicidal thoughts etc. The list is endless, but the major one is living a fake life in order to impress strangers. Thanks to social media, gone are the days when people were simply accepted for who they were \u2013 for instance, their skin tone, etc.; now it is unrealistically glamorised so much so that there is a danger towards young minds treading dangerous paths in order to be recognised. This really doesn\u2019t sit well, especially with the older generation.\n\nInfluencing is a game changer but due to loopholes in rules, roles and accountability, so many negative attributes are starting to overshadow the positive nature of social media influencing, especially with regards to \u201cclout chasing.\u201d\n\nI must admit that the existence of social media has been a welcomed platform for sharing, learning, adapting and purchasing new movements, by bridging the gap between nations, brands and consumers, opinions and more simply by the click of a button, with about 80 percent of daily usage by citizens of the world, be it in a backwater country or highly civilised one; social media is now borderless and in control when it comes to decision making.\n\nSometimes, it\u2019s hard to conclude whether it is a friend or foe simply because experience, usage, understanding etc., differ from person to person, yet one thing I can say is that guided usage is advised, because too much of anything can be bad. So, till there is a definite conclusion on how to feel or accept the terms of what social media should be, I would personally stick to a friendly foe: it drives you crazy but has its uses.",

Muminu Badmus said the corporation is at the point of procuring contractors to commence immediate remedial projects of sinking new water boreholes to provide potable water to the community.\n\n\u201cBaruwa is not the only community we are working on, we are sinking more boreholes even to serve other areas around the vicinity.\u201d Badmus said, adding that the bid process for water provision contracts would be closed by end of this week and evaluation process would commence by next week.\n\nHe said apart from the ongoing short term measure the Corporation is embarking on a network expansion project to fully connect those communities to its dedicated pipelines to ensure sustainable supply.\n\nThe GMD, explained that the Baruwa water issue was escalated because the available boreholes sank previously were shallow wells which could not guarantee hygienic drinking water.\n\nThe community in a letter to the Governor cited by our correspondent, decried the cost of procuring usable water in the last 24 years which range from between N1,000 to N1,500 daily by families.\n\nThe letter was signed by the Baale of Baruwa, Alh. Halid Baruwa, dated 6th of May, 2022, said families spend between N2,000 to N3,000 daily to procure drinking water, adding, \u201cWe have faced serious health hazards like, irritation of eyes, skin and mucous membranes, nausea and nervous system depression for a long time.\n\nMeanwhile, Lagos State government said the sum of N300 billion would be required yearly to meet its Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs, target on universal access to water for its growing population.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu, has however, expressed readiness of his administration to improve the water supply needs of residents towards achieving universal access to safe water by 2030.\n\nThe Governor who highlighted the challenges of achieving sustainable water supply at the second edition of the annual International Water Conference, organised by Lagos state Water Regulatory Commission, LASWARCO, noted that Lagos State Water Corporation produces 210 million gallons per day, MGD, against the daily water demand estimate of 540 MGD.\n\nThe figure showed a clear deficit of over 300 MGD, which translates to less than 40 per cent of the population having access to clean and safe water.\n\nWhile stating that the government was not oblivious of the huge gap and its consequences on the health of the populace, he stressed that his administration remained dedicated to its goal of becoming a global point of reference in the provision of sustainable safe water and sanitation for its increasing population.\n\nSanwo-Olu further stated that in furtherance of his commitment to affordable and sustainable clean water supply, his government has signed a three-year memorandum of understanding with WaterAid, an International Non-governmental Organization on capacity building for approved regulation and expansion of clean water access.\n\nHe assured that phase II of the Adiyan Water Project which now stands at 80 per cent completion stage would soon become operational.",

          "text": "Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has expressed optimism about his chances of being reelected by the Lagos electorate in the 2023 general election in the state, saying he is very confident of victory at the polls.\n\nGovernor Sanwo-Olu stated this when he submitted the Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms for his re-election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to party officials at the International Conference Centre, Abuja.\n\nThe governor who was accompanied by a large crowd, which included members of the Lagos APC apex leadership body, Governance Advisory Council (GAC), Lagos State Executive Council and party executives, traditional rulers, APC chieftains, political associates, and supporters, among others said with support from the masses, he is confident of victory during the March 11, 2023, gubernatorial elections.\n\nHe added that his administration is committed to the delivery of real dividends of democracy in all aspects of life to all Lagos residents.\n\n\u201cWe have put in place a robust economic agenda, which we call the THEMES developmental agenda and it has propelled all the various interventions that we\u2019ve had in Lagos.\n\n\u201cWe know where we are as a nation, but Lagos continues to remain safe and secure. We have the highest foreign direct investments and it\u2019s because the environment is safe and secure. It is because we have provided the platform for the Organised Private Sector to thrive. Mind you, Lagos during the pandemic period was the epicenter for COVID-19.\n\n\u201cFor about one and a half years, we slowed down but our slowing down didn\u2019t slow down economic development. It gave us the opportunity to redouble our efforts and ensure that people can feel us meaningfully in all areas. We did not give excuses about COVID. In fact, COVID propelled us to have better health facilities as we speak today. We have improved our health infrastructure and the number of health practitioners that we have in all of our health institutions.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to the delivery of real dividends of democracy in all aspects of life and those are the things that propelled us. We kept asking Lagosians, what do we do? And they said they are appreciative of the first four years but they have given us assurance and the confidence for us to push forward and see the second term.\u201d\n\nHarping on the 2023 presidential election expressed his support for rotation of the presidency to the South in line with the position of the Southern Governors Forum during its meeting in Lagos that the South should produce President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s successor on May 29, 2023.\n\n\u201cI think that it is what is fair, justiciable and just. It is really about Nigeria but there are aspirations everywhere and there are so many eminent qualified people but in the spirit of equity and fairness that we have in our country, I think it is just morally fair that it goes to the South. And the South-West is showing serious interest in that space. So, we believe that our positions from those meetings are very valid,\u201d he said.",

The strategic master plan covers an area just under 2,000 kilometre square and provides a 20 year vision for the future of Ilorin. It is a comprehensive, sustainable and implementable framework for urban development aimed at reflecting the needs of the community\u201d, he said.\n\nGovernor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq at the unveiling of the Ilorin master plan said that the presentation spoke to his administration\u2019s genuine concern for planned growth and the future of our children.\n\nRepresented by his deputy, Mr. Kayode Alabi, the governor, who said that the project is a testament to vision and commitment the government has for the state, added that designing master plans for other major cities is also a top priority, \u201cas we build a sustainable future for Kwara state\u201d.\n\n\u201cToday represents another milestone in the history of Ilorin and our state. For one, the capital city is getting a master plan for the second time since the creation of Kwara State in 1967. The first one had been designed in 1976 and it was meant to lapse at the close of the 20th century. We are glad to be offering the state its second-ever master plan.\n\n\u201cWe started this project some 15 months ago, in 2020, and it has taken the efforts of many professionals and patriots to get us this far. I am truly grateful to all of you\u201d, he said.",

Osiagor of the Federal High Court, Lagos Division.\n\nIt stated that, \u201cIt would be recalled that Justice Osiagor gave the ruling on February 7, 2022, and in compliance to the enforcement order of the court, AMCON put logistics together, and on Friday, May 6, 2022, took effective possession of the nine properties as listed by the court through its debt recovery agent \u2013 Robert Ohuoba & Co.\n\n\u201cThe properties include those situated at Plot 4 & 4B Block 66 Magodo Scheme, Lagos State; Plot 9, Block 44c, Adetoro Adelaja Street, Magodo Lagos; No. 4C Maye Ogundana Street, Magodo Lagos; No. 10 Oluyomi Oshinkoya Street, Magodo Residential Scheme, Lagos; Plot 8, Block 66, Residential Scheme, Sangisha, Lagos; No. 2A John Olugbo Street, Ikeja, Lagos; No. 2 Fadeyi Street, off Awolowo way, Ikeja, Lagos; No. 8 Surulere Alelor Street, Millenium, Gbagada; and No. 14 Jerry Iriabe Street, off Bashorun Okunsanya, off Admiralty Road, Lekki Penisula.\u201d\n\nThe statement said the court also ordered the freezing of the bank accounts and shares of the company\u2019s directors, including Mr Segun Adewale and Mrs Victoria Adewale.\n\nIt added that the court additionally granted AMCON rights to seize any other landed property in any other place that might be found within the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court belonging to Aeroland Travels Limited or either of its directors.\n\nNwauzor said all the property as listed in the court order had been taken over by AMCON with the assistance of court bailiffs and other officials of the law.\n\nThe statement said, \u201cAMCON had purchased the non-performing loan of Aeroland Travels Limited from Polaris Bank (formerly Skye Bank) in 2018.\n\n\u201cUntil the coming of the order of the court, all previous efforts by AMCON and its representatives to resolve the debt amicably with the obligor had proved abortive, which was why the corporation resorted to the court for justice.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the owner of Aeroland conglomerates, Otunba Segun Adewale, has accused AMCON of illegally sending policemen to seal his business premises over an alleged debt to Polaris Bank.\n\nIn a statement made available to our correspondent, Adewale said he was surprised to see police officers invading the premises of his air travel agency located on John Olugbo Street, Ikeja, Lagos, on Friday, ordering him and his workers out over an allegation that he was owing the bank some money.\n\nOn the contrary, Adewale claimed that Polaris Bank had refused to grant him access to his N1.77bn in the bank shortly after the 2015 Lagos West Senatorial Election.\n\nThe businessman claimed that he took the bank to court in 2018 over his seized money and that neither the officials of the bank nor its lawyers appeared in court, only for them to accuse him of owing them and got an expert order to seal his property.",

          "text": "By Eunice Orike\n\nManaging director ,Nigeria\u2019s export Processing Zones Authority NEPZA\u2019s , Adesoji Adesugba has said the planned concession of the country\u2019s two public free trade zones remains the federal government\u2019s best economic approach to accelerate Nigeria\u2019s industrialisation agenda.\n\nThis was disclosed in a statement by NEPZA\u2019s spokesman Martins Odey during a roadshow for the concession of the two zones in Lagos.\n\nThe event was organised by the National Council on Privatisation through its secretariat, Bureau of Public Enterprises BPE, with the Ministry of Industry, Trade & Investment and NEPZA.\n\nIt was aimed at further attracting investors and their sundry partners to take up the ownership of the zones.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Mr Adesugba said the planned handshake with the would-be concessionaires would positively impact on the operation of the 30-year old public facilities for global competition.\n\n\u201cThe two zones are highly viable because of many reasons, including their vital locations, easy access to raw materials, seaports, airports, outside infrastructure, labour and importantly the boisterous nature of the two commercial cities,\u201d explained Mr Adesugba. \u201cThe authority is, therefore, available to support and assist the new owners, to speedily surmount challenges that may come with taking up the management of this kind of business\u201d, he said.\n\nHe also hinted that the scheme offered a complete tax holiday from all federal, state and local government taxes, rates, customs duties and levies. He said the duty-free on import of capital goods, consumer goods, machinery, equipment and furniture were guaranteed, adding that the scheme also permitted 100 per cent foreign ownership of investments.\n\nAdding that duty on exports into the customs territory was calculated on the value of originally imported component raw materials and not on the value of finished goods.\n\n\u201cThe scheme offers permission to sell 100 per cent of manufactured, assembled or imported goods into the domestic market and it guarantees 100 per cent repatriation of capital and profit,\u201cIt was imperative for the private sector to now leverage these incentives as the scheme allows them to ride on the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement AfCFTA, framework to freely access the continent\u2019s huge market\u201d, he concluded.\n\nMinister of industry, trade and investment Adebayo Adeniyi in his keynote address, said the efforts of the National Council on Privatisation had made the process leading to the concession of the two zones seamless so far.\n\nThe minister pointed out that the decision to privatise them hinged on the government\u2019s preparedness to produce world-class free zones that the country could use to solve some of its economic challenges.\n\n\u201cGovernment\u2019s stance to allow for a transparent process that would bring up virile concessionaires, with the right capacity, expertise and finance to convert the zones to national economic assets, capable of generating employment for the teeming youth and Foreign Direct Investment FDI, is very necessary\u201d, he said.",

The Party should also work towards consensus candidate where possible,\u201d the communique read in part.\n\n\u201cNEC noted the recommendation of the Zoning Committee that in the interest of justice and fair play, the Party should take decision on Zoning timeously so as to prevent complications to the process.\u201d\n\nDate For Presidential Primary\n\nAt the meeting, the PDP NEC also adopted a date for its presidential primary and special national convention and chose former Senate President David Mark to head the organising committee.\n\n\u201cNEC ratified the conduct of the Presidential Primary (Special National Convention) to elect our Party\u2019s Presidential Candidate on Saturday, May 28 to Sunday, May 29, 2022, in Abuja,\u201d the communique said.\n\n\u201cNEC approved the setting up of the National Convention Organizing Committee and approved the appointment of His Excellency, Senator David Mark as Chairman, His Excellency Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi as Deputy Chairman and His Excellency Barr. Ibrahim Shema as Secretary.\u201d\n\nThe party\u2019s NEC gave the assurance of free, fair, credible, and transparent processes for the emergence of its candidates for all elective positions in the 2023 general elections.\n\nRead the full communique below:\n\nCommunique Issued at the End of the 96th National Executive Committee (NEC) Meeting of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Held Today, Wednesday, May 11, 2022, at the PDP National Secretariat, Wadata Plaza, Wuse Zone 5, Abuja\n\nThe National Executive Committee (NEC) of our great Party at its 96th meeting extensively deliberated on urgent national issues as well as the preparation of our Party for the 2023 general elections and resolved as follows:\n\n1. NEC commended the dedication of the National Working Committee (NWC) under the Chairmanship of Sen. Dr. Iyorchia Ayu in effectively piloting the affairs of our Party, particularly in the organization of processes preparatory to the 2023 general elections.\n\n2. NEC restated its confidence in the ability of the NWC to lead our Party to victory in the 2023 general elections.\n\n3. NEC applauded other organs of the Party; namely the Board of Trustees (BoT), the PDP Governors\u2019 Forum, the National Assembly Caucus, the Zonal and State Organs of the Party, our structure at various levels, critical stakeholders and teeming members across the country for their efforts in strengthening our Party in the mission to Rescue and Rebuild our nation from the misrule of the APC.\n\n4. NEC commended the NWC for the deft handling of issues relating to the conduct and outcome of our Party Congresses at various levels preparatory to the election of candidates for various elective positions in the 2023 general elections.\n\n5. NEC applauded the spirit of sportsmanship being exhibited by our leaders, critical stakeholders, aspirants and party members on issues relating to our Congresses.\n\nOn the State of the nation\n\n6. NEC strongly decried the worsening insecurity and continued killing of innocent Nigerians by terrorists who are emboldened by the exposed refusal of the APC-led government to confront the terrorists even when it knows their locations, listens to their phone conversations and even aware of their plans.\n\n7. NEC Condemned the failure/refusal of the APC government to rescue our citizens still languishing in their abductors\u2019 dens including victims of last month\u2019s terrorism attack on the Abuja/Kaduna train. NEC urged the Federal Government to live up to its Constitutional duty to secure life and property and ensure an unconditional release of all the abductees.\n\n8. NEC expressed dismay that our security command and control coordination structure has collapsed under President Muhammadu Buhari as Mr. President remains \u201cabsent\u201d having abdicated his duties as Commander-in-Chief and surrendering sovereignty over a substantial part of our country to terrorists.\n\n9. NEC further condemned the humongous corruption and deliberate economic manipulations in the APC Government which have crippled our productive sector and resulted in the unbearable high cost of food items and other essential goods and services with consequential excruciating economic hardship to our citizens.\n\n10. NEC rejected the continuing closure of public universities in Nigeria due to the refusal/failure of the APC government to decisively address the lingering industrial action by lecturers in public universities despite the huge resources at its disposal. It cautioned the APC to stop playing with the emotions, destiny and future of our youths and take action to address the industrial action immediately so that our children can go back to their classes.\n\n11. NEC condemned in very strong terms the mass looting of our national treasury and diversion of public funds through orchestrated purchase of APC Presidential Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms by all manner of persons at excessive N100 million to warehouse slush funds for APC to rig the 2023 general elections. We restate our demand to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to investigate all APC Presidential aspirants in this regard.\n\n12. NEC restated the call by the Party for the immediate resignation, arrest and prosecution of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele, for alleged manipulations and financial impropriety in the CBN which contributed to the collapse of our national economy.\n\n13. NEC vehemently rejected the continued stay of Mr. Emefiele as CBN Governor after being confirmed as a card-carrying member of the APC. The CBN is the custodian and keeper of all INEC sensitive materials used in all elections. Having been confirmed as a member of the APC, Mr. Emefiele, can no longer be trusted with INEC sensitive materials which are key to the guarantee of free, fair and credible elections.\n\n14. NEC assures Nigerians that the PDP is resolute in taking very firm legitimate series of action in the march to restore and protect the sanctity of our Central Bank and electoral process\n\nZoning:\n\n15. After a very extensive deliberation NEC aligned with the recommendation of the PDP National Zoning Committee that the Presidential Election should now be left open. The Party should also work towards consensus candidate where possible.\n\nNEC noted the recommendation of the Zoning Committee that in the interest of justice and fair play, the Party should take decision on Zoning timeously so as to prevent complications to the process.\n\nPresidential Primary and National Convention\n\n16. NEC ratified the conduct of the Presidential Primary (Special National Convention) to elect our Party\u2019s Presidential Candidate on Saturday May 28 to Sunday May 29, 2022 in Abuja\n\n17. NEC approved the setting up of the National Convention Organizing Committee and approved the appointment of His Excellency, Senator David Mark as Chairman, His Excellency Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi as Deputy Chairman and His Excellency Barr. Ibrahim Shema as Secretary.\n\n18. NEC assured of free, fair, credible and transparent processes for the emergence of our Party\u2019s Candidates for all elective positions in the 2023 general elections.\n\nThank you.\n\nHon. Debo Ologunagba\n\nNational Publicity Secretary\n\nCalls for zoning jettisoned\n\nPrior to the meeting, there were expectations that the party would zone its presidential ticket to the southern part of the country and there were calls by party leaders and supporters for it to do just that.\n\nTo determine what to do about the calls, on March 24, the PDP\u2019s National Working Committee inaugurated a zoning committee led by Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom.\n\nThe committee was tasked with the responsibility of ensuring fair distribution of the party\u2019s elective offices across the country. It concluded its sittings on April 5 but was silent on its recommendation.\n\nFour days later, southern governors elected on the platform of the party demanded that the presidential ticket be zoned to the region.\n\nThey kicked against the reports that the zoning committee had recommended an open contest for the top post, arguing that doing so would be deemed unjust and must be rescinded.\n\nTheir demand was not granted as NEC has decided to make it an open contest, opening the door for all those who have shown interest in running for the country\u2019s top position on the party\u2019s platform.\n\nSo, far Nigerians from the north and south have indicated an interest in the presidential ticket of the party.\n\nAmong those aspiring for the ticket are former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Governor Nyesome Wike of Rivers State, former Senate President Bukola Saraki, Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto, and Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi.",
          "summary": "The National Executive Council (NEC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has opted to throw the contest for its presidential ticket open rather than zone it to a particular region of the country.\n\u201cAfter a very extensive deliberation, NEC aligned with the recommendation of the PDP National Zoning Committee that the presidential election should now be left open.\nWe restate our demand to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to investigate all APC Presidential aspirants in this regard.\nAfter a very extensive deliberation NEC aligned with the recommendation of the PDP National Zoning Committee that the Presidential Election should now be left open.\nThey kicked against the reports that the zoning committee had recommended an open contest for the top post, arguing that doing so would be deemed unjust and must be rescinded.",

          "text": "RelatedStories No Content Available\n\nNigeria\u2019s federal government has insisted that it wasn\u2019t in breach of any part of the treaty setting up the West African Gas Pipeline Authority (WAGPA) by the selection of a Nigerian to head the organisation.\n\nWAGPA is an international institution established by the treaty on the West African Gas Pipeline (WAGP) Project signed by the Heads of States of the Republics of Benin, Ghana, Nigeria and Togo.\n\nBut it was gathered that the selection of a Nigerian, Ms. Chafari Kanya, had raised eyebrows within the regional body , with the francophone countries insisting that Nigeria cannot have both the headquarters and the director general simultaneously.\n\nTHISDAY learnt that Nigeria\u2019s argument is that no part of the international agreement imposes any obligation on members of the organisation to forfeit their right to produce the DG even if the head office is situated in their country.\n\nThe pipelines project is run by the West African Gas Pipeline Company limited (WAPCo), jointly owned by Chevron (36.7 per cent), Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) (25 per cent), Shell Overseas Holdings Limited (18 per cent), Takoradi Power Company Limited (16.3 per cent), Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Togolaise de Gaz (2 per cent) and et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 BenGaz (2 per cent).\n\nSpeaking at the meeting of the Committee of Ministers (CoM) of WAGP in Abuja, Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Mr Timipre Sylva, maintained that the Accra resolution of November 2021, to move ahead with the appointment of a Nigerian as the head of the body remains very critical.\n\nHe called for the understanding of member nations, urging them to stick to the rules setting up the body.\n\n\u201cDear colleagues, I know we have some differences in respect of the appointment of the DG but I am confident that through a common understanding, which has been the hallmark of this body, we will all agree to respect one another\u2019s existing right under the WAGP Treaty.\n\n\u201cAs parties to the treaty and the agreements, we should all be guided by the applicable provisions of these legal instruments especially section 4(2) of Article IV of the Treaty, which guides the appointment of the Director General of WAGPA.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that section 4(2) of Article IV of the WAGP Treaty does not discriminate against any State Party in the appointment of the Director General of WAGPA and by my letter earlier to you my dear colleagues, I have conveyed this express position of the Treaty.\n\n\u201cIn the circumstances therefore, I will seek the understanding and cooperation of all of us to be guided by the provisions of the Treaty in reaching a sustainable, profitable and fair decision on this matter.\n\n\u201cIt cannot be argued otherwise that in a situation like this, to be guided by the Treaty, which brought the State Parties together is the most dependable internal mechanism provided for conflict resolution,\u201d the minister pointed out.\n\nAccording to him, it would be most unfair to disregard an applicable provision of the treaty in violation of the existing right of one of the parties to the treaty, which is Nigeria.\n\n\u201cI am certain that as committed signatories to the treaty, we shall not find any difficulty in allowing section 4(2) of Article IV of the Treaty to resolve the issue of the appointment of the Director General for all of us.\n\n\u201c If section 4(2) of Article IV of the Treaty says a Nigerian is not qualified to be appointed the Director General, then such agreement must be kept and be upheld.\n\n\u201c But if section 4(2) of Article IV of the Treaty is to the effect that Nigeria is qualified, then, there need not to be further objection against what section 4(2) of Article IV of the Treaty plainly stated,\u201d he argued.\n\nSylva noted that the meeting was coming at a very critical time especially the changing socio-political landscape occasioned by the Russian-Ukrainian war that has put pressure on global gas demands across Europe.\n\nNoting that the organisation was set up to ramp up cross border natural gas transportation, he pointed out that since inception, the Takoradi-Tema Interconnection Project (TTIP) and the lifting of force majeure that was in place by Nigeria Gas Company (NGC) between June 2013 and October, 2020 had been achieved.\n\nIn addition, he listed the reforms of the Access Code to the WAGP Network Code and the ongoing amendment to the WAGP Act and the WAGP Regulations to give licencing power to WAGP Authority to oversee the activities of the Shippers as some other milestones.\n\n\u201cWe will as a nation continue to work with all stakeholders for the improvement of the project performance. I must dare say that we have not done badly in our collective quests to realise these laudable objectives,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained that since the global community had classified gas as part of renewable energy and since members cannot but join the global energy transition train, they must hurry to explore and exploit the abundant natural gas deposits within their borders.\n\nIn her comments, the new DG, Kanya, pledged to collaborate with WAPCo and other stakeholders in the WAGP Project to identify areas of gaps in the delivery of better services to ensure continuous, increased and sustainable flow of gas.\n\n\u201cTo me, this is important because adequate flow of gas to end users through the WAGP will fast-track positive growth of the power sector of the countries, accelerate industrialisation, generate employment, increase revenue for the State Parties and increase infrastructural developments for our people,\u201d she noted.\n\nShe affirmed that she was aware of the sentiments that over-regulation could bring discouragement and be counterproductive , but said that the regulations fashioned out for WAGP Project were amendable where they become counterproductive.\n\nMinister of Energy, Ghana, Dr. Matthew Prempeh, who is also chair of WAPG, in his intervention, stated that in spite of the \u201ctechnical breaches\u201d encountered in the past, the WAGP remains a regional asset and has been a significant contributor to the stability of power supply in beneficiary countries.\n\n\u201c It is therefore appropriate that there are plans to extend the pipeline further along the West African Coast up to Morocco to supply natural gas to the countries along the pipeline route, as well as those inland.\n\nHe pledged Ghana\u2019s commitment to the Takoradi to Tema Interconnection Project (TTIP), which was fully paid for by the Government of Ghana at the cost of approximately $200 million.\n\nManaging Director of WAPCo, Gregory Germani, lauded the role of the committee of ministers in keeping the WAGP a going concern as it celebrates 10 years of commercial operations.\n\nHe noted that WAGP was important for regional integration and the sub-region\u2019s energy future, saying it continues to serve its purpose as a development instrument among member countries.\n\nEmmanuel Addeh in Abuja",

          "text": "RelatedStories No Content Available\n\nNigeria\u2019s Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba; Minister of Science, Technology and Innovations, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu; and Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, on Wednesday, resigned from their respective positions following the directive by President Muhammadu Buhari that ministers in his cabinet who were desirous of running for elective offices should resign forthwith.\n\nHowever, Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, said he would have to consult with his constituents and the president before resigning his appointment.\n\nOther ministers affected by the presidential directive, who were yet to resign included Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Amaechi, and Minister of State, Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, both of whom have joined the presidential race on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).\n\nOthers are Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, who is seeking to contest the governorship position in Kebbi State; Minister of State for Mines and Steel, Uche Ogah, who is running for governorship in Abia State, and Minister of Women Affairs, Paulline Tallen, who declared her ambition to contest for a senatorial seat in Plateau State.\n\nWith few days to the party primaries ahead of the 2023 general election, Buhari on Wednesday ordered ministers in his cabinet who were nursing the intention to run for elective offices to resign.\n\nHowever, it was gathered that Nwajiuba had tendered his resignation letter on April 28, after the purchase of nomination and expression of interest forms for him by a group. On their part, Onu and Akpabio, it was also gathered, submitted their letters of resignation to the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha.\n\nBriefing journalists after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided by Buhari, Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, said the president directed that ministers with political ambitions had up till Monday, May 16, 2022, to resign.\n\nBut presidential spokesman, Mallam Garba Shehu, in another interview, said the president\u2019s directive to the ministers was with immediate effect.\n\nSpeaking with journalists after the cabinet meeting, the information minister said, \u201cThe mandate I have from the president is to announce that all members of the FEC contesting for elective office must resign their ministerial cabinet appointments on or before Monday, the 16th of May, 2022.\u201d\n\nAsked if the directive affected the vice president, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, who had declared interest in the presidential race, Mohammed declared, \u201cThe vice president was elected, he was not appointed.\u201d\n\nOn the fate of other political appointees, like Central Bank Governor, Godwin Emefiele, who might also be contesting the presidential election, the minister explained that the directive was likely to be extended to non-cabinet members.\n\nHe stated, \u201cAs of this moment, the mandate I have is for members of the Federal Executive Council. Subsequently, it might affect other political appointees, but that will be made known. If there is going to be any amendment or any inclusion, you will be informed in due course.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the issue, the presidential spokesman said Buhari, at the FEC meeting, asked the ministers with political ambitions to toe the footsteps of Minister of State for Education, who had resigned before the FEC meeting.\n\nShehu, who spoke in Hausa after the cabinet meeting, said, \u201cThe president has given a directive to ministers who purchased nomination forms to contest for the presidency.\n\n\u201cHe told them to follow the example of Minister of State for Education, Nwajiuba, who purchased form and tendered his resignation. The president said anybody who bought form to contest any elective position, excluding the vice president, should immediately resign and face his ambition. That is the directive he gave.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, anyone aspiring for the presidency should not remain in position. What I want people to understand is that whether there is law or no law the president is the one who appoints and he has power to remove any appointee. He has asked them to immediately resign, so we are waiting to see what they will do.\u201d\n\nHe added that a circular would soon be issued by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation to explain the category of political appointees to be affected by the presidential directive.\n\nShehu said, \u201cI will advise that you wait for the circular that would be issued by the secretary to the government. The circular will explain in details those affected.\u201d\n\nWhile reacting to the development, Ngige said the president gave a window for those that needed clarification on his pronouncement to meet him, adding that he would meet Buhari for explanation. He added that the ministerial position he occupied was held in trust for the government and his state, adding that he would consult them before taking any decision.\n\nNgige said, \u201cI have no reaction for now because the president said if anyone wants clarifications, the person should meet him.\n\n\u201cSo I have to consult him and consult my constituents, Anambra State, because I am holding the office for the government and my constituents.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a coalition of civil society organisations (CSOs) commended Buhari\u2019s instruction to the ministers with political ambitions to resign.\n\nThe CSOs had on Tuesday asked the president to relieve the ministers with interest in vying for elective offices of their duties or face a mass action from Nigeria.\n\nA statement from the CSOs yesterday read, \u201cThe Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), Transition Monitoring Group (TMG), and the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) commend Mr. President for taking this laudable step and listening to the call of Nigerians towards a free and fair election, following the issuance of his directives that all members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) running for elective office must submit their letters of resignation on or before Monday, the 16th of May, 2022.\u201d\n\nThe statement added, \u201cWe hope that this directive takes full effect pending legislation on the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision to void Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act 2022, which made it mandatory for political appointees to resign from office before they could vote as delegates or vie for any elective position.\n\n\u201cIt is worthy of note to mention that this action puts to bed worries of complicity in the impunity with which some political appointees have expressed their political interests ahead of the upcoming general election in total disregard for the provisions of the Electoral Act 2022 and the sensibilities of Nigerians whose collective resources have been diverted to satisfy personal political ambitions.\n\n\u201cThese illegalities have been well condemned by the public and the president\u2019s decision at this time is, indeed, a welcome one and reflects a responsiveness to the yearnings of the citizenry.\u201d\n\nThe CSOs also called on all political parties to demonstrate ethical and moral standards that ensure a democratic election and avoid the commercialisation and proliferation of money politics, which disqualified patriotic Nigerians from partaking in the elections.\n\nDeji Elumoye, Michael Olugbode and Onyebuchi Ezigbo in Abuja",
