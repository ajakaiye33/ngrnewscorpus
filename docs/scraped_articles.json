He is seeking to stop a probe into the alleged N96 billion sale of assets belonging to Rivers State.\n\nThe incumbent Governor Nyesom Wike had constituted a seven-man probe panel to probe Amaechi over the sale of assets. Wike asked the panel to look into the lawful or otherwise, sales of valuable assets of the state.\n\nThe listed valuable assets are Omoku Gas Turbine, Afam Gas Turbine, Trans Amadi Gas Turbine, Eleme Gas Turbine, Olympia Hotel, and the award of contract for the execution of monorail project.\n\nHowever, Justice Adamu Jauro who read the lead judgement on Friday, held that Amaechi\u2019s appeal lacked merit and dismissed it.\n\nThe court also ordered Amaechi to face the probe panel that was set up by the Rivers state government to investigate his 8-year tenure as governor of the state.\n\nThe court also fined the presidential aspirant N1 million.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We strongly condemn that abominable act. In Igbo land it\u2019s an abomination to kill a pregnant woman. The perpetrators of this heinous crime are certainly not IPOB and could never have been IPOB.\n\n\u201cWe have always said it that terrorists were imported into Biafra land to commit the ongoing atrocities all in an attempt to discredit our struggle, demonise IPOB and proscribe it then lobby and bribe Britain to tag us a terror group with the hope to stop our march to freedom but the doubters who already have a predetermined belief will not listen.\n\n\u201cThe husband said he ran away from his home state Adamawa because of terrorists pursuing him and his family members. How are we sure that those pursuing him from his place were not behind to this wicked murder of this pregnant woman and her children? The people pursuing him can come here and kill them to give the impression that Igbos and IPOB killed them. We can\u2019t kill pregnant women and children is an abomination in our land.\n\n\u201cThose involved in the barbarity of killing the Hausa woman and children in Agulu should wait for the repercussions of the evil they committed against the innocent woman and children. The criminals behind this barbarity should be prepared to pay for their heinous crimes.\n\n\u201cIPOB has severally called these criminals to allow Hausa citizens to do their legitimate business in our land because Hausa suffer the same fate we are facing in the hands of Fulani terrorists claiming they are herdsmen in Nigeria\n\n\u201cFulani people decided to kill the woman and her children and blame it on IPOB so that Hausa people can help them start killing Igbo people living in the North because they know they can\u2019t do it again. The Hausas leaders must not fall for this Fulani gimmick. We assure them that the Hausa community in Biafraland are safe and should continue to live their normal life amongst our people and go about their legitimate businesses.\u201d",

          "text": "Former President Goodluck Jonathan has recommended the removal of the controversial Section 84 of the new Electoral Act to allow political parties to decide modalities for candidates\u2019 elections.\n\nJonathan gave the recommendation at the public presentation of a book by former Minister of State Power, Dr Mohammed Wakil, on Thursday in Abuja.\n\nThe former president said that the National Assembly should allow political parties to have the leverage of doing certain things differently, as their needs were different.\n\n\u201cGive parties the leverage. The key thing is that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), is regulating them.\n\n\u201cThey mentor them, and the system they will adopt in selecting their candidates must be documented in their constitution and copies deposited with INEC. That is what will be used to judge that party.\n\n\u201cParties are not parastatals of government and the National Assembly cannot make laws that choke the political parties. That is my take on this controversial issue,\u201d he said.\n\nJonathan also rated as low, the ongoing primaries by political parties to elect candidates for the 2023 general elections because of provisions of the 2022 Electoral Act.\n\nHe said that the primary where only elected delegates were allowed to elect candidates, was already a failed process.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly made alterations to the Electoral Law, and now only what they call the `elected delegates\u2019 are to elect people that would vote. Then one day Nigerians will go to the polls and think they are voting a president?\n\n\u201cBut who presented presidential candidates for you? Very few people at the national level, at the state level, at the local districts, at the federal and state constituencies.\u201d\n\nJonathan cited a Federal Constituency in Bayelsa State with only two wards and just only six delegates that elected PDP candidates because every ward had three elected delegates.\n\nHe said the situation was even more worrisome when the delegates were unknown figures in the society.\n\n\u201cWe have former governors, former deputy governors, former Senators and all the rest. But then, we have only one elected delegate that you don\u2019t know where he is coming from.\n\n\u201cA delegate that will come to Abuja to select who becomes the presidential candidate. Is that the kind of democracy we will practice?\n\n\u201cBut those of us who have been involved know that it is terrible. Are we bringing those who really know who is who to elect these delegates or those delegates that can be bought over with money?\u201d\n\nJonathan advised the National Assembly to make laws that would help solve problems, not those that were irrelevant or designed to create problems.\n\n\u201cAnd laws must be made assuming those who are making the law are blind to any interest just like the judges, who rely on only the scale and the sword.\n\n\u201cLaws must not be made to target a group of individuals or an individual.\n\n\u201cAnd when you go into that system of making laws, you will make this terrible mistake that messes things up like the primaries that are going on now.\n\n\u201cI think we should rather think about institutionalised democracy and make it our culture,\u201d he said.",

          "text": "Former President Goodluck Jonathan has recommended removal of the controversial Section 84 of the new Electoral Act, to allow political parties decide modalities for candidates\u2019 elections.\n\nJonathan gave the recommendation at the public presentation of a book titled \u201cPolitical Party Governance\u201d by former Minister of State Power, Dr Mohammed Wakil, on Thursday in Abuja.\n\nThe former president said that the National Assembly should allow political parties have the leverage of doing certain things differently, as their needs were different.\n\n\u201cGive parties the leverage. The key thing is that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), is regulating them.\n\n\u201cThey mentor them, and the system they will adopt in selecting their candidates must be documented in their constitution and copies deposited with INEC. That is what will be used to judge that party.\n\n\u201cParties are not parastatals of government and the National Assembly cannot make laws that choke the political parties. That is my take on this controversial issue,\u201d he said.\n\nJonathan also rated as low, the ongoing primaries by political parties to elect candidates for the 2023 General Elections because of provisions of the 2022 Electoral Act.\n\nHe said that the primary where only elected delegates were allowed to elect candidates, was already a failed process.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly made alterations to the Electoral Law, and now only what they call the `elected delegates\u2019 are to elect people that would vote. Then one day Nigerians will go to the polls and think they are voting a president?.\n\n\u201cBut who presented presidential candidates for you? Very few people at the national level, at the state level, at the local districts, at the federal and state constituencies.\u201d\n\nRead Also: Supreme Court reserves judgment in Electoral Act case\n\nJonathan cited a Federal Constituency in Bayelsa State with only two wards and just only six delegates that elected PDP candidates because every ward had three elected delegates.\n\nJonathan said the situation was even more worrisome where the delegates were unknown figures in the society.\n\n\u201cWe have former governors, former deputy governors, former Senators and all the rest. But then, we have only one elected delegate that you don\u2019t know where he is coming from.\n\n\u201cA delegate that will come to Abuja to select who becomes the presidential candidate. Is that the kind of democracy we will practice?\n\n\u201cBut those of us who have been involved know that it is terrible. Are we bringing those who really know who is who to elect these delegates or those delegates that can be bought over with money?\u201d\n\nJonathan advised the National Assembly to make laws that would help solve problems, not those that were irrelevant or designed to create problems.\n\n\u201cAnd laws must be made assuming those who are making the law are blind to any interest just like the judges, who rely on only the scale and the sword.\n\n\u201cLaws must not be made to target a group of individuals or an individual.\n\n\u201cAnd when you go into that system of making laws, you will make this terrible mistake that messes things up like the primaries that are going on now.\n\n\u201cI think we should rather think about institutionalised democracy and make it as our culture,\u201d he said.\n\nJonathan who decried situation where those contesting openly shared money and gift, saying those actions should be criminalised.\n\n\u201cIn some countries, you cannot give a gift like what we normally do here; we give bags of rice with photographs of candidates, and other tangibles.\n\n\u201cWe distribute them freely. That is a criminal offence and we expect the National Assembly to make laws to criminalise that.\u201d\n\nHe added that President Muhammadu Buhari should not be blamed for delaying assent to that amended section of the bill.\n\nJonathan noted that there were lots of processes a bill must pass through before the president could sign.\n\nHe said the document was supposed to go through a drafting process in the National Assembly with all their committees and joint committees.\n\nThe former president added that when the draft was ready, the speaker and senate president, as well as executive aides, would take a look at it.\n\n\u201cThat is the bureaucracy so that the President does not make mistakes.\n\n\u201cSo nobody should expect the President to wake up and just sign. It must go through a process.\n\n\u201cPeople must do their work in this country, you cannot just be taking money and be sleeping. This is a wake up call to the National Assembly,\u201c Jonathan added.\n\n(NAN)",

          "text": "By Wilfred Eya\n\nBarely 48 hours to the Special Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), the race for the presidential ticket of the ruling party has been narrowed to six frontline aspirants.\n\nHowever, former President Goodluck Jonathan could turn out the joker.\n\nAre you a Man 40 yrs and above? Do not miss the Vital Information, it goes off in 2 days! CLICH HERE to READ .\n\nThe top runners are Senate President, Ahmad Lawan; Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; former Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; former ministers of Science and Technology and of Transportation, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu and Rotimi Amaechi, respectively and Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi.\n\nThe emergence of the six top runners comes as the pressure on Jonathan to vie for the top office has continued.\n\nA highly placed source told Daily Sun that beside the Jonathan trump card, the race is strictly among the six leading aspirants based on areas of strength in terms of delegates support for the primary.\n\nBreaking!!! Earn up to N2 - N3 million monthly GUARANTEED (all paid in US Dollars). No training or refereal required. Do business with top USA companies like Amazon, Tesla, Facebook, IBM, Netflix, Zoom, etc. Learn more .\n\nThe projection, he said, is based on an analysis of delegates\u2019 preferences, realignments of APC governors, President Buhari\u2019s behind-the-scene moves and emerging voting patterns in swing states.\n\nWith President Buhari declining assent to the Electoral Act 2022 Amendment Bill, only 2,340 ad-hoc delegates would be participating at the APC convention to elect the party\u2019s presidential candidate for next year\u2019s election.\n\nPremature Ejaculation & \"Small Joystick\" Resolved in 7Days... Click Here For Details .\n\nThis is because the current Electoral Act 2022 (as amended) does not provide for statutory delegates during the convention.\n\nThe ad-hoc delegates would be drawn three apiece from the nation\u2019s 774 local government areas and six area councils of the nation\u2019s capital, Abuja.\n\nStatutory or \u201csuper\u201d delegates\u201d include elected councillors, elected local government chairmen and their deputies, political party chairmen in all the 774 LGAs and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), state and federal lawmakers, governors and their deputies, president and vice president, political parties\u2019 national working committee members, state party chairmen and secretaries.\n\nHow would the aspirants fare in the six geopolitical zone?\n\nSouth West:\n\nMultiple sources confirmed that in the South West, the battle is among the vice president, Tinubu and other two aspirants, who are not strong contenders: Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi and former Ogun State governor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun.\n\nAccording to the sources, following the breakdown of the delegates list, Vice President Osinbajo barring unforeseen circumstances will dominate Ondo and Oyo, while Tinubu is strong in Lagos and Osun. Fayemi is at home with Ekiti, while Amosun will share votes with Tinubu in Ogun. The other aspirants, like Amaechi and Umahi do not stand any chance in South West.\n\nNorth West:\n\nIn the North West states of Kano, Kaduna Katsina, Kebbi, Sokoto, Jigawa and Zamfara, Lawan, Tinubu, Onu and Amaechi are strong, with Osinbajo trailing.\n\nDaily Sun learnt that Tinubu would enjoy a substantial support of delegates from Kano because of his relationship with Governor Umar Ganduje. Lawan is also a big factor in the state.\n\nAmaechi enjoys good support in Katsina, where he holds a title of \u201cTrust Son\u201d and in Kaduna, where Governor Nasir El-Rufai, speculated to be penciled down as a running mate if the former Rivers governor wins, holds sway.\n\n100% Natural Herbs to Finally End Premature Ejaculation, Weak Erection and Small Manhood. >>>Click Here for Details<<< .\n\nLawan is equally strong in Katsina given his support for Buhari and in Kaduna. Sokoto and Kebbi tilt towards Lawan, with Tinubu, Osinbajo, Amaechi hoping to get some votes, likewise Jigawa and Zamfara.\n\nSouth South:\n\nAmaechi appears to be king in the South South. He is expected to take substantial votes in Rivers, Bayelsa and Cross River states. Former Akwa Ibom governor, Godswill Akpabio, is however, the man to beat in his state, with expected share of Cross River votes. Tinubu, strongly supported by ex-APC Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, is likely to win Edo, while Lawan looks good in Delta, with the support of Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege. This equation will however change if Jonathan succumbs to pressure and joins the race.\n\nNorth East:\n\nThe Senate president, Lawan, our sources confirmed, is at home in the North East states of Yobe, Borno, Adamawa, Bauchi, Taraba and Gombe. He is expected to take Yobe fully and substantial votes in Adamawa, Taraba, Bauchi and Gombe. Oni and Tinubu are popular in Borno, with Governor Babagana Zulum\u2019s support. Former governor of Zamfara, who is also in the race, Senator Sani Yerima, is on ground in his state.\n\nNorth Central:\n\nIn North Central states of Kogi, Kwara, Benue, Niger, Nasarawa and Plateau, Governor Yahaya Bello, Lawan, Amaechi, Osinbajo, Tinubu , Oni and Umahi are in strong contention.\n\nWhile Bello is expected to take Kogi fully and do well in Niger and Nasarawa, Tinubu is good in Kwara. Osinbajo, Amaechi , Onu and Umahi are projected to do do fairly well in Plateau and Benue because of the Christain population.\n\nSouth East:\n\nOwing to sentiment for South East president, Onu and Umahi are popular in the zone. They are at home in Ebonyi and Enugu. Lawan is good in Imo, Anambra and Abia states owing to the strong support of Senate Chief Whip Orji Uzor Kalu and Imo state governor, Hope Uzodimma . Onu is popular in the South East and is rumoured as a likely dark horse that could spring surprise. In the zone, the battle is for Umahi, Onu and Lawan.\n\nThe Jonathan mix:\n\nAlthough Jonathan has not confirmed that he is running, there are indications that some powerbrokers in the North want to draft him in. A coalition of North groups had obtained forms for Jonathan, which were filled and duly submitted. The APC leadership has insisted that it will screen all those whose forms were submitted.\n\nDaily Sun learnt that those around President Buhari want Jonathan as consensus canidate, to keep to expectation of power shift to South. Talks are ongoing to persuade Jonathan, which we learrnt is delaying President Buhari\u2019s meeting with all presidential aspirants.\n\nOur source said that even though Jonathan has submitted his form, he is giving conditions to emerge as the consensus candidate.\n\nThe Buhari factor:\n\nPresident Buhari is a big factor in choosing APC candidate. Sources said he is torn between choice of Lawan, Onu, Amaechi or Emeka Nwajiuba.\n\nIt was gathered that although the President prefers a southern candidate, he is under intense pressure to back a northern aspirant in the event that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chooses a northern candidate. This , some claim is the reason Lawan is in the calculation. He is there as a counterpoise to PDP\u2019\u2019s expected northern candidate.\n\nIt is however believed that the outcome of PDP primary, which is coming first will determine what will happen in APC on Sunday.\n\nPartner with me, let's get you making N500K to N500K a month!

But we will manage and move on. We pray that good people should come. I hope what happened this year, 2022, will not happen again in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a measure to halt the trend, Jonathan urged the National Assembly to make laws to criminalise inducement of delegates and electorate. He also wants the National Assembly to remove from the Electoral Act, the sections on how political parties should select candidates for elections.\n\nJonathan said: \u201cThe National Assembly can\u2019t make laws and lock all political parties together.

          "text": "\n\n\n\nPeter Uzoho with agency report\n\nNigeria\u2019s low crude oil production means the country is barely able to cover the cost of imported petrol from its oil and gas revenue, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed said yesterday.\n\n\n\nAhmed, who said this in an interview with Reuters, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, said she hoped Nigerian oil production would average 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, up from around 1.5 million bpd in the first quarter.\n\n\n\nThe government had budgeted 1.8 million bpd of production, Ahmed said, blaming crude theft and attacks on oil infrastructure for the shortfall.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are not seeing the revenues that we had planned for,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cWhen the production is low it means we\u2019re \u2026 barely able to cover the volumes that are required for the (petrol) that we need to import.\u201d\n\n\n\nNigeria exports crude oil and imports refined petrol, suffering intermittent fuel shortages. It faces double-digit inflation and low growth, amid a shrinking labour market and mounting insecurity.\n\n\n\nA plan to abolish its petrol subsidy was scrapped ahead of national elections in February 2023 and recently, President Muhammadu Buhari got the National Assembly to approve N4 trillion for subsidies in 2022, up from the N400 billion initially projected for the purpose, putting pressure on the budget.\n\n\n\nNigeria raised $1.25 billion via a Eurobond sale in March at a premium rate and had planned to issue another bond.\n\nBut Ahmed said the government had \u201cnot seen a good opportunity to go in.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe country\u2019s deficit is set to rise to 4.5 per cent of its Gross Domestic Product this year due to the fuel subsidy, up from an original estimate of 3.42 per cent in the budget.\n\n\n\nAfter holding the Monetary Policy Rate constant at 11.5 per cent for about two and a half years, the MPC on Tuesday, raised the benchmark interest rate by 150 basis points to 13 per cent in response to global inflationary pressures, which had continued to hurt economies around the world. Inflation in Nigeria rose to 16.82 per cent in April, the highest in eight months.\n\n\n\nCommenting on the interest rate hike, Ahmed said the central bank move was necessary.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate hikes, including a 50 basis-point rise earlier this month, alongside Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and coronavirus lockdowns in China have prompted a move from riskier emerging markets to safe havens.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are certainly very, very concerned,\u201d Ahmed said of the Fed\u2019s policy tightening. \u201cThe actions that the Fed or the central bank in Europe take will affect us.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

          "title": "Buhari Talks Free Polls, Jonathan Attacks National Assembly, Faults Section 84 of New Electoral Act",
          "text": "\n\n*Declares lawmakers legislating to target particular persons, groups\n\n*Insists quality of delegates disgraceful, monetisation of process unacceptable\n\nDeji Elumoye, Kingsley Nwezeh and Adedayo Akinwale in Abuja\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, reiterated his government\u2019s commitment to free, fair, and credible general election in 2023. Buhari also expressed his commitment to ensuring that only honest and reliable candidates won in the polls.\n\n\n\nThe assurances came just as in a rare public outburst yesterday, former President Goodluck Jonathan took a swipe at the National Assembly over the controversy surrounding section 84 of the Electoral Act, describing it as a mess.\n\nThis was just as divergent views emanated from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) barely 72 hours to its national convention, with members expressing fears over lack of activities in the party and indication of unpreparedness for the party\u2019s presidential primary.\n\n\n\nAlso, yesterday, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police Command said it had put in place a robust security arrangement ahead of the presidential primary of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) scheduled to hold May 28 and 29 at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja.\n\n\n\nBuhari spoke while playing host to an APC Kano Central senatorial aspirant, Senator Basheer Lado, at the State House, Abuja. Lado\u2019s meeting with the president came a day before the senatorial primary of the party holding today.\n\n\n\nSpeaking with newsmen after the meeting, Lado said the President declared his commitment to credible elections that would ensure the emergence of candidates with integrity.\n\n\n\nHe stated, \u201cAfter my briefing, Mr. President reiterated his commitment to credible and peaceful elections and also his desire to see candidates with integrity prevail at the polls all across Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs you are aware, Kano State is the largest producer of votes in Nigeria. It is the decider of who becomes the next president in the presidential election.\n\n\n\n\u201cJust like my governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, has done in the past, I respectfully informed and reassured Mr President that the APC is still the party to beat in Kano, despite recent defections.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, according to the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 elections released by APC, the screening of the presidential aspirants was supposed to take place last Monday. But as at yesterday, the screening committee that would assess the presidential aspirants was yet to be constituted. Accreditation of those that would be attending the convention was also yet to commence, while Eagle Square, venue of the convention, remained empty and deserted.\n\n\n\nDirector of Media, Yahaya Bello Campaign Organisation, Ms. Yemi Kolapo, said she was not worried about the lack of activities in the party a few days to the primary election. Kolapo believed the party was only being strategic.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so; they (APC) are only being strategic,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nAsked if the failure of the party to constitute a screening committee was part of the strategy, Kolapo added, \u201cIt has been constituted since. They can\u2019t constitute for others and not constitute for presidential.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Osinbajo Support Group also said there was no need to worry, stressing that activities would commence at Eagle Square on Saturday. Convener of the group, Badmus Olawale, said, \u201cScreening can still happen 24 hours to the primary day. No worries whatsoever. You will see activities at the Eagle Square ground from Saturday.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut the Bola Ahmed Tinubu Support Group (AATSG) wondered the kind of example APC was setting as a ruling party. National Publicity Secretary of the group, Hon. Sampson Oburu, said the ruling party ought to be doing everything right at all times.\n\n\n\nOburu said, \u201cLess than 72 hours to the primaries, no screening of aspirants, and possible debates between aspirants is zero. I wonder what kind of example we, as the ruling party, is setting after we promised Nigerians change.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe moved to the next level, one would have thought that we would move from doing things anyhow to doing the right things, the first time all the time, which to a large extent would muster unity within the party, raise the status of the party, and usher in a new era of hope.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is extremely important to sustain and in our own case now, restore confidence in the party by the electorate and public, because as it is, Nigerians are fast losing confidence in our ability to lead the country to the much needed next level.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere are rancour and strife in almost all the states controlled by our party, multiple factions, poor internal democratic processes, where the electoral processes are hijacked by one or a few individuals against the collective strength of the majority.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn its part, the APC Rebirth Group expressed concerns about the lack of activities in the party. Its Convener, Mr. Aliyu Audu, stated, \u201cWhile we are concerned about the lack of activities to show that plans are in place for the special convention, we want to believe that everyone involved is aware of the implications of not having a duly elected presidential candidate by the 3rd of June 2022. So, there are probably plans in place that are unknown to us.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, all appears set for the PDP presidential primary, with the Nigeria Police promising a strong security arrangement.\n\nThe event would involve a high influx of people into the nation\u2019s capital, and the FCT police say they have taken charge.\n\n\n\nThe FCT command said in a statement, \u201cConsequent upon the above and in a bid to ensure a hitch-free event, the FCT Police Command has designed a robust security arrangement defined by a generous deployment within and without the election ground and to every nook and cranny of the territory.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe deployment prioritises the protection of lives and properties of all and sundry by emplacing counter-insurgency measures, maintenance of clear road access, robust stop and search at strategic points around the suburbs and city centre, effective crowd control, and intelligence gathering.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe command asserted that the Commissioner of Police, FCT Police Command, CP Babaji Sunday, while briefing the divisional police officers, heads of the various tactical and intelligence units of the command scheduled for the operation, charged them to be effective in discharging their duties with utmost respect for fundamental human rights.\n\n\n\nSunday told FCT residents to go about their lawful duties without fear of harassment or molestation of any kind, urging them, also, to remain vigilant and report any suspicious or abnormal occurrence to the police.\n\nEx-President Jonathan Attacks National Assembly Over Section 84 of New Electoral Act\n\nMeanwhile, a usually measured and reticent Jonathan yesterday accused the federal lawmakers of making laws to target individuals and groups, rather than observing the long-held maxim that like judges, legislators must be \u201cblind\u201d in the process of law-making, instead of dishing out self-serving legislations.\n\n\n\nThe former president was speaking in Abuja at the presentation of a book titled: \u201cPolitical Party Governance,\u201d authored by a former Minister of State for Power, Dr. Mohammed Wakil.\n\n\n\nSome Nigerians recently expressed concerns that the National Assembly\u2019s amendment of some portions of the Electoral Act, 2022, especially Section 84 was designed to boost the chances of certain persons in the electoral race.\n\n\n\nJonathan, who rated the current primaries as a total failure insisted that if it was to be rated, the process would not have a pass mark and would be scored less than 25 per cent.\n\n\n\nPicking Bayelsa as a case study, the former Nigerian leader characterised the process as \u201chorrible,\u201d stating that for instance, certain people who did some \u201cmagic\u201d created just two wards in a particular state constituency where six elected delegates were to determine the fate of six aspirants in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n\n\n\u201cLet me use this opportunity to advise the National Assembly that laws must be designed to solve problems, not to create problems and that laws must be made assuming that those who are making the law are blind, just like the judges.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat is so that they cannot be able to target an individual or a group of individuals and when you go into the system of making laws (like it is being done), you will make this terrible mistake that has really messed up the whole primaries that are going on.\n\n\n\n\u201c If you have not been involved in the process of primaries, you will be happy or you may not be happy, but for those of us who have been involved, it is terrible,\u201d he maintained.\n\n\n\nJonathan stressed that those who are current delegates could easily be bought over, decrying how low the standards have fallen such that aspirants are now openly retrieving monies paid to the delegates.\n\n\u201cTake my local government for example. My local government by divine providence has me as a former president, we have former governors, former deputy governors, former senators and all the rest.\n\n\n\n\u201cThen only one elected delegate that you don\u2019t even know where it is coming from, will come to Abuja to select who becomes the presidential candidate. Is that the kind of democracy that we want to practice?\u201d he queried.\n\nThe former president alleged that the lawmakers had succeeded in strangulating the electoral system by going as far as determining the mode of primaries, arguing that every political party has its peculiarities.\n\n\n\nWhile contending that laws must not be made at the whims of individuals, Jonathan picked holes on the argument of those accusing Buhari of not immediately signing the amended sections sent to him by the lawmakers, saying that assent to bills must go through a thorough process.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis controversial Section 84, to me, if you read through that law, 80 per cent or more of that section has nothing to do with it and should be expunged from the Electoral Act because the National Assembly cannot make laws and lump up all the political parties together.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey must have the leverage to do things differently. Political parties have different reasons for being set up,\u201d he said, giving the instances of parties in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\u201cTwo parties cannot do things the same way. Creating a situation whereby every party must have the same way of doing things as to who will represent them is nonsense. It doesn\u2019t help the practice of democracy. We must allow the parties the leverage,\u201d he explained.\n\n\n\nHe pointed out that since the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was already regulating the parties, they must be allowed to choose the method they would adopt in selecting candidates, as documented in their constitutions.\n\n\n\n\u201cParties are not parastatals of the government. And the national assembly cannot make laws to strangle the political parties and that is my thinking on this issue that is quite controversial,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nHe further called for the institutionalisation of democracy, instead of the current ad hoc practice by the lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWe have to institutionalise democracy. What is the quality of delegates where some people are even going back to delegates to ask for refund when they fail election? This is extremely disgraceful,\u201d he declared.\n\n\n\nHe added: \u201cIn some countries, you cannot give a gift to the voter like what we normally do here where bags of rice and salt are shared. You are inducing the electorate and that\u2019s a criminal offence and the National Assembly should be able to criminalise this.\n\n\n\nAs it is now, Jonathan argued that any criminal can now aspire to the highest office of the land as far as the person has the money even if he\u2019s an armed robber.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf I tell you the kind of people that are coming up to pick the people that will represent us, you will feel sad. So the National Assembly must have to wake up.\n\n\n\n\u201cSome people are even blaming the president that he did not sign this, he did not sign that and that is another area that the national assembly must wake up to. You cannot wake up the president and say come and sign a bill, whether a new bill or an alteration of an existing one.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn this matter, the president can\u2019t be blamed. Before the president signs any bill into law, it passes through different processes after the national assembly and their committees finish their work,\u201d he noted.\n\n\n\nAccording to him each member of the National Assembly has at least five aides who are expected to be involved in vetting any bill passed to the president, accusing the lawmakers of not doing their jobs properly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Speaker has more and the Senate President has more. What is their duty? Is it just to be following the speaker and the senate president like a troop of monkeys or a bevy of birds?\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are meant to read before it goes to the clerk of the national assembly that also has his own aides that will also read through that draft before it goes to the president and that\u2019s bureaucracy at the government level so that the president is not meant to make silly mistakes.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo nobody should expect the president to just wake up and say come sign this bill because it must go through a process and people must do their work in this country.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou cannot just be taking money and be sleeping and for the national assembly this is a good wake-up call because they have various aides who are employed to do this work.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd their laws must not target individuals or group of individuals. They must be laws that will improve governance and not be made for certain people to have an advantage over others.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn fact, the whole of this primary that is going on is a mess. If you know the standard practice, you will ask teachers here to score this primaries and it cannot get more than 25 per cent and you cannot use that process to elect the president.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe process is already failed and it is not good for this country. Yes , we will manage and move on and I pray that good people should emerge, but we hope that what has happened this 2022 will not happen again in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nReddit\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nPinterest\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSkype\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\nPocket\n\nTelegram\n\n",

He became the president in May 2010 following the death of President Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and completed the latter\u2019s tenure.\n\nHe won the 2011 presidential election but lost his attempt to secure a second term in office in 2015.\n\nUsing proxies, Jonathan approached the court praying he \u201cis pre-eminently constitutionally, morally and legally qualified to contest the 2023 presidential election.\u201d\n\nThe case with suit no FHC/YNG/CS/86/2022 has Andy Solomon and Idibiye Abraham as plaintiffs while All Progressives Congress, Jonathan and the Independent National Electoral Commission were listed as defendants.\n\nApparently in a haste to ensure that the judgement was delivered before the APC primary which is slated for Sunday, the plaintiffs requested an accelerated hearing via a motion ex parte.\n\nSaharaReporters gathered that the judgment was part of the plans of the Aso Rock cabal supporting Jonathan to take over from President Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nThe newspaper on Thursday reported that Jonathan had submitted the N100 million forms a few days earlier to the National Chairman of the ruling party, Abdullahi Adamu.\n\n\u201cHis form has secretly been submitted. He submitted his nomination form through the APC Chairman a few days ago,\u201d a source in the ruling party privy to information had said.\n\n\u201cMembers of President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s cabal are still pushing for Jonathan to become the party\u2019s consensus candidate.\u201d\n\nBackground\n\nJonathan had recently rejected the presidential form of the ruling APC purchased for him, purportedly by a group of supporters from the northern region.\n\nSpeaking through his Media Adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, the former president said it was an insult for the group to have bought him the forms without his permission.\n\nHowever, sources had told SaharaReporters that claims by the former President that he did not authorise the purchase of the multi-million-naira forms are far from the truth.\n\n\u201cContrary to his denials, former President Goodluck Jonathan gave over N200 million to the governor of Jigawa, Mohammed Badaru, to purchase the APC nomination and expression of interest forms for him,\u201d a source privy to the arrangement had told SaharaReporters.\n\nInterestingly, the Jigawa governor, Badaru had also joined other interested presidential aspirants to vie for the ticket of the APC by buying the N100 million nomination and expression of interest forms.\n\n\u201cI will join the Presidential race since everyone knows I\u2019m a highly qualified person to do the job,\u201d Badaru was quoted as saying during an APC stakeholders\u2019 meeting held at Government House in Dutse recently.\n\nThe governor was also said to have told the gathering during the meeting that he was pressurised by his colleagues to contest for the presidential seat.\n\nHis media aide, Auwalu Sankara, had said his principal had sought President Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s blessings before buying the forms.\n\nBut SaharaReporters learnt that the Jigawa governor had bought the forms and come up with the statements as a ruse to deceive Nigerians; as he was indeed working for Jonathan.\n\nIt was further learnt that Jonathan had backed out of the plan and swiftly come up with the denial after the APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, had refused to guarantee that the former President would be the consensus candidate of the ruling party.\n\nJonathan was Nigeria\u2019s leader as a member of the PDP, which is now an opposition party.\n\n\u201cThe reason why he (Jonathan) gave him that much money \u2013 over N200 million \u2013 was that he asked the governor to buy himself a form too in order to cover up the deal,\u201d a source had said.\n\n\u201cAnd upon purchasing the form, Jonathan alerted Buhari. Buhari told him to meet with the APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, but Adamu said he can\u2019t guarantee him as a consensus candidate.\n\n\u201cAt that point, GEJ (Goodluck Ebele Jonathan) started denying that he purchased the form,\u201d another source had said.\n\nSaharaReporters broke the story of how a cabal in the ruling APC had pushed for Jonathan to succeed Buhari, after being impressed by how the former President never openly criticised Buhari government despite its ineptitude and the insults the APC, as an opposition party, hurled at him (Jonathan) ahead of the 2015 presidential election.\n\nThe fact that Jonathan cannot spend more than one term in office, if they can manage to get him there, is also not lost on the cabal. However, SaharaReporters has also reported how Jonathan was later called a betrayer by the cabal after he failed to fulfil some of the conditions given to him, including convincing some PDP governors to defect to the APC.\n\nFollowing speculations that Jonathan was preparing to defect to the ruling APC and seek the presidential ticket of the party, some Nigerians, including human rights lawyer Femi Falana (SAN), argued that his candidature will breach the constitution. Other Nigerians have also expressed different opinions on the issue.\n\nFalana had based his position on Section 137 (3) of the Constitution, which provides as follows: \u201cA person who was sworn in to complete the term for which another person was elected as president shall not be elected to such office for more than a single term.\u201d\n\nFalana had said, \u201cSome people have said that the amendment is not retrospective and therefore cannot apply to Dr Jonathan.\n\nAssuming without conceding that the amendment is not retrospective it is submitted that under the current Constitution a President or Governor cannot spend more than two terms of eight years.\n\n\u201cIn other words, the Constitution will not allow anyone to be in office for more than a cumulative period of 8 years. In Marwa v. Nyako (2012) 6 NWLR (Pt.1296) 199 at 387 the Supreme Court stated that Section 180 (1) and (2)(a) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has prescribed a single term of 4 years and if a second term, another period of 4 years and not a day longer.\n\n\u201cIn the case of Governor Ladoja v INEC (2008)40 WRN 1 the Supreme Court rejected the prayer of Governor Ladoja for 11 months\u2019 extension to cover the period he was kept out of office through illegal impeachment. The Supreme Court rejected the prayer on the ground that a Governor is entitled to spend a maximum period of eight years or less and not more than eight years.\n\n\u201cIt is not in dispute that Dr. Jonathan became the President of Nigeria in 2010 following the sudden death of President Umaru Yar\u2019Adua. He later contested and won the 2011 presidential election. Having spent five years in office as President, Dr. Jonathan is disqualified from contesting the 2023 presidential election. The reason is that if he wins the election, he will spend an additional term of four years. It means that he would spend a cumulative period of 9 years as President of Nigeria in utter breach of Section 137 of the Constitution which provides for a maximum two terms of eight years.\u201d",

          "text": "Several important moves were made across Africa\u2019s tech ecosystem in April.\n\nFrom MTN\u2019s PSB license approval and Airtel\u2019s super-agent license in Nigeria, to Sun King\u2019s $260 million raise in Kenya, and CAR\u2019s crypto adoption, here are the top 10 biggest tech moves in April.\n\nIn April, startups across the continent raised $413,143,000 across 38 fully-disclosed* deals.\n\nThis means April ranks the lowest in terms of funding announcements made, 41% (~ $296 million) less than what was announced in March, and 34% (~ $216 million) less than February\u2019s announcement.\n\nPer sector, the top 3 sectors are energy-tech, fintech, and logistics. Energy leads with $289,800,000 (70.1%); fintech with $53,500,000 (12.9%); and logistics with $34,000,000 (8.2%).\n\nPer region, East Africa leads with announced raises in April 2021, with Sun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise at the helm of the 4 announced raises. West Africa comes in second with $90.5 million announced across 18 funding deals. North Africa is next with startups from Egypt and Morocco announcing a combined raise total of $39.3 million across 11 deals.\n\nThe top 5 disclosed deals of the month are:\n\nSun King\u2019s $260 million Series D raise to expand into Africa, and Asia.\n\nNigerian logistics startup Sabi\u2019s $20 million funding round.\n\nEgypt-based energy tech company Pylon\u2019s $19 million seed round.\n\nUmba\u2019s $15 million round to expand its digital bank into new markets.\n\nGhanaian agritech Farmerline\u2019s $12.9 million pre-Series A round.\n\n*Note: This data is inclusive only of funding deals announced in April 2022. Raises are often announced later than when the deals are actually made.\n\nThis data is exclusive of the Bboxx/PEG Africa acquisition deal which has numbers that have yet to be confirmed. It also excludes estimated grants from accelerators like Techstars or Y-Combinator.\n\nThis month, a slew of good news came for the mobile money sector in anglophone and francophone West Africa.\n\nThe Nigerian arms of telecoms MTN and Airtel made important strides in ramping up mobile money adoption in the country.\n\nFirst, MTN received final approval from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to run a payment service bank in the country.\n\nWeeks later, Airtel laid its hands on a super-agent license from CBN that will allow it to recruit agents for agency banking and deliver essential financial services to customers through a network of third-party agents on behalf of financial institutions.\n\nMeanwhile, in Senegal, fintech unicorn Wave was granted an e-money license by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) to expand its mobile money services in the country.\n\nAfrica\u2019s most valued startup, Flutterwave, faced a series of heavy accusations in March.\n\nFollowing an article by journalist David Hundeyin, Fco-founder and CEO Olugbenga Agboola, was accused of insider trading, fraud, and sexual harassment.\n\nAgboola, as well as ex-CEO Iyinoluwa Aboyeji who was also mentioned in the article, has also responded to some of the allegations.\n\nIn March, Google\u2019s subsea internet cable landed in Togo.\n\nFollowing that announcement, the 12,000 + km cable snaked its way to Lagos, Nigeria in April, as it moves on to Namibia, St. Helena\u2014a British territorial island west of Angola\u2014and finally, South Africa.\n\nThe cable is part of Google\u2019s $1 billion plan to provide affordable internet access in Africa by building global infrastructure to help bring faster internet to more people and lower connectivity costs.\n\nIn April, the Central African Republic (CAR) became the first African country to adopt bitcoin\u2014and all other forms of cryptocurrency\u2014as legal tender.\n\nIt\u2019s also the second country worldwide, after El Salvador, to take this action.\n\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) fined 3 of the country\u2019s commercial banks for flouting a cryptocurrency trading restriction levied a year ago.\n\nThe 3 banks\u2014, Stanbic IBTC, Access Bank, and United Bank for Africa (UBA)\u2014 were fined a total of \u20a6800 million (~$1.9 million) for operating accounts used for crypto trading.\n\nThis is the most recent development in Nigeria\u2019s ongoing crypto trading restriction.\n\nTwitter may not be an African company, but everyone\u2019s got business on there.\n\nIn April, billionaire and Tesla CEO bought Twitter for $44 billion.\n\nThere\u2019s a not-so-funny backstory behind Elon\u2019s takeover though.\n\nFirst, Musk got an individual majority stake in Twitter, then he got an invitation to join the Board, which he declined after realising he wouldn\u2019t be able to own Twitter if he accepted the offer.\n\nMusk also got sued by other investors because he failed to disclose his stake to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Post-decline, Musk also offered to buy all Twitter shares in a veiled threat that could have tanked Twitter\u2019s stock prices. Twitter in turn adopted a poison pill before succumbing to Musk\u2019s charm offer.\n\nA lot of good things are facing Kenya. The country announced a 10-year digital plan in April.\n\nE-commerce behemoth Amazon also announced the launch of an Amazon Web Services Local Zone in the country as well.\n\nVisa opened its first Innovation Studio in Africa in Nairobi, and Google announced plans to launch its first product development centre on the continent in the capital city as well.\n\nA year after launching operations in South Africa, Chinese ride-hailing giant, Didi Chixung, ended its operations in South Africa.\n\nThe ride-hailing company faced stiff competition from Bolt and Uber, and its expansion was also married by South Africa\u2019s third COVID wave which prompted yet another lockdown.\n\nGlobal product manager Ebi Atawodi has made yet another significant move.\n\nLast year, Atawodi announced a move from her position as Uber\u2019s Head of Product, Payments and Financial Products, to Netflix where she served as Director of Products, Payments MEA.\n\nIn April, Atwodi made yet another significant move. After 1 year at Netflix, she\u2019s moved to Google where she\u2019s now serving as Director of Product Management for YouTube Studio.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Egyptian health startup Esaal raises $1.7 million in seed funding",
          "text": "The use of technology or the internet to connect patients to doctors goes as far back as 1994 (PDF) in the MENA region, when Egypt is considered that date is 2002. But wars, doctor and patient resistance, poor infrastructure, lack of funding, poor system quality, and lack of information technology training have hindered the adoption and growth of telemedicine in the MENA region.\n\nThese challenges and the pandemic which force the world to rethink access to healthcare, has created an underserved market for online medical consultation in the region.\n\nEsaal, a health and wellness startup, which has enjoyed unprecedented success in the MENA\u2019s telemedicine industry, has announced a $1.7 million seed investment from A15, according to a statement released by the MENA-focused company. Since its launch in 2018, Esaal has accumulated $3 million in funding, to fund its physical health and mental health and nutrition consultation services which it offers for subscription or on-demand consultation fees.\n\nEsaal\u2019s foray into mental health consultancy is not unrelated to Egypt\u2019s mental crisis, where one-quarter of the country\u2019s population is estimated to suffer from mental health issues. And despite nearly 3,800 people attempting to take their lives in the North African country, the stigma associated with seeking medical help for mental health related issues has further exacerbated the crisis. According to surveys, in the wider MENA region, (one-third) 35% of the MENA population frequently experience stress, while 29% suffer from depression, and even more adults increasingly suffer from obesity.\n\nEsaal enlists the help of over 350 consultants to provide health and wellness services, on a broad range of issues including anxiety, physiotherapy, paediatrics, and nutrition to its 1 million users. Esaal\u2019s users receive service offerings via text, video/voice calls and in-person home visits. At the end of each session, Esaal users can pay using cash, credit card, Fawry, or Vodafone.\n\nIn a statement sent to TechCabal, Esaal said it saw a 250% Y-o-Y increase in revenue in 2021 and a 55% jump in users. This new funding will help it target further growth in the MENA market.\n\nEsaal\u2019s team. Image source: Esaal\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible journey building a solution we are supremely passionate about, with the unparalleled support of experienced and strategic investors such as A15, who are literally building this business alongside us, with expertise that has enabled our expansion into key target markets,\u201d Esaal\u2019s CEO, Fadi Doss said in a statement. \u201cWe have only scratched the surface in an untapped market and are actively working to secure further capital to fuel our continued growth. Esaal has become a name synonymous with trust, quality and access to health and wellness professionals that can help users obtain better outcomes.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the moment we started working with the Esaal team, we knew this was a company with the laser focus and vision to create something truly unique and purpose-driven in its market. They have been prudent in the deployment of capital to date, demonstrating outstanding efficiencies in unit economics, which has enabled their expansion ambitions, \u201c A15\u2019s managing partner, Karim Beshara speaking on the investment. \u201cWe are proud to see their growth, and enjoyed building the business with them throughout the last four years.\u201d\n\nEsaal is currently available in 8 countries including Egypt, KSA, Tunisia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Palestine and Iraq; and wants to use its recent funding to further expand across the MENA region, invest in product and brand development, and increase talent acquisition.\n\n\u201cThere are millions more people across an enormous region that would benefit from our fresh approach to holistic health and we are thrilled to be in a position to keep growing and connecting more health professionals with patients in underserved markets,\u201d Doss said.\n\nEsaal, told TechCrunch, that it expects a revenue CAGR of around 50% to 60% between 2021 and 2025. This goal is supported by data which estimates that the telemedicine industry in Africa and the Middle East will grow from $3.86 billion in 2022 to $6.44 billion by 2021, with a CAGR of 10.80% over the forecast period.\n\nShare this article",

          "title": "Nigeria wants to help creators sell their intellectual properties",
          "text": "The Nigerian government has signed a 3-year intellectual property rights (IPR) agreement with Developing Africa Group (DAG) to create a marketplace where Nigerians can sell their intellectual property rights and receive royalties.\n\nThe platform will allow Nigerian creators commercialise registered intellectual property rights, and enable them to sell or exchange those rights internationally.\n\nGlobally, the intellectual property rights market is worth $8.2 billion and is set to reach $16.1 billion by 2026 with the advent of cloud-based solutions. Nigeria\u2019s deal with DAG is one such cloud-based IP solution.\n\nAccording to the agreement, the partnership will also see the launch of a nationwide wallet where Nigerians can collect royalties or payments\u2014in form of digital tokens or cryptocurrencies\u2014on any intellectual property rights they upload on the platform.\n\nThe Developing Africa Group (DAG), a UK-based IPR commercialisation group, has also announced that it will build the crypto-based platform on the Algorand Blockchain; while the tokenisation technology\u2014which includes the wallet and a stable coin-pegged token\u2014will be handled by Koibanx, an Argentina-based software company. Both Koibanx and Algorand have been involved in several similar crypto-based projects in Latin America including a national blockchain-based citizens ID and information programme in Colombia, and El Salvador\u2019s National Registration platform.\n\nIntellectual property in Nigeria\n\nIntellectual property rights (IPR) are the exclusive rights creators have over their works. Under IP laws, creators have the right to sell (assign) their work or permit others (license) to use or re-create their work. Intellectual Property also includes the rights of production, stocking, reproduction, adaptation, translation, and performance. They include the rights to sell (assign) their work or permit others (license) to use their works. They also include the rights of production, stocking, reproduction, adaptation, translation, and performance.\n\nIn Nigeria, intellectual property is divided into copyright, patents, trademarks and industrial designs, all governed by 4 different Acts. The country\u2019s Copyright Act governs the intellectual property rights of literary, artistic, musical works, broadcasting, recorded, and cinematographic works. Its Patent and Designs Act metes out laws guiding inventions, and industrial designs such as product designs. Its Trade Marks Act, and Merchandise Mark Act oversee the registration and regulation of trademarks like logos.\n\nJust like you have the freedom of movement or the freedom to post freely on social media, creators\u2014photographers, writers, painters, designers, and even scientists\u2014also have the rights to sell or rent out whatever unique things they create, subject to a few conditions.\n\nThis partnership between the Nigerian government and DAG will help Nigerian creators to benefit from their inventions and creators.\n\nNigeria\u2019s history with cryptocurrency\n\nThe deal brings into question Nigeria\u2019s shaky history with cryptocurrency.\n\nIts implementation will see crypto used in at least 2 ways: the building of the platform and wallet which will be on a blockchain network, and the use of a digital token\u2014which will be pegged to the naira. It\u2019s also possible that the deal could drive the usage of the CBN-backed e-naira.\n\nThese plans conflict with Nigeria\u2019s stance on crypto. In February 2021, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) restricted all commercial banks and crypto exchange platforms from crypto trading and has subsequently sanctioned erring platforms.\n\nIt subsequently launched its central bank digital currency (CBDC) months later with over 35,000 transactions recorded since its launch.\n\nMore recently, in May 2022, the country\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published new rules regulating the issuance, offering platforms, and custody of digital assets A.K.A cryptocurrencies which some experts say fails to address problems facing Nigeria\u2019s crypto industry.\n\nCommercialised IP rights for everyday Nigerians\n\nFor Nigeria\u2019s blooming creator economy, the partnership means more visibility and income.\n\nA platform like this would allow anyone who identifies as a digital creator to sell their intellectual properties. Celebrities like Osita Iheme could sell rights to soundbites; photographers like Fati Abubakar could list rights to their photos, and even software engineers and product designers can sell rights to unique processes or designs (including logos) that are registered under Nigeria\u2019s patent law. The Nigerian film industry\u2014Nollywood\u2014could also raise funds by selling some of its features.\n\nWhen the deal comes to fruition, Nigeria\u2019s Copyright Commission (NCC) should see a rise in registration from Nigerians looking to make money selling their IP rights.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please share it with your networks on WhatsApp, Twitter, Telegram, Facebook, and LinkedIn\n\nShare this article",

It\u2019s also the ideal time to bill that tech bro or sis.\n\nThis type of weekend only occurs once a month. If you miss it this month, you\u2019ll have to wait until the next. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to wait. Just kidding. No, I\u2019m not .\n\nBy the way, today is Children\u2019s Day in Nigeria. It\u2019s an excellent opportunity to fulfil that promise to take them out or buy that ice cream. \ud83d\ude09 I mean, make a child happy today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis weekend, I\u2019m also following my advice and billing you. Just kidding. I still don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do this weekend, but I know it will be fun.\n\nEnjoy your weekend however you can. You know I\u2019m always concerned with your overall health and wellbeing. Take care of yourself during this short break!!!\n\nSo today, I\u2019m going to talk about two stories:\n\nJumia\u2019s partnership with CGAP\n\nProducts for people with disabilities\n\nJumia\u2019s partnership with CGAP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt goes without saying that Jumia is one of the dominant players in the African eCommerce market. In Nigeria, the company made $33 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2021, with a $14.6 million increase in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nAlso, the Central Bank of Nigeria recently granted it a Payment Service Solution Provider (PSSP) licence.\n\nThe licence will enable it to process payments for Nigerian third-party businesses. This development pits it directly against Paystack, Flutterwave, eTranzact, and Remita.\n\nIt also provides an additional revenue stream when the company desperately needs to increase revenue.\n\nInterestingly, the company is testing a healthtech play through a partnership with the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis collaboration will provide users with access to doctors for a $1 monthly subscription fee.\n\nWell, Chimgozirim thinks it\u2019s a fantastic move that will allow Jumia to leverage its existing customer base and infrastructure.\n\nI do not think we have enough doctors in this country, though. I mean, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends one doctor for every 600 people in a country.\n\nHowever, in a country with one doctor for every 5,000 people, the WHO\u2019s recommendation appears a long way off.\n\nFurther, the Nigerian Medical Association reports that only 35,000 of the 72,000 registered doctors are practising in Nigeria.\n\nIn his article, Chimgozirim discusses what the collaboration could mean for healthtech startups. You can find it here: Dear healthtech startups, Jumia is coming for your bread!\n\nKenya\u2019s digital products for people with disabilities\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a report, approximately 40% of Africa\u2019s population is disabled, including 10-15% of school-age children. This implies that there are over 300 million people with disabilities in Africa.\n\nEven though people with disabilities are often referred to as the world\u2019s largest minority, in Africa, they face exclusion, discrimination, and barriers to exercising their fundamental rights and participating in development.\n\nHowever, Kenya, an African country, is changing the narrative.\n\nHow? Kenya has developed a standard for digital accessibility for people with disabilities.\n\nThis means that people with disabilities, and older people who are largely disconnected from most e-government services and business-owned digital platforms, will be connected, supported, and empowered by digital products to increase their digital inclusion.\n\nHow? It will be accomplished by providing computer assistive technology to the blind and visually impaired. Also, public and private sector digital products and services (like websites and mobile applications) will be more accessible and usable by all Kenyan citizens.\n\nThis follows the announcement by the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) of a partnership with inABLE to develop a national information and communication technology (ICT) accessibility standard.\n\nThis is similar to EnableMe Kenya, an online platform, aimed at providing community-oriented technological support and increasing digital inclusion for people with disabilities.\n\nAccording to Bernard Njiraini, KEBS Managing Director, \u201cTo accommodate all people in the society, inclusive design and universal design principles should be integrated into digital products and services.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe African Leadership Group and Udacity are offering 5,000 scholarships to African citizens who want to advance their careers in tech. by learning new digital skills. Scholarship recipients will enrol in one of the following Udacity Nanodegree programmes: Data Analyst, Full-Stack Web Developer, or Cloud Developer. Apply here.\n\nGrant Master has announced the start of its second Creative Writers Fellowship cohort. The Fellowship for Creative Writers will take place virtually from July 4th to August 26th, 2022. Apply here.\n\nMOBI Automation, a startup that uses Web3 technologies to solve business problems, is looking for a Chief Technology Officer, UI & UX Designer, Senior Frontend Developer, and Creative Designer. Send your resume here.\n\nDo you breathe crypto or are you simply crypto-curious? Apply for the Coinbase Community Ambassador Program (CAP) \u2014 Summer 2022 here.\n\nHave an amazing weekend!\n\nVictoria Fakiya for Techpoint Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria Fakiya A writer with ADHD who is interested in mental health and how technology is improving the lives of Africans with mental disorders.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, May 17, 2022, Nigerian eCommerce giant, Jumia released its financial report for the first quarter of 2022.\n\nCo-CEOs Jeremy Hodara and Sacha Poignonnec shared that orders, revenue, and gross merchandise value (GMV) saw significant growth compared to the last nine quarters. Comparing Q1 2021 with Q1 2022, orders grew from 6.6 million to 9.3 million, GMV grew from $198.9 million to $252.7 million, while revenue went from $33 million to $47.6 million.\n\nEven with this growth, it\u2019s not all rosy for the company as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) loss was $53 million. On a call with TechCrunch, Poignonnec shared that the company plans to keep EBITDA loss below the $70 million it recorded in Q1 2021.\n\nNow to some good and potentially exciting developments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJumiaPay, its fintech product, has secured a payment service solution provider (PSSP) licence, which will allow it to process payments for third-party businesses in Nigeria. This development puts it in direct competition with Paystack, Flutterwave, eTranzact, and Remita. It also provides another revenue stream when it desperately needs to increase revenues.\n\nPSSPs usually make their money by charging a transaction fee for every transaction they facilitate, and these fees often vary depending on the transaction\u2019s value. Per the report, 34% of orders placed on Jumia were completed using JumiaPay, and with its licence, JumiaPay\u2019s numbers could significantly increase in the coming quarters.\n\nHealthcare at the drop of a hat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: AMISOM via Iwaria\n\nPerhaps the most interesting thing about the developments shared in the report is Jumia\u2019s decision to venture into the healthcare space. Via a partnership with Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, the company is testing a service that will allow users to access doctors with a monthly subscription of $1.\n\nViewed in isolation, this is a great move that could see Jumia tap into its existing customer base and infrastructure. It also represents a more formidable competitor for existing healthcare startups.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends 1 doctor per 600 people in a country, but Nigeria has 1 doctor for 5,000 people. Furthermore, the Nigerian Medical Association reports that only 35,000 of the 72,000 registered doctors are practising in Nigeria, while the healthtech industry in Africa is projected to be worth $259 billion by 2030.\n\nAlthough little detail was provided about the move, its foray into an area that is notoriously difficult in Africa and is not remotely related to its core business warrants some questions.\n\nExisting telehealth startups in the country include CribMD, iWello, and WellaHealth. As private companies, their records are often not in the public domain, but in a 2021 interview with Techpoint Africa, iWello reported that it had 140 clients, with CribMD reportedly serving 2,800 patients as of 2021. WellaHealth\u2019s CEO also shared that the company hit 10,000 unique users in 2017, with thousands on its waitlist.\n\nThese companies are significantly less funded than Jumia, with Africa\u2019s healthcare sector raising $392 million in 2021. However, these companies have to combat low Internet penetration, dwindling household incomes, and cultural norms to get paying customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, Jumia has no expertise operating in the healthcare sector and would likely have to go through a learning curve for this venture to succeed. Even with the option of hiring experienced professionals, things will probably not go their way immediately.\n\nThe fragmented nature of the healthcare space is another challenge that existing players face. For example, there are only a handful of hospitals with digitised records and even fewer still that share this information. This makes it imperative that healthtech startups build solutions for this purpose.\n\nBuilding partnerships for effective healthcare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile these could pose challenges to Jumia\u2019s healthtech plans, Yomi Kazeem, Senior Consultant, Salient Advisory, believes that Jumia has what it takes to succeed, especially if it goes the partnership route.\n\nIn a chat with Techpoint Africa, he said, \u201cJumia can potentially build out its healthtech play through more partnerships to facilitate diagnostics. It can also partner with pharmacies, leverage its logistics network, and pair medication delivery with its telemedicine service, so patients are not only speaking to doctors remotely but also receiving needed medication seamlessly.\n\n\u201cThis approach is important because, ultimately, providing access to consultations is only one part of healthcare. With more of these companies emerging, user acquisition becomes more competitive. In essence, third-party partnerships that facilitate access to patients on a larger scale are vital.\u201d\n\nUnlike existing healthtech players, Jumia has an established logistics service that could help it deliver medications faster than startups that have to depend on third-party providers. While this means Jumia could potentially cut into their market, it also presents an opportunity to expand healthtech services in the country while unlocking one more revenue stream for Jumia.\n\nHealthtech startups, for example, can provide faster and more efficient services by partnering with Jumia. Such partnerships could also expose them to Jumia\u2019s considerably larger customer base.\n\nAn example of such a partnership is Airtel Kenya\u2019s partnership with MyDawa, an online pharmacy in Kenya that allows Airtel\u2019s customers log into the MyDawa website without incurring data costs while MyDawa provides an option to pay for products with Airtel Money.\n\nDespite being boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic, healthtech startups are still a long way from meeting Africa\u2019s healthcare needs. However, partnerships such as this could be key going forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimgozirim Nwokoma Accidental writer, covering Africa\u2019s startup landscape and its heroes.

          "text": "Share this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOl\u00e1,\n\nYou\u2019ve missed out if you haven\u2019t been listening to the Techpoint Africa Podcast, dear reader! Ask around and tell me what other people are saying.\n\nToday\u2019s episode is a lot of fun to listen to! The editorial team made me laugh; Bolu\u2019s story was one of the stories that drew me in.\n\nWhat\u2019s the story? The Central African Republic announced plans to launch SANGO, a bitcoin investment hub.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis follows a warning from the Banking Commission of Central Africa (COBAC) prohibiting banks in the region from collaborating with digital payment platforms. Why? The CAR adopted bitcoin as a reference currency.\n\nAlso, a Nigerian, Chidi Nwaubani, launched the \u201cLooty\u201d project to reclaim African artefacts stolen by European colonists.\n\nThe project will create 3D images of these artefacts, sell them as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and use the proceeds to support young African artists.\n\nPlease listen to the podcast to hear these gists in particular. Bolu spoke last, so you\u2019ll have to listen till the end.\n\nYou can find today\u2019s episode here.\n\nToday, I\u2019ll be discussing:\n\nHow Traction wants to stop fake alerts\n\nCanza Finance\u2019s journey\n\nEsaal\u2019s $1.7m seed\n\nJABU\u2019s $15m series A\n\nTraction wants to stop fake alerts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraction Founders: Dolapo Adejuyigbe and Mayowa Alli (L-R)\n\nOn Monday, I had to use a PoS kiosk because I had problems with one of my banks. Currently, I have two active accounts, but only one has an ATM card.\n\nThat was intentional. I had no idea the other ATM card would come in handy. I have, however, learnt my lesson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, at the kiosk where I was supposed to transfer money to get cash, I asked if they accept mobile transfers, and the attendant took a long look at me before responding reluctantly in the affirmative.\n\nWith her response, I knew they don\u2019t accept mobile transfers. But, because I am someone she knows, she reluctantly agreed.\n\nOf course, the attendant isn\u2019t the only one who has reservations about accepting mobile transfers. In fact, there are small business owners in my neighbourhood who refuse to accept mobile transfers.\n\nSo, before I went there, I mumbled some incantations because I had no money. \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude39 I\u2019m kidding. But that money was urgently needed, though.\n\nAlthough the transfer was successful, she did not give me my money until she saw and confirmed the alert. I was slightly vexed, but I understood why.\n\nReceiving fake alerts isn\u2019t new for merchants in my neighbourhood, so they\u2019d rather you give them cash for every item you buy over making a mobile transfer.\n\nI waited about 15 minutes before she gave me my money. Fear of fake alerts cost me 15 minutes of my time! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude22 I\u2019m not crying, but I believe this is a problem.\n\nI\u2019m sure you know someone or have heard of someone who has been a victim of receiving fake alerts. Consider a merchant receiving fake alerts for every item they sell or service they render. That\u2019s cruel, in my opinion.\n\nHowever, there appears to be a solution. What is it? Traction! The Nigeria-based fintech startup believes its proprietary solution can solve this problem.\n\nHow? It has a unique feature that allows merchants to confirm that every alert is real. Isn\u2019t this interesting?\n\nBusiness owners can use the app to accept payments, generate invoices, manage inventory, and track payments. It also enables merchant employees to confirm payments without calling their boss. Aren\u2019t you curious now?\n\nIf you are, please read Ogheneruemu\u2019s story to learn more about the startup: Traction is building an ecosystem for Nigerian small businesses, starting with stopping fake credit alerts\n\nCanza Finance\u2019s journey\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nL-R, Pascal Ntsama, Canza Finance CEO and Co-Founder and Oyedeji Oluwole, Canza Finance CTO and Co-Founder.\n\nWith the volatility of cryptocurrency, I won\u2019t even look at you twice if you ask me to buy, not to think of launching a crypto business with you.\n\nIt\u2019s simply too risky, if you ask me. It\u2019s high today, low tomorrow; please don\u2019t give me a heart attack. \ud83d\ude0f\n\nThis reminds me of something that happened last Monday. Please accept my apologies if you are a crypto trader or investor. But, I couldn\u2019t stop laughing when the guy next to me on the bus was glued to his screen, checking his crypto app. \ud83d\ude39\ud83d\ude02\n\nSincerely, this guy didn\u2019t even close the app for a second. He was just staring. His expression was sad. That could be due to the drop in cryptocurrency that week.\n\nToday\u2019s story, on the other hand, features two Co-founders, Pascal Ntsama and Oyedeji Oluwoye, who began working together after Oluwoye advised Ntsama to buy cryptocurrency. That was bold, if you ask me.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t convinced initially, but after seeing Oluwoye\u2019s success with cryptocurrency two years later, he agreed.\n\nThat\u2019s when the pair realised there was more to cryptocurrency than just trading. They established Coincentrix in 2017 and received a grant from the Zcash Foundation in 2018.\n\nThen, in 2019, they launched Canza Finance, a crypto neobank that connects African businesses to the global economy.\n\nIn other words, the startup makes cryptocurrency transactions easier. It also allows for payments and peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions within the country. Besides, it intends to include treasury management in its suite of services.\n\nChimgozirin described the startup\u2019s journey in detail here: Canza Finance is a neobank enabling decentralised cross-border payments for Africans\n\nEsaal\u2019s $1.7 million seed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to mental health, there is a common misconception that only people suffering from mental disorders see therapists. This is because some of us mistake mental health for a mental illness, which it is not.\n\nMental health is more than just the absence of a mental disorder. It includes how you think, feel, and act.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re having trouble thinking clearly, stressed, or feeling depressed, it can affect your productivity at school, work, or at home, indicating poor mental health.\n\nConsequently, it would help if you spoke with a trusted person who can keep your information confidential while also providing a safe space to express your emotions and possibly offer advice. You can also talk with someone who is trained in counselling or psychiatry.\n\nMoreover, due to the stigma surrounding mental health, most people are afraid of physically going to a centre to see a therapist or psychiatrist\n\nIn Egypt, Fadi Doss, Founder and CEO of Esaal, launched a platform that connects users to experts, allowing them to receive personalised and genuine answers to health concerns straightforwardly and smoothly.\n\nAnd yesterday, Esaal \u2014 an online health and wellness consultation platform \u2014 announced a $1.7 million seed round, led by Egypt-based A15.\n\nEsaal claims that it has over 350 consultants. Also, the company offers consultations on a wide range of topics, like anxiety, physiotherapy, paediatrics, and nutrition.\n\nUsers use an app to access these services via texting, video/voice calls, and in-person visits. They can pay with cash, credit cards, Vodafone, and Fawry.\n\nPer the CEO, the services are available in seven other countries across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries: Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Palestine, and Iraq.\n\nThe funding will be used to expand across MENA, invest in product and brand development, and hire more people. Between 2021 and 2025, Esaal anticipates a revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50-60%.\n\nJABU\u2019s $15m series A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamibian B2B eCommerce retail platform, JABU, announced a $15 million Series A round yesterday, Wednesday,May 25, 2022.\n\nThe round was led by Tiger Global and saw participation from Box Group, Knollwood, D Global Ventures, Afore Capital, Oldslip and FJ Labs.\n\nFounded in 2020 by David Akinin (CEO), JABU claims to be the solution to Namibia\u2019s inefficient and nearly non-existent supply chain and distribution.\n\nThe company has a fleet of vehicles and eight distribution centres, with a platform connecting over 6,000 retailers to local and multinational suppliers like Namibia Breweries Limited, ABInBev, Bokomo, Coca-Cola, and Namibmills.\n\nWhat\u2019s new? Akinin stated that JABU intends to build around its Jwallet, a wallet system that is currently available as a standalone product. It enables Southern African merchants to use their physical flows to provide cash withdrawal and deposit services to their customers.\n\nIs this similar? Yes. It\u2019s identical to agency banking, a branchless banking system in Nigeria and West Africa where human agents serve as ATMs to provide financial services in outlying areas. And in Morocco, Chari provides a similar service.\n\nJABU will use the Series A funding to expand its presence in Southern Africa and enter new markets like Botswana and Eswatini later this year.\n\nWhat I\u2019m reading and watching\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe African Leadership Group and Udacity are offering 5,000 scholarships to African citizens who want to advance their careers in tech. by learning new digital skills. Scholarship recipients will enrol in one of the following Udacity Nanodegree programmes: Data Analyst, Full-Stack Web Developer, or Cloud Developer. Apply here.\n\nGrant Master has announced the start of its second Creative Writers Fellowship cohort. The Fellowship for Creative Writers will take place virtually from July 4th to August 26th, 2022. Apply here.\n\nMOBI Automation, a startup that uses Web3 technologies to solve business problems, is looking for a Chief Technology Officer, UI & UX Designer, Senior Frontend Developer, and Creative Designer.

To promote your brand via Brand Press, please email business@techpoint.africa\n\nShare this article:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nby Abdullahi Fawale\n\nShort answer? Apply to AltSchool Africa.\n\nIt\u2019s the perfect avenue. Within 12 months, you would have learnt a highly sought-after tech skill and obtained a top-rated diploma. The knowledge and experience gathered during the program adequately prepare you for your first tech job.\n\nReady to begin that journey? Get started HERE.\n\nYou\u2019re reading this for one of two reasons:\n\n1. You\u2019ve made the decision to switch careers and you have your eyes set on the tech space. You\u2019re now on the lookout for key pointers on how to start.\n\n2. You\u2019re yet to decide on transitioning though you\u2019ve been giving it a lot of thought. You however seek more information in the hope that you get all the clarity and green light you need.\n\nA third possibility could be that you know someone who is at that phase of their life\u2014yearning for a career change and real opportunities for growth. This piece answers some of your questions about pursuing a career in tech and how to transition.\n\nBefore we dive in, what is your \u201cWhy\u201d?\n\nThe tech space undoubtedly holds a myriad of opportunities for skilled talent worldwide. Global ecosystems continue to witness exponential growth. In Africa, solution-driven startups keep springing up & raising rounds to help drive growth and expansion.\n\nTech news platforms are often inundated with announcements of funds raised by startups which sometimes run into several millions of dollars. More jobs are getting created. Top tech talents are being enticed with juicy compensation packages and then poached. Junior employees are now taking up more responsibility and securing promotions. It\u2019s Career Christmas!\n\nHowever, it\u2019s quite easy to get distracted by this zeitgeist. Away from the exciting announcements and fascinating Twitter conversations, the growth and successes of these tech ecosystems are powered by the blood and sweat of deeply passionate and hardworking people who put in their absolute best to make things work.\n\nIn other words, working in tech is not a walk in the park. Your \u201cwhy\u201d mustn\u2019t be influenced by the current ecosystem zeitgeist, but by a genuine readiness to learn, contribute and grow.\n\nYou also must define what you want to do going forward. Are you looking for core tech/code roles (e.g Software Engineering) or no-code roles like Product Design, Product Management, Product Marketing, Technical Writing, Customer Success, Recruitment etc,?\n\nHave you looked into what it takes to be successful in this new path and are you ready to give what it takes?\n\nAnswer these questions as truthfully as you can. Don\u2019t worry if you fear your answers aren\u2019t convincing enough at the moment. You can always look up more information on these roles to guide your final decision.\n\nWith that said, here are 5 Proven Tips to Help You Transition Into Tech:\n\n1. What transferable skills do you have?\n\nA sizeable number of people that transition to tech do so by leveraging their previously acquired skills\u2014though these skills are mostly no-code or non-technical. For instance, a Customer Service Representative at a local bank could easily transition to a similar role at a FinTech startup. A journalist or creative writer could try out technical writing and pick up really fast. Human Resource Managers/Recruiters in conventional companies would easily settle in as technical recruiters after a few months of training. The list goes on.\n\nWhat you should do is identify the skills you already possess and see what roles those could get you in tech. If you have your eyes set on an entirely different role (one that doesn\u2019t align with your current skills), check out the skills required for that role and how to go about acquiring them. Then go for it.\n\n2. Search for opportunities in industries where you have prior experience\n\nThis is in many ways similar to what we discussed above\u2014about seeking opportunities in tech where your previously acquired skills are a match. Say you\u2019re a Risk & Compliance Officer at a local bank; you can work the same job at a FinTech startup. A seasoned chartered accountant can head the Accounts & Finance unit at a tech startup. Medical doctors could, for instance, work as consultants at HealthTech startups offering home services. Product Managers can easily function across numerous industries. Conventional journalists and content creators could niche down and focus on reporting/producing content on tech and so on.\n\n3. Take courses & write a certification exam\n\nOne of the sure-fire ways to transition to tech is to learn the skill(s) required to function in specific areas of interest. A great way to achieve this is by taking online courses, registering for and joining boot camps and writing certification exams. Thanks to the internet, there now seems to be unlimited access to information allowing us to learn on our own.\n\nThe democratization of the internet has also brought about a rise in the number of digital platforms that help people acquire knowledge and learn new skills. Within a few months, you can go from being a complete outsider to becoming an entry-level professional, anywhere in the world.\n\nThis is where AltSchool Africa comes in. At AltSchool Africa, you can learn some of the world\u2019s most sought after tech skills and earn a top-rated diploma within 12 months. The school runs a number of coding and no-code learning programs that are stand-alone specialisations under its School of Engineering and School of Product respectively.\n\nFor instance, when you apply to the School of Engineering, you will have to select a specific area of specialisation among the following:\n\nFrontend Engineering Backend Engineering & Cloud Engineering\n\nHowever, for the no-code School of Product, you can choose to learn either Product Design, Product Management or Product Marketing.\n\nIs it possible to land a job in tech by just taking courses without certification? Yes. However, earning a certification badge from an institute of repute certainly opens more doors and gets you in much bigger rooms.\n\n4. Be on the lookout for Internships\n\nMany careers that began as internships have blossomed into highly successful vocations. Some of the most revered, most admired professionals today, started out as interns and managed to build their careers into the success we currently know them to be.\n\nInternships offer great learning opportunities and direct pathways to getting your first job in tech. Not only do you get the opportunity to learn directly from much more experienced professionals\u2013you could also be on your way to getting your first offer of employment. This, of course, is dependent on how well you perform during the period.\n\n5. Network. Network. Network\n\nThe opportunities you seek aren\u2019t coming to pay you a visit in the comfort of your home. You have to get out there and grab them. Your social capital will, to a large extent, influence your career trajectory.\n\nWho do you know? Who do they know? What do they know? What do they do?\n\nUnderstanding the power of networking and actively making time to build connections will help you grow personally and professionally. So, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll do:\n\nIf your LinkedIn has been inactive, it\u2019s time to power it up: That is a good place to start. Find people doing great work in your preferred field and connect with them. Genuinely engage them in conversations and keep an open mind during these discussions.\n\nYou could also look up startup founders and hiring managers in companies you have an interest in: Try to connect with them and send a properly worded message. Briefly introduce yourself and why you\u2019re reaching out. Remember to be courteous.\n\nAttend tech events: These events are the perfect place to network as attendance is primarily physical. You can walk up to stakeholders, politely introduce yourself and tell your story. If you\u2019ve completed all the necessary training and are now in search of a job, that would be a perfect place to pitch to startup founders and execs too.\n\nYou should also consider volunteering: A good number of startups are in the business of building communities and organizing events. Due to the workload which sometimes could get overwhelming, these startups seek to onboard volunteers to help out on a project temporarily. In some cases, volunteers are paid a stipend for the work they do. In reverse scenarios, they aren\u2019t. However, monetary benefits shouldn\u2019t be your primary concern here. Your focus must be on learning as much as you can, gaining insights into the workings of the space, identifying key players and expanding your social circle.\n\nVolunteering, when done right, puts your name on the lips of persons that have the capacity to get you your next job.\n\nJoin Tech Communities: As the ecosystem grows, stakeholders are beginning to appreciate the power of community; the need to bring key players and intelligent outsiders together to look inwards and map out strategies for continued growth.\n\nOne of the strategies designed to ensure said growth is the creation of smaller groups or communities dedicated to knowledge sharing, resource sharing, mentorship and access to opportunities. The primary targets of these communities are entry-level & intermediate professionals who are then guided by more experienced tech talent. Members of these communities often have a shared sense of responsibility to help each other grow.\n\nThere are communities for everyone. So, whether you\u2019re a Software Engineer, Data Analyst, Product Manager or Technical Writer, there is a place for you.\n\nOn a final note:\n\nIt is very much possible to transition into tech within one year. As a matter of fact, some have managed to make the switch in just a few months. Bear in mind that if you must transition and do it fast, you will have to simultaneously employ more than one of the methods mentioned above. For example, you could have direct, transferable skills but you may have to network and volunteer to access even bigger and better opportunities.\n\nThese methods also aren\u2019t set in stone. You could come up with other creative, honest ways to move several steps further and get to work.\n\nIn the meantime, let\u2019s circle back to where we began:\n\nA quick guide on How to Transition into Tech in 1 Year?\n\nApply to AltSchool Africa\n\nApplications to the School of Product are currently open.\n\nReady to begin that journey?

          "text": "The Federal Government of Nigeria is in talks with major gas producers in the country for the development of more Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) trains to take advantage of the growing global demand for gas.\n\nEd Ubong, managing director of Shell Gas Nigeria, told BusinessDay on the sidelines of the World Gas Conference in Daegu, Republic of Korea, that the talks are proceeding accordingly.\n\n\u201cAfter the successful commencement of NLNG Train 7, it is only logical to build on that success,\u201d said Ubong.\n\nHe said that the Nigerian government\u2019s priority at the moment is to lock in the gas fields that will serve new LNG trains.\n\nWhile there is no clear timeline for when new projects will commence, the government is not waiting for the completion of Nigeria LNG (NLNG) Train 7 before it expands its footprint in the gas market.\n\nOn guaranteeing domestic supply of gas, Ubong said Nigeria is looking at building more mini-LNG plants as there are now technologies that make it easier to set up the plants a lot cheaper with some able to supply as much 5 million standard cubic feet per day.\n\nA major challenge for gas production in Nigeria is distribution as the network of pipelines does not cover the country and is prone to attacks and sabotage. With mini-LNG plants, gas is trucked across the country, even if at a higher cost.\n\nUbong said the short-term focus is to leverage technology to guarantee local supply at the point it is needed most and gradually ramp up capacity to export big volumes.\n\nHowever, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) foraging for cash as petrol subsidy weakens its ability to finance projects from its cash flow.\n\nThe refusal to give the green light for the Mobil Producing Limited share sale deal with Seplat Energy Plc by President Muhammadu Buhari, who doubles as the petroleum minister, is seen as an obstacle to the financing required to develop what are predominantly gas fields under the deal.\n\nRead also: Nigeria\u2019s gas potential draws interest at global conference\n\nThis has made it imperative for the NNPC to ramp up financing for new developments and Mele Kyari, group managing director of the NNPC, at the WGC 2022, made pitches to investors to take up opportunities in developing the country\u2019s gas.\n\nHe decried how underinvestment in the sector is leaving the world unable to meet its energy needs and making it harder to replace reserves.\n\nHe called for a balance between balancing climate concerns with guaranteeing energy security today.\n\nTo guarantee supply certainty and meet global demand, the Nigerian government is also revisiting abandoned LNG projects.\n\nLast month, Timipre Sylva, minister of state petroleum resources, said the Federal Government was seeking new investors for the abandoned LNG projects in the country.\n\nThe two abandoned gas projects are the Olokola LNG project, with 12.6 million metric tonnes capacity, stalled because all the international oil companies (BG, Shell, and Chevron) withdrew from the project, with only the NNPC left; and the Brass LNG project, designed to produce 10 million metric tonnes per annum, which was to be built by the NNPC, Total, ConocoPhillips, and Eni Group but ConocoPhillips withdrew from the project in 2013.",

          "text": "New factories built by BUA Cement and African Glass Limited as well as five new paper mills that recycles wastepaper into carton drove up manufacturing output in Nigeria in the second half of last year, industry data have shown.\n\nManufacturing sector production output increased by almost 60 percent to N7.03 trillion in 2021 from N4.42 trillion in 2020, the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) said in a new report on Thursday. It increased to N3.73 trillion in the second half of 2021 from N2.36 trillion in the same half of 2020.\n\nMAN\u2019s 2021 second-half economic review revealed that manufacturing investments soared by 83.2 percent in 2021 to N217.22 billion from 118.52 billion in 2020.\n\nCapacity utilisation in the sector averaged 58.9 percent in 2021, up from 49.5 percent a year earlier.\n\nThe increase in manufacturing capacity utilisation and investments was attributed to the gradual recovery of business and economic activities as efforts were intensified to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\u201cIn addition, there are increased capacities in the paper subsector brought in by five new paper mills that are into recycling of waste papers to produce cartons. Also are the additional capacities as BUA Group introduced a cement factory in Sokoko and the new African Glass Limited factory that produced glass products,\u201d it said.\n\nThe association, however, said manufacturing activities in the non-metallic minerals sector had been persistently low following the exclusion of some of the raw materials imported for glass production from the official foreign exchange window.\n\n\u201cThe situation is worsened by the limited availability and high cost of prospecting for local development raw materials in the country. Capacity utilisation in the sector averaged 49.5 percent in 2021 as against 49.9 percent in 2020,\u201d the manufacturers said.\n\nA total of 16,110 jobs were created in the sector last year while 4,451 jobs were lost, according to the report.\n\n\u201cThe net job created in the sector in 2021 stood at 11,659 while a net job loss in 2020 was 3,257. The trend thus shows that manufacturing jobs are also rebounding following the gradual return of economic activities in the sector after a year onslaught brought by COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d MAN said.\n\nLast year, Flour Mills of Nigeria announced its acquisition of an additional 5,200 hectares of land at Sunti which expanded the total land size of Sunti Golden Sugar Estates to 22,000 hectares.\n\nOlam said its subsidiary Crown Flour Mill Limited launched a N300 million ($750,000) 10-year project to set up community seed enterprises for Nigerian farmers to increase their production of wheat.\n\nLocal sourcing of raw materials in the sector dipped to 52.4 percent in 2021 from 57.5 percent in 2020, according to the report.\n\n\u201cSince the full opening of the economy following the lockdown associated with COVID-19 pandemic, local raw materials and other manufacturing inputs have been relatively scarce and costly. This has also affected the output of the sector negatively,\u201d MAN said.\n\nIt stressed the need to improve and reposition the sector back as the engine of growth.\n\nAccording to the association, there is a need to maintain those policies and formulate others that will encourage investments, especially on the stability of exchange rate, development of local raw materials, and protection of lives and properties, among others.\n\n\u201cThe manufacturing sector is very important in a growing economy but Nigeria\u2019s manufacturing sector is currently struggling with a myriad of challenges. This data was for 2021 but since the beginning of this year, things have gotten worse; so there are fears that these improvements recorded may not be sustainable this year,\u201d Jide Babatope, a Lagos-based analyst, said.\n\nAccording to him, manufacturers are battling with a widening supply-demand gap, acute shortage of FX for transactions, continuous depreciation of the naira, and surging cost of production, among others.\n\nHe said except things improve going forward, manufacturers may not be able to maintain this kind of growth going forward.\n\nMAN CEOs Confidence Index, which was recently released, declined to 53.9 points in the first quarter of 2022 from 55.4 points in the fourth quarter of 2021, as macroeconomic conditions and global crisis took a toll on the sector.\n\nRead also: Nigerian manufacturers cut 4,451 jobs in one year\n\n\u201cContributory factors to the decline in the index score for the first quarter of 2022 include eroding disposable income of consumers, the immediate impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine as seen in the hike in price of diesel, wheat and other imported manufacturing inputs the persistent acute shortage of forex, insecurity, high interest rate, excessive drive for revenue by Government,\u201d the association said.\n\nSince Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February, manufacturers in Africa\u2019s largest economy have suffered production hiccups as the supply of raw materials was disrupted and the price of diesel, a major source of energy, surged by over 92 percent, causing a surge in the cost of production.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the improved performance of the manufacturing sector during the year, it is still far beyond its potential growth and contribution to national output due to an almost innumerable challenges confronting the sector,\u201d MAN said.\n\nThe association urged the government to create plausible incentives for investment in the development of raw materials locally through the backward integration and resource-based industrialisation initiatives.\n\n\u201cIndustrial policies in the country should be allowed to gestate with proper monitoring and evaluation rather than jettisoning or altering them frequently while the implementation of Executive Order 003 must be properly monitored to ensure compliance by MDAs in order to boost activities in the manufacturing sector,\u201d it said.",

          "title": "\u2018This time it will be different\u2019 \u2013 Nigeria\u2019s IPOB conundrum",
          "text": "In 1991, an enterprising Sierra Leonean fellow called Foday Sankoh had a brainwave. Inspired by Charles Taylor\u2019s successful armed takeover of the government across the border in Liberia, the ex-army corporal brought together a few friends and allies and launched the Revolutionary United Front (RUF).\n\nThis group was essentially a copycat of Taylor\u2019s National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL). With a name apparently referencing a struggle for the interests of Sierra Leonean commoners against the corrupt, far-away government in Freetown, Sankoh\u2019s RUF rapidly gained popularity in Sierra Leone\u2019s countryside.\n\nPositioning itself as the solution to the perceived arrogance of the Freetown elites who had entirely failed to bring any sort of meaningful development to the country outside the capital city, RUF promised free healthcare, free education and fair distribution of the country\u2019s diamond revenues.\n\nBear in mind that for most people in a country whose government revenue base relied almost entirely on diamond mining revenues, tourism, foreign aid and loans, the promise to equitably distribute diamond revenues instead of investing everything into Freetown and its ivory tower elites was seen as the Holy Grail of political aspirations.\n\nRUF\u2019s popularity rapidly swept through the country and its slogan \u201cNo More Slaves, No More Masters. Power and Wealth to the People\u201d seemed to indicate a bright new future for ordinary Sierra Leoneans once the corrupt Freetown government was out of the way.\n\nEverything the indigenous people of the countryside ever hoped and dreamed of was on the other side of this armed struggle against a government dominated by snotty elites and descendants of resettled freed slaves. What happened instead, became a story that has inspired this column today.\n\n\u201cLong sleeve or short sleeve?\u201d RUF and what happens when there is no plan\n\nA little over 20 years after Foday Sankoh launched his Charles Taylor tribute act, another enterprising young man in West Africa came up with a similar brainwave. Nnamdi Kanu, a charismatic, temperamental and well-spoken political campaigner from Nigeria\u2019s southeast region came up with the \u201cIndigenous People Of Biafra\u201d (IPOB) as a counterbalance to genuine wrongs committed against the region by Nigeria\u2019s Federal Government. Like RUF, IPOB rapidly gained real street-level popularity, fed by historical grievances from Nigeria\u2019s genocidal three-year civil war and its intractable legacy.\n\nIt is important to note that neither RUF nor IPOB in any way exaggerated the wrongs visited upon their purported constituencies \u2013 these wrongs were as real as they were egregious. If the wrongs did not exist, neither of these groups could have gained the popularity they did in such a short space of time.\n\nIf we are to believe the \u201cDr Strange\u201d theory of reality, then there is a parallel universe out there where Foday Sankoh and Nnamdi Kanu both led successful, productive campaigns to free their constituencies from the yoke of oppression by distant governments in Freetown and Abuja.\n\nIn that universe, Foday Sankoh\u2019s body is preserved in a national mausoleum in Freetown, and Nnamdi Kanu led the successful breakaway of Nigeria\u2019s southeast into a successful industrial country called Biafra, which is now Africa\u2019s Tiger economy.\n\nThis is not that universe.\n\nIn this universe, what happened was that beyond a few shouty slogans, a ton of highly emotional but intellectually empty rhetoric and threat of violence, both RUF and IPOB could not articulate a coherent and realistic roadmap to achieve their goals, or indeed agree on what their goals were.\n\nSoon, the only observable goal became the acquisition of power over their constituencies using violence. Acting ostensibly in the name of the Sierra Leonean people, RUF embarked on one of the most horrific sprees of war crimes the world has ever seen.\n\nSierra Leonean children were kidnapped in industrial quantities from their families, forced to shoot both their parents, and become child soldiers or child prostitutes.\n\nRUF became noted for lining up captured Sierra Leonean civilians \u2013 the same ones they were apparently fighting for \u2013 and asking them, \u201cLong sleeve or short sleeve?\u201d Those who answered \u201clong sleeve\u201d would instantly get amputated at the wrist with a sharpened bush knife or machete, while \u201cshort sleeves\u201d would get amputated at the elbow. By the time the war ended in 2003, an estimated 27,000 Sierra Leoneans had been turned into amputees, and 14,000 Sierra Leonean children had been turned into some of the cruellest soldiers ever encountered by the ECOMOG and British Army soldiers who put an end to the war.\n\nIPOB in 2022: Early-stage RUF redux\n\nThis column has made no attempt to be subtle about the parallels to be drawn between RUF and its present-day Nigerian reincarnation. This is because regardless of the hundreds of death threats and hate messages that will inevitably follow, it is important for everyone reading this who has some influence in Nigeria\u2019s southeast to understand something very key about the ongoing violence and anarchy in the region \u2013 Nnamdi Kanu no longer has any real control over the activities being carried out in his name. Executing him or releasing him makes no difference at this point.\n\nNon-state actors have been given firearms, basic weapons training and an overwhelming sense of power and agency that they have never experienced before. The only outcome of this is the same outcome that Sierra Leone witnessed as Foday Sankoh\u2019s ideological creation turned into the violent mockery that saw seven year-old boys shoot their parents dead and hack the limbs off wailing civilians.\n\nAs was the case with RUF, IPOB completely failed to articulate a workable plan for actualising its political goals and took the easy shortcut \u2013 threatening and proposing violence against an enemy.\n\nAs was also the case with RUF, the identity of said enemy was fluid and subjective. and the start of IPOB\u2019s guerilla information warfare campaign using Radio Biafra, the designated \u201cenemy\u201d was the Federal Government violent Fulani militia that acted with the clear and obvious approval of the Buhari government and elements in the armed forces. It was easy to sell the campaign as a self-defense effort, which is perhaps why the launch of IPOB\u2019s so-called Eastern Security Network \u2013 essentially a non-state army \u2013 did not raise the alarm it should have.\n\nThese days, anything and anyone can be the enemy. A civilian woman and her four children. A trader going about his legitimate business in defiance of the illegally-imposed \u201cstay at home\u201d order. A bus driver trying to work to feed his family. Ordinary civilians on social media decrying the disastrous effects of the neo-RUF\u2019s activities on trade and commerce in the southeast. The journalist writing this column. Everyone is or can now be IPOB\u2019s designated enemy depending on what side of the bed anyone wakes up on.\n\nFinally, just like with RUF in the 90s, there is a studied and concerted effort to deny ownership and responsibility of the atrocities being carried out by the armed non-state militia. This could be because the chain of command is broken and different armed elements are running riot over the southeast, doing whatever they see fit.\n\nIt could be because there has been a palace coup and the Finnish Mr Potatohead has seized operational control from Nnamdi Kanu. It could even be the Nigerian state itself taking advantage of IPOB\u2019s in-house chaos to instigate more chaos, so as to give the Buhari regime the pretext it longs for to enact its long-desired anti-Igbo military crusade. It could be all three.\n\nThe only thing we know for sure is that the people of the southeast themselves are being set up to become the biggest losers in all this, just as the people of Sierra Leone were set up by Foday Sankoh\u2019s RUF in the 1990s.\n\nOnly they have the power to end this escalating nightmare before it gets to the \u201clong sleeve or short sleeve\u201d chapter. Everything points to the reality that southeastern Nigeria is heading toward the condition of Sierra Leone before Nigerian military occupation created peace the same way dropping a high yield tactical nuke on a town solves its rat problem.\n\nMaybe it will be different this time, but you know, maybe not.",

          "text": "Share Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nStumbleupon\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nRiding on the back of Governor Godwin Obaseki\u2019s investment drive, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Zenith Bank, Suntrust Bank, among other investors have made commitments to the development of a 1,590-hectare oil palm plantation operated by Raedial Farms Limited.\n\nWith the global demand for oil palm on the increase amid supply disruptions, investors are taking advantage of the Edo State Oil Palm Programme (ESOPP), to deepen imprints in the country\u2019s oil palm sector. Already, Edo has about 120,000 hectares of oil palm plantation under development.\n\nOther investors and stakeholders who visited the Raedial Farms facility in Iguomokhua village, Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo State include Boston Advisory, CAGL Global, United Capital & United Bank of Africa (UBA). They were received by the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the company, Mr. Uwadiale Agenmonmen.\n\nAgenmonmen said work is in top gear to supply crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel oil (PKO) to the market through the current expansion programme of its palm plantation and mill.\n\nHe stated that there was no better time to invest in palm oil cultivation and production in Nigeria other than now, particularly against the backdrop of the recent ban on the exportation of palm oil and oil palm produced by the Indonesian government.\n\nAccording to him, \u201cThe business environment is interesting. There may be ups and downs but lately, the palm oil value chain has been the best in a while, fostered by Indonesia shutting down their export recently and thereby putting the pressure back home.\n\n\u201cIn recent times, people that normally import can no longer import palm oil and other products from Indonesia. So, the prices are going up and it is good for the farmers that actually cultivate and sell. In a nutshell, right now, the business environment is okay.\u201d\n\nWhile commending the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for the financial support towards the growth of the industry, he stated that the major obstacle militating the success of farmers in the oil palm industry is largely occasioned by the set of conditions or evaluation commercial banks give to those who want to access the funds provided by CBN.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe farm sits on 1,509 hectares of land and has currently cultivated 700 hectares while another 500 hectares would be cultivated this year. The oil mill in the farm currently has the capacity of producing 16 tons of red oil every day and from palm kernel oil, it can produce 27 tons every day when there is a full stock of raw materials.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to bring our current investors and bankers here to physically see what we are doing because there is a difference when you talk to people about what you do on paper and phone calls. We want them to feel connected to where they have their money and with this, we look forward to better business opportunities.\u201d\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

He noted that working together with other stakeholders, including all security agencies, the government will ensure a safe and conducive environment for people to live and do business without harassment and extortion.\n\nHe said, \u201cWe have declared a complete war on land grabbers in the state. With the support of the Inspector General of Police, we are building trucks with guns and a barrack that will contain 100 men. We are working with the Private Property Protection Committee to come up with a list of petitions which is about 420. We will address all and ensure we end land grabbing in the state.\u201d\n\nThe governor further added, \u201cWe can\u2019t continue in the way we have gone in the past, where people build indiscriminately in the state, blocking waterways and causing erosion across the state. We want to create a culture of planning. We owe it to the people to set a path to the future of the state. It\u2019s on us to build the system and the people to own it, long after we leave office.\u201d\n\nObaseki noted that the stakeholders\u2019 meeting is important because of the role of the Christian Community in driving development in the state.\n\nHe urged, \u201cChurches must join us to correct the ills going on today and we need to start reordering the planning of the state.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Chairman of PFN in Edo State, Evang. Mrs. Margaret Agbonifo assured the governor that churches in the State will key into the Benin Master Plan and Edo Regional Development Plan to ensure development in the state.\n\nShe said, \u201cChurches have fallen prey to land grabbers in the past and that has affected churches in terms of building plans as they face disputes when developing the properties.\n\n\u201cWe have had a meeting with the churches under PFN in the state and we all have agreed to key into the plan by ensuring we all register our churches. We are ready to submit our building plans but appeal to the governor to approve such plans.\u201d\n\nAlso, the Chairman of Edo CAN, Bishop Oyenude Kure promised the support of Christians to ensure sustainable development in the state.\n\nOn her part, Commissioner for Physical Planning, Urban and Regional Development, Isoken Omo, noted, \u201cCAN is important to the project as the state knows you are a key influencer within the state and beyond.

We have been able to grow our economy to align with its potential. We are addressing a whole lot of issues, particularly security and healthcare to sort out the economy.\n\n\u201cWe are working to fire our economy to the extent that we utilize the economy to the benefit of our people, and one key driver for us is agriculture; food. The number one pressing issue in Nigeria today is food availability.\n\n\u201cWe are going to make sure we focus on food production and economic growth. We are engaging with our young people and trying to position them to take advantage of the opportunities in culture and technology globally.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn order to be competitive economically, the key asset you need are your people; the key driver they need is education. They have to be educated. We are emphasizing education, particularly basic education,\u201d he added.\n\nReaffirming his government\u2019s commitment to ending the menace of human trafficking and illegal migration in Edo, Obaseki further noted, \u201cWe realized that it is that lack of hope and poor education that fuels irregular migration, and we have tried as much as we can to curtail that menace of irregular migration by creating hope for them; nobody wants to leave home if the home is comfortable.\u201d\n\nHighlighting the success recorded by his administration in the health sector, the governor said the state partnered with the Association of Nigeria Physicians in the Americas (ANPA) to provide free medical outreach to Edo people.\n\nHe said, \u201cA couple of weeks ago, we received 67 medical practitioners in our state and they worked with our personnel on ground to improve quality healthcare delivery to our people. For us, with healthcare, it\u2019s about the foundation. If we have the basic health footprint right, as well as the training of community healthcare heads, then it will not be too challenging dealing with diseases such as malaria and distributing vaccines.\u201d\n\nOn culture, Obaseki added, \u201cFor us as government, our goal is to position Edo for the subcontinent. We are working with the European Government in the areas of storage and preservation facilities and the Nigeria Government, to strengthen the national museum monuments\u2019 facilities.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to working with the Royal Palace in building a royal collection and the whole idea is to build the Edo Museum of West Africa Art (EMOWAA) where you will have a lot to see when you come in.\u201d\n\nEarlier in her speech, the United States Ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Leonard, saluted the government for its anti-trafficking laws, noting that they have helped in curbing irregular migration among young people in the state.\n\nWhile reassuring the support of the United States, she further hailed the Obaseki-led government for its various programmes to positively engage Edo youths.\n\nLeonard further revealed that museums in the United States of America are intensifying efforts to repatriate Benin artifacts in their possession.\n\nShare this: Tweet\n\n\n\nMore\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n...",

          "text": "Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party and also resigned as the Minority Leader in the upper chamber of the National Assembly.\n\nAbaribe cited reasons of illegality, impunity, and hesitations in decision-making for his decision to dump the party.\n\nHe confirmed his exit from the PDP and as a minority leader in both the party and the Senate in separate letters to the ward chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Obingwa Local Government Area of Abia State and the President of the Senate in the National Assembly.\n\nAbaribe\u2019s letter addressed to the party\u2019s ward Chairman, titled \u201cResignation of my membership from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP,\u201d read in part;\n\n\u201cI write to inform you of my decision to resign as a member of (the) Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n\u201cThis development is consequent upon the shameful display of illegality, impunity, and undemocratic decision of the party and after due consultations with my constituents.\u201d\n\nHis letter to the senate titled \u201cNotification of Resignation from the Membership of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Senate,\u201d read in part;\n\n\u201cThis is to notify you and my dear colleagues in the Senate that I have formally resigned my membership of the Peoples Democratic Party through my ward. This also means my resignation as (the) Minority Leader of the Senate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish to thank you and my dear colleagues in the Leadership of the Senate for the warm camaraderie we enjoyed while I was Minority Leader.\u201d\n\nAbaribe, who was one of the top contenders for the party\u2019s governorship ticket in Abia State, pulled out of the primary about 78 hours earlier.\n\nStating his reasons, Abaribe said:\n\n\u201cThe last couple of weeks has been tortuous as we battled hard to navigate our party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) away from a self-destructive path.\n\nThe essence was to create an unfettered democratic space and a level playing field for all aspirants vying for all elective offices in the state, to participate equally in the primary elections.\n\nThat was not the case and of course, what we are witnessing is a shambolic process driven by a procured court injunction.\n\nTo make matters worse, the use of only an imaginary 3-man Adhoc delegates to the exclusion of the party\u2019s statutory delegates in the primary elections to elect our candidates even when INEC the nation\u2019s electoral umpire, has unequivocally stated that no congress held in Abia State for that purpose, has no doubt put the party and her candidates in a quagmire.\n\nThe implication for our party is grave and as such has put all ongoing primary exercises on quicksand.\n\nI am known for standing firm in defence of my convictions for the right of all people to a free and fair democratic process. That was why my campaign set sail on a democratic journey that took us to all the nooks and crannies of our dear state. We covered all the local governments and we could see the enthusiasm on the faces of our people who are desirous of change to a progressive government with a human face.\n\nWe committed human and material resources, preaching the \u201cRise Up Abia\u201d message for the total emancipation of our State from the drudgery of imposition and godfatherism, which has seen the state at the lowest wrung of infrastructural, human and material development index among the states of the federation.\n\nOur people were and are indeed fired up for a new lease of life that will be brought about by a people\u2019s government.\n\nThere was no doubt that Abians are tired of being subjected to being the butt of jokes and ridicule from their peers, particularly those from the contiguous states that were hitherto far behind Abia State in the development index at the time past.\n\nThat was the narrative we sought to change when the campaign took off.\n\nUnfortunately, the ugly developments ignited by a rapacious ambition to maintain the wicked governance status quo of imposition and godfatherism have aborted this quest in PDP.\n\nAccordingly, I Senator Enyinnaya Harcourt Abaribe will not be part of this charade.\n\nI am therefore not participating in the exercise, which means that I will not be part of the PDP governorship primary election that holds in Abia State on Wednesday 25th of May, 2022 as doing so would have amounted to an endorsement of illegality that is already being challenged in the courts.\n\nI, therefore, ask all our people, our teeming supporters, and Ndigbo to remain calm, keep the faith and wait for the new direction, which will be announced very soon.\n\n\u201cWhat is important is that the campaign to liberate Abia State would surely assume a new dimension. The time is now.\u201d\n\nIn another statement, he said:\n\n\u201cEverybody will make a sacrifice, I have decided to make a sacrifice, I will never be part of anything bad for Abia State, what we won\u2019t do is to step away from the political process, by tomorrow, I will announce a new direction, you can follow me if you like\u201d",

          "text": "Barely 72 hours to the May 29 presidential primary election of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC), the party\u2019s state of preparation for the event, has become a source of concern to stakeholders.\n\nAbout 2,340 delegates across the country are expected to converge on Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital city, to elect the presidential candidate of APC.\n\nBut the screening committee that ought to certify the aspirants fit for the contest is yet to be inaugurated.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had set June 3rd as the deadline for the submission of presidential candidate by all political parties participating in the 2023 general elections.\n\nBut a visit by our correspondent Thursday evening to the Eagles Square Abuja, scheduled venue of the APC special convention, showed the usual preparations ahead of the convergence were yet to commence.\n\nBlueprint observed the absence of usual relevant stands, banners and structures at the Eagle Square venue, fuelling speculation and fear that the event may not hold Sunday.\n\nAlso, the party\u2019s national secretariat located at Blantyre Street, Wuse 11, Abuja was deserted by party officials due to ongoing governorship primaries elections holding across the states of the federation.\n\nTinubu group worried\n\nReacting to the development, the national publicity secretary of Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu Support Group (AATSG), Hon. Sampson Atasia Oburu, lamented the state of party\u2019s preparation for the exercise.\n\nHe said: \u201cLess than 72 hrs to the primaries, no screening of aspirants and possible debates between aspirants is zero. I wonder what kind of example we as the ruling party is setting after we promised Nigerians change.\n\n\u201cWe moved to \u2018Next Level\u2019, one would have thought that we would move from doing things anyhow to doing the right things which to a large extent, would muster unity within the party, raise the status of the party and usher in a new era of hope.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely important to sustain and in our own case now, restore confidence in the party by the electorate and public because as it is, Nigerians are fast losing confidence in our ability to lead the country to the much needed Next Level.\n\n\u201cThere is rancour and strife in almost all the states controlled by our party, multiple factions, poor internal democratic processes, where the electoral processes are hijacked by one or a few individuals against the collective strength of the majority.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to proffer solution to the identified challenges, Oburu said: \u201cIn my thinking, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu is the best prepared aspirant among all the other aspirants. Asiwaju has been thinking and planning for the betterment of the party and the nation. He is the most acceptable across board, he was the architect of the merger that formed APC, he is the one that set the foundation to victory of APC, he has the best chances to win for the party even with the critical condition of the party.\u201d\n\nAPC rebirth\n\nAlso speaking, Co-convener APC Rebirth Group Comrade Aliyu Audu reminded the Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led National Working Committee (NWC) of the implication of not producing a presidential candidate by 3rd of June.\n\nAudu said: \u201cWhile we are concerned about the lack of activities to show that plans are in place for the special Convention, we want to believe that everyone involved is aware of the implications of not having a duly elected presidential candidate by the 3rd of June 2022, so there are probably plans in place that are unknown to us.\u201d\n\nPro-Osinbajo group\n\nTo supporters of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, a top contender in the race, there is really no cause for alarm.\n\nOne of the groups, Osinbajo Support Movement said: \u201cThe screening can still happen 24hrs to the primary day. No worries whatsoever. You will see activities at the Eagles Square ground from Saturday.\u201d\n\nWhen reminded that the screening Committee for the presidential aspirants is yet to be constituted, Olawale said: \u201cI don\u2019t think so, they (party leaders) are only being strategic.\u201d\n\nJonathan hits parties on primaries\n\nMeanwhile, former President Goodluck Jonathan has faulted the ongoing primaries for the 2023 elections.\n\nThe primaries are being marred with complaints of inducement of delegates by aspirants to win their votes.\n\nThere have been reports of how aspirants induced delegates to vote for them.\n\nFor instance, in Kaduna, a son to Jonathan\u2019s former deputy, Namadi Sambo, asked for a refund from delegates who allegedly collected his money but failed to vote for him.\n\nCondemning the development Thursday in Abuja at a book launch titled \u201cPolitical Party Governance\u201d authored by Dr. Mohammed Wakil, a former Minister of State, Power, the former president said it was disgraceful to induce delegates to get their votes and then request for refund after failing to secure tickets.\n\nJonathan said: \u201cThese whole primaries going on across the country is a mess. This is not a standard practice. The process has failed. We cannot use the process to elect president, governors, senators and House of Representatives members and others.\n\n\u201cThe process is already failed, which is not good for the country. But we will manage and move on.\n\n\u201cWe pray that good people should come. I hope that what happened this year, 2022 will not happen again in this country.\u201d\n\nThe former president, therefore, urged the National Assembly to make laws to criminalise inducement of delegates and electorate.\n\nJonathan further called on the legislature to expunge from the Electoral Act, the sections that dwell on how political parties should select candidates for elections.\n\nJonathan said: \u201cThe National Assembly can\u2019t make laws and lock all political parties together. Parties have different ways of nominating candidates and the process is enshrined in their constitutions.\n\n\u201cCreating a situation where all parties must have the same way of selecting candidates is nonsense. Parties are not parastatals of government.\n\n\u201cThe National Assembly can\u2019t make laws to strangulate political parties. Section 84 should be expunged from the Electoral Act.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",
          "summary": "About 2,340 delegates across the country are expected to converge on Abuja, the nation\u2019s capital city, to elect the presidential candidate of APC.\nHe said: \u201cLess than 72 hrs to the primaries, no screening of aspirants and possible debates between aspirants is zero.\nJonathan further called on the legislature to expunge from the Electoral Act, the sections that dwell on how political parties should select candidates for elections.\nJonathan said: \u201cThe National Assembly can\u2019t make laws and lock all political parties together.\n\u201cThe National Assembly can\u2019t make laws to strangulate political parties.",

          "text": "Dance of victories, moment of lamentation and conflict of interests Thursday signposted the governorship primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC) conducted across the states. From the results released at the end of the contests, some of the primaries were keenly contested, characterised by intrigues, horse-trading and the usual power tussle that culminated in parallel congresses while in others it was like a walk over.\n\nIn most cases, the anointed candidates, expectedly, won the day and emerged choice candidates, while in other states, it was full of surprises as those being looked upon as dark horses emerged victorious.\n\nNiger\n\nAs at the time of this report, the primary election was still on in Niger state where Blueprint\u2019s Publisher Mohammed Idris Malagi and a federal lawmaker, Mohammed Bago were about the major contenders for the APC governorship ticket.\n\nIt was gathered that delegates from about 15 local government areas had voted, with Malagi coasting home to victory.\n\nSome of the local government areas include Agaie, Agwara, Bida, Borgu, Edati, Chachanga, Bosso, Lavun, Gurara, Gbako and Kachia among others.\n\nAlthough there were initial hiccups, these were however rectified with the arrival of Commissioner of Police Monday Kurya who deployed more police officers to the Legbo Kutigi Conference Centre venue of the exercise for proper supervision.\n\nHe assured all parties in the contest of a level playing field.\n\nZulum wins primaries\n\nIn Borno state, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum who was the sole APC aspirant, was declared winner ahead of the forthcoming general elections in 2023.\n\nThe primary election was held at the El-Kanemi Sports Centre in Maiduguri Thursday evening, and attended by key APC stakeholders, including former Governors Kashim Shettima, Ali Modu Sheriff, and Maina Ma\u2019aji Lawan.\n\nMinister of State for Agriculture Mustapha Baba Shehuri, serving and former National and State Assembly members, Nigerian Ambassador to China, Baba Ahmed Jidda, and many others also graced the occasion.\n\nUba Maigari Ahmadu, Chairman of the APC Governorship and House of Assembly primaries for Borno state, announced that Zulum won with 1,411 votes by delegates.\n\nHe explained that 1,560 voters were registered for the primaries, while 1,422 voters were accredited, out of which 1,411 votes were recorded with no record of invalid votes.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Zulum thanked delegates and stakeholders, after which he revealed his position on the calls for him to become Vice President.\n\nHe said: \u201cLet me reveal with apologies, that some close associates of key presidential aspirants have sent me offers for the position of running mate, as possible Vice President, depending on the outcome of the APC presidential primaries by the weekend.\n\n\u201cI have thought deeply about these offers because becoming Vice President is considered attractive. I have thought about all the powers and privileges of being VP. I can see the honour of presiding over meetings attended by Governors and ministers and the privilege of having a presidential Jet at one\u2019s disposal. I can see the honour of presidential receptions within and outside Nigeria.\n\n\u201cHowever, I have asked myself, that should I get the opportunity to become VP and raise my political profile, what happens to all our ongoing works for the people of Borno State?\n\n\u201cWe have built more than 10, 000 house and currently more of such and reconstructing existing ones, for ongoing resettlement of our people. We have resettled more than 20 communities so far.\n\n\u201cYet, thousands of our fellow citizens are still homeless and in desperate need of food, water and healthcare.We have adopted a development plan that we are already implementing.\n\n\u201cI have asked myself, what happens to all these plans that I am central to, which are helping to fast track our recovery in Borno State?\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, the killings in Kala-Balge at the weekend made me more critical and the incident seriously reminded me of the challenges that are still ahead of us in Borno State.\n\n\u201cI came to the conclusion that while a chance to become Vice President could benefit my profile as an individual, becoming reelected as Governor of Borno State has the potential of more overall and more assurance of benefit to the good people of Borno State.\n\n\u201cI therefore say that while I thank those who may be considering me for the position of VP, I prefer to stay back and work drastically for the people of Borno State because for me as a citizen of Borno State, working with others to hastily rebuild Borno State is the most urgent need and it is beyond any aspiration.\n\n\u201cI profoundly thank everyone who thought of me worthy of any responsibility and I +pray that Allah helps us to work towards the full restoration of peace, the full recovery and growth of Borno State.\u201d\n\nParallel primary in Ebonyi\n\nBut in Ebonyi state, there were parallel primaries, both of which produced their choice candidates.\n\n\n\nThe Governor David Umahi-led faction produced Speaker of Ebonyi state House of Assembly as its guber candidate with a total votes of 743, while the former Chairman Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission(RMAFC) Engineer Elias Mbam emerged governorship candidate of his faction with the total votes of 741 votes.\n\nThe government\u2019s faction held its primary election at Pa Ngele Oruta Township stadium in Abakaliki with 5 aspirants contesting for governorship positions. They are Francis Nwifuru, Sen. Julius Ucha, Arc Edward Nkwegu, Rosemary Ofoke Nwogbaga, and Mbam.\n\nWhile Nwifuru emerged with 743 votes, Rosemary Ofoke came second with 63 votes, Senator Ucha got 22 votes, Mbam got 10 votes, Nkwegu got 8 votes and 8 invalid votes.\n\nAnd from the Mbam\u2019s faction which had its primary election at his party office, Mile 50 Abakaliki, all the five contenders that participated in the government\u2019s faction also featured on the list.\n\nAt the end of the contest, Mbam emerged victorious with 741 votes with Nwifuru as his close runner-up garnering 7 votes.\n\nDeclaring Nwifuru winner with 743 votes, the returning officer, Professor Emmanuel Adebayo Kehinde said the total votes cast were 846, while 8were invalid.\n\nAlso declaring Mbam winner, the returning officer, Mr. Egwu Inya Akanu-Otu said: \u201cWith this result Eng. Chief Elias Mbam scored the highest number of votes with 741, he is hereby elected as the gubernatorial candidate of APC of Ebonyi state. I, on this 26th day of May 2022 declare Elias Mbam as the elected person to represent APC in the gubernatorial election come 2023.\u201d\n\nThe elections were held under tight security surveillance in both venues.\n\nInuwa gets return ticket in Gombe\n\nIn Gombe state, Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya got a return ticket as the APC governorship candidate.\n\nAnnouncing the result at Gombe International Hotel where the exercise held, chairman of the governorship primary committee, Dr Danjuma Dabo, said the governor emerged unopposed being the only aspirant that purchased the nomination Form and screened by the party.\n\nDabo said the 563 delegates out of 570 accredited for the exercise, affirmed the nomination through voice votes.\n\nGovernor Yahaya would slug it out with Muhammad Jibril Barde of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and other candidates to be fielded by the various political parties.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Governor Yahaya thanked the delegates for finding him worthy to be the party\u2019s flag-bearer for the 2023 governorship election.\n\nHe called on party stakeholders to work together to deliver the state to the APC in the 2023 elections, adding that: \u201cour performance will speak for us; so there is no shaking.\u201d\n\nThe governor commended President Muhammadu Buhari, leader of the party, for \u201cstanding firm and for providing good leadership in Nigeria in this hard time that there is indeed a global challenge.\u201d\n\nYahaya also thanked members of his team for supporting and working hard to produce results that had convinced the people of Gombe state.\n\nBarde won his party\u2019s ticket Wednesday having polled 160 votes to defeat his closest rival, Alhaji Jamil Gwamna, who scored 119 votes.\n\nMatawalle emerges in Zamfara\n\nAnd from Zamfara state, Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle also got the nod of the delegates as the party\u2019s flag bearer in next year\u2019s election. Chairman APC governorship primary committee, Hon. Babagana Tijjani Banki, stated that the election was based on affirmation of the governor by the 735 delegates across the state, as the sole aspirant.\n\nBlueprint gathered that an aspirant, Alhaji Abubakar Garba Gajam, withdrew from the race few hours before the contest in support of the governor.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Governor Matawalle thanked the delegates and electoral committee for the peaceful conduct of the exercise.\n\nGovernor Bello Mohammed Matawalle stated that if re-elected, he would focus on economic growth, human development and security.\n\nDapo Abiodun emerges amid protest\n\nBut in Ogun state, Governor Dapo Abiodun was elected as the APC flag bearer amidst protest by some aspirants.\n\nAt the party\u2019s gubernatorial primary election held inside the MKO Abiola Stadium, Kuto Abeokuta, Thursday, Abiodun polled 1168 votes out of the 1170 total votes cast.\n\nDeclaring Abiodun winner of the election, the chairman of the electoral committee, Wale Ohu, noted that a total of 1180 delegates were accredited for the election, while 1170 votes were cast, with 1,168 valid votes, just as 2 votes were voided for irregularities in voting pattern.\n\nThe other aspirants, Abdulkabir Akinlade, Modele Sarafa-Yusuf, and Owodunni Opayemi who were conspicuously absent at the venue however scored zero votes.\n\nIt was, however, gathered that they had their agents present at the venue to monitor events.\n\nMeanwhile, in a release signed by two aspirants, Abdulkabir Akinlade and Biyi Otegbeye, they cited the selection of the electoral committee chairman, Wale Ohu, and the non-inclusion in the process of delegates\u2019 selection as reasons for their boycott.\n\nThey maintained that Ohu had been involved in about three controversial congresses that further deepened the cleavages within the state APC.\n\n\u201cIt is noteworthy that the crisis emanating from the congresses featured prominently before the National Reconciliation Committee of the APC.\n\n\u201cThe guidelines for the conduct of congresses in the APC stipulate that aspirants should pay a prescribed fee for delegates\u2019 form, which we did but no forms were made available to us.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, only one aspirant collected all the delegate forms in the state, thus hedging the entire process in his favour,\u201d the aggrieved aspirants stated.\n\nSanwo-Olu gets Lagos APC guber ticket\n\nFrom Lagos state came the report that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu picked the party\u2019s ticket.\n\nSanwo-Olu was the sole aspirant cleared by the party\u2019s electoral committee.\n\nThe two others, Wale Oluwo and Abdul-Ahmed Mustapha were disqualified.\n\nThe governor polled 1,170 votes to emerge winner of the primaries held at the Mobolaji Johnson Stadium in Onikan, Lagos.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\n",

          "text": "BY ONU OKORIE\n\nLagos: May 26, 2022: To encourage and simplify vehicle ownership for personal use by millions of Nigerians, First City Monument Bank (FCMB) now offers auto loans of up to N30 million at a reduced interest rate. The FCMB auto loan supports acquiring brand new and pre-owned vehicles (popularly known as \u201cTokunbo\u201d), with N500,000 as the minimum loan amount that a customer can access for a repayment duration of up to 5 years.\n\nThis affirms FCMB\u2019s commitment to improving the social well-being of individuals and enhancing access to credit for higher standard of living for families.\n\nCommenting on the unique value proposition, Divisional Head, Personal Banking of the Bank, Mr Shamsideen Fashola, said, \u201cvehicle ownership is one of the most exciting moments in a person\u2019s life. Yet, many people struggle to save up for a long time to make this dream come true. To bridge this gap, we created a value proposition that is flexible, convenient and empowers individuals, families and businesses to achieve the dream of vehicle ownership. Nigerians can now finance their dream vehicle with an auto loan from FCMB at a low-interest rate with monthly or yearly payment options depending on their income. We, therefore, urge the populace, including, but not limited to salaried individuals, to take advantage of this opportunity to fulfil their vehicle ownership dream\u201d.\n\nFCMB Auto Loan empowers qualified Nigerians to part-finance the purchase of brand-new and pre-owned vehicles while spreading the repayment between one and five years. The loan, which is dependent on the type of vehicle to be purchased, is open to salaried individuals and self-employed Nigerians.\n\nAccording to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the number of registered vehicles in Nigeria is 13 million. However, vehicle ownership in the country has been declining because of increased prices. This is due to foreign exchange and importation challenges, leading to a drastic reduction in purchasing power and sales decline in the auto industry.\n\nA purpose beyond profit commercial banking institution, First City Monument Bank is a member of FCMB Group Plc, led by Ladi Balogun as Group Chief Executive. The Bank is committed to COVID-19 recovery, income equality and poverty reduction by easing credit constraints to disadvantaged individuals and small businesses. The intervention of FCMB in the automobile sector aligns with Goals 3 and 10 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which focus on well-being and reduced inequalities.",

          "title": "Russian Proxies Claim Control of Key Town in East Ukraine",
          "text": "Russia\u2019s separatist proxies in eastern Ukraine claimed full control of the important battlefield town of Lyman on Friday, and Ukraine appeared to concede it, as Moscow presses its biggest advance for weeks.\n\nLyman, site of a key railway hub, has been a major front line as Russian forces press down from the north, one of three directions from which they have been attacking Ukraine\u2019s industrial Donbas region. The pro-Russian Donetsk People\u2019s Republic separatists said they were now in full control of it.\n\nOleksiy Arestovych, adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appeared to confirm the fall of Lyman in an interview overnight, and said the battle there showed that Moscow was improving its tactics.\n\n\u201cAccording to unverified data, we lost the town of Lyman. The Russian army \u2013 this must be verified \u2013 captured it,\u201d Arestovych said in a video posted on social media.\n\n\u201cMoreover, the way they captured it\u2026. correctly organising the operation. This shows, in principle, the increased level of operational management and tactical skills of the Russian army. It has grown. It has not grown everywhere of course, but it has unquestionably grown.\u201d\n\nAfter being driven back from the capital Kyiv in March and from the outskirts of the second biggest city Kharkiv earlier this month, Russian forces are staging their strongest advance in weeks in the eastern Donbas region.\n\nWestern military analysts say the battle there could prove decisive, depending on whether Russian forces can sustain the advance or run out of momentum.\n\nFurther east, Russian forces have been trying to encircle Ukrainian troops in the cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lyshchansk, after breaking through Ukrainian lines further south in the city of Popasna last week.\n\nPopasna, reached by Reuters journalists in Russian-held territory on Thursday, was a blasted wasteland of burnt-out highrise apartments and shattered municipal buildings. Russian tanks and other military vehicles tore through the rubble-strewn streets kicking up dust with their treads, and low-flying attack helicopters thundered overhead. The bloated body of a dead man in uniform lay in a courtyard.\n\nNatalia Kovalenko, a resident, had finally come up in recent days from the cellar where she had been sheltering, to sleep amid the wreckage of her own flat. The balcony had been blown away and windows blasted off by a direct hit from a shell.\n\nShe stared out wistfully into the blasted courtyard, recounting how two people had been killed there and eight wounded by a shell when they went outside to cook. Inside her flat, her kitchen and living room were filled with rubble and debris, but she had tidied a small bedroom to sleep. She was tired of being trapped in the cellar with dogs and cats.\n\n\u201cI just have to fix the window somehow. The wind is still bad. Cold at night,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are tired of being so scared. So tired.\u201d\n\n\u2018WHAT PRICE\u2019\n\nIn an overnight address, Zelenskiy criticised the European Union for taking too long to ban Russian energy imports, saying the bloc was sending Moscow a billion euros a day which was funding the Kremlin\u2019s war effort. He said some countries were blocking efforts to agree new sanctions, an apparent reference to Hungary, which has objected to an EU ban on Russian oil.\n\n\u201cPressure on Russia is literally a matter of saving lives. Every day of procrastination, weakness, various disputes or proposals to \u2018pacify\u2019 the aggressor at the expense of the victim merely means more Ukrainians being killed,\u201d he said.\n\nWestern countries led by the United States have provided Ukraine with long-range weaponry, including M777 howitzers and Harpoon anti-ship missiles from Denmark.\n\nUkraine says it wants longer range ground weapons, especially rocket launchers, that can help it win an artillery battle against Russian forces in the east.\n\nIt now looks likely to get them. U.S. officials say the Biden administration is even considering supplying Kyiv with the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), which can have a range of hundreds of kilometers.\n\nOne concern that had held Washington back from supplying longer range arms in the past is the danger of escalation should Ukraine use them to hit targets deep within Russia. U.S. and diplomatic officials told Reuters Washington has held discussions with Kyiv about the issue.\n\n\u201cWe have concerns about escalation and yet still do not want to put geographic limits or tie their hands too much with the stuff we\u2019re giving them,\u201d said one U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nA second U.S. official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington and Kyiv had a shared \u201cunderstanding\u201d about the use of certain Western-provided weapons: \u201cSo far, we\u2019ve been on the same page about the thresholds.\u201d\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned that any supplies of weapons that could reach Russian territory would be a \u201ca serious step towards unacceptable escalation\u201d.\n\nRussia calls its invasion of Ukraine a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to defeat \u201cNazis\u201d there. The West describes this as a baseless justification for a war of aggression.\n\nReuters",

          "text": "Senegal\u2019s President Macky Sall fired the health minister on Thursday and announced three days of national mourning for the death of the newborns..\n\nEleven newborn babies died in a hospital fire blamed on an electrical short circuit in Senegal\u2019s western city of Tivaouane, authorities said Thursday.\n\nIn the latest in a series of hospital deaths that have exposed the weaknesses of the nation\u2019s healthcare system, President Macky Sall announced the tragedy on Twitter and declared three days of national mourning.\n\n\u201cI have just learned with pain and dismay about the deaths of 11 newborn babies in the fire at the neonatal department of the public hospital,\u201d Sall wrote after the fire late Wednesday.\n\n\u201cTo their mothers and their families, I express my deepest sympathy,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nMacky would return early from abroad and visit the hospital on Saturday, his office said.\n\n\u201cWhere is Mohamed?,\u201d asked one of the distraught mothers outside Mame Abdou Aziz Sy Dabakh Hospital in Tivaouane, a city with a population of 40,000.\n\nHer baby son was taken to the hospital 10 days ago and was baptised on Monday, Mohamed\u2019s 54-year-old father Alioune Diouf said.\n\nThe city\u2019s mayor Demba Diop said the fire had been caused by a short circuit and spread very quickly.\n\nHe denied allegations from relatives at the hospital and across social media that the babies had been left alone, saying a midwife and nurse were present Wednesday evening.\n\n\u201cThere was a noise and an explosion, that lasted three minutes at most,\u201d he said outside the hospital entrance.\n\n\u201cFive minutes after, the fire brigade arrived. People used fire extinguishers.\u201d\n\nThe mayor said the air-conditioning had accelerated the flames and added that the two nurses fainted but were revived.\n\n\u201cThere was no negligence,\u201d Diop insisted.\n\nHealth Minister Abdoulaye Diouf Sarr was quoted in media reports also as blaming an electrical fault.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Beyond heartbroken\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe maternity unit was equipped to take care of 13 babies.\n\n\u201cAt the time of the fire, there were 11, whom nurses were unable to save,\u201d the minister said.\n\nWorld Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tweeted that he was \u201cbeyond heartbroken with this tragic news.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sending my deepest condolences to the parents and families of the babies who lost their lives.\u201d\n\nHealth Minister Sarr, who had been in Geneva attending a meeting with the WHO, said an investigation is under way.\n\nThe tragedy in Tivaouane comes after several other public health incidents in Senegal, which suffers from a great disparity between urban and rural areas in healthcare services.\n\nIn the northern town of Linguere in late April, a fire broke out at a hospital and four newborn babies were killed. The town\u2019s mayor cited an electrical malfunction in an air conditioning unit in the maternity ward.\n\n\u2013 \u2018This is unacceptable\u2019 \u2013\n\nWednesday\u2019s accident came over a month after the nation mourned the death of a pregnant woman who waited in vain for a caesarean section.\n\nThe woman, Astou Sokhna, arrived at a hospital in the northern city of Louga in pain. The staff refused to accommodate her request for a C-section, saying it was not scheduled.\n\nShe died on April 1, 20 hours after arrival.\n\nSokhna\u2019s death caused a wave of outrage across the country over the dire state of the health system. Sarr acknowledged two weeks later that the death could have been avoided.\n\nThree midwives on duty the night Sokhna died were given a six-month suspended prison sentence on May 11 by the High Court of Louga for \u201cfailure to assist a person in danger\u201d in connection with her case.\n\nAmnesty International\u2019s Senegal director Seydi Gassama said his organisation had called for an inspection and upgrade for neonatal services in hospitals across Senegal after the \u201catrocious\u201d death of the four babies in Linguere.\n\nWith the new tragedy, Amnesty \u201curges the government to set up an independent commission of inquiry to determine responsibility and punish the culprits, no matter the level they are at in the state apparatus\u201d.",

          "title": "Former Nigeria President Jonathan Attacks National Assembly, Faults Section 84 of New Electoral Act",
          "text": "It was a rare public outburst on Thursday by former Nigeria President Goodluck Jonathan as he took a swipe at the National Assembly over the controversy surrounding section 84 of the Electoral Act, describing it as a mess.\n\nThis was just as divergent views emanated from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) barely 72 hours to its national convention, with members expressing fears over lack of activities in the party and indication of unpreparedness for the party\u2019s presidential primary.\n\nAlso, on Thursday, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police Command said it had put in place a robust security arrangement ahead of the presidential primary of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) scheduled to hold May 28 and 29 at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium, Abuja.\n\nA usually measured and reticent Jonathan accused the federal lawmakers of making laws to target individuals and groups, rather than observing the long-held maxim that like judges, legislators must be \u201cblind\u201d in the process of law-making, instead of dishing out self-serving legislations.\n\nThe former president was speaking in Abuja at the presentation of a book titled: \u201cPolitical Party Governance,\u201d authored by a former Minister of State for Power, Dr. Mohammed Wakil.\n\nSome Nigerians recently expressed concerns that the National Assembly\u2019s amendment of some portions of the Electoral Act, 2022, especially Section 84 was designed to boost the chances of certain persons in the electoral race.\n\nJonathan, who rated the current primaries as a total failure insisted that if it was to be rated, the process would not have a pass mark and would be scored less than 25 per cent.\n\nPicking Bayelsa as a case study, the former Nigerian leader characterised the process as \u201chorrible,\u201d stating that for instance, certain people who did some \u201cmagic\u201d created just two wards in a particular state constituency where six elected delegates were to determine the fate of six aspirants in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\n\n\u201cLet me use this opportunity to advise the National Assembly that laws must be designed to solve problems, not to create problems and that laws must be made assuming that those who are making the law are blind, just like the judges.\n\n\u201cThat is so that they cannot be able to target an individual or a group of individuals and when you go into the system of making laws (like it is being done), you will make this terrible mistake that has really messed up the whole primaries that are going on.\n\n\u201c If you have not been involved in the process of primaries, you will be happy or you may not be happy, but for those of us who have been involved, it is terrible,\u201d he maintained.\n\nJonathan stressed that those who are current delegates could easily be bought over, decrying how low the standards have fallen such that aspirants are now openly retrieving monies paid to the delegates.\n\n\u201cTake my local government for example. My local government by divine providence has me as a former president, we have former governors, former deputy governors, former senators and all the rest.\n\n\u201cThen only one elected delegate that you don\u2019t even know where it is coming from, will come to Abuja to select who becomes the presidential candidate. Is that the kind of democracy that we want to practice?\u201d he queried.\n\nThe former president alleged that the lawmakers had succeeded in strangulating the electoral system by going as far as determining the mode of primaries, arguing that every political party has its peculiarities.\n\nWhile contending that laws must not be made at the whims of individuals, Jonathan picked holes on the argument of those accusing Buhari of not immediately signing the amended sections sent to him by the lawmakers, saying that assent to bills must go through a thorough process.\n\n\u201cThis controversial Section 84, to me, if you read through that law, 80 per cent or more of that section has nothing to do with it and should be expunged from the Electoral Act because the National Assembly cannot make laws and lump up all the political parties together.\n\n\u201cThey must have the leverage to do things differently. Political parties have different reasons for being set up,\u201d he said, giving the instances of parties in South Africa.\n\n\u201cTwo parties cannot do things the same way. Creating a situation whereby every party must have the same way of doing things as to who will represent them is nonsense. It doesn\u2019t help the practice of democracy. We must allow the parties the leverage,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe pointed out that since the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was already regulating the parties, they must be allowed to choose the method they would adopt in selecting candidates, as documented in their constitutions.\n\n\u201cParties are not parastatals of the government. And the national assembly cannot make laws to strangle the political parties and that is my thinking on this issue that is quite controversial,\u201d he said.\n\nHe further called for the institutionalisation of democracy, instead of the current ad hoc practice by the lawmakers.\n\n\u201cWe have to institutionalise democracy. What is the quality of delegates where some people are even going back to delegates to ask for refund when they fail election? This is extremely disgraceful,\u201d he declared.\n\nHe added: \u201cIn some countries, you cannot give a gift to the voter like what we normally do here where bags of rice and salt are shared. You are inducing the electorate and that\u2019s a criminal offence and the National Assembly should be able to criminalise this.\n\nAs it is now, Jonathan argued that any criminal can now aspire to the highest office of the land as far as the person has the money even if he\u2019s an armed robber.\n\n\u201cIf I tell you the kind of people that are coming up to pick the people that will represent us, you will feel sad. So the National Assembly must have to wake up.\n\n\u201cSome people are even blaming the president that he did not sign this, he did not sign that and that is another area that the national assembly must wake up to. You cannot wake up the president and say come and sign a bill, whether a new bill or an alteration of an existing one.\n\n\u201cIn this matter, the president can\u2019t be blamed. Before the president signs any bill into law, it passes through different processes after the national assembly and their committees finish their work,\u201d he noted.\n\nAccording to him each member of the National Assembly has at least five aides who are expected to be involved in vetting any bill passed to the president, accusing the lawmakers of not doing their jobs properly.\n\n\u201cThe Speaker has more and the Senate President has more. What is their duty? Is it just to be following the speaker and the senate president like a troop of monkeys or a bevy of birds?\n\n\u201cThey are meant to read before it goes to the clerk of the national assembly that also has his own aides that will also read through that draft before it goes to the president and that\u2019s bureaucracy at the government level so that the president is not meant to make silly mistakes.\n\n\u201cSo nobody should expect the president to just wake up and say come sign this bill because it must go through a process and people must do their work in this country.\n\n\u201cYou cannot just be taking money and be sleeping and for the national assembly this is a good wake-up call because they have various aides who are employed to do this work.\n\n\u201cAnd their laws must not target individuals or group of individuals. They must be laws that will improve governance and not be made for certain people to have an advantage over others.\n\n\u201cIn fact, the whole of this primary that is going on is a mess. If you know the standard practice, you will ask teachers here to score this primaries and it cannot get more than 25 per cent and you cannot use that process to elect the president.\n\n\u201cThe process is already failed and it is not good for this country. Yes , we will manage and move on and I pray that good people should emerge, but we hope that what has happened this 2022 will not happen again in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the timetable and schedule of activities for the 2023 elections released by APC, the screening of the presidential aspirants was supposed to take place on Monday. But as at Thursday, the screening committee that would assess the presidential aspirants was yet to be constituted. Accreditation of those that would be attending the convention was also yet to commence, while Eagle Square, venue of the convention, remained empty and deserted.\n\nDirector of Media, Yahaya Bello Campaign Organisation, Ms. Yemi Kolapo, said she was not worried about the lack of activities in the party a few days to the primary election. Kolapo believed the party was only being strategic.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so; they (APC) are only being strategic,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked if the failure of the party to constitute a screening committee was part of the strategy, Kolapo added, \u201cIt has been constituted since. They can\u2019t constitute for others and not constitute for presidential.\u201d\n\nThe Osinbajo Support Group also said there was no need to worry, stressing that activities would commence at Eagle Square on Saturday. Convener of the group, Badmus Olawale, said, \u201cScreening can still happen 24 hours to the primary day. No worries whatsoever. You will see activities at the Eagle Square ground from Saturday.\u201d\n\nBut the Bola Ahmed Tinubu Support Group (AATSG) wondered the kind of example APC was setting as a ruling party. National Publicity Secretary of the group, Hon. Sampson Oburu, said the ruling party ought to be doing everything right at all times.\n\nOburu said, \u201cLess than 72 hours to the primaries, no screening of aspirants, and possible debates between aspirants is zero. I wonder what kind of example we, as the ruling party, is setting after we promised Nigerians change.\n\n\u201cWe moved to the next level, one would have thought that we would move from doing things anyhow to doing the right things, the first time all the time, which to a large extent would muster unity within the party, raise the status of the party, and usher in a new era of hope.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely important to sustain and in our own case now, restore confidence in the party by the electorate and public, because as it is, Nigerians are fast losing confidence in our ability to lead the country to the much needed next level.\n\n\u201cThere are rancour and strife in almost all the states controlled by our party, multiple factions, poor internal democratic processes, where the electoral processes are hijacked by one or a few individuals against the collective strength of the majority.\u201d\n\nOn its part, the APC Rebirth Group expressed concerns about the lack of activities in the party. Its Convener, Mr. Aliyu Audu, stated, \u201cWhile we are concerned about the lack of activities to show that plans are in place for the special convention, we want to believe that everyone involved is aware of the implications of not having a duly elected presidential candidate by the 3rd of June 2022. So, there are probably plans in place that are unknown to us.\u201d\n\nHowever, all appears set for the PDP presidential primary, with the Nigeria Police promising a strong security arrangement.\n\nThe event would involve a high influx of people into the nation\u2019s capital, and the FCT police say they have taken charge.\n\nThe FCT command said in a statement, \u201cConsequent upon the above and in a bid to ensure a hitch-free event, the FCT Police Command has designed a robust security arrangement defined by a generous deployment within and without the election ground and to every nook and cranny of the territory.\n\n\u201cThe deployment prioritises the protection of lives and properties of all and sundry by emplacing counter-insurgency measures, maintenance of clear road access, robust stop and search at strategic points around the suburbs and city centre, effective crowd control, and intelligence gathering.\u201d\n\nThe command asserted that the Commissioner of Police, FCT Police Command, CP Babaji Sunday, while briefing the divisional police officers, heads of the various tactical and intelligence units of the command scheduled for the operation, charged them to be effective in discharging their duties with utmost respect for fundamental human rights.\n\nSunday told FCT residents to go about their lawful duties without fear of harassment or molestation of any kind, urging them, also, to remain vigilant and report any suspicious or abnormal occurrence to the police.",
          "summary": "It was a rare public outburst on Thursday by former Nigeria President Goodluck Jonathan as he took a swipe at the National Assembly over the controversy surrounding section 84 of the Electoral Act, describing it as a mess.\nYou are inducing the electorate and that\u2019s a criminal offence and the National Assembly should be able to criminalise this.\nSo the National Assembly must have to wake up.\nBefore the president signs any bill into law, it passes through different processes after the national assembly and their committees finish their work,\u201d he noted.\n\u201cYou cannot just be taking money and be sleeping and for the national assembly this is a good wake-up call because they have various aides who are employed to do this work.",
